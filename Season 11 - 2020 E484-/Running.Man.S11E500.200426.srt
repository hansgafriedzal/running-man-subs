1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,250
Hello.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,530
- Hello.
- The weather is very nice.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,230
There's the life-sized
figure of So Min.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,730
- Gosh, it's So Min.
- What is she doing here alone?

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,730
I know.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,040
It's So Min.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,230
So Min is smiling,
but she looks somewhat sad.

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,230
This is our 500th episode.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,260
I know.

10
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,670
This is our 500th episode.

11
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,300
(Congratulations on the 500th
episode of Running Man.)

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,440
Congratulations.
It's the 500th episode.

13
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,800
It's the 500th episode.

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,350
I'd like to thank
our crew members...

15
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,710
and viewers for being with us
the whole time.

16
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,030
Stop walking and run, Running Man.

18
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,490
Hello, everyone.

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,710
Hello.

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,210
- This is our 100th episode!
- Yes!

21
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,670
Cha Bum Kun!

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,350
- Cha Bum Kun!
- Okay.

23
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,090
Congratulations.

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,490
Thank you so much.

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,990
It's me!

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,220
We did it.

27
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,970
It's the 500th episode.

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,580
It's the 500th episode already.

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,800
The president of SBS
sent us a coffee truck.

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,110
Mr. Park.

31
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,140
Thank you, Mr. Park.

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,550
Mr. Park Jung Hoon.

33
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,520
Please stay healthy.

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,990
Are you making a deep bow?

36
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,960
- Your legs must hurt.
- Hey, stop it.

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,420
Mr. Park hates things like this.

38
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,720
- Really?
- Why would you try to flatter him?

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,220
I just wanted to thank him.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,470
Jong Kook, why are you
holding her arm?

41
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,690
I should take care of So Min.

42
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,690
(Jong Kook, why are you
holding her arm?)

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,030
(I should take care of So Min.)

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,270
- What?
- I was surprised.

45
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,500
- You're so nice.
- Hey.

46
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,910
Why are you being like this?

47
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,080
She feels lonely.

48
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,440
It's the 500th episode,
but she couldn't make it.

49
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,270
When I talked to So Min
on the phone,

50
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,050
she wouldn't hang up.

51
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,050
- It happened to me too.
- We talked for 40 minutes.

52
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,220
Me too.

53
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,690
So Min asked
a straightforward question.

54
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,880
She asked me not to hang up.

55
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,250
- I was so tired.
- That's true.

56
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,160
I talked to her on the phone
for 30 minutes.

57
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,720
So Min is feeling bored now.

58
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,630
If you want to call So Min,
you have to brace yourself.

59
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,320
You should take some time out.

60
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,970
I know.

61
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,030
Like we just said,
this is our 500th episode.

62
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,940
But our society is
still being cautious,

63
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,870
and So Min is recovering her health,
so she can't join us today.

64
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,870
That's right.

65
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,880
So we prepared a simple but fun
episode instead of something huge.

66
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,600
- That's good.
- We should have fun.

67
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,440
For you guys who've
worked so hard for this show,

68
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,220
we prepared some healthy food
for spring that will boost immunity.

69
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,940
- Healthy food?
- That sounds nice.

70
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,720
Before you start eating,

71
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,690
let me introduce our five guests
with spring-like charms...

72
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,630
who are here to celebrate
the 500th episode.

73
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,880
Guests with refreshing charms.

74
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,900
Please bring in the board.

75
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,930
Let's get So Min away for now.

76
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,220
- Get rid of her.
- So Min.

77
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,320
- Go get some rest.
- See you.

78
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,530
Go take a rest.

79
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,570
- Stay with the director.
- Lie down.

80
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,440
- All right.
- On the board,

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,070
there are three questions
about food...

82
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,630
and the guests' answers.

83
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,700
I've picked one already.

84
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,410
- Who?
- Tripe and entrails.

85
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,410
(Guest 4 likes tripe and entrails.)

86
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,570
Did you pick one already?

87
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,910
I like tripe and entrails too.

88
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,980
We have five guests today.

89
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,560
- But there are seven numbers.
- Yes.

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,410
One of the numbers is mine,

91
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,720
and one of them belongs to
the writer over here.

92
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,030
- Do you mean Hyo Im?
- Yes.

93
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,350
We should avoid those two, right?

94
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,950
If you choose one of us,
you'll team up with...

95
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,400
- another Running Man member.
- I knew it.

96
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,930
Now, please choose a number.

97
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,030
(Which of the 5 members
will team up with the guests?)

98
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,530
Look at number one.

99
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,780
- Please let me choose number two.
- On a date, she wants to eat...

100
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,180
food made by her mom.

101
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,750
That means she wants to introduce
her boyfriend to her mom.

102
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,350
She wants her boyfriend
to meet her mom.

103
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,180
That can't be Bo Pil or Hyo Im.

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,380
- Right.
- Right?

105
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,450
Still, I think we'll get to
eat these dishes later.

106
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,480
So I choose number two.

107
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,780
- Let me choose a number too.
- I choose number two.

108
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,820
I choose number one.

109
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,560
- Number one?
- Ji Hyo, make up your mind.

110
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,930
I choose number six.

111
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,160
- I choose number 3.
- I choose number 4.

112
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,950
- "Tteokbokki".
- "Oysters".

113
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,530
- There's only one number left now.
- That's right.

114
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,500
But I hate every dish
under number seven.

115
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,470
I hate all of them,
whoever that person is.

116
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,570
It's the worst. What is that?

117
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,280
I hate all of them.

118
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,030
You have no choice.

119
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Behind you,

120
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,440
you'll see tents
with a number on it.

121
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,820
Go into the tent with the number
you chose and bring your guest out.

122
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,580
- The guests are in there?
- Where are the tents?

123
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,640
Shall we go?

124
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,060
If the tent is empty, you'll team up
with a Running Man member.

125
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,060
- Which number was it?
- I wonder who it is.

126
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,630
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

127
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,820
(Does tent number 2 have
a guest in it?)

128
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,520
Unbelievable.

129
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,300
(The red-haired guest is
covering her face with a pillow.)

130
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,700
She looks so stylish.

131
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,240
- Haha.
- Hey.

132
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,240
What are you doing here, Bomi?

133
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,700
(Yoon Bomi,
the stylish member of Apink)

134
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,310
Haha.

135
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,210
Hey.

136
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,790
Hello. Who are you?

137
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,050
(Suk Jin chose tent number 3.)

138
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,490
(Laughing awkwardly)

139
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,560
What happened?

140
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,210
(Park Chorong,
the pretty member of Apink)

141
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,320
Hi.

142
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,650
(Who wants to eat her mom's food?)

143
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,950
- Hello.
- Oh, my. Hi, Chungha.

144
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,630
Gosh, you surprised me.

145
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,070
- Hi, Chungha.
- Hello.

146
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,440
- How have you been?
- I've been good.

147
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,940
Come on out.
What were you doing here?

148
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,000
I've been waiting for you.

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,460
Is anyone here?

150
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,770
(Already three teams
have been decided.)

151
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,640
Someone's here.

152
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,070
Who...

153
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,270
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

154
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,210
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

155
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,190
(Choi Yoojung,
the rising star of Weki Meki)

156
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,190
- What are you doing here?
- Hello.

157
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,360
I didn't expect to see you here.

158
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,860
- How have you been?
- Come here.

159
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,750
What are you doing here?

160
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,360
- Have you been well?
- What were you doing here?

161
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,390
(There are 3 members
and only 1 guest left.)

162
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,590
We might end up
with another Running Man member.

163
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,630
(Which two members will team up
with each other?)

164
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,440
(She is the last guest.)

165
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,090
- Hello.
- Hi.

166
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,170
Mijoo, it's you.

167
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,760
- Hi, Mijoo.
- He knows my name.

168
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,610
(Tent number 7)

169
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,140
Gosh, I can't believe this.

170
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,120
Gosh, what is this?

171
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,180
(Good job choosing
the producer's taste.)

172
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,820
"Congratulations on guessing
the writer's taste"?

173
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,380
Why on earth would you want
those dishes?

174
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,860
My goodness.

175
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,080
Don't you hear
how happy the others sound?

176
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,430
Bo Pil!

177
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,190
Why on earth would you want tarts?

178
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,460
Se Chan!

179
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,460
- Hey!
- Ji Hyo!

180
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,040
It's Hyo Chan Park again.

181
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,940
- Come here.
- Hi. It's been a while.

182
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,960
(The unhappy Hyo Chan Park is back.)

183
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,200
- Come here.
- Oh, my.

184
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,770
Finally.

185
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,270
I'll make Chorong
the most searched person today.

186
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,270
(The happy 6 teams are decided.)

187
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,580
As this is our 500th episode,

188
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,490
we have very special guests today.

189
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,710
Let's give it up for them.

190
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,560
Yes!

191
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,520
- Let's talk to Mijoo first.
- Hi, Mijoo.

192
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,820
As you all probably know,

193
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,800
she is a very famous
idol group member.

194
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,370
- She's a good talker.
- You could put it that way.

195
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,440
- She's full of energy.
- She's frivolous.

196
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,090
You can say many things about her,

197
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,330
but some think she's crazy.

198
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,130
- I'm crazy.
- She's crazy.

199
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,070
She has way too much energy.

200
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,480
- I'm out of control.
- Especially on her way to work,

201
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,500
- her pictures attract attention.
- Her poses are special.

202
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,510
(Extremely unique)

203
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,690
She makes those poses?

204
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,140
- On her way to work?
- Yes.

205
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,650
- Look at this.
- I thought she was hugging a dog.

206
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,690
Something like this.

207
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,820
(She starts taking
unique poses right away.)

208
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,730
- Look at her.
- Something like this.

209
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,300
That's what she does?

210
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,860
Even if she's my partner,
if she goes too far,

211
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,130
- You can't stand it, right?
- I can't stand it.

212
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,760
- I can't stand it.
- So...

213
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,630
- For example, Mijoo,
- Look at her face.

214
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,460
show us how you drop your bag.

215
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's say my bag is sponsored.

216
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,460
- Then I want it to stand out.
- Right.

217
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,880
(Her bag is sponsored.)

218
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,750
(My bag is sponsored.)

219
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,270
The sponsor would love it.

220
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,210
(Mijoo is known for her photoshoots
on her way to work.)

221
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,990
- What's with her?
- Something like that.

222
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,560
- Why...
- Let's say your watch is sponsored.

223
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,190
- Oh, that's right.
- Your watch is sponsored.

224
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,450
(Her watch is sponsored.)

225
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,560
Hello.

226
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,020
(The pose vending machine is
on fire.)

227
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,690
Gosh, my eyes.

228
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,820
- This...
- Like this.

229
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
- She's actually good.
- Did you see that?

230
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,740
- She looks so natural.
- It looks so natural and smooth.

231
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,400
(Mijoo finishes up
with her outstanding poses.)

232
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,880
Next up is Weki Meki's...

233
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,380
- Choi Yoojung.
- Yes!

234
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,400
- Yoojung.
- Yes.

235
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,510
Compared to a couple of years ago,

236
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,380
you have a completely different
vibe now.

237
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,080
- I've grown a lot.
- Yes.

238
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,620
You've become a lot more mature.

239
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,320
I read that you're starting
a new drama.

240
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,250
- That's right.
- This is not the time...

241
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,450
to talk about that.

242
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,730
Then when is the right time?

243
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,090
When and to who
am I supposed to talk about it?

244
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,070
Have some class, seriously.

245
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,940
I can't believe him.

246
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,090
(Kwang Soo's unsophisticatedness
irritates everyone.)

247
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,170
Hold back.

248
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,140
Don't be so nosy.

249
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,940
You should be careful
with those questions.

250
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,280
I'm sorry.

251
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,550
(Kwang Soo apologizes
without understanding why.)

252
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,570
I shouldn't have said that.

253
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,340
- Yoojung.
- Yes?

254
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,870
I hear you're starting a new drama.

255
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,870
(What?)

256
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,740
That's right. It's a web drama.

257
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,890
- Nice!
- Nice!

258
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,690
- Well said!
- You're starting a drama?

259
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,390
- You're starting a drama?
- You're starting a drama?

260
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,220
There's a right time for everything.

261
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,950
- I said it at the wrong time?
- Of course.

262
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,350
- It was three seconds ago.
- It wasn't the right time.

263
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,620
- This is the right time.
- Exactly.

264
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,460
- This is the right time?
- This is the right time.

265
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,490
Next up are Chorong...

266
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,640
and Bomi.

267
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,700
Chorong, you recently visited
Jong Kook's place...

268
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,280
- with the other Apink members.
- Yes.

269
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,370
- Did they say anything special?
- What do you mean?

270
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,680
- The other Apink members?
- Yes.

271
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,150
- About Se Chan or Jong Kook.
- After the shoot...

272
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,710
I'm sure they said something.
Let's hear it.

273
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,390
They didn't say anything?

274
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,480
When the shoot was over,

275
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,520
that was it.

276
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,760
(They keep their work
and personal lives separate.)

277
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,030
- They didn't say anything at all?
- It's so different.

278
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,930
As soon as the shoot was over,
I called Jong Kook and said,

279
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,460
"I'm so happy right now."

280
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,720
- "I'm really happy."
- He talked...

281
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,300
He talked about Chorong a lot.

282
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,940
I thought you had a crush on Na Eun.

283
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,410
- That's not true.
- Why would I have a crush on her?

284
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,540
- He was just joking.
- But you didn't dislike her either.

285
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,680
- I neither liked nor disliked her.
- Right.

286
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,700
(What did I do?)

287
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,340
Hey. If you say that...

288
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,650
If you say that, our next guest
will be Na Eun.

289
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,480
Stop it. I'll act all stupid
around her again.

290
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,290
- In the end,
- Gosh.

291
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,850
nothing will ever happen
between him and Apink.

292
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,980
(Sadly, nothing will ever happen
between Se Chan and Apink.)

293
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,430
Your new song, "Dumhdurum,"
will be released today?

294
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,090
- Yes, today at 6 p.m.
- Today?

295
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,570
- Today at 6 p.m.?
- "Dumhdurum"?

296
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,490
- We have a showcase after this.
- That's right.

297
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,300
- You have a showcase today?
- Yes.

298
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,360
What time?

299
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,170
- It starts at 8 p.m.
- It'll broadcast live at 8 p.m.

300
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,960
That means we'll be finished
before 8 p.m.

301
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,200
(We'll be finished before 8 p.m.)

302
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,310
We'll be finished before that.

303
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,810
- He's getting old. I told you.
- Don't say that out loud.

304
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,470
Don't say that out loud.

305
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,970
Haha is getting old.

306
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,610
(Everyone is secretly happy.)

307
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,690
- He wants to go home early.
- But...

308
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,080
- Stop it.
- The thing is...

309
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,390
Yoojung looks very happy too.

310
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,350
- Actually...
- We'll be finished around 5 p.m.

311
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,220
- We should see their performance.
- Bomi and...

312
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,090
- Chorong, please.
- We should.

313
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,350
("Dumhdurum" by Apink
is topping all the charts.)

314
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,430
- Yes!
- "Dumhdurum".

315
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,230
(The music starts playing.)

316
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,910
This is going to be a hit.

317
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,020
(The melody is catchy
and refreshing.)

318
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,790
Their moves are so full of energy.

319
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,450
<i>Dumhdurum...</i>

320
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,920
I memorized it already.

321
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,690
(Their dance is perfectly in sync.)

322
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,400
That looks so cool.

323
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,990
That's amazing.

324
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,300
(My heart is like, dumhdurum)

325
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,400
It's going to be
the number one song!

326
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,440
- It's the number one song!
- It's going to be a hit.

327
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,670
- The number one song!
- I'm sure of it.

328
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,310
- The song is so nice.
- It's the number one song.

329
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,550
- I love the song.
- Really?

330
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,180
- It's going to be a huge hit.
- I mean it.

331
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,020
Next up is Chungha.

332
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,050
(Chungha, the performance queen)

333
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,650
- Hello.
- It's been a while.

334
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,020
No one can deny...

335
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,290
- that she is the leading...
- Exactly.

336
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,160
female solo singer right now.

337
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,900
- Isn't she incredible?
- I know.

338
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,620
My new song will be released
the day after...

339
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,460
- this airs.
- Can we see it?

340
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,960
- She's going to perform it here?
- Please.

341
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,570
(Chungha performs her new song,
"Stay Tonight.")

342
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,070
(She looks like a different person.)

343
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,140
She completely changes.

344
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,540
She becomes a different person.

345
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,570
(Speechless)

346
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,480
(Everyone is overwhelmed
by her performance.)

347
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,420
(Praying)

348
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,720
(The finishing pose looks
so elegant.)

349
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,530
(Pure perfection)

350
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,850
(Everyone falls love with Chungha.)

351
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,570
She looks like a magician.

352
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,490
(What is he doing?)

353
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,360
- That doesn't look right.
- Look at me.

354
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,330
She didn't do that.

355
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,570
She did.

356
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,640
(Fascinated)

357
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,410
I couldn't even try to copy her.
Such charisma.

358
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,840
The 500th episode's race is...

359
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,710
Did You Even Eat Before the Race?

360
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,470
The winning team of each round...

361
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,520
gets to enjoy invigorating food
in season prepared on the spot.

362
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,260
- Really?
- Spring greens...

363
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,930
- That sounds amazing.
- But...

364
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,580
one of you is greedy...

365
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,090
and wants to take all the prizes.

366
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,170
Again?

367
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,570
(The greedy one
wants all the prizes.)

368
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,990
- Someone is greedy.
- Unbelievable.

369
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,440
We have a greedy one again.
Who is it?

370
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,940
The greedy one wants to
eliminate everyone else...

371
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,330
- and win all the prizes.
- How greedy.

372
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,200
Find and eliminate the greedy one...

373
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,840
in the final race.

374
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,150
The team that eliminates
the greedy one wins the race...

375
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,520
and receives all the prizes.

376
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,080
(The teams will be able to buy hints
regarding the greedy one.)

377
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,710
Each team
will receive 100 dollars...

378
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,560
which you must hide in your tents.

379
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,820
- In our tents?
- In our tents.

380
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,430
After each round,
the winning team will get...

381
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,900
a hint regarding the greedy one...

382
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,300
and time to search for the money
hidden in another team's tent.

383
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,190
With the money you win,

384
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,270
you can buy the meal offered
in the round and more hints.

385
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,180
After the second round,

386
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,910
the top two teams with
the most amount of money left...

387
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,710
will win extra hints regarding
the identity of the greedy one.

388
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,920
Please head to your tents
and hide the money.

389
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,890
- Got it.
- We need to hide the money?

390
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,160
(They'll now hide the money.)

391
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,260
We need to hide it
in a place no one would suspect.

392
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,800
Are you perhaps the greedy one?

393
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,850
If you are, can you rip off
my name tag?

394
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,930
What?

395
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,770
There's only one?

396
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,400
Let's not suspect each other
during the race.

397
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,100
- What? Of course.
- We'll trust each other.

398
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,170
Why would I suspect you?

399
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,510
(He's nothing but suspicious.)

400
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,150
- These spots...
- Is this too obvious?

401
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,470
That'll easily get found.

402
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,150
This isn't easy at all.

403
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,650
(Meanwhile,
Kwang Soo and Chungha...)

404
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,790
- Can we turn off this fan?
- What?

405
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,820
Let's hide it in the fan
and then turn it back on.

406
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,660
Wouldn't the money
fly all over the place?

407
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,820
You're right.

408
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,820
Hold on.

409
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,490
(Se Chan hides the money
in the door frame.)

410
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,940
(He's proud of himself.)

411
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,570
I hid it all.

412
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,470
I'm not suspicious or anything,
but you didn't pocket any, right?

413
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,730
- What?
- No, right?

414
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,100
Unbelievable.

415
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,470
- We're on the same team today.
- Got it.

416
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,280
(They're all done
hiding their money.)

417
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,690
Please gather around.

418
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,190
Your time is up.

419
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,190
Where did you hide yours?

420
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,080
I bet we hid the money
in similar places.

421
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,430
- Right.
- Under the mattress?

422
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,350
- Probably.
- There weren't many options.

423
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,820
- You're right.
- Like always,

424
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,320
Jong Kook's the last one out.

425
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,620
Jong Kook!

426
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,090
Coming!

427
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,640
You can't hide them
separately, right?

428
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,230
Someone should tell him.

429
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,360
Separately?

430
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,770
- What do you mean?
- Can we hide each bill separately?

431
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,640
- Yes, you can.
- We can?

432
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,200
- We can?
- Why would you hide them together?

433
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,470
- Is that what you did?
- It'll be like hitting the jackpot.

434
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,920
- I hid all of it together too.
- Hold on...

435
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,110
(A little while ago)

436
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,740
Would this fit in here?

437
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,290
(They tried to find a place
to hide all the money in.)

438
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,760
No one would open this, right?

439
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,160
Of course not.

440
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,060
I doubt this will fit.

441
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,400
No way!

442
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,190
No one would find that.

443
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,430
- How...
- We should've kept quiet.

444
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,960
Wait, are you sure?

445
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
- I'm heading to Haha's tent.
- For sure.

446
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,270
We can hit the jackpot there.

447
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,770
We only need to look
for one hiding spot.

448
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,780
- Mijoo, over here.
- Where did Chorong go?

449
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,340
Bomi, where are you?

450
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,740
- Bomi?
- Bomi!

451
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,780
- You gave yourself a brow lift.
- Look at you.

452
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,980
- Bomi...
- That's a tight ponytail.

453
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,710
I thought
you were frowning just now.

454
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,940
You look like a warrior
from a period drama.

455
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,520
As you can see,

456
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,480
the chefs over there
will be cooking for you today.

457
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,080
- It looks amazing.
- Thank you!

458
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,260
If only it were a little less windy.

459
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,300
- Exactly.
- I'm starving!

460
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,300
(Their tongues
and stomachs react.)

461
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,600
Let me reveal the first dish
you'll be playing for in this round.

462
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,830
Bring it out.

463
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,410
- Come on out.
- Anything would taste good today.

464
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,040
Everything is better
when freshly cooked.

465
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,070
I see noodles!

466
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,810
- What is it?
- Noodles?

467
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,870
What is it?

468
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,320
- What's that?
- What is it?

469
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,520
- No way!
- I love this.

470
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,190
- What is it?
- What is it?

471
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,940
- I can't see.
- Webfoot octopus ramyeon.

472
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,950
- Webfoot octopus.
- Are those fritters?

473
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,950
I can't see.

474
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,390
- Octopus ramyeon.
- Webfoot octopus.

475
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,060
Is it webfoot octopus?

476
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,320
- And fried webfoot octopus.
- They look delicious.

477
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,820
(Kwang Soo's lost it.)

478
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,770
Webfoot octopus is in season,
you know.

479
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,140
It's in season.

480
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,040
I'm going to have that
no matter what.

481
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,360
The first dish...

482
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,730
is abundant with taurine
which rejuvenates you.

483
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,440
Fried webfoot octopus
and webfoot octopus ramyeon.

484
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,640
I didn't know they were in season.

485
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,440
(He shows his excitement
with a knee strike.)

486
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,050
Jae Suk only does that
when he feels energized.

487
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,720
Why would you kick the air?

488
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,410
I just love webfoot octopus.

489
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,880
The game you will play
is called Dancing Catallena.

490
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,120
One of you will stick a question
on a part of your body...

491
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,960
- and dance to the music.
- Right.

492
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,820
Your goal is to make sure
that only your partner sees it.

493
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,700
Then, it's up to the partner
to answer the question.

494
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,630
Other teams are also free
to answer the questions...

495
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,510
- and score points.
- All right.

496
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,040
- So we need to answer it correctly.
- Got it.

497
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,840
I'm sure the questions
aren't that difficult.

498
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,980
- More or less.
- Really?

499
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,520
- Are they easy enough for us?
- Yes.

500
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,220
- Common knowledge?
- That's right.

501
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,490
- Darn it.
- Common knowledge?

502
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,150
"Hyeongseoljigong"
describes this situation.

503
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,910
Jae Suk, "hyeongseoljigong"...

504
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
You're killing me.

505
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,030
This situation...

506
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,460
I searched "hyeongseoljigong"
after watching the show,

507
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,160
and I've never been
more embarrassed in my life.

508
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,800
I still don't know what it means.

509
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,970
(It means
"the fruits of studying hard.")

510
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,210
Be honest.

511
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,070
(The meaning
of "hyeongseoljigong"...)

512
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,600
(Se Chan doesn't know either.)

513
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,810
You two...

514
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,320
- I still don't know what it means.
- "Hyeongseoljigong".

515
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,670
I looked it up and...

516
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,950
Ji Hyo, you know
what it means, right?

517
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,020
I don't.

518
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,290
- You don't?
- It describes this situation.

519
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,560
- This situation?
- Yes.

520
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,680
- Yes, of course.
- That's right.

521
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,850
You know what it means, right?

522
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,730
- No, I don't?
- I see.

523
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,420
(This is exactly what
"hyeongseoljigong" means.)

524
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,040
The teams in the back
can also answer the question...

525
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,890
if you can read it.

526
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,970
- Got it.
- Really?

527
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,770
You must say, "Let me answer" first.

528
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,870
- Sure.
- Got it.

529
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,670
Let the wall go up first.

530
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,780
We won't get to see
where she sticks it on.

531
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,900
You should tell me what you see.

532
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Got it.

533
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,050
- You get the rules, right?
- Right.

534
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,820
- I want that dish badly.
- Go, Chorong.

535
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,950
- Has she stuck it on her?
- Yes.

536
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,520
- Let's do this then.
- Get ready.

537
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,020
Yoojung,
make sure that only I can see it.

538
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,060
(She nods.)

539
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,460
- Let's go!
- Can we answer it too?

540
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,620
- Yes.
- Say, "Let me answer" first.

541
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,060
- I don't see it.
- Where is it?

542
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,820
- Where is it?
- There.

543
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,530
- There!
- On her side!

544
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,000
(I see something.)

545
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,400
- Over there.
- I can't see it at all.

546
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,710
It all comes down
to having good vision.

547
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,170
- I can't see it.
- Me neither.

548
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,510
- The letters are too small.
- I don't see a thing.

549
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,250
- I can't see anything.
- She's too far away.

550
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,510
The letters are too small.

551
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,870
(Who founded Goguryeo?)

552
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,610
(The answer is Jumong.)

553
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,140
- No!
- I can't see a thing.

554
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,140
Let me answer!

555
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,720
Magugo.

556
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,910
Magugo.

557
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,730
- What?
- What's that?

558
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,390
The letters are too small.

559
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,030
- Goguryeo...
- Sweet potatoes...

560
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,120
Let me answer!

561
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,570
- Goguryeo...
- Sweet potatoes...

562
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,660
Let me answer!

563
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,070
(Farsightedness caused
a misunderstanding.)

564
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,070
Jumong!

565
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,000
- What?
- What was that?

566
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,100
(Screaming)

567
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,710
(They celebrate by dancing.)

568
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,250
- What was that?
- What did he say?

569
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,550
- What was the answer?
- What did he say?

570
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,810
Wasn't I supposed to say
"sweet potatoes" backward?

571
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,050
What?

572
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,370
"Who founded Goguryeo?"

573
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,180
- Really?
- Who founded Goguryeo?

574
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,220
No way.

575
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,790
Let's go for it. Nice!

576
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,060
Gosh.

577
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,290
- What was the question?
- Who founded Goguryeo?

578
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,350
- Wasn't it Wang Geon?
- I thought it was a math quiz.

579
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,620
- What?
- Se Chan said...

580
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,070
that Wang Geon is the one
who founded Goguryeo.

581
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,570
- That's what he said.
- I thought it was Wang Geon.

582
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,430
- He founded Goryeo.
- Seriously?

583
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,570
I bet some are pretending
not to have read it.

584
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,430
- I'm sure of it.
- Me too.

585
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,870
Yoojung did a good job.

586
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,640
- Okay, Kwang Soo's up next.
- Me?

587
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,020
Reading it
doesn't mean you'll answer it.

588
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,250
Jumong...

589
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,640
I would've answered that correctly.

590
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,110
Jumong, Park Hyeokgeose...

591
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,060
You need to have common knowledge.

592
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,320
Reading it
doesn't mean you'll answer it.

593
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,680
Right, you need common knowledge.

594
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,380
Haha, you just need basic knowledge.

595
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,390
Shut it.

596
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,120
(Jae Suk still wants to party.)

597
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,300
Chungha...

598
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,200
Look at him being all silly.

599
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,160
(Why is Kwang Soo
heading over to Chungha?)

600
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,860
Kwang Soo, you can't go back there.

601
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,040
- What are you doing?
- You can't cheat.

602
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,400
What are you doing?

603
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,480
Kwang Soo, are you kidding me?

604
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,950
(He openly gives her advice.)

605
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,910
Give me a signal using your hands.

606
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,220
(What was that?)

607
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,580
- What is he doing?
- Hey.

608
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,720
He said he'd look
when she gives him a signal.

609
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,820
(Se Chan reveals their strategy.)

610
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,880
- That was our strategy.
- Are you kidding me?

611
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,000
How could you tell the others?

612
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, I heard it too.

613
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,160
What on earth are you doing?

614
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,890
- What's the meaning of this?
- My gosh.

615
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,130
Cover your behind with your t-shift.

616
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,930
Cover your behind.

617
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,010
I did.

618
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,710
You have no idea how many
clothes Jae Suk has ruined.

619
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,070
- What is this?
- He pulls on mine...

620
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,050
so that it becomes
an off-the-shoulder top.

621
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,110
- Kwang Soo...
- Unbelievable.

622
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,410
All right then.

623
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,840
- Where is it?
- I don't see it.

624
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,720
It's probably on her side.

625
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,380
(Nice!)

626
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,790
(Where did she stick the question?)

627
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,060
It's on the bottom of her foot!

628
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,500
The bottom of her foot.

629
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,620
- What?
- The bottom of her foot.

630
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
Let's see.

631
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,730
(It's difficult to see.)

632
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,120
- I can't see it.
- Me neither.

633
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,040
- Stop bouncing!
- The letters are too small.

634
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,100
- Where is it?
- I can't see it.

635
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,540
- Do you see it?
- What's the question?

636
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,040
- I can't see it.
- She looks so cool though.

637
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,370
No, I can't see anything.

638
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,310
- The position of it...
- Hold your foot up and freeze.

639
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,600
Hold your foot up and freeze.

640
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,520
(What's the Korean word
for "a cold?")

641
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
(The answer is "goppul.")

642
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,580
(Does Se Chan know the answer?)

643
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,350
Ji Hyo, what's that dish
that was served in the palace?

644
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,620
- What is it?
- I don't see anything.

645
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,230
I think I saw "a bowl of rice."

646
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,460
- Really?
- A bowl of rice.

647
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,890
- Chungha...
- Chorong!

648
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,470
- Chorong...
- Chorong!

649
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,470
- A cold...
- Chorong said her name.

650
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,740
- What's the answer?
- Chorong, go ahead.

651
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,970
(What will Chorong's answer be?)

652
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,130
Goppul.

653
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,360
- Sorry?
- Goppul.

654
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,070
She's right.

655
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,900
- Goppul.
- She's right.

656
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,550
- What was the question?
- Go, Chorong!

657
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,140
- The archaic word for...
- The Korean word for "a cold."

658
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,170
(Chorong
read the question perfectly.)

659
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,370
- Chorong, nice one.
- The old word for "a cold."

660
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,580
(The question was meant
for Kwang Soo though.)

661
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,140
The Korean word for "a cold."

662
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,910
Why would you ask me
about a dish served in the palace?

663
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,960
Isn't that what it said?

664
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,220
A dish served in the palace?

665
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,680
Oh, the Korean word.

666
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,320
I might have the ramyeon
thanks to Chorong.

667
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,650
I should've gotten it.

668
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,700
You wouldn't have been able
to answer it anyway.

669
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,040
What are you talking about?

670
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,970
I call it a goppul these days too.

671
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,130
You do what?

672
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,470
Are you saying you knew the answer?

673
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,810
That's what I still call a cold.

674
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,370
How did you manage to read that?

675
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,210
- Bomi's ready for business.
- I wonder where she hid it.

676
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,980
Let's do this.

677
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,180
(She lets her hips fly.)

678
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,340
- She's getting into it.
- Yes.

679
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,080
(She's good.)

680
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,460
It's a hit.

681
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,530
She's great.

682
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,500
Gosh, what's up with Bomi?

683
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,300
You're amazing.

684
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,390
Let us see the question now.

685
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,770
(Haha, take a look at my palm.)

686
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,970
What was that?

687
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,660
- It's on her palm.
- My gosh.

688
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,810
Your butt is showing.

689
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,170
(What's Bomi's question?)

690
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,980
What?

691
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,370
(What's the name
of Seong Chun Hyang's mom?)

692
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,950
(She shows it
only to her partner, Haha.)

693
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,080
- Haha, what are you doing?
- We can't see it.

694
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,220
It's about something's name.

695
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,460
(Let me answer.)

696
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,490
Let me answer.

697
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,790
Do you want to see her dance
a little more?

698
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,230
Okay. Go ahead. Let's enjoy.

699
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,590
- Keep dancing.
- Enjoy.

700
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,890
- Did you see it?
- Enjoy.

701
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,890
She's scary.

702
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,000
Enjoy.

703
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,590
Okay.

704
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,770
- Let me answer.
- He knows it.

705
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,470
(Haha seems confident. Can he
get it right on his first attempt?)

706
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,710
(Haha, I believe in you.)

707
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,480
Mother Ppaengdeok.

708
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Mother Ppaengdeok?

709
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,870
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

710
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,900
Maid Ppaengdeok!

711
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,220
(They all get excited
as Haha gives a wrong answer.)

712
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,170
It's Maid Ppaengdeok.
Maid Ppaengdeok.

713
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,990
- What is it then?
- Let me answer.

714
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,490
Ms. Ppaengdeok.

715
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,350
Let me answer. Housemaid Ppaengdeok.

716
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,460
Let me answer. Kim Chun Bok.

717
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,500
What?

718
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,000
- Let me answer.
- Good.

719
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,350
- Look at her.
- Let me answer.

720
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,920
- What was the question?
- Mr. Sim.

721
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,570
(They give all kinds
of wrong answers.)

722
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,570
Let me answer. Wolmae.

723
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,770
What?

724
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,270
(Jong Kook made a lucky guess.)

725
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,430
- How did you know that?
- What was that?

726
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,100
(It's Wolmae.)

727
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,870
It's Wolmae. I knew it.

728
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,280
- Mom?
- What was the question?

729
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,070
- I didn't see the question.
- Seong Chun Hyang's mom?

730
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,750
It's Wolmae.

731
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,450
I see. Wolmae.

732
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,060
I mean, they are best friends.

733
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,350
It's Seong Chun Hyang's mom.

734
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,180
Aren't Ppangdeok and
Chun Hyang's mom best friends?

735
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,290
You're funny.
The answer is Wolmae.

736
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,560
- Who is Mother Ppaengdeok?
- It's not Ppaengdeok.

737
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,120
Who is Ppaengdeok then?

738
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,700
She's Mr. Sim's wife.

739
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,500
What are you doing?

740
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,200
I didn't even know the question.
I just inferred it from his answer.

741
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,570
I'm so embarrassed.

742
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,540
Did you just hear Haha?

743
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,430
"Do you want to see her dance
a little more? Okay."

744
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,810
"Do you want to see..."

745
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,280
(After he shouted out
confidently...)

746
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,070
(Do you want to see her dance
a little more?)

747
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,570
(It's a tragedy caused
by his overconfidence.)

748
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,110
(He wants to crawl under a rock.)

749
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,380
"Do you want to see more?"

750
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,990
"Do you want to see her dance
a little more? Okay."

751
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,960
Hey, you just put Bomi
in an awkward situation.

752
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,060
"Enjoy, Bomi."

753
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,790
"Let me answer. Mother Ppaengdeok."

754
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,080
What was that?

755
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,920
Haha was being so ugly.

756
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,230
It gives me pleasure.

757
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm excited to see Mijoo dance.

758
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,090
(Next up is Jong Kook and Mijoo.)

759
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,090
Let's go.

760
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,570
There she goes.

761
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,860
(She turns around
posing sensuously.)

762
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,210
(Headbanging)

763
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,930
What does it say?

764
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,780
Her hair is covering it.

765
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,010
What does it say?

766
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,170
(Her hair is covering it.)

767
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,640
The capital of Canada.

768
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,340
- What does it say?
- The capital of Canada.

769
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,990
(He eavesdrops on Yoojung.)

770
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,180
What's the capital of Canada?

771
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,960
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer!

772
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,560
- Oslo.
- Let me answer.

773
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
- Let me answer.
- Oslo?

774
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,460
Let me answer!

775
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Ottawa.

776
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,890
Gosh, I knew it.

777
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,700
(Thanks to Ji Hyo's mistake,
Jae Suk and Yoojung got 1 point.)

778
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,700
I knew it.

779
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,630
- What was the question?
- Oslo? Ji Hyo.

780
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,100
- Where's Oslo?
- Did she mean...

781
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
a green tea farm?

782
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,810
- No, I said Oslo.
- Did you say O'sulloc?

783
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,210
- It's a green tea farm.
- No.

784
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,280
- I didn't say O'sulloc.
- Why did you say O'sulloc?

785
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,340
- What about O'sulloc?
- Where's Oslo?

786
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,170
It was supposed to be
the capital of Canada.

787
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,380
Did you go to O'sulloc?

788
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,820
- No.
- Jeju Island?

789
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,880
- No.
- Do you like green tea?

790
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,290
No, it's not that.

791
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,180
It's not O'sulloc. I said Oslo.

792
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,580
Where is Oslo?

793
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,350
- Where is it?
- What did she say?

794
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,960
There's a city called Oslo.

795
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,230
- Really?
- There is.

796
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,730
Next up is our members.

797
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,890
Okay.

798
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,470
- Is it Se Chan's turn?
- Yes.

799
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,010
Let's do this.

800
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,480
(This song is "Growl" by ECO.)

801
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,310
- There you go.
- It's EXO.

802
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,780
My gosh.

803
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
Oh no.

804
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,220
Oh no.

805
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,340
(This is "Snore" by Yang Se Chan.)

806
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,610
Chorong, what do you think?

807
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,380
- What do you think?
- He's cool.

808
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,920
(Is he showing the question?)

809
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,590
- Is he doing it?
- Where is it?

810
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,650
There's nothing.

811
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,770
Where is it?

812
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,770
(Screaming)

813
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,800
(After dancing around a while...)

814
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,590
(He shows his belly carefully.)

815
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,970
(It ruins their eyes.)

816
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,860
(Frightened)

817
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,900
(They can't bear to see his belly,
so they just cover their eyes.)

818
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,280
My goodness.

819
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,550
- I can't see this. You sit here.
- I'll sit.

820
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,570
I'm not watching it.

821
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,720
Look at this.

822
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,340
(Possessed by EXO)

823
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,450
(The guy with a baby belly
is carried away.)

824
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,580
What does it say?

825
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,720
- I can't see it.
- What is it?

826
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,990
What does it say?

827
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,580
- It's...
- What does it say?

828
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,350
- What is it?
- Can I come closer?

829
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,350
They all are asking it.

830
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,000
They all are asking it.

831
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,560
(Where is the place
Sim Cheong jumped into the water?)

832
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,000
- That's right.
- It's...

833
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,500
- She doesn't know the answer.
- It's...

834
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,000
- You're almost there.
- She doesn't know the answer.

835
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,630
- She doesn't know.
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

836
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,570
- River.
- What?

837
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,570
(Did Sim Cheong dive into a river?)

838
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,450
- What?
- A reservoir. Hang on.

839
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,340
What is it?

840
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,780
Let me answer. A lake.

841
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,950
What?

842
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,840
I know what it is.

843
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,550
- What?
- What's the question?

844
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,790
(She didn't even see the question.)

845
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,760
- I know what it is.
- Where did Sim Cheong...

846
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,620
Let me answer. Indangsu.

847
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,760
(Indangsu is correct.)

848
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,090
- I knew it.
- My goodness.

849
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,890
What's the question?

850
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,390
(Disappointed)

851
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,030
She said a river.

852
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,000
What was that? Indangsu? My gosh.

853
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,770
How could you say that?

854
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,010
I couldn't think of the name.

855
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,330
She said O'sulloc and river.
What's with her?

856
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,510
River and sea.

857
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,280
Sim Cheong dived into a river?
Isn't it ridiculous?

858
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,370
- A river? It's just...
- It's Indangsu.

859
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,020
That's right.

860
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,980
You should've said Samdasoo.

861
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,380
- O'sulloc.
- You should've said O'sulloc.

862
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,820
- O'sulloc.
- That was hard.

863
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,820
Gosh, I want to
get the right answer.

864
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,850
- This is fun.
- But I can't see it.

865
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,850
I can't answer when I can't see it.

866
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,580
Yoojung catches it very well.

867
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,560
- I have good eyesight.
- You have such good eyesight.

868
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,730
I have good eyesight.

869
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,470
You're really good.

870
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,890
Please give us an easy one.

871
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,740
I didn't know any of the questions
you just gave.

872
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,540
- Change it with Mijoo.
- He's starting.

873
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
(It's Haha's turn to dance.)

874
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,210
Look at his hand.

875
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,570
(She opens her eyes wide.)

876
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,820
- I can't see his feet.
- I guess it's on his foot.

877
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,720
It's on the sole of his foot.

878
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,290
- Hey, I don't see anything.
- There's nothing.

879
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,080
(He shows his feet slowly.)

880
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,350
(I don't see anything.)

881
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,650
Haha.

882
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,850
My gosh.

883
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,880
(It's on his calf, not his foot.)

884
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,490
(Who's the god of the sea
in Greek mythology? Poseidon)

885
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,760
- Let me answer.
- It's Bomi's turn.

886
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,500
(She shouts out first.)

887
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,860
Bomi doesn't know it.

888
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,000
You know it.

889
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,970
(Bomi, I believe in you.)

890
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,770
(What's Bomi's answer?)

891
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,810
- Jesus.
- Let me answer.

892
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,810
- Let me answer.
- My turn.

893
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,480
(The god of sea, Jesus?)

894
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,280
- I said it first.
- Jesus!

895
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,370
(Upset)

896
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,980
Let me answer!

897
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,570
- Let me answer!
- Jong Kook.

898
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,340
- Let Jong Kook answer.
- Poseidon!

899
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,950
- I said it first.
- Jong Kook.

900
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,180
Poseidon.

901
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,960
- Let me answer.
- Okay. I knew it.

902
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I was faster.

903
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
- Okay.
- Gosh, it's Poseidon.

904
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,560
- I knew the answer.
- Jong Kook was faster.

905
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,000
- What was that? Jesus?
- Because he walked on the sea.

906
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,660
The god of sea, Jesus?

907
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
The god of sea.

908
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,700
Is Jesus in Greek mythology?

909
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,090
Bomi?

910
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,600
That was close, Ji Hyo.

911
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,010
Don't come too close.

912
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,370
- Okay.
- They all were here.

913
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,070
They all were standing here.

914
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,480
That's because
this smell drives me crazy.

915
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,450
- Okay.
- It smells amazing.

916
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,670
It smells so good.

917
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,820
I like the smell.
We have to eat it, Yoojung.

918
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,640
(What? Yoojung?)

919
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,220
- Me?
- Suk Jin.

920
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,380
Yoojung is my partner.

921
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,380
Really?

922
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,030
I was so surprised to hear that.

923
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,180
What did you say?

924
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,090
Do you know what Suk Jin said?

925
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,390
"We have to eat it, Yoojung."

926
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,730
Why?

927
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,590
- He doesn't even know his partner.
- It's Chorong.

928
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,090
- He's...
- You thought she is your partner...

929
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,200
because she's next to you.

930
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
I'm sorry.

931
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,710
- What was that?
- She was standing next to me.

932
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,860
Next up is Kwang Soo.

933
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,070
(It's Chungha and Kwang Soo's turn.)

934
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,710
- Kwang Soo.
- I have to trust my eyes.

935
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,600
Kwang Soo, is it
a difficult question?

936
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,170
You can answer it.

937
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,070
Do you know the answer?

938
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,220
This isn't right.

939
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,020
- What?
- I don't know.

940
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,080
(I don't know.)

941
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
I'm sorry.

942
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,340
He doesn't know the answer.

943
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,290
I'm sorry.
But I'm sure you can answer it.

944
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,490
- You can do this.
- You don't know it?

945
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,320
How can she answer it
when you don't know it?

946
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,350
(I'll try hard to answer it.)

947
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,090
- You can do this.
- Where did he put it on?

948
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,300
Did you put it on the cast?

949
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,820
(He rolls up his pants.)

950
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,070
(Then he lies down.)

951
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,800
- It's coming.
- Good. There you go.

952
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,860
Where is it?

953
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,070
- Where is it?
- Look at his face.

954
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,100
- Look at his face.
- It looks so annoying.

955
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,370
What are you doing?

956
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,900
What's that?

957
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
(Shrieking)

958
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,980
There it is.

959
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,340
(After he draws attention
to his leg,)

960
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,980
(he gives the question
with his mouth.)

961
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,380
(Shocked)

962
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,380
What's that?

963
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,020
(What's the name
of Hong Du Kkae's wife?)

964
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,180
(Go Eun Ae)

965
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,730
My goodness.

966
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,960
(They are shocked
by his way of setting the question.)

967
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,390
Kwang Soo is unbelievable.

968
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,360
- Kwang Soo is Kwang Soo.
- We have to watch carefully.

969
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,700
(They all look
at Kwang Soo's mouth.)

970
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,660
I can't see it.

971
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,200
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

972
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,210
Go ahead.

973
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,040
Go Gil Dong.

974
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,740
- Let me answer.
- No. It's from "Dooly."

975
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,040
Let me answer. Go Eun Ah.

976
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,170
Let me answer. Go Gil Sun.

977
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,450
Let me answer!

978
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,280
(If Jae Suk gets it right,
Jae Suk and Yoojung win.)

979
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,320
Go Eun Ae.

980
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,220
That's right. It's Go Eun Ae.

981
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
(Go Eun Ae is correct.)

982
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,610
- It's Go Eun Ae.
- Go Eun Ae?

983
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,380
It is Go Eun Ae.

984
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,730
I was right about Go.

985
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,500
You were right about that.
She's not Kang.

986
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,590
Go Gil Dong?
You guys are unbelievable.

987
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,970
That's right. It's Go Eun Ae.

988
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,240
- It wasn't Go Gil Dong.
- It's Go Eun Ae.

989
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,160
It was so close. It's okay.

990
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,710
It wasn't close at all.

991
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,930
It was close.

992
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:36,930
Was it close?

993
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,170
What's next?

994
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,640
Let me announce the results.
The winning team is...

995
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,010
Yoojung and Jae Suk.

996
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,480
(The top three couples
who can search hidden money)

997
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,820
Second place is
Mijoo and Jong Kook.

998
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,290
- That's not bad.
- It's still good.

999
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,220
- Thank you. You did a good job.
- This isn't bad.

1000
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,790
Third place is
Chorong and Suk Jin.

1001
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,730
The top three couples can...

1002
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,560
choose a tent
that they will steal money from.

1003
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,590
- Which one should we pick?
- Please make a decision.

1004
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,820
Do you want to do that?

1005
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,320
- We pick Haha's tent.
- What?

1006
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,500
They hid all the money in one place.

1007
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,390
- Really?
- Shall we do that?

1008
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,830
We will go to Kwang Soo's tent.

1009
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,360
We pick Suk Jin
and Chorong's tent.

1010
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,480
- I'll give you 100 seconds.
- What is this?

1011
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,900
- Start.
- Let's go.

1012
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,070
- We have 100 seconds.
- Kwang Soo.

1013
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,140
- Let's go to Kwang Soo's tent.
- Where is it?

1014
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,670
Where did they hide it?

1015
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,220
I think we can find it.

1016
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,380
(They are busy searching the tent.)

1017
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,490
(Find money for a meal
and a hint on the greedy one.)

1018
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,520
Where is it?

1019
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,260
Where did they hide it?

1020
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,490
Gather around.

1021
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,680
Time's up.

1022
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,230
Did you find our money?
You didn't, did you?

1023
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,260
- They must have found it.
- Did you find it?

1024
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,030
- They must have found it.
- They must have found it.

1025
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,160
Look at Jae Suk's butt.

1026
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,540
I think they found it.

1027
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,040
- It was so hard.
- Jae Suk must have found it.

1028
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,740
- He found it.
- His back pocket is full.

1029
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,780
Really?

1030
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,370
- What is that?
- Did you find all the money?

1031
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,710
- What?
- Is that a full envelope?

1032
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,780
Did you hide all of the money
in one place?

1033
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,170
- Yoojung found it.
- How did you find it?

1034
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,320
(Team Haha's 100 dollars
was discovered right away.)

1035
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,790
- How are supposed to...
- Jae Suk, I found it.

1036
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,450
- Did you find it?
- I found it! How do I go in there?

1037
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,910
- Yoojung, where is it?
- It's over there.

1038
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,410
- Where?
- Over there.

1039
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,760
- Okay. We found it.
- Yes!

1040
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,820
(They easily retrieved
the entire amount.)

1041
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,420
- I guess people think similarly.
- Yes!

1042
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,160
- Bomi. Bomi.
- 100 dollars?

1043
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,360
- 100 dollars?
- Yes.

1044
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,590
- Haha.
- Suk Jin's team is next.

1045
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,590
(They suddenly become dirt poor.)

1046
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:12,930
Us?

1047
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,330
(Meanwhile, Suk Jin and Chorong)

1048
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,370
Is that it?

1049
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,300
- Is that it?
- Where did you hide the money?

1050
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,740
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.

1051
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,910
You found it
with the toilet paper, right?

1052
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,640
- Didn't you?
- Is it with the toilet paper?

1053
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,080
(She suddenly confesses
where she hid the money.)

1054
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,890
- What is wrong with her?
- Who is next?

1055
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,180
- What is wrong with her?
- It's with the toilet paper.

1056
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,260
Search there the next time.

1057
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,950
- Search there the next time.
- What is wrong with her?

1058
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,010
- Thank you, Chungha.
- Search there the next time.

1059
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,450
Did she reveal it just now?

1060
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,450
- What is wrong with her?
- It's with the toilet paper.

1061
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,850
Jong Kook's team is next.

1062
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,990
What?

1063
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,390
(Jong Kook and Mijoo
acquired 67 dollars.)

1064
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,490
- Where did you find them?
- Please spread them out.

1065
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,070
They scattered them across the tent,
but the hiding places were obvious.

1066
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,330
- Were the hiding places obvious?
- They lacked original ideas.

1067
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,870
One serving of the meal
you saw earlier costs...

1068
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,140
30 dollars.

1069
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,300
- We won't be able to eat.
- If you want a hint...

1070
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,240
on the greedy one,
it also costs 30 dollars.

1071
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,350
- We need to pay.
- Yes.

1072
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,280
The team that placed first
will receive a hint.

1073
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,910
- Will we receive it?
- Yes.

1074
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,580
- A hint on the greedy one.
- I forgot about the greedy one.

1075
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,510
The greedy one.

1076
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,660
Jae Suk, doesn't it feel strange
to receive a hint about yourself?

1077
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,720
(They carefully check the hint.)

1078
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,490
(Someone who is a bit hot
and unstylish)

1079
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,490
(This person is very interested
in health.)

1080
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,100
What does it mean?

1081
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,600
It may be wise to keep the hint
a secret...

1082
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,070
since you need to eliminate
this person to win.

1083
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,240
- How is the hint?
- It's not like how it was...

1084
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,300
- in the past.
- It isn't too broad, is it?

1085
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,680
(Jong Kook is obsessed
with working out.)

1086
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,740
(Is he the greedy one
who is very interested in health?)

1087
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,640
I wouldn't say
it leaves you flustered.

1088
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,120
(There is another person
who is associated with health.)

1089
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,050
Jae Suk is talented
in exercising too.

1090
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,530
(Jae Suk looks after his health.
Is he the greedy one?)

1091
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,700
Don't you wish
you could see the hint?

1092
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,160
(Suk Jin is closely associated
with health too.)

1093
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,370
You look ill.

1094
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,070
(Suk Jin brags about his health.
Is he the greedy one?)

1095
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,370
(All three of them are
fairly unstylish too.)

1096
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,280
(Who could the greedy one be?)

1097
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,410
You are worried about that.

1098
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,580
A serving of a meal
costs 30 dollars.

1099
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,010
- Do we have to pay for the meal?
- Yes.

1100
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,410
Bomi has a showcase today.
Please give her 10 dollars.

1101
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,720
Please give me two dollars.

1102
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
Please give her two dollars.
She has a showcase today.

1103
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,530
- Please give her two dollars.
- But still...

1104
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,330
You don't need to give me anything.

1105
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,070
- Please give me one dollar.
- Yoojung, I leave it up to you.

1106
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,870
- Yoojung.
- Please give her 10 dollars.

1107
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,330
Look at Bomi's hands.

1108
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,740
(Let's do the same.)

1109
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,430
- Chorong has a showcase too.
- Please give me 10 dollars.

1110
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,470
- We took money from them.
- But we...

1111
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,200
(He spots an opportunity.)

1112
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,640
Chungha has a showcase too.
She couldn't tell you before.

1113
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,780
She has a showcase too.

1114
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,450
Jae Suk, Ji Hyo needs to go
to the river.

1115
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,680
- She needs to go to the river.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1116
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,050
- Please give her two dollars.
- How much did you give her?

1117
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,120
We will have one serving.

1118
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,850
- Shall we have one each?
- Yes.

1119
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,720
- Give us one each.
- They are flexing.

1120
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,800
- You are ordering two servings.
- That's right.

1121
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,120
- We need a serving each, right?
- Yes.

1122
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,530
It's okay. I am not hungry
because I ate at home.

1123
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,100
- 60 dollars.
- 60 dollars.

1124
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,700
- Thank you for the food.
- How much does a bite cost?

1125
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,830
Thank you for the food.
I won't sell a bite.

1126
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,030
- Yoojung.
- Yes?

1127
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,410
How much does webfoot octopus cost?

1128
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,680
It's a hearty meal.

1129
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,080
(She doesn't have time to answer.)

1130
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,410
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

1131
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,780
(He slurps the noodles
with determination.)

1132
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,220
(His mouth waters.)

1133
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220
- It was delicious.
- Let's move to the next location.

1134
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,180
(They finish eating
and move to the next location.)

1135
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,760
- All right.
- It's time for the second mission.

1136
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,550
We will reveal the second meal.

1137
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,550
Bring in the meal.

1138
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,830
I bet it will keep improving.

1139
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,160
Gosh, I have to eat it.

1140
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,200
This is something I must eat.

1141
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,330
What's inside?

1142
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,570
Fatsia shoots.

1143
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,760
- Bibimmyeon with fatsia shoots.
- Brisket rolled...

1144
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,260
- fatsia shoots.
- Fatsia shoots are inside.

1145
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,330
Fatsia shoots are good for health.

1146
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,470
This is insane.

1147
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,740
This mission is...

1148
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,300
I Am Coming to Save You.

1149
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:46,240
The couples will take turns
to be an offensive team.

1150
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,510
A member of the offensive team
will sit on a conveyor belt.

1151
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,820
The other member will play
All-Direction Cham, Cham, Cham...

1152
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,780
with five members
of the rest of the teams.

1153
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,550
- We have played this game before.
- That's right.

1154
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,930
- I remember that.
- It's so hard.

1155
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,160
- It's so hard.
- It's a difficult game.

1156
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,330
As the matches take place,
the conveyor belt will move.

1157
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,890
It will stop the moment
the player beats all opponents.

1158
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:10,370
The time it took to save the partner
will determine the top three places.

1159
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,530
- Okay.
- Okay.

1160
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,780
- In that case...
- Top, bottom, left, and right.

1161
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,780
(Their eyes go wide!)

1162
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,120
My goodness.

1163
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,320
(They begin to set up the paints
on the conveyor belt.)

1164
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,550
Aren't they soaking the fabric...

1165
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,620
too much?

1166
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,720
They are completely soaking
the fabric.

1167
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,180
Don't go too hard on it.

1168
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,180
(Gulping)

1169
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,800
Pick the first team.

1170
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,160
They should go first this time.

1171
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,070
They should go first this time.

1172
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,120
- Haha.
- Haha or Kwang Soo.

1173
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,200
- No!
- Jong Kook.

1174
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,570
Why should we go first?

1175
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,140
- "DADDY FREE", do it.
- Okay!

1176
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,800
He is happy.

1177
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,240
We need one member from each team
to play the game.

1178
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,370
(Haha sits on the conveyor belt
and Bomi goes to play the game.)

1179
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,800
- Bomi!
- Okay.

1180
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,100
I need to have that meal.

1181
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,220
Let's not see each other if we lose.

1182
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,470
- That's right.
- Okay.

1183
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,240
(I will win!)

1184
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,990
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1185
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,580
(What?)

1186
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,580
(The beat is a bit strange.)

1187
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,430
- She can't do that.
- That was a bit off.

1188
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,930
(Is that how you play
Cham, Cham, Cham?)

1189
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,120
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1190
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,530
(She continues to play
Cham, Cham, Cham strangely.)

1191
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,600
What?

1192
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,760
Hurry up!

1193
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,370
(Bomi keeps going.)

1194
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,600
- He dodged.
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1195
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,930
(Red paint)

1196
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,970
(Green paint)

1197
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,600
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

1198
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,240
(Hurried)

1199
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,140
What? "Hold on"?

1200
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,220
What is going on?

1201
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,820
- Why did you lie down?
- Why did you lie down?

1202
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,120
- Why did you lie down?
- Hey!

1203
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,050
- Why did you lie down?
- You didn't say you had stopped.

1204
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,160
(He feels victimized.)

1205
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,600
- Why did you lie down?
- I kept going since I didn't know!

1206
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,620
- Why did you lie down?
- I kept going.

1207
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,830
- Why did you lie down?
- You were supposed to keep going.

1208
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,300
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

1209
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,100
- You were supposed to keep going.
- You said, "Hold on."

1210
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,870
Hey, this is reggae!

1211
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,870
- Really?
- Ya man!

1212
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,100
- Ya man!
- Ya man!

1213
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,300
(Ya man!)

1214
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,800
- Why did you stop?
- He told me to stop.

1215
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,740
- This is reggae.
- We will start over.

1216
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,820
It's okay. It doesn't matter.
I need to have that meal.

1217
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,080
"Dumhdurum".

1218
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,820
I believe in you.

1219
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,490
Pick a direction on the last "Cham."

1220
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,430
- Get ready.
- Bomi, let's go!

1221
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,580
Let's go!

1222
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,930
Set.

1223
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,030
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1224
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,570
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1225
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,740
(Yoojung avoids all attacks.)

1226
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,030
(Desperate)

1227
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,140
(Here it comes.)

1228
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,580
(Fast and precise)

1229
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,580
- She is done.
- All done.

1230
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,580
(He stopped
right in front of the paint!)

1231
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,640
So why do I look like this?

1232
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,580
Why do I look like this
when I stopped right in front of it?

1233
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,050
No matter how much you like reggae,
you shouldn't be on TV like this.

1234
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,890
- You try so hard to stand out.
- Why do you dress that way?

1235
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,050
- Was I like this from the opening?
- Yes!

1236
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,720
Are you having a showcase today?

1237
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,660
- Seriously.
- Why do I look like this?

1238
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,370
- 12 seconds.
- You were so fast.

1239
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,800
- That's how you should do it.
- I will keep it fast.

1240
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,240
- The paint dried.
- You should put more paint on it.

1241
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,410
Aren't they...

1242
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,300
- Aren't they putting too much?
- Make it perfect.

1243
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,800
- Put more paint on it.
- Suk Jin is next, right?

1244
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,280
- No, no. Jong Kook is next.
- No.

1245
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,680
- The producer confirmed it.
- No, no. Jong Kook is next.

1246
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,080
- The producer confirmed it.
- You are next, Suk Jin.

1247
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,910
- You are next, Suk Jin.
- The producer confirmed it.

1248
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,160
It's you.

1249
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,780
Jong Kook is next!

1250
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,050
I will go after Suk Jin.

1251
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,330
They...

1252
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,100
They put too much paint on it.
Why did I suggest it?

1253
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,390
Let's go!

1254
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,600
I am bad at it. This is bad.

1255
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,160
(He sits on the conveyor belt.)

1256
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,140
Look at him.
He isn't sitting at the very end,

1257
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,970
because he is too lazy
to move the sitting cushion.

1258
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,030
Are you serious?

1259
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,180
(Suk Jin is unbelievable.)

1260
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,100
- All right. Chorong.
- You know what I mean, right?

1261
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,510
- Yes?
- Let's go!

1262
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,050
He is unbelievable.

1263
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,240
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1264
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,910
- It's moving fast.
- Why didn't you sit at the end?

1265
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,010
It's moving fast.

1266
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,990
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1267
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,620
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>
- Your hair looks cool.

1268
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,800
She is good.

1269
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,830
(Bomi plays Cham, Cham, Cham
haphazardly again.)

1270
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,620
(Suk Jin emerges
as colorful as ever.)

1271
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,990
(They are absorbed in
Cham, Cham, Cham.)

1272
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,660
(Tapping)

1273
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,990
- Hey.
- It's over.

1274
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,510
- It's over.
- Someone give him a motorcycle.

1275
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,970
Someone give him a motorcycle.

1276
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,930
(Suk Jin, the outlaw motorcyclist)

1277
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,300
Suk Jin, let's go.

1278
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,550
Get on that motorcycle.

1279
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,120
- His hair looks cool.
- He looks cool.

1280
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,620
Sport this look regularly.
It's a good look on you.

1281
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,120
- Seriously.
- You look cool.

1282
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,760
- Really?
- You look young.

1283
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,280
- You look young.
- In that style,

1284
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,050
- you look young.
- Do I really look okay?

1285
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,450
- Let me see.
- Who wants to go next?

1286
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,160
- You look cool.
- This time,

1287
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,870
- shall we go?
- Jae Suk.

1288
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,740
- This is hard.
- I have no confidence.

1289
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,240
- Put yourself at ease.
- Okay.

1290
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,640
- Get ready.
- I will put myself at ease.

1291
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,330
- Okay.
- Set.

1292
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,180
(Yoojung and Jae Suk start.)

1293
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,280
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1294
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,320
(Yoojung plays the game
comfortably.)

1295
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,620
Yoojung! Why is it so fast?

1296
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,910
Yoojung! Why is it so fast?

1297
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,080
(Look at that!)

1298
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,760
- Hey!
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1299
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,120
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1300
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,580
- Hey!
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1301
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,530
(Spring and summer collection,
when a handsome face meets colors)

1302
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,870
(What is that?)

1303
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,800
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>
- Hey!

1304
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,870
(Peek-a-boo)

1305
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,510
Come on.

1306
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,080
This is...

1307
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,030
- Hey.
- His face became a mess.

1308
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,910
(The outlaw motorcyclist
laughs merrily.)

1309
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,220
- Hey.
- His face became a mess.

1310
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,620
Hold on.

1311
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,950
- Didn't you make it too fast?
- Why is it so fast?

1312
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,080
It became faster
starting from my turn.

1313
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,280
This is...

1314
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,390
- It became faster.
- I can't open my eyes!

1315
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,760
- I feel bad.
- For goodness' sake.

1316
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,430
It was as fast as a roller coaster.

1317
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,990
Kwang Soo should go again.

1318
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,570
- Kwang Soo should go again.
- Seriously.

1319
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,620
- What?
- Kwang Soo, go again.

1320
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,700
- You didn't get any paint on you.
- Kwang Soo hasn't gone yet.

1321
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,640
I haven't gone yet?

1322
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,010
- You haven't gone yet.
- No, no.

1323
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,570
Says who?
Who says I haven't gone yet?

1324
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:44,600
You haven't gone yet.

1325
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,800
(A bit earlier,)

1326
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,820
(Kwang Soo played a boring round
when the paint was dry.)

1327
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,140
- Go again.
- Kwang Soo hasn't gone yet.

1328
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
Don't say he needs to go again.
He hasn't gone yet.

1329
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,510
- He hasn't gone yet.
- I am getting a sense of deja vu.

1330
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,660
- You haven't gone yet.
- You haven't gone yet, Kwang Soo.

1331
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,080
- Really?
- Kwan Soo.

1332
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,930
- I haven't gone yet.
- Kwan Soo should go at our speed.

1333
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,200
- At our speed.
- Okay.

1334
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,350
His name is Kwang Soo, not Kwan Soo.

1335
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,530
Suk Jin.

1336
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,490
We worked together for 10 years.
How could you call me Kwan Soo?

1337
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,970
I mispronounced.

1338
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,200
(He learns Kwang Soo's name
after 10 years.)

1339
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,300
Paint!

1340
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,030
Dip it in paint!

1341
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,470
Gather around, Soak it with paint.

1342
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,010
Soak it completely.
Soak it perfectly. More!

1343
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,550
Get ready. Set.

1344
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:26,140
(Kwang Soo and Chungha start.)

1345
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,740
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1346
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,890
Kwang Soo, close your eyes.
You need to close your eyes.

1347
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,450
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>
- Chungha, don't worry about me.

1348
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,580
(He keeps his eyes closed.)

1349
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,890
- Just think that I am not here.
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1350
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:37,330
(My goodness.)

1351
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,030
Just think that I am not here.

1352
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,870
(It's like a car wash.)

1353
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:43,660
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>
- Chungha, I am okay.

1354
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,070
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>
- Chungha, don't worry about me.

1355
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,140
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1356
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,010
Oh, no!

1357
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,180
Oh, no.

1358
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:55,870
Oh, no.

1359
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,180
Who is that?

1360
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,280
(Trying to figure out
what happened)

1361
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:03,280
He looks scary.

1362
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,580
(The colorful monster
charges forward.)

1363
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,780
Don't run!

1364
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,080
(The outlaw motorcyclist is happy.)

1365
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,280
- Chungha, what happened?
- How scary!

1366
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,550
- Chungha, what happened?
- You look scary.

1367
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,370
- Decalcomania.
- You look like a work of art.

1368
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,330
Isn't this decalcomania?

1369
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:18,990
You look like a work of art.

1370
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,600
- You look like a work of art.
- I made you a star.

1371
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,970
- I made you a star.
- How badly do I look?

1372
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,530
(The name of the artwork is
"The Bare-faced Star.")

1373
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,530
- I made you a star.
- What the...

1374
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,350
What is this?

1375
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,080
Paint got on my phone!

1376
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,950
I made you a star.

1377
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,620
Your time is 15 seconds.

1378
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,580
- 15 seconds?
- That's right.

1379
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,220
Are you saying this happened
in 15 seconds?

1380
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,660
- 15 seconds is a short time.
- You did a good job.

1381
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,350
How did you get
so much paint on yourself?

1382
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,450
Okay!

1383
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,100
- 13 seconds.
- Good job.

1384
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,600
- 13 seconds?
- You finished fast.

1385
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,600
She is good.

1386
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,800
Se Chan.

1387
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,370
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo go last.)

1388
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:53,370
(Do you want to go
on the conveyor belt?)

1389
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,370
Hey.

1390
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,070
Hurry up and go, you punk.

1391
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,600
Ji Hyo, do you want to give it a go?

1392
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,030
- Should I give it a go?
- Go ahead.

1393
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,050
- Okay then.
- Go.

1394
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,600
(Ji Hyo gets 5 stars
for enthusiasm.)

1395
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,120
- What is going on?
- Hey.

1396
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,720
- I will do a good job.
- Let's go.

1397
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:10,580
- Ji Hyo is enthusiastic.
- Ji Hyo is cool.

1398
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,760
Here I go.

1399
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,080
Ji Hyo, that's good.

1400
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,030
Okay. Ji Hyo is enthusiastic.
Let's go.

1401
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,200
Ji Hyo, I will do this properly.
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1402
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,800
Ji Hyo, I will finish them off
in five blows.

1403
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,100
- Okay.
- Don't worry.

1404
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,120
Let's go. Let's go.

1405
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,370
Set.

1406
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,100
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1407
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,140
- What?
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1408
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,700
- That's good.
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1409
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,910
(Something doesn't seem right.)

1410
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,100
(He got me.)

1411
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:38,050
(To the beat)

1412
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,850
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1413
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:42,510
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1414
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,180
(He attacks with all his force.)

1415
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,680
- How is she avoiding everything?
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1416
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,930
(Swearing)

1417
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,330
(There hasn't been
Cham, Cham, Cham like this!)

1418
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:50,330
- Ji Hyo.
- That's good.

1419
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,120
- Ji Hyo.
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1420
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,070
(Gosh, I lost.)

1421
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,200
(Swearing)

1422
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,800
(The delinquent Ji Hyo is back.)

1423
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,100
I can't believe you!

1424
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,600
You should have at least fallen
for it once!

1425
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,830
You suck!

1426
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,700
I can't believe you!
When I went, <i>"Cham, cham, cham,"</i>

1427
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,010
you should have fallen for it!

1428
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,180
For goodness' sake.

1429
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,950
Ji Hyo is cool.

1430
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,640
- For goodness' sake.
- You look like Angry Bird.

1431
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,740
Ji Hyo,

1432
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,720
- I did my best.
- For goodness' sake.

1433
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,510
- Ji Hyo, you look like Angry Bird.
- Mijoo, I am disappointed in you.

1434
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:22,080
You should have allowed
an attack once.

1435
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,620
They did a good job.

1436
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:26,120
Mijoo, you looked so carefree.
It was like a commercial.

1437
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,620
Mijoo is good.

1438
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,700
(She is
the Cham, Cham, Cham genius.)

1439
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,200
The records are in.

1440
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,260
I will give you a chance
to renew the record...

1441
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,300
- if you want.
- Should I go?

1442
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,970
My partner, Yoojung,
wants to give it a go.

1443
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:40,200
Chungha wants to go.
We will go again.

1444
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,080
Ji Hyo wants to go again.

1445
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,180
I will show the viewers!

1446
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,220
- Ji Hyo is incredible.
- Viewers, just you wait.

1447
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,550
I will show you.

1448
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,510
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1449
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,930
Just you wait.
I told the viewers to wait.

1450
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,120
I will show them.

1451
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,390
I am angry! Ji Hyo, come here.

1452
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:58,430
Come here.

1453
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,300
- Ji Hyo, come here.
- For goodness' sake.

1454
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,760
Let's start with Yoojung.

1455
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,200
This time, the men will play
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1456
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,490
- Okay.
- Okay.

1457
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,260
- Yoojung, are you ready?
- Yes.

1458
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,830
- Okay.
- Get ready.

1459
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,010
(Screaming)

1460
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,240
(Yoojung is excited.)

1461
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,830
- She is excited.
- It's a good look on Yoojung.

1462
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,450
- It's a good look.
- You look cute.

1463
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:17,180
Yoojung, let's make a record.

1464
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,280
- Okay.
- Get ready.

1465
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,620
Set.

1466
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,120
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1467
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,850
(Here comes Yoojung!)

1468
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,120
(She is carefree despite the paint
on her both cheeks.)

1469
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,450
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1470
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,080
(The Cham, Cham, Cham novice)

1471
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,050
(Se Chan dodges expertly.)

1472
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:35,830
- You punk!
- What was that?

1473
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,330
- What was that?
- Hold on.

1474
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,870
- You need to play fair!
- Why did you do that?

1475
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:41,140
Why did you hit him?

1476
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,470
- Come here.
- Why did you hit him?

1477
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,470
(Yoojung reaches the end.)

1478
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:46,830
It's over.

1479
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,140
What happened?

1480
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,350
Yoojung, you look cute.

1481
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,820
You look cute.

1482
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,050
- You look cute. You look cute.
- It's okay.

1483
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,490
- I am okay.
- Are you okay?

1484
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,280
- This is nice.
- Yoojung is okay.

1485
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
You look cute.

1486
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,820
- You should take a selfie.
- Do I look okay?

1487
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,850
Yes, you do.

1488
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:05,890
It looks like Yoojung is
at a festival.

1489
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,870
(Yoojung looks like
someone at a festival.)

1490
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,870
- Who wants to go next?
- Chungha will go next.

1491
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,070
Let's get ready.

1492
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,490
I am worried!

1493
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,700
- Get ready.
- I can't wait.

1494
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,930
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1495

00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:21,780
- He is good.
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1498

<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1499

(Motionless)

1500
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,180
(Jae Suk doesn't move.)

1501
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:31,180
(Jae Suk didn't move.)

1502
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,890
He didn't play the game.

1503
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,720
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>
- He didn't play the game.

1504
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,260
This is ridiculous!

1505
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,700
You can't stand motionless!

1506
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:40,700
- You have to play!
- What?

1507
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,370
- What?
- Why won't you play?

1508
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,660
Come on and play.

1509
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,390
You have to play!

1510
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:46,760
- What?
- You have to play.

1511
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,160
Come on and play.

1512
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,300
You can stay motionless too.
Say, "Cham, cham, cham."

1513
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,680
I thought you were
a cardboard cutout for a second.

1514
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,740
(Chungha got covered in paint
in the meantime.)

1515
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,470
- Is staying motionless an option?
- Then hit me.

1516
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:59,680
- Is staying motionless an option?
- Yes, it is.

1517
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,050
It's an option.
Why wouldn't it be an option?

1518
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,510
I am sorry.

1519
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,890
I didn't know
staying motionless was an option.

1520
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,030
Jong Kook, you are up next.

1521
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,080
Is it my turn?

1522
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,220
- Mijoo, let's go.
- Let's go.

1523
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,430
I am scared.

1524
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,490

00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,240
- Harley Quinn.
- Team Jong Kook...

1547
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,850
had a better record the last time
with 13 seconds.

1548
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,010
(13 seconds will be their record.)

1549
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,680
What's our record?

1550
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,410
- You failed.
- What? We failed?

1551
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:09,990
- You failed.
- Oh, you are right.

1552
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,720
Chorong, let's go. Let's go.

1553
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,550
We failed earlier.

1554
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:15,990
Doesn't she have a showcase later?

1555
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,330
- My goodness.
- She has a showcase later.

1556
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,700
- Don't do it.
- You don't need to do it.

1557
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,600
No, no. She wants to do it.
If she doesn't do it,

1558
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
- she will regret it.
- Suk Jin.

1559
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,600
- Don't make her do it.
- She has a showcase.

1560
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,490
- Don't make her do it.
- I am not making her do it.

1561
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,100
You should do it once more.

1562
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,430
- If I do it once more...
- Do it once more.

1563
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,100
- If I do it once more...
- Suk Jin,

1564
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,870
Chorong's staff members
are ready to destroy you.

1565
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,950
Chorong's staff members...

1566
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,950
are sticking pins
into your voodoo doll.

1567
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,320
"What is up with that punk?"

1568
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:43,080
I want Chorong to experience
the variety show.

1569
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,260
If you aren't going to do it,
let's stop.

1570
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,390
In that case, shall we stop?

1571
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,280
(He is cool.)

1572
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,300
My goodness.

1573
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,490
That's not a bad idea.

1574
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,720
(Bomi and Chorong of Apink had
a good showcase after the shoot.)

1575
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,470
- Chorong has a showcase.
- You are the absolute worst.

1576
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,570
- You look cute.
- Give me an opportunity.

1577
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,740
- Seriously.
- Ji Hyo.

1578
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,180
- Make Se Chan go.
- This time, Ji Hyo should play...

1579
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,200
- Cham, Cham, Cham.
- Se Chan will get the paint.

1580
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,780
Se Chan, go on the conveyor belt.

1581
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,780
Go on.

1582
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,850
Ji Hyo, let's do this.

1583
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:15,010
(Her enthusiasm flares up.)

1584
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,180
Ji Hyo, let's go.

1585
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:18,950
Let's go! Se Chan, I'll be serious.

1586
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,050
- Okay.
- Seriously.

1587
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:30,690
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1588
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,290
(She's very passionate
about this game.)

1589
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,360
(They dance to
the "Cham, Cham, Cham" beats.)

1590
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,730
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1591
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:40,920
(Falling)

1592
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:43,420
Hold on.

1593
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,730
- What's going on?
- What's this?

1594
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,190
- What do I do?
- That's so weird.

1595
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,710
- Your ears!
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1596
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:50,900
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1597
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,900
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>
- Hey.

1598
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,610
(She keeps singing to the beat
regardless.)

1599
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,840
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>
- Hey.

1600
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,940
What was that?

1601
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,070
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>
- Hey.

1602
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,040
- Se Chan!
- What was that?

1603
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,820
There was a speed bump!

1604
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,820
- What was that?
- Why is there a speed bump?

1605
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,420
Why did this fall?

1606
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,880
What happened, Se Chan?

1607
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,980
Your record is unchanged
from before.

1608
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,090
Sure.

1609
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,960
What?

1610
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,190
- Okay.
- Okay.

1611
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:18,000
- What was that?
- Get back together.

1612
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,070
- My gosh.
- We might be top three.

1613
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,900
You never know.

1614
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,900
These are the results of
I Am Coming to Save You.

1615
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,570
1st place is
Haha and Bomi with 12 seconds.

1616
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,610
(Top three couples get to
search for money.)

1617
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,900
Second place is
Mijoo and Jong Kook.

1618
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,900
(Jong Kook and Mijoo are
2nd place team.)

1619
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,440
- We didn't do bad.
- Third place is...

1620
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,920
- Chungha and Kwang Soo.
- Okay!

1621
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,920
(Kwang Soo and Chungha are
3rd place team.)

1622
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,380
This was doable.

1623
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,750
- Let's get started.
- Kwang Soo, did you find the money?

1624
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,460
Get started.

1625
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,250
- You have to get started.
- Do I go?

1626
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,790
(Which team will bring back most
amount of money in 100 seconds?)

1627
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,960
There's a bundle here.

1628
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:51,270
(Search time is over.)

1629
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,290
First, Team Jong Kook stole
22 dollars.

1630
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,210
- That's not bad.
- True.

1631
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,400
Team Kwang Soo stole 35 dollars.

1632
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,340
- Okay.
- Yes.

1633
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,310
- They didn't find anything.
- We had bundles.

1634
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,710
They didn't find anything.

1635
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,020
- They did.
- They were searching outside.

1636
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,320
They found something inside.

1637
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,150
I'm so mad.

1638
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:12,110
I found nothing.

1639
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,710
- He found nothing.
- Haha didn't find anything.

1640
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,360
- Really?
- I thought Bomi found some.

1641
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,730
- They found none?
- Yes.

1642
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,250
We looked everywhere,
and there was nothing.

1643
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,070
- Well, then...
- You get a hint though.

1644
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,730
- It's important.
- I'll give you a hint.

1645
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,730
Okay.

1646
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,590
- Hints are really important.
- They really are.

1647
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:29,710
- You'll find out it's not me.
- I think it is you.

1648
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,440
(What is this hint about?)

1649
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,710
(Fussy personality with
a nasty temper, Top star)

1650
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,170
(Haha...)

1651
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,170
- That's nonsense.
- No, it's not me.

1652
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:39,380
We have to eat.

1653
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,840
(Is this hint about the greedy one
pointing to Haha?)

1654
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:45,110
(Fussy personality
with a nasty temper)

1655
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,960
(Top star pose)

1656
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,150
(She's full of doubt.)

1657
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:54,630
This does sound like me, but this is
not what people perceive me as.

1658
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,500
You're going to regret it.

1659
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,270
I'm serious. I swear.

1660
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,590
Kwang Soo.

1661
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,460
Three top teams can eat.

1662
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,940
Let's see how it tastes.

1663
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:07,730
- This looks so good.
- It looks so good.

1664
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:09,310
(Fatsia shoot bibimmyeon and meat
contain the scent of the spring.)

1665
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:10,900
Excuse me, Yoojung.

1666
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,110
- Are you eating by yourself?
- Eat this.

1667
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,710
- Okay.
- She told me to eat by myself.

1668
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,590
Bomi wants to eat too.

1669
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,210
- No, it's okay.
- Have one.

1670
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:19,320
It's fatsia shoot.

1671
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,110
This is really good, Yoojung.

1672
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,290
How much is this?

1673
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,790
I want it for a dollar.

1674
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,190
(The combination of bibimmyeon
and rolled meat are amazing.)

1675
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,360
Two dollars.

1676
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,820
What is this scent?

1677
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:29,920
- Is this fatsia shoot?
- Are you done?

1678
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,920
- Yes.
- This is so good.

1679
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,670
Let's clean up
and move onto the next mission.

1680
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,840
- Okay.
- That was good.

1681
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,710
Do you...

1682
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,380
Do you have enough ingredients?

1683
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,380
No.

1684
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,710
I'll pay with my own money.

1685
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,570
I want to take it to go.
That was really good.

1686
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,920
Do you have some cash?

1687
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,920
I didn't bring my wallet.

1688
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,540
- Don't be so cheap.
- Go get cleaned up.

1689
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,020
Can we get cleaned up?

1690
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,590
Bring a camera over here.

1691
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:55,320
Wait. I can talk to them personally.

1692
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,150
Do you own a restaurant?

1693
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,820
(There are cameras on them already.)

1694
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,500
Are you going to eat this?

1695
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,520
No.

1696
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,290
Are you going to throw it away?
You can throw it away in my mouth.

1697
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,570
Is it done?

1698
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,730
Here.

1699
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:07,730
It's okay.

1700
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,730
(They move onto the next mission
as the staff members are watching.)

1701
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:15,710
This is the final race, Find Me.

1702
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,650
(Final Race of Did You Even Eat
Before the Race? Find Me)

1703
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:18,670
"Me"?

1704
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,980
The couple that can
put together the hints...

1705
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,920
hidden in various places
and eliminate the greedy one wins.

1706
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,860
I see.

1707
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,130
However, every five minutes,

1708
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,090
there will be
the night of the greedy one.

1709
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,900
- This is when...
- I'm scared.

1710
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,860
everybody will be blindfolded
and freeze on the spot.

1711
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:41,090
Only the greedy one will be free to
move around and eliminate people...

1712
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:44,570
- in the order that they assigned.
- There's an order.

1713
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,670
(Eliminate one at a time?)

1714
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,110
- In the assigned order?
- They have already shared...

1715
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,270
the order with the staff.

1716
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,840
- Already?
- We're in trouble.

1717
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,940
Jong Kook is number one.

1718
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,570
I think I'm near the beginning.

1719
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,920
Once it's the night
of the greedy one,

1720
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,690
you cannot move or make any noise.

1721
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:01,320
If your name tag gets ripped,
you cannot resist.

1722
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,420
This is going to be insane.

1723
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,690
If you accidentally rip
the name tag...

1724
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,290
of a normal person,

1725
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,090
the one whose name tag got ripped
will be eliminated.

1726
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,730
Plus, the night of the greedy one
will start immediately.

1727
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,690
Oh, dear. You also get eliminated?

1728
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:17,040
The person who attacked will live,
but it'll be night again.

1729
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,000
Person who got attacked is
eliminated.

1730
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,210
- This is really scary.
- Each couple...

1731
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,750
will move to separate spots.

1732
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,770
Let's go.

1733
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,210
(The identity of the greedy one is
still a mystery.)

1734
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,670
The sky is so clear today.

1735
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,710
Look, Yoojung.

1736
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,460
- It's a clear day.
- Hurrah!

1737
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,380
(She shouts "hurrah" for 3 seconds.)

1738
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,730
(Her refreshing "hurrah" echoes
in the surrounding.)

1739
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:43,900
You're definitely an idol star.

1740
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,500
You definitely are. This is great.

1741
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,730
Can't you do that too?
Be cute. Try it.

1742
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,960
- Be cute?
- Say, "hurrah".

1743
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,380
(Hur...)

1744
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,670
Hur...

1745
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,670
You have a husky voice.

1746
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,670
Your voice sounds like
it got blocked.

1747
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,670
(She sounds very husky.)

1748
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:01,440
- That's good.
- Hurrah!

1749
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,940
We're enjoying our time too.

1750
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,380
- Her tone is different.
- Hurrah!

1751
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,750
I know.
There's something stuck here.

1752
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,820
(The girl crush comes from
her husky voice.)

1753
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,630
Are you very interested in health?

1754
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,360
I am, but not excessively.

1755
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,560
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1756
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,790
They're unstylish, hot,

1757
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:18,000
- They're fussy...
- fussy...

1758
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,360
with a nasty temper.

1759
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,540
It's Jong Kook. It has to be him
according to the hints.

1760
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,360
Is he really interested in health?

1761
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,000
Yes, I'm very interested in health.

1762
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,110
Very much.

1763
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,440
- You're very interested.
- This is really strange.

1764
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,170
I'm very interested.

1765
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,270
Exactly.

1766
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,380
It's you.

1767
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,520
It's not.

1768
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:38,110
- Be honest, okay?
- Yes.

1769
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,960
- It's not you, right?
- My gosh.

1770
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,750
This person is
very interested in health.

1771
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,190
I heard...

1772
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:48,230
she's religious about
taking her supplements.

1773
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,360
Is it okay to doubt your partner?

1774
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,500
- I want to ask you.
- I think it's you.

1775
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,400
Bomi and Haha are a team,

1776
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,770
but Bomi was
still suspicious of Haha.

1777
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,630
- Oh, really?
- She was suspicious of him,

1778
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,500
so I am too.

1779
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,480
They also had a chance
to find money,

1780
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,750
but they didn't find a penny.
That was deliberate.

1781
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,020
Also, they put
all the money together.

1782
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,590
- That too.
- It's a dangerous thing to do.

1783
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:17,020
If it ends up being you,
I'm going to feel so betrayed.

1784
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,060
It won't be.

1785
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,250
Think carefully. How many of us
are there including the guests?

1786
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,000
- How many teams are there?
- There are around 10 of us.

1787
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,270
There are 12 people.

1788
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:25,400
There's only one greedy one.

1789
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,670
That one person has to
eliminate 11 people.

1790
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:29,500
Who do you think can do that?

1791
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,210
Great reasoning.

1792
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,000
Think about it. It has to be
Jong Kook. We have to eliminate him.

1793
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,270
(Haha is suspicious of Jong Kook.)

1794
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,570
(Is the greedy one among them?)

1795
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,020
Let's get started.

1796
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,820
- My goodness!
- Race starts...

1797
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,420
in 5, 4,

1798
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,710
3, 2, 1.

1799
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,960
- Race starts.
- Let's go.

1800
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,820
(Race starts.)

1801
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,560
We're just starting.

1802
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,190
We have to find hints.

1803
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:58,090
Chungha,
let's share the hints we find.

1804
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,670
Sure. Should we split?

1805
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:02,960
We can split or go around together.

1806
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:05,900
Chungha.

1807
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,480
(Did she find a hint already?)

1808
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:12,400
(She finds a hint
as soon as the game starts.)

1809
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,110
- This person likes music.
- What?

1810
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:16,540
This person likes music.

1811
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,040
Music.

1812
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,590
(This person likes music.)

1813
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,190
This is insane.

1814
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,820
(The greedy one likes music?)

1815
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,150
From the members,
Jae Suk really likes music.

1816
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,290
Really?

1817
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,790
Hey, who do you think it is?

1818
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,070
- Suk Jin, we found one.
- A hint?

1819
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,170
Yes. I don't think it's you.

1820
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,170
I'm not. What's the hint?

1821
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,310
This person likes music.

1822
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:37,540
(He shares the hint Chungha found.)

1823
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,540
Music.

1824
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:42,500
I think it's Jae Suk.

1825
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,670
(Suk Jin is suspicious of
Jae Suk as well.)

1826
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,020
- He really likes music.
- True.

1827
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:50,110
He plays music
on his Bluetooth speaker.

1828
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,820
What night is it again?

1829
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,250
We have to find hints
before that night comes.

1830
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,880
- Night of the greedy one.
- Night of the greedy one.

1831
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,400
(Potential candidate for the greedy
one approaches them.)

1832
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,500
This is driving me crazy.

1833
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,270
Where will the hints be?

1834
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,340
How do you find them?

1835
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,940
I found it!

1836
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:14,730
(She finds a hint under the shells.)

1837
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:18,210
(What does her hint say?)

1838
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,320
I'm certain. This is over.

1839
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,090
Right? This reminds me of him.

1840
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,460
Jong Kook?

1841
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,020
(This person raises their voice
frequently.)

1842
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:30,690
Okay.

1843
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,480
(Is Jong Kook the greedy one
because he raises his voice?)

1844
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,520
I don't think it'll be here.

1845
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,960
Is it not on that side?

1846
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,400
We hid some on that side too.

1847
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,460
This side?

1848
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,360
- Check it out.
- Okay.

1849
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,000
(Jong Kook looks for hints
harder than ever.)

1850
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,860
- I found one.
- Really?

1851
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,000
(Jong Kook finds a hint.)

1852
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,940
(He finds a hint under a chair.)

1853
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,070
I knew it.

1854
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:52,340
(The hint says...)

1855
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:55,820
(This person has a soft voice.)

1856
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,210
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
- What does it say?

1857
01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:59,750
What does it say?

1858
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,860
(What does the hint say?)

1859
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,650
"This person has a soft voice."

1860
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,650
Mijoo, it's not like that.

1861
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,900
It doesn't make sense.

1862
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,020
Listen.

1863
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,230
It can be anyone. We're all singers.

1864
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:13,790
Am I wrong?

1865
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,360
Is there a singer
who doesn't have a soft voice?

1866
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:19,170
But your voice is way too soft.

1867
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,880
No, it's not like that.

1868
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,710
Jong Kook is getting
more and more suspicious.

1869
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,250
I should... Look at him.

1870
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,170
He's looking so hard for hints.

1871
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,020
(Is Jong Kook the greedy one
and pretending to look for hints?)

1872
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,610
- The first night of the greedy one.
- What's going on?

1873
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,020
Already?

1874
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,320
It's the night of the greedy one.

1875
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,060
It's the night of the greedy one?

1876
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:42,150
Really?

1877
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,690
I'm too remote.

1878
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,090
(A member chosen by the greedy one
will be eliminated.)

1879
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:46,690
(Everyone has to stay
where he or she is.)

1880
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:47,730
Okay.

1881
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,570
Please put on your blindfolds.

1882
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:50,900
(Everyone has to put on
a blindfold.)

1883
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,070
This is not a bad place to be.

1884
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,610
(No one is allowed
to fight the greedy one back.)

1885
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:02,110
(The first night of the greedy one)

1886
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:06,960
(Who is the greedy one
going to eliminate first?)

1887
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:09,650
Gosh, I'm scared.

1888
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,290
Please don't rip my name tag off.

1889
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:18,320
(In the darkness, fear creeps in.)

1890
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,960
- Oh, my.
- What happened?

1891
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,360
Who is it?

1892
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:25,440
Kwang Soo, are you out?

1893
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,130
(Kwang Soo's name tag
has been ripped off.)

1894
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,270
Unbelievable.

1895
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,310
(It happened so fast.)

1896
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,440
Who ripped it off?

1897
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,480
That means the greedy one
is near us.

1898
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,940
He or she is extremely close by.
I'm scared.

1899
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,690
Is it morning yet?

1900
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,840
When will it be morning?

1901
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,150
(Yoojung is about to cry.)

1902
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,320
(Everyone is terrified.)

1903
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,920
I'm scared to death.

1904
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,000
Where am I being taken to?

1905
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,790
(Only 5 minutes in,
Kwang Soo is taken to prison.)

1906
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,770
I'm clueless. Who is the greedy one?

1907
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:54,170
(The first target of the greedy one,
Kwang Soo, is out.)

1908
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,610
You can take off
your blindfolds now.

1909
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,840
(The first night of the greedy one
is over.)

1910
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,400
Kwang Soo was taken away
right before my eyes.

1911
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:01,770
Gosh, what a scary world we live in.

1912
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:03,980
- Weren't you right next to him?
- I was.

1913
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:07,020
After a ripping noise,
Kwang Soo screamed.

1914
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:09,820
- What happened?
- Unbelievable.

1915
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,540
Kwang Soo was right next to me.

1916
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,610
- I only heard a ripping noise.
- I heard someone approaching.

1917
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,380
The hint I have
points to one person.

1918
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,860
- Mine too.
- Mine too.

1919
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:19,920
Who are you suspecting?

1920
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,650
- One of the members, right?
- Yes.

1921
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,130
- Jong Kook.
- Right?

1922
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,520
It's definitely Jong kook.

1923
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,670
I think so too.

1924
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,690
I'm sure of it.

1925
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:30,230
The greedy one is
supposed to have decided...

1926
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:33,110
the order of people
to be eliminated beforehand.

1927
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:34,230
- That's right.
- It was decided beforehand.

1928
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,880
I'm sure the greedy one
is Jong Kook.

1929
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,380
- I'm sure too.
- Guys!

1930
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:40,980
- Who was near Kwang Soo?
- What?

1931
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,790
- The greedy one must be a woman.
- Why?

1932
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:47,380
Don't you think the rules were
made for a woman?

1933
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,020
(Jong Kook insists
the greedy one must be a woman.)

1934
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,380
(If you think about it...)

1935
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,820
But I was next to Kwang Soo.

1936
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,000
Chorong and I were next to him.

1937
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,400
Chorong too?

1938
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,590
- Chorong too.
- Then it could be Chorong.

1939
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:59,840
Really? Then it could be Chorong.

1940
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,000
- It could be Chorong.
- No.

1941
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,730
(Chorong was
one of the candidates.)

1942
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,110
- It could be Chorong.
- Chorong...

1943
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:07,400
Another night of the greedy one
starts in two minutes.

1944
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,480
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1945
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,110
- Yoojung, where are you?
- I'm scared.

1946
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,380
I'm going to go hide.

1947
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,520
I think I'm the next target.

1948
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,070
I'm going to go hide.

1949
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:17,250
- Could there be a hint here?
- Let's hurry up.

1950
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,540
Jae Suk.

1951
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:20,090
Where's Jong Kook?

1952
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,980
- You know I'm not the greedy one.
- It's obvious.

1953
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,380
Look at this.
It's definitely Jong Kook.

1954
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,500
- He must have deceived me.
- What did you find?

1955
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,920
- He rushed back to where he was.
- Of course.

1956
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,860
- I mean...
- That must be it.

1957
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,000
I'll pretend I have no idea.

1958
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,270
(Mijoo is searching for a hint.)

1959
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,230
(She finds...)

1960
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:42,210
(Jong Kook behind the tent.)

1961
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,250
(Startled)

1962
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,270
What are you doing?

1963
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:48,520
- Why do you look so creepy?
- The thing is,

1964
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,380
the greedy one must be checking...

1965
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:53,820
where his or her next target is.

1966
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,960
(What's Jong Kook's identity?)

1967
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,820
I'm sure Jong Kook is
the greedy one.

1968
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:00,860
He is the only one
who raises his voice.

1969
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,500
(What is this?)

1970
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,020
Someone already
rummaged through this place.

1971
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:08,630
Could a hint be here?

1972
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:09,840
(Bomi finds a frame
with an R mark on it.)

1973
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,070
I wonder...

1974
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:13,570
Wait. What is this?

1975
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:16,170
What does this even mean?

1976
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,340
(What does it say?)

1977
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,190
(All-knowing and all-powerful)

1978
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:25,920
I mean...

1979
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,710
Why is this written
with Chinese characters?

1980
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:29,520
(Why is this written
with Chinese characters?)

1981
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,690
(Other tents have...)

1982
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:36,060
(framed Chinese characters too.)

1983
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:40,570
(What's the secret
of these framed Chinese characters?)

1984
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,460
What's this?

1985
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,610
(Bomi asks Haha
what the Chinese characters mean.)

1986
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:46,710
Do you know what it means?

1987
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:50,400
- This must be a hint. Wait.
- Exactly.

1988
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,480
But I can't read it.

1989
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:53,610
Do you have any idea?

1990
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,520
What could it be?

1991
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:57,790
What's this character?

1992
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,210
(Ignorant and incapable)

1993
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,290
I can't read a single character.

1994
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:01,320
(To be honest,
I can't read a single character.)

1995
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,520
Let's ask someone like Suk Jin.

1996
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:05,190
Suk Jin!

1997
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,320
No.

1998
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,130
(The old man, Suk Jin,
is making a guess.)

1999
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:10,500
- It's the night of the greedy one.
- Again?

2000
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,860
(It's the night of the greedy one
again.)

2001
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:17,070
Please don't come near me.

2002
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,170
(Yoojung overreacts.)

2003
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,710
(Who will be eliminated this time?)

2004
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:26,840
Who are you?

2005
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:30,210
(Ripping)

2006
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,480
(Mijoo,)

2007
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,420
(the greedy one's second target,
is out.)

2008
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,460
You can take off
your blindfolds now.

2009
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:38,560
Who was eliminated this time?

2010
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,920
Is it over? Was someone eliminated?

2011
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,520
Innocent citizen Mijoo is out.

2012
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,570
Who?

2013
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,860
Mijoo is out.

2014
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:49,290
(Shocked)

2015
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:50,810
Who eliminated Mijoo?

2016
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,900
(The greedy one is eliminating
the citizens one by one.)

2017
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,980
All of a sudden, Mijoo is out?

2018
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,110
Mijoo!

2019
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,380
She's not dead or anything.

2020
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,840
(Crying)

2021
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,880
Yoojung.

2022
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:04,710
Who is it?

2023
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:06,560
Where was Mijoo?

2024
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:08,790
Hold on.

2025
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,960
Who ripped her name tag off?

2026
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,480
(Jong Kook has been hiding
in a remote place.)

2027
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,690
Jong Kook has been very talkative.

2028
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,090
(Jong Kook has been very talkative.)

2029
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:18,570
He's been suspicious.
I want to rip his name tag off.

2030
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:20,170
Should we try that?

2031
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:22,790
- I'll try to rip his name tag off.
- Okay.

2032
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:23,960
Suk Jin.

2033
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:25,700
This time, I was hiding.

2034
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,310
- I thought I was the second target.
- But...

2035
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,980
there is already a list...

2036
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,500
- of people to eliminate.
- Exactly.

2037
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,580
It's already been decided
by the greedy one.

2038
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,340
(Bomi sneaks up on Jong Kook.)

2039
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,320
What happened?

2040
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,360
Bomi was with us.

2041
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:43,830
(Jong Kook's name tag
is ripped off.)

2042
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:46,060
Whose name tag is ripped off?

2043
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,560
(No one saw this coming.)

2044
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,590
What did you do?

2045
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:52,030
You're the greedy one.

2046
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:53,570
(Confident)

2047
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,830
(If Jong Kook is the greedy one,)

2048
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:57,700
(Haha and Bomi win.)

2049
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,480
(If he isn't,
he will be eliminated.)

2050
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,310
(Jong Kook shakes his head.)

2051
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:06,000
(What does Jong Kook's reaction
mean?)

2052
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,280
(Is Jong Kook the greedy one
as many expected?)

2053
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,690
Jong Kook isn't the greedy one.

2054
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,910
(Jong Kook is not the greedy one.)

2055
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,280
Jong Kook isn't the greedy one.

2056
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,160
He isn't?

2057
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,730
(Then who is it?)

2058
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:20,860
Jong Kook...

2059
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,090
But the hints...

2060
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:24,370
The hints were...

2061
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:27,630
too obvious. It can't be me.

2062
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:30,910
Innocent citizen Jong Kook is out.

2063
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:34,810
(Does that mean the greedy one is
one of these three?)

2064
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,370
With innocent citizen Jong Kook out,

2065
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,540
it's the night of the greedy one
again.

2066
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:44,210
(Everyone is more and more confused
about the greedy one's identity.)

2067
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,560
(The greedy one's
third target is...)

2068
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,860
(Ji Hyo.)

2069
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,660
(The order of elimination is...)

2070
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,920
(Kwang Soo, Mijoo, and Ji Hyo.)

2071
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,370
(Innocent citizen Ji Hyo is out.)

2072
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:01,900
- Innocent citizen Ji Hyo is out.
- Who?

2073
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:04,630
Ji Hyo is out.

2074
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:05,910
Poor Ji Hyo.

2075
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,440
(Ji Hyo is out too.)

2076
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:11,670
Ji Hyo is out.
I knew she wasn't the greedy one.

2077
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:14,320
Jae Suk, I'll say this in front of
everyone. You're the greedy one.

2078
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,450
- I'm sure...
- I'm not.

2079
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,910
All the hints point to you.

2080
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:20,250
The greedy one is
supposed to be unstylish.

2081
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,910
- That's why I suspected you two.
- You're unstylish.

2082
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:23,060
(That's why I suspected you two.)

2083
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,490
- I'm so confused.
- Hey.

2084
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:26,190
You're unstylish,
and you love music.

2085
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:27,730
- He's interested in health too.
- You're interested in health too.

2086
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:29,920
But I'm not too interested
in health.

2087
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,620
- What about you?
- What about me?

2088
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,160
You're not as stylish
as you used to be anymore.

2089
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,370
(You're not as stylish
as you used to be anymore.)

2090
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:36,090
You've become unstylish too.

2091
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,000
Compared to before...

2092
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,460
To be honest, the most unstylish one
is Se Chan.

2093
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,580
- When I saw that hint,
- Se Chan's face is unstylish.

2094
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:44,150
- My face is unstylish.
- I thought it meant Se Chan.

2095
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:46,480
- But I'm not the greedy one.
- I mean...

2096
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,150
Who is the greedy one?

2097
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,580
I have no idea.

2098
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,450
I'm getting angry.

2099
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:53,490
Like you said, I think it's a woman.

2100
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:54,910
Is it a woman?

2101
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:57,450
The rules would be too easy...

2102
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:00,400
- if the greedy one is a man.
- It'd be easy to win.

2103
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,990
It felt like the person was...

2104
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,200
- used to ripping off name tags.
- No.

2105
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,160
Apink has been on Running Man
many times already.

2106
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,740
Also, none of
the Running Man members...

2107
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,310
would rip off a name tag that way.

2108
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:15,000
We don't rip it off so quickly.

2109
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,450
- Do you?
- You're right.

2110
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:19,110
- We'd grab the shirt.
- Exactly.

2111
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:21,540
Also, we don't want
the others to find out.

2112
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,150
We would have ripped it off quietly.

2113
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:24,320
That's a good guess.

2114
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,380
(Is the greedy one
one of the guests?)

2115
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,450
You're the greedy one, aren't you?

2116
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,320
Goodness. Yoojung, I'm not.

2117
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,450
- Do you swear?
- Gosh.

2118
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:33,560
- Hand on your heart?
- I swear.

2119
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:36,060
I don't see a hint anywhere.

2120
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:38,920
I can't believe this brat.

2121
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,630
- It's not me.
- I found one.

2122
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:42,940
I swear it's not me.

2123
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:45,030
- It's Jae Suk.
- It has to be him.

2124
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,240
I think it is.

2125
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:48,000
I'm sure it's him.

2126
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,910
Hey, rip off Jae Suk's name tag.

2127
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:52,040
Should I?

2128
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,150
Try ripping it off.

2129
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,710
(He looks around.)

2130
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,080
(Chorong approaches him alone
so that he doesn't notice.)

2131
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,210
Chorong, would you like some water?

2132
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:06,360
- I have no idea who it is.
- Thank you.

2133
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,900
(He gives her water
without asking why she's here.)

2134
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,770
If you rip off the wrong person's
name tag, you don't die, right?

2135
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:15,570
You don't.

2136
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:16,870
(He answers kindly.)

2137
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:17,870
You don't.

2138
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,460
(Then...)

2139
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,500
I'll rip off your name tag then.

2140
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,740
(Ripping)

2141
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:24,170
(She ripped off
Jae Suk's name tag.)

2142
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,310
I'll rip off your name tag then.
Sorry.

2143
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:31,490
(He got attacked in the blink
of an eye. What is his identity?)

2144
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:33,040
- Sorry.
- Hey!

2145
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,410
(He was not the greedy one!)

2146
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:39,280
What's wrong with you?

2147
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,450
Innocent citizen Jae Suk is out,

2148
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:42,750
so the night
of the greedy one has come.

2149
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,490
I told you it wasn't me, Chorong.

2150
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:45,990
I didn't know.

2151
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:48,270
- Is it really not you?
- It's not.

2152
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:50,240
(Everybody was suspicious of
Jae Suk, but it wasn't him.)

2153
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,030
Chorong, you're driving me nuts.

2154
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:55,830
(The candidates get narrowed down
quickly now.)

2155
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,500
We're not sure,
so let's narrow it down.

2156
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,820
(Chorong is one of the surviving
candidates for the greedy one.)

2157
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:04,020
It felt like somebody
who had ripped off name tags before.

2158
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:07,780
But Apink has been
on Running Man many times.

2159
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:10,420
(Her movement was decisive
with no pauses.)

2160
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:15,660
(Is she the greedy one?)

2161
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,200
(The night of the greedy one has
come again.)

2162
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,490
It wasn't Jae Suk?

2163
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:22,830
(Sobbing)

2164
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:25,660
(He was a good partner.)

2165
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:27,910
- I told you it wasn't me!
- What now?

2166
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:28,910
(She's really nervous.)

2167
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,310
(Ripping)

2168
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:35,170
(Chungha is eliminated
on the night of the greedy one.)

2169
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:39,120
Whoever it is,
their plan is working great.

2170
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:41,160
Trust nobody!

2171
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,160
(He gets eliminated by
the greedy one.)

2172
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,560
I think it's Chorong.

2173
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:45,620
(Yoojung was wailing every time.)

2174
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,200
(She gets eliminated
with a short cry as well.)

2175
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,950
You'll move to jail
with your blindfold on.

2176
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:50,030
Okay.

2177
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,030
(Running Man is
such a sad variety show.)

2178
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:52,990
Wait. Who's left?

2179
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:54,570
- Haha.
- Haha and...

2180
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:56,440
- Haha, Se Chan,
- Se Chan,

2181
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,000
- Chorong, and Bomi.
- Chorong, and Bomi.

2182
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,330
- It's 1 of them.
- There are 4 left.

2183
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:01,130
- I think it's Chorong.
- Me too.

2184
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:03,910
Who breathes heavily?

2185
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,170
- They breathed heavily for me too.
- Haha breathes heavily.

2186
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:08,150
- Haha breathes heavily.
- Like that.

2187
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,820
Because he has asthma.

2188
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,620
(Haha breathes heavily
from the members.)

2189
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,210
(Meanwhile, Haha is...)

2190
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,750
It's "all-knowing and all-powerful".
I found it.

2191
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:20,790
All-knowing and all-powerful.

2192
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:21,990
(He interprets the hint
in 10 minutes.)

2193
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:26,070
(They need more hints
to narrow down the greedy one.)

2194
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,700
Why is this here? This is so random.

2195
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:32,830
(The shells under the pine tree
are strange.)

2196
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:33,940
What is this?

2197
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,870
(The shells under the pine tree
are strange.)

2198
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:38,740
What's this?

2199
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,910
What's the R mark?

2200
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:46,190
(He looks closely, and there's an R
which signifies a hint.)

2201
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,860
(That means this shell is a hint.)

2202
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,420
(Why did Se Chan,
who doesn't like to think, find it?)

2203
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,030
Haha!

2204
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,090
(He asks Haha
who's slightly smarter.)

2205
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:58,330
What is this?

2206
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:02,370
(They finally turn their eyes
to the hints in the campground.)

2207
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:03,700
(What!)

2208
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:09,630
(There's an R mark on the light bulb
around the tree too?)

2209
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:12,580
Hey! Come here. Quick.

2210
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,670
I solved this.

2211
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:15,210
It's all-knowing
and all-powerful. Wait.

2212
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,240
This.

2213
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,880
This was on the light bulb.

2214
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,990
All-knowing and all-powerful?

2215
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:20,250
- What's this?
- What's that?

2216
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,320
- A shell.
- A shell?

2217
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,910
What's all-knowing and all-powerful?

2218
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:23,950
Where was that?

2219
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:26,950
- All-knowing and all-powerful.
- Chorong. She's Catholic.

2220
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,620
No way.

2221
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,860
Religion all of a sudden?

2222
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,090
All-knowing and all-powerful.

2223
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:33,120
Light bulb and what's this?

2224
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,660
- A shell.
- A shell?

2225
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,330
Jeon So Ran? Jeon...

2226
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:38,030
- So Ran.
- Jeon So Ran.

2227
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:39,440
- Jeon So Min?
- Jeon So Min.

2228
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:40,980
I told you. Excuse me.

2229
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,700
- Right.
- I told you it's So Min.

2230
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,240
- How'd she rip off our names tags?
- I told you it's her.

2231
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,370
(What is he talking about?)

2232
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:47,370
Suk Jin,

2233
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:50,150
I have this weird idea.

2234
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,320
Can it be So Min?

2235
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,360
No way. She can't walk right now.

2236
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,620
I must be out of my mind.

2237
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,420
(His idea was dismissed,
and he left it at that.)

2238
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,420
- Shell.
- Shell?

2239
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,200
- Haha.
- Light bulb starts with "jeon".

2240
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,660
- Shell starts with "so".
- Right.

2241
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,400
("Jeon", "jeon", and "so")

2242
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,240
(Do these hints point to So Min?)

2243
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,830
- I got chills.
- So it's not Chorong?

2244
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:10,870
I don't think it is.

2245
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:11,940
(The identity of the greedy one
finally gets revealed.)

2246
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:16,610
But one of you is greedy
and wants to take all the prizes.

2247
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:17,980
- Someone is greedy. Who is it?
- Unbelievable.

2248
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,740
(So Min is the greedy one.)

2249
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,620
(All the hints
they had today were...)

2250
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,780
"I'm a bit hot and unstylish."

2251
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:28,880
(It's a line
from a book So Min published.)

2252
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:29,990
Excuse me.

2253
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,580
I'm very interested in health.

2254
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,030
(This person is
very interested in health.)

2255
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:35,450
Why does it have to be him?

2256
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:36,450
(From the series
"Something About 1 Percent")

2257
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:39,370
He has a fussy personality
with a nasty temper.

2258
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:43,370
Oh, dear. A top star is here!

2259
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:45,030
(On "Top Star U-Back",
she said "top star" many times.)

2260
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:46,630
(During the race,
testimonies about the greedy one...)

2261
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:47,670
(This person likes music.)

2262
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:48,810
(This person raises their voice
frequently.)

2263
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,340
(This person has a soft voice.)

2264
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,150
(These are words
from her manager and stylist.)

2265
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:54,320
(Please tell me
a characteristic about So Min.)

2266
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:59,210
(There were hints around
the campground as well.)

2267
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,620
(All these items start with "jeon".)

2268
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,580
(All these items start with "so".)

2269
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,990
(All these items start with "min".)

2270
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,250
(Jeon So Min)

2271
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,570
(This is the order I would like.
Kwang Soo first for sure.)

2272
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:14,830
(So Min decided on the order
of elimination as well.)

2273
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,130
(Then Mijoo.)

2274
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:19,870
(The judges eliminated people
on behalf of So Min.)

2275
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:21,370
(And then Ji Hyo.)

2276
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,650
(Jae Suk then Jong Kook.)

2277
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,670
(She had dreams of
becoming the star of 500th episode.)

2278
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:29,170
(We miss the greedy So Min.)

2279
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:30,950
How do we win then?

2280
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:32,450
We have to find her.

2281
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,580
How do we find her?

2282
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,450
Wait, can she return already?

2283
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:36,520
(He walks toward
the life-sized figure.)

2284
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,330
(She can't be here in person.)

2285
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,490
This is unbelievable.

2286
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,560
- Haha.
- What?

2287
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:43,900
Why? What is it?

2288
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:46,030
- Gosh.
- What? Why?

2289
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,090
What's this?

2290
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:48,740
She had a name tag on her back.

2291
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,130
860407.

2292
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:52,870
(So Min decided
how the winners will be selected.)

2293
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:55,810
The couple that finds that password
on my life-sized figure...

2294
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:57,170
and opens the safe...

2295
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:59,310
wins today's race.

2296
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,210
- It's her birthday.
- Birthday.

2297
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,450
- This is her birthday.
- It is.

2298
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:03,880
860407.

2299
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,820
(The person
who opens the safe first wins.)

2300
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:06,910
- This is her birthday.
- It is.

2301
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:09,020
I'm getting dizzy.

2302
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,490
(Today's winner opened the safe
3 minutes later.)

2303
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:12,950
(Who is today's winner?)

2304
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:14,200
Race is over.

2305
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,330
What happened?

2306
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:18,230
- What's going on?
- How did this end?

2307
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:20,740
- I got chills. It almost killed me.
- What is it?

2308
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:21,960
I want to know.

2309
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:22,960
(Nobody but the people involved
know the result.)

2310
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,570
- Everybody.
- Yes.

2311
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:28,500
This is the 500th episode,
but she could not join us,

2312
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,700
so So Min planned the race herself.

2313
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,240
The greedy one was So Min.

2314
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:37,150
(This was 500th episode special
by So Min.)

2315
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:39,520
She is actually the most greedy one.

2316
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,780
- Right?
- I know.

2317
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:43,120
She's kind of unstylish too.
We were so confused at that.

2318
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,160
She likes music.

2319
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,990
The winning couple
of today's race is...

2320
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:47,900
(He announces the couple
that defeated So Min and won.)

2321
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:48,950
The winning couple is...

2322
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:53,160
(The person who opened the safe
and their partner are winners.)

2323
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:55,370
- It's Se Chan and Ji Hyo.
- Come on!

2324
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:57,160
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo win.)

2325
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:58,960
- It's Se Chan and Ji Hyo.
- Come on!

2326
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,740
(Se Chan won?)

2327
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,780
What happened?

2328
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:02,910
How did that happen?

2329
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:04,450
- Today...
- What happened?

2330
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:05,580
(Thanks to Se Chan,
Ji Hyo won unknowingly.)

2331
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:10,580
(He realized that So Min's birthday
was the password to the safe.)

2332
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,950
(He opened it.)

2333
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,560
(This is the prize So Min prepared.)

2334
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,560
What's this?

2335
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,620
What's this? Hold on.

2336
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,160
(The prize So Min got is...)

2337
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,330
- She sent an invitation as well.
- Okay.

2338
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:26,400
You were like her hands and feet.

2339
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,570
No, no.

2340
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:28,740
I also...

2341
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,960
"You are invited to So Min's house."

2342
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,700
- This is yours.
- I was wondering...

2343
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,200
what this was.

2344
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,740
"You are invited to So Min's house,"

2345
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:38,110
and her door code is on it.

2346
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:39,910
- Se Chan has to go then.
- Is he going?

2347
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:41,480
You have to go
and take a picture with her.

2348
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,580
- What?
- You have to take a picture.

2349
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,490
- It's a penalty.
- It is.

2350
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,950
I'm relieved I didn't win.

2351
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:51,160
I think this is perfect for Se Chan.

2352
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,380
I agree.

2353
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,860
This is a great chance.

2354
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:56,450
(They call So Min
who invited Se Chan.)

2355
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:57,960
Jae Suk.

2356
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,090
Writer Jeon.

2357
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,770
- We're filming.
- Well,

2358
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:04,460
- I can't believe you did all this.
- What is this?

2359
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,660
- What was that?
- What did you do?

2360
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,780
We spoke on the phone earlier.

2361
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:11,370
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It worked out well.

2362
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:12,610
- It worked out well.
- Good job.

2363
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,870
Do you know who won?

2364
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,120
Who?

2365
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,320
Se Chan.

2366
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,410
(Shrieking)

2367
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,750
High tone.

2368
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,690
- You sound happy.
- She sounds happy.

2369
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:24,060
What's all this?

2370
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,330
She's happy.

2371
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:27,090
Why is it him?

2372
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:29,750
- It just happened.
- It's strange.

2373
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:32,230
- I have a question.
- Sure.

2374
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,030
Why was Kwang Soo first?

2375
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,370
I want to see his face
the least these days.

2376
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:39,660
I didn't even get a chance to win.

2377
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:42,980
I was eliminated five minutes
into the race.

2378
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:45,410
Everybody is worried about you,

2379
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:47,240
so please say a few words
to the viewers.

2380
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:49,170
Don't worry too much.

2381
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:51,490
I'll get better quickly
and come back.

2382
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:53,710
Thank you, So Min. See you later.

2383
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,560
See you later.

2384
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,530
- See you.
- Bye.

2385
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,120
Anyhow,

2386
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,620
thank you to the 5 guests who
joined us for our 500th episode.

2387
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,290
- Great work.
- Let's go.

2388
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:06,160
- Great work.
- Good luck.

2389
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,270
- Good work.
- Thank you.

2390
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:09,740
Yoojung.

2391
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,660
(This is the 1st time in 10 years.)

2392
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,480
(1st Running Man Quiz
for the Ultimate Winner)

2393
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,540
(They are joined by actors
who played detective roles.)

2394
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,170

2395
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:21,210

2396

(This quiz sums up
the 10-year history of Running Man.)

2397
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,690
(For Running Man, By Running Man,
the unprecedented quiz special)

2398
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,380
(However,)
