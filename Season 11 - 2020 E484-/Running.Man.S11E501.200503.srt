1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,330
- Hello.
- You're here. Hello.

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,170
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,580
- This looks good.
- I like the color.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,340
How was it yesterday?

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,750
- Did you go there?
- Where?

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,380
To So Min's place? I didn't.
I just talked to her on the phone.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,750
(The prize for last week's winner)

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,050
(Invitation to So Min's house)

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,260
I called her.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,850
- She really liked it.
- When are you going to visit her?

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,850
I should go next week.

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,260
- You should definitely go.
- We need to shoot it.

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,050
- That's right. It's a prize.
- We have to shoot it.

14
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,690
- Okay.
- It was a penalty.

15
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,000
I know. It's not a prize.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,460
And Ji Hyo took
the Bluetooth earphones.

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,890
- Did she take them?
- I gave them to her.

18
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,240
She might think you got her
broken earphones.

19
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,840
- "It has no cords."
- "It's broken."

20
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,600
It will work if you stomp your foot.

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,170
I don't think she can connect
the Bluetooth earphones.

22
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,210
- She can't.
- I'm sure she can't do it.

23
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,170
Hey, adjust your clothes first.

24
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,750
- Hey.
- Take your time.

25
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,750
No rush.

26
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,320
(Running hurriedly)

27
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,250
You suddenly started
running right here.

28
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,210
We don't usually come
doing up the zipper like that.

29
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,780
Seriously, how could you...

30
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,150
(We don't usually come
doing up the zipper like that.)

31
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,500
(A 10-year veteran
shows up in a shocking way.)

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,960
Why are you zipping up
your pants like that?

33
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,390
How could you
come running like that?

34
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,960
- I was really surprised.
- I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,230
Ji Hyo, you're unbelievable.

36
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,700
This is what makes
Ji Hyo attractive.

37
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,760
Today, we are going to have...

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,680
the first Running Man Quiz
for the Ultimate Winner.

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,070
(1st Running Man Quiz
for the Ultimate Winner)

40
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,450
- Yes!
- What?

41
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,400
- A quiz show?
- Why are you excited?

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,680
- Why do you like it?
- I can outperform you guys in this.

43
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,040
- So it's a quiz competition.
- What are you talking about?

44
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,250
- I can outperform you guys in this.
- He's being ridiculous.

45
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,850
Hey. You and you.

46
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,790
- Not me.
- And you. You are a stupid trio.

47
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,060
- What about Ji Hyo?
- A stupid trio?

48
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,060
- Why are you being quiet?
- He skipped Ji Hyo.

49
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,430
- Captain.
- Captain.

50
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,530
(She's the real captain.)

51
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,370
- Captain?
- There, there.

52
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,790
- Okay.
- Yes, Captain.

53
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,590
(She's on another level.)

54
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,670
Ji Hyo hasn't shown
what she's got yet.

55
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,430
- Once she opens up...
- She will be unbelievable.

56
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,430
- I agree.
- Ji Hyo is a little short and...

57
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,810
- Why are you standing there?
- I'm not like you guys.

58
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,280
- Come here.
- I'm not that bad.

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,150
- You're the last here.
- Seriously.

60
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,150
It's just like hyeongseoljigong.

61
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,260
- You still don't know what it is.
- I'm going.

62
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,390
(He tries to change the subject.)

63
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,650
- Come over here.
- I'm coming.

64
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,560
- This seems right.
- Bye.

65
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,590
- I know it now.
- Okay.

66
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,030
So today, we are going
to have special guests...

67
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,870
who showed off their intelligence
playing detectives.

68
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,270
- Detectives?
- Are they detectives?

69
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,270
Please come on out.

70
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,560
- Detectives?
- Who's here?

71
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,810
(What 4 actors had detective roles?)

72
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,770
- Did they play detective roles?
- My gosh.

73
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,340
It's Yeon Joo.

74
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,340
My gosh.

75
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,150
(She showed her intellectual beauty
playing a detective in "Cheo Yong".)

76
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,050
(As a member of Mensa, she takes
part in the quiz competition.)

77
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,360
Hello.

78
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,380
(She's acknowledged to be the best
detective. Actress Park Hyo Ju)

79
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,150
(She played a charismatic detective
in "The Chaser" and "Triangle".)

80
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,370
(Hyo Ju is a professional actress
who plays many intelligent roles.)

81
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,660
- Oh, hello.
- My goodness.

82
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,870
(Actor Kwak Si Yang specialized
in playing detective roles)

83
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,710
(He played a homicide squad
inspector in "Welcome2Life".)

84
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,650
(He's loved in many dramas with
his good looks and touch charm.)

85
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,710
(And lastly...)

86
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,650
- That's Yi Kyung.
- What's going on?

87
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,650
What?

88
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,650
- It's Yi Kyung.
- Hello.

89
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,960
(From the movie, "Hitman")

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,120
(Actor Lee Yi Kyung who played
a wiry detective in "Hitman".)

91
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

92
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,960
- Please stand in the middle.
- Please come over here.

93
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,270
You're not a detective.
You're a criminal.

94
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,160
Don't act like you two
are close friends.

95
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,770
- We are close.
- Move over.

96
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,240
- Go over there.
- We really are.

97
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,870
I'm close with Yi Kyung.

98
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,370
- I see.
- We're close.

99
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,900
Let me introduce them one by one.

100
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,580
First, please introduce yourself.

101
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,520
Hello, I'm Park Hyo Ju.
Nice to meet you.

102
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,410
She looks like a real detective.

103
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,310
I know. A righteous detective.

104
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,020
She's an actress with 20 years of
experience. She prepared something.

105
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,020
It's not that I prepared it.

106
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,750
She will show us her salsa dance
that she learned in Cuba.

107
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,560
- Salsa dance?
- My gosh. Salsa?

108
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,150
- I've never seen it before.
- From Cuba.

109
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,370
She learned it from a human
cultural asset of Cuba.

110
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,830
- Yes.
- Really?

111
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,870
- My goodness.
- This is my first time to see it.

112
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,060
In Cuba?

113
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,370
- Cuba.
- My gosh.

114
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,030
I like the song.

115
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,680
- Oh dear.
- Senorita.

116
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,810
(Her calm and confident face
shows the vibes of Cuba.)

117
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,940
(The intro reminds her
of the dance lesson from Cuba.)

118
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,750
(They all are excited
to see her get ready.)

119
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,550
Havana.

120
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,060
Havana.

121
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,150
Havana.

122
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,160
(What?)

123
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,520
- It's a little strange.
- Isn't it Jae Suk's move?

124
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,760
Isn't this what Jae Suk does?

125
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,970
Did you learn this in Cuba?

126
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,240
Why did you go all the way
to Cuba to learn this?

127
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,370
- Hyo Ju. Hang on.
- Look at her.

128
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,260
Hyo Ju, wait.

129
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,680
- I just don't get it.
- Hang on. I'm so surprised.

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,770
It looks strange.

131
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,770
Wait. Hang on a second.

132
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,620
Please stop the music.

133
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,310
Hang on. I'm so surprised...

134
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,720
that I called her Han Hyo Ju
and Go Hyo Ju.

135
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,850
Is this the Cuban style?

136
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,660
Did she lie about Cuba?

137
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,060
Salsa is all about enlightenment.

138
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,320
When I danced salsa in Cuba,

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,660
I was told to open up my mind.

140
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,320
It's us who can't open up.

141
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,260
- We're supposed to open our minds.
- It's shut tight.

142
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,560
She's even worse than you, Jae Suk.

143
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,170
You were even worse than me.

144
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,670
- I just don't get it.
- Give her a big hand anyway.

145
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,610
- It's the Cuban style salsa.
- She's good though.

146
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,050
All right. Yeon Joo,
please introduce yourself.

147
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,870
Hello, I'm Ha Yeon Joo.

148
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,510
- Ha Yeon Joo.
- Her last name is Ha too.

149
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,880
Let me tell you a bit
about Yeon Joo's filmography.

150
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,230
In 2016, she played the passionate
detective in "The Ghost-Seeing..."

151
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,500
- "Detective Cheo Yong 2".
- That's right.

152
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,800
In 2014, on the game show,
"The Genius: Black Garnet"...

153
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,120
You were on that show?

154
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,540
How far did you go?

155
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,330
- I went pretty far.
- Aren't you a member of Mensa?

156
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,760
I am.

157
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,370
- You are?
- Really?

158
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,500
What's your IQ score?

159
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,110
It's a little over 150,
but I don't remember exactly.

160
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,310
Haha's height is
a little over 150cm.

161
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,750
All of a sudden?

162
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,880
(Haha's height and Yeon Joo's IQ
are both a little over 150.)

163
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,510
We have something in common.

164
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,950
- Yeon Joo was in my debut sitcom.
- That's right.

165
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,160
(So what?)

166
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,990
What's with your face?

167
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,560
- Did I say something wrong?
- Kwang Soo...

168
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,450
No one seems to remember
working with Kwang Soo.

169
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,670
I'm sure she does.

170
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,820
- I do.
- She does.

171
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,470
- Do you remember it?
- Of course.

172
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,540
- Really?
- He liked me and chased me.

173
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,060
- Really?
- She means, in the sitcom.

174
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,200
- In real life?
- In the sitcom.

175
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,910
Not in real life.
Just in the sitcom.

176
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,480
- I get it now.
- Gosh.

177
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,000
- I get it.
- Just in the sitcom.

178
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,870
I mean, just in the sitcom.

179
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,310
Next up is...

180
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,440
- Kwak Si Yang.
- It's been a while.

181
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,640
- That's right.
- I almost didn't recognize him.

182
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,310
Does playing a detective
come naturally to you?

183
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,730
No, I struggle a lot.

184
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,250
- Why?
- You have to think a lot.

185
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,470
- You have to look sharp too.
- Okay.

186
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,130
Which of us do you think would be
best at playing a detective?

187
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,370
(Who looks like a detective
to Si Yang?)

188
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,470
- Jong Kook totally looks like one.
- Jong Kook...

189
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,810
Jong Kook would make...

190
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,240
- a really good detective.
- He'd be good at it.

191
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,310
- The Violent Crimes Unit.
- Seriously...

192
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,500
Who looks like a petty offender?

193
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,270
- A petty offender...
- An extremely petty offender.

194
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,750
- There are many candidates.
- This can hurt your pride.

195
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,310
I'd rather be a financial offender.

196
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,290
There's someone who would be
good at playing such a role.

197
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,730
- Who?
- Kwang Soo.

198
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,380
I've played a police officer.

199
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,950
- Please show us.
- I've played a police officer.

200
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,430
Please pretend
you just got arrested.

201
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,620
Si Yang.

202
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,060
- You're being interrogated.
- What's your name?

203
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,300
- What did you do?
- Pardon?

204
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,000
- What is it?
- What?

205
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,560
- What are you here for?
- What do you mean?

206
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,000
I just made a little mistake.

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,310
You punk.

208
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,140
(You punk.)

209
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,920
(What was that?)

210
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,120
It suits you.

211
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,490
He didn't hit you hard.

212
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,290
- He's only a petty offender.
- He didn't hit you hard.

213
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,930
- It's just that I feel offended.
- Exactly.

214
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,320
Also, I thought he swore at me.
Am I just imagining it?

215
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
He's so good.

216
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,040
Next up is Lee Yi Kyung.

217
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,240
(Another actor known for
his detective roles)

218
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,060
- Hello.
- Our friend, Yi Kyung.

219
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,310
"Leave Work on Time".

220
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,310
You just released a trot album...

221
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,770
- Really?
- recently.

222
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,980
You sing trot?

223
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,770
- What's the name of the song?
- "Leave Work on Time".

224
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,870
"Leave Work on Time".

225
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,850
Let's hear "Leave Work on Time".

226
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,080
Just play it from any part.

227
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,990
(We're having a team dinner today)

228
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,160
Let's go!

229
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,180
(His powerful voice raises
the audience's expectations.)

230
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,120
(Team dinners are the worst)

231
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,470
(What is that?)

232
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,100
(Jumping)

233
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,870
(I can't watch this.)

234
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,200
- Let me come to work late
- Stop laughing.

235
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,910
(He obviously can't stand
team dinners.)

236
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,070
(I want to go home)

237
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,410
(He continues singing the chorus.)

238
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,220
(He glances at the audience.)

239
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,780
(I can't stand this.)

240
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,230
(Straightforward lyrics,
cute dance moves, and a shy charm)

241
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,520
- This song...
- Thank you.

242
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,020
His boss obviously wanted to have
some fun.

243
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,620
When his shoulders
moved up and down...

244
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,790
Why do I feel embarrassed?

245
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,870
(His shy shoulder movements
are burned into everyone's mind.)

246
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,630
Why did you feel shy doing this?

247
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,900
Yi Kyung's face turned red.

248
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,740
Let's give it up
for our four guests.

249
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,670
Our detectives.

250
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,010
Today's race is Running Man
Quiz for the Ultimate Winner.

251
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,410
After 4 rounds of quizzes,
the top 5 will receive prizes...

252
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,120
according to their places.

253
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
- The top five?
- That's easy.

254
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,220
- That's no problem.
- But...

255
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,120
there are
three illegal participants...

256
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,750
who know the answers
to all the questions.

257
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,420
- Three?
- So many?

258
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,520
They know the answers?

259
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,660
The illegal participants will win
if two or more of them...

260
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,630
end up in the top five.

261
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,900
(The illegal participants win if
2 or more of them make the top 5.)

262
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,080
If any of them survive
the final vote,

263
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,770
- they win the race,
- Any of them?

264
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,580
and all the prizes will be theirs.

265
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,080
If all of them are caught,

266
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,320
the prizes go to the top five
excluding the illegal participants.

267
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,950
- We have to catch all of them.
- Even if you know the answers,

268
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,050
- you should pretend you don't.
- You shouldn't show it.

269
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,050
There is a reason why we have actors
who have played detectives here.

270
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,550
After each round,

271
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,520
the person in sixth place
becomes a detective...

272
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,420
and gets to arrest a suspicious one.

273
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,470
If an illegal participant
ends up in sixth place,

274
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,740
he or she may try to arrest
someone innocent.

275
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,110
- They'll try to be in sixth place.
- Right.

276
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,900
- Sixth place?
- Sixth place.

277
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,750
Sixth place?

278
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,400
Since we haven't played
any quizzes yet,

279
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,640
we'll play a simple game
to decide the detective.

280
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,280
Pick one person, and that person
will pick another person, and so on.

281
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,490
The sixth person chosen
becomes the detective.

282
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,190
- Can you be chosen multiple times?
- Yes.

283
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,420
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Like that.

284
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,490
One.

285
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,120
Two.

286
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,230
Three.

287
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,360
Four.

288
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,420
Five.

289
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,790
- If he is a criminal...
- The person he chooses...

290
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,130
- If he is, he'll choose Suk Jin.
- Exactly.

291
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,800
Depending on who he chooses...

292
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,440
That person becomes
the detective, right?

293
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,040
If he is a criminal,
he'd choose another criminal, right?

294
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,540
- Six.
- That's right.

295
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,540
- Yi Kyung?
- That's suspicious.

296
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,820
- We found one.
- Yi Kyung...

297
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,590
- Yi Kyung...
- Yi Kyung is the first detective.

298
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,050
Put this badge on
and carry these handcuffs.

299
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,280
(After the round, the detective
gets to arrest 1 person.)

300
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,020
I'm familiar with handcuffs.

301
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,390
Please go change
so we can start the mission.

302
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,460
- Okay.
- Okay!

303
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,260
What's this?

304
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,160
Is it some kind of test?

305
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,610
Everyone.

306
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,370
Welcome to the Running Man Quiz
for the Ultimate Winner.

307
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,580
Gosh.

308
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,800
The first game is...

309
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,370
Write What You Hear.

310
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,820
- Is it dictation?
- That's hard.

311
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,140
(Write What You Hear)

312
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,480
Dictation is no problem.

313
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,880
- It's my specialty.
- Dictation is hard.

314
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,990
It's no problem.

315
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,550
There are two rounds,

316
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,090
which will be played
by 5 and 6 players respectively.

317
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,960
The first round is...

318
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,600
foreign children's song dictation.

319
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,230
- In English?
- Foreign children's songs?

320
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,660
- What?
- In English?

321
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,330
- How could we do that?
- We have to write in English?

322
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,500
Listen to a foreign children's song,

323
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,260
and write down as many English words
as you hear.

324
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,530
- It'll be easy for Yeon Joo.
- She'll hear everything.

325
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,870
- No, I'm not. Me?
- You're good at English, right?

326
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,450
She speaks other languages too.

327
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,110
- Really?
- How many?

328
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,370
I speak a bit of Chinese.

329
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,250
- Chinese?
- English, Chinese...

330
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,490
English, Chinese, Korean...
That's incredible.

331
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,910
I know a bit of Ancient Greek
as well.

332
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,590
(Ancient Greek
in addition to the 3 languages?)

333
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,190
I know a bit of Ancient Greek
as well.

334
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,490
- What's that?
- What?

335
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,860
- Is that a language?
- Why would you learn that?

336
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,250
How do you say hello
in Ancient Greek?

337
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,860
- What's the point?
- Why would you learn that?

338
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,970
How do you say thank you
in Ancient Greek?

339
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,740
I actually don't know.

340
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,030
Then what do you know?

341
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,110
(Shocked)

342
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,400
- What do you know?
- Isn't that the most basic thing?

343
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,000
- "Thank you..."
- Can you say hello then?

344
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,530
Shouldn't you be able to
at least say thank you?

345
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,710
What do you know then?

346
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,950
Seriously...

347
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,670
(She is trying to remember
how to say thank you.)

348
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,010
I know a really funny expression.

349
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,140
She shouldn't really say
she knows Ancient Greek, should she?

350
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,380
I know it, I swear.

351
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,860
Let's try English then.

352
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,280
Do you know how to say thank you?

353
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,780
(Can you say thank you
in English?)

354
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,960
You're starting to doubt her?

355
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,500
- You're being mean.
- Try Chinese too.

356
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,620
At least I know
she is a member of Mensa.

357
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,630
I still don't completely believe...

358
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,070
she knows Ancient Greek.

359
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,030
How could we write down the lyrics
of a foreign song?

360
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,440
A children's song can't be
that hard.

361
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,140
We picked a song
loved by preschoolers.

362
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,140
That hurts my pride.

363
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,820
Please don't say that.

364
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,140
Since you have kids...

365
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,490
- Don't say that.
- All right.

366
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,780
Gosh.

367
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,120
- Here's the first question.
- Okay.

368
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,550
(The first song starts.)

369
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,700
(Listening)

370
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,940
(They're to write down
as many English words as they hear.)

371
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,470
- What?
- They all look so serious.

372
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,740
(They all look serious.)

373
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,110
(From the Mensa member
to Ji Ho's dad, everyone frowns.)

374
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,450
- Gosh.
- What?

375
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,170
- How could we do this?
- I've never heard this song before.

376
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,170
This song is for preschoolers?

377
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,690
They must be so smart.

378
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,120
- He mumbles too much.
- Do you want to hear it again?

379
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,360
Yes, please.

380
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,190
- I can see they wrote many words.
- The song is too fast.

381
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,620
(The song starts playing again.)

382
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,760
(However, their hands...)

383
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,660
(aren't moving so much.)

384
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,530
What is he saying?

385
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,240
Is this really English?

386
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,270
- 1, 2, 3.
- I have no idea.

387
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,710
I think he said, "thumb."

388
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,640
I heard "kissing" too.

389
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,370
- Right. I heard it too.
- And then...

390
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,580
I heard "sing" too.

391
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,250
"Sing."

392
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,690
I heard "bro" too.

393
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,850
"Bro"?

394
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,380
- You heard "bro"?
- Is he in a gang?

395
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,730
I'm pretty sure I heard,
"What's up, bro?"

396
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,600
Haha is amazing.

397
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,790
"Scroll down by to home..."

398
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,470
"Do... My mother was say..."

399
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,870
It should be, "was saying."

400
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,100
"My mother..." What?

401
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,610
Gosh, he's annoying.

402
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,470
You heard "was"?

403
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,630
<i>"My mother was saying..."</i>

404
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,750
- It's hard to hear "was."
- I didn't hear it.

405
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,270
I'm getting suspicious.

406
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,580
I didn't hear "was" once,

407
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,590
but that's grammatically correct.
I'm wondering how you heard that.

408
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,410
- I just tried to make a sentence.
- Okay.

409
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,380
It's hard.

410
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,020
Can we see the lyrics?

411
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,490
It was too hard.

412
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,520
<i>"Down by the bay"</i>

413
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,750
It was "bay"?

414
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,870
It was "grow"?

415
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,570
<i>"I dare not go"</i>

416
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,760
<i>- "For if I do"</i>
- I hear it now.

417
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,370
(It wasn't "was".)

418
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,500
It was "will", not "was".

419
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,850
The words in this song
weren't that easy.

420
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,720
- This wasn't easy.
- Down by the bay?

421
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,050
- Preschoolers know this?
- Preschoolers know this song?

422
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,380
I won't be ashamed
for not knowing this.

423
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,730
What do I do?
My English is terrible.

424
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,020
Guys, don't forget...

425
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,390
that three among you
have already memorized the lyrics.

426
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,530
- All of it?
- When?

427
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,760
Yes, all of it.
We gave it to them this morning.

428
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,940
Hold on a second.

429
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,030
No one seemed like
they had memorized the lyrics.

430
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,040
I didn't get that feeling
from anyone either.

431
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,140
- Kwang Soo wrote a lot.
- It definitely isn't me.

432
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,350
- Here's the second song.
- Bring it on.

433
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,410
What? What's this?

434
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,460
(After an upbeat intro... What?)

435
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,750
I have never heard
a song like this before.

436
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,730
Is this English?

437
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,620
- Hold on.
- What?

438
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,260
(Shadows are cast on their faces.)

439
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,740
Why is he singing like a cheeky boy?

440
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,800
The original song is
"London Bridge Is Falling Down".

441
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,240
Quiet.

442
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,400
(The cheeky version
of "Jungle Jive" is over.)

443
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,140
That was easier than our song.

444
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,640
- But...
- I like ours more.

445
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,850
Why does Se Chan
have hieroglyphics written down?

446
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,540
He's worse than I thought.

447
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,190
He wrote "U" for "woo".

448
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,250
- Here.
- Tell us about what you wrote.

449
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,290
- Sure.
- I heard the "woo" part.

450
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,250
At least that's worth some points.

451
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,020
To the jungle.

452
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,330
There's no N in jungle.

453
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,000
It sounds like "Do you want to die"
in Korean.

454
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,130
J, U, G, L, E. Jungle.

455
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,170
- No, that's Jugle.
- Jugle.

456
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,080
"Do you have a death wish?"

457
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,950
I also heard "swell".

458
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,640
(Are you sure
we heard the same song?)

459
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,950
- Swell?
- That's what I heard. Swell!

460
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,280
The words Si Yang wrote
don't form a sentence.

461
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,410
I only wrote down
the words I could hear.

462
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,910
I, can, do, boom,

463
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,490
woo, and come.

464
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,520
He...

465
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,700
(He's lost for words.)

466
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,820
Is that the best you can do?

467
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,230
There's no way he's the criminal.

468
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,290
Hold on.

469
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,090
Someone did even worse than I did?

470
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,640
Whoever suspects Si Yang
will answer to me.

471
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,640
- He can't be the criminal.
- Hey.

472
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,940
- Anyone else...
- It can't be him.

473
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,100
- Ji Hyo, you're up next.
- I'm not sure about this.

474
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,440
Can to the...

475
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,410
I mean, "Come to the".

476
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,880
I can do the blank say...

477
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,450
Ji Hyo wrote down a lot
considering how she normally is.

478
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,720
I agree.

479
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,080
But this isn't even much.

480
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,350
(It's suspicious for the members
to know even a few words.)

481
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,890
I know this song because
I have a four-year-old at home.

482
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,400
(Hyo Ju knows the song?)

483
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,320
(Hyo Ju says she knows the song
thanks to her toddler.)

484
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,590
- You know the song?
- It's not one I know though.

485
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,740
No one can possibly know this song.

486
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,790
"Come and do the..." What's that?

487
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,640
(She knows the melody.)

488
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,670
- What's that?
- Jungle jive.

489
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,530
- Jive?
- Yes.

490
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,880
- That wasn't an easy word.
- It's Hyo Ju.

491
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,710
<i>Come and do the jungle jive</i>

492
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,250
- That I know.
- How did she know that?

493
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,540
- The following lyrics though...
- Hold on.

494
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,980
Hyo Ju, I'm sorry,

495
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,690
but Detective Lee
is already suspicious.

496
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,550
Before she showed us what she wrote,

497
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,420
I said I was suspicious of her.

498
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,320
The others wrote it down
while listening to the song,

499
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
- but she was thinking.
- As if to remember the lyrics.

500
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,400
Because she memorized them?

501
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,520
(Instead of listening,)

502
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,000
(she was trying to remember
what she memorized?)

503
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,900
It's because
I already knew the song.

504
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,360
- We'll know by seeing the footage.
- Busted.

505
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,380
Here's the result
for the first round.

506
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
- I'm suddenly nervous.
- Me too.

507
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,600
We need to be
in the top five, right?

508
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,510
And the one in sixth place
will be the detective.

509
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,040
- Right, the detective.
- Let me reveal the scores.

510
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,080
Haha received 110 points.

511
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,310
- That's quite high.
- Really?

512
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,110
You get 10 points
for every correct word.

513
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,580
- My gosh.
- He got 11 right?

514
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,490
110 points seem like a high score.

515
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,960
Jae Suk has 100 points.

516
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,090
- You beat Jaek Seok?
- No way.

517
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,630
- What?
- Something fishy's going on.

518
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,590
- But...
- This can't be right.

519
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,590
No way.

520
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,790
- Haha answered one more correctly.
- I got 110 points.

521
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,240
That puts him in first place.

522
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Yi Kyung received 130 points.

523
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,330
What?

524
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,830
- Isn't that a higher score?
- I'm suspicious of him.

525
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,330
A total of 130 points isn't
really a high score either.

526
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,040
Yeon Joo has 140 points.

527
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,750
Is 140 points the best you could do?

528
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,770
(How can someone in Mensa
only receive 140 points?)

529
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,990
Kwang Soo received 130 points.

530
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,040
(Even Kwang Soo scored 130 points.)

531
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,010
Hold on a second. Seriously?

532
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,780
We...

533
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,250
- Seriously?
- Hold on.

534
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,890
They must be the criminals!

535
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,730
- Get them all.
- I got 130 points?

536
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,900
I scored only 10 points below
someone in Mensa?

537
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,260
This is absurd.

538
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,030
- I got the lowest score?
- He only has 100 points.

539
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,440
Let's move on to the next five.

540
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,410
Se Chan received 40 points.

541
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,330
You at least got some of it right.

542
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,680
Suk Jin has 40 points.

543
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,180
(Suk Jin also got 40 points
even though he jeered at Se Chan.)

544
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,270
(We have the same score!)

545
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,570
We have the same score!

546
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,840
Si Yang received 50 points.

547
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,010
- Take that.
- But...

548
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,490
(Am I truly as stupid as they are?)

549
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,220
If only I wrote one more word.

550
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,250
Ji Hyo received 60 points.

551
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,630
- What?
- No way.

552
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,250
She received a high score.

553
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,560
Jong Kook has 90 points
while Hyo Ju has 110.

554
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,290
(Jong Kook 90 points,
Hyo Ju 110 points)

555
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,090
Next, you will write down...

556
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,030
a foreigner reading Korean.

557
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,060
(Writing down Korean lines
spoken by a foreigner)

558
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,100
What was that again?

559
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,440
We'll be writing down
a foreigner reading Korean.

560
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,480
Listen to the Korean
said by the non-Korean actor...

561
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,040
and write down the words.

562
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,150
You will be ranked depending on...

563
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,770
how close your answer is.

564
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,540
Those who know the answer...

565
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,580
definitely will have
a leg-up in this round.

566
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,810
Of course. Or someone
who saw that movie.

567
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,490
We'll play the movie and
you'll write down the sentence...

568
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,630
that comes after the countdown.

569
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,960
After the countdown?

570
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,430
Yes, this is way easier.

571
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,320
Here's the first quiz.

572
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,000
Cue.

573
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,470
(Sophia,)

574
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,830
(they are my rich friends
from Nairobi.)

575
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,300
(They're quite decent.)

576
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,450
- 3, 2, 1.
- What?

577
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,500
Was that a sentence?

578
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,010
(What on earth is she saying?)

579
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,520
- All right.
- That's the quiz?

580
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,850
- Was that Korean?
- Yes.

581
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,000
- That was Korean?
- Liar.

582
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,250
- How...
- How was that Korean?

583
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,630
- They're supposed to guess that?
- It was all Korean.

584
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,320
- An American...
- Can we hear it again?

585
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,400
Sure, we'll play it again.

586
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,440
Please do.

587
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,140
Listen to what comes
after the countdown.

588
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,530
(Highly focused)

589
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,880
(The sentence is repeated.)

590
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,450
- What on earth was that?
- Together?

591
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,010
- You have 10 seconds.
- Was this Jessi?

592
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,780
(Sabidubidubi dubidaduba?)

593
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,010
That's what I heard.

594
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,050
Hey, write
"Sabidubidubi dubidaduba."

595
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,280
Is it "sabidu" or "dubisa"?

596
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,390
- Sabidu?
- Yes.

597
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,020
(The first quiz is hard to crack.)

598
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
I'm clueless.

599
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,200
Show us your answer. Five...

600
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,760
Didn't she say,
"Where are you going?"

601
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,530
Kwang Soo, I'm sure it's hard
to remember what you memorized.

602
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,700
- What are you talking about?
- Ji Hyo, show us your answer.

603
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,330
- Friends?
- What do you think?

604
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,600
Only an illegal participant
would get this right.

605
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,270
(What's the answer?
Is there a criminal among them?)

606
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,570
Are your friends rich, like you?

607
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,450
Where are you going?
It's the same, right?

608
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,110
- Si Yang?
- Do they like SEVENTEEN?

609
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,580
Do they like SEVENTEEN? Like you?

610
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,630
- What?
- SEVENTEEN?

611
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,190
- Do they like SEVENTEEN?
- SEVENTEEN?

612
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,550
SEVENTEEN?

613
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,260
Blank that likes to wreak havoc.

614
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,590
Together?

615
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,790
- Wreak havoc?
- That likes to wreak havoc?

616
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,400
If that's correct, then...

617
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,440
(They're suspicious of Ji Hyo.)

618
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,740
They're all rich? Really?

619
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,910
I don't have a clue.

620
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,180
I guessed the rich part
since that's what was mentioned.

621
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,910
- Let me show you the answer.
- Sure.

622
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,180
(So what's the answer?)

623
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,540
They like to wreak havoc?

624
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,540
Like you?

625
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,660
(From the movie "Black Panther")

626
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,850
(No way!)

627
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,660
The scene was from
the movie "Black Panther".

628
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,700
I see.

629
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,860
There was such a line?

630
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,740
That one wasn't easy.

631
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,900
But Ji Hyo...

632
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,000
Who wrote "wreak havoc"?

633
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,300
- But I heard it.
- "They like to wreak havoc?"

634
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,710
- You heard that?
- How can one hear that?

635
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,450
- What?
- No way.

636
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,040
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's absurd.

637
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,540
Ji Hyo really heard that?

638
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,570
That doesn't make sense.

639
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,920
Detective, you have your culprit.

640
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,750
- She heard that part?
- "They like to wreak havoc?"

641
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,190
But I heard it clearly.

642
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,610
Fine, think as you wish,

643
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,460
- but I definitely heard it.
- You're the illegal participant.

644
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,960
Okay, we're next.

645
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
- This...
- That was absurd.

646
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,290
I'm not kidding though.

647
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,460
- But...
- I heard it.

648
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,700
Be careful not to fall for the trap.

649
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,030
Just so you know,
I can hear this quite clearly...

650
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,740
because I had a lot of friends
who spoke like this in Dongducheon.

651
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,800
Yes, of course.

652
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,740
Se Chan's from Dongducheon.

653
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,140
- It's why it's easier for me.
- Right.

654
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,980
There's not much of
a lead-in this time.

655
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,180
You'll hear it almost straight away.

656
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,040
(Yes, Father.)

657
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,080
- What was that?
- "Yes, Father."

658
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,430
(They prick up their ears.)

659
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,490
(Whispering)

660
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,930
Can you guys be quiet?

661
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,170
I couldn't hear the last word.

662
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,400
Ji Hyo whispered this in my ear.

663
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,240
"Okonomiyaki is to die for."

664
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,330
(Okonomiyaki is to die for.)

665
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,330
Please lift your boards.

666
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,800
I couldn't hear the last word.

667
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,240
(They're about to reveal
what they wrote.)

668
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,530
I couldn't hear the last word.

669
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,650
I couldn't hear it either.

670
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,380
- I couldn't hear the last word.
- I wrote what I heard though.

671
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,110
(What's the correct answer?)

672
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,490
- It all depends on the last part.
- Right.

673
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,420
- I'll reveal the answer.
- It was easy.

674
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,920
Yes, Father.

675
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,250
What's going on?
We're five minutes out.

676
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,400
(From the movie
"007: Die Another Day")

677
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,700
- What?
- We're five minutes out.

678
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,030
No way.

679
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,530
How can one even guess that?

680
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,470
- They all got it wrong.
- What?

681
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,030
- Five minutes...
- I heard "Who's the jerk".

682
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,180
We can hear it easily...

683
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,540
- when it's written down though.
- Tell me about it!

684
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,070
I could hear every single word.

685
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,650
It was as clear as day.

686
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,810
I know.

687
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,750
His pronunciation is perfect.

688
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,220
It was from the movie
"007: Die Another Day".

689
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,580
(No one got close
to the answer this time.)

690
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,230
I don't think there's
a criminal among them.

691
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,930
- No one's an illegal participant.
- No, not in this group.

692
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,590
- So the 3 are here?
- 3 out of the 6 of us?

693
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,630
All the criminals are on that side.

694
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,560
Some of them
could've deliberately got it wrong.

695
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,760
- No way.
- Most of them have high scores.

696
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,830
- Hear me out.
- Why would we...

697
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,860
deliberately get it wrong?

698
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,980
Not one of us wrote down
"We're five minutes out."

699
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,650
- By the way...
- But they have to get sixth place.

700
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,880
Why would they make a mistake
on purpose though?

701
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,250
Out of us...

702
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,570
I'm suspicious of Ji Hyo.

703
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,610
It's not me.

704
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,150
This is fun.

705
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,810
- This is fun.
- It is.

706
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,280
Here's the third question.

707
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,490
I'll get it right this time.

708
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,130
I sit here...

709
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,700
all day and watch people...

710
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,230
- get engaged and married.
- Her pronunciation is accurate.

711
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,320
She sounds Korean.

712
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,670
What about me? What about Su Mi?

713
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,590
When is it my turn?

714
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,300
I understand now.

715
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,600
You'll hear good news soon too.

716
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,000
3, 2, 1.

717
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,920
- What?
- What?

718
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,960
- What just happened?
- What was that?

719
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,050
(What just happened?)

720
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,930
Why can't he speak?

721
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,190
Wasn't that French at the end?

722
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,400
What happened?

723
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,550
He was speaking well before.

724
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,700
What just happened?

725
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,290
This is so wrong.

726
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,740
- Did he do that on purpose?
- What was that?

727
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,400
I can't even read this.

728
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,760
They want us to die.

729
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,140
- Write.
- Enough.

730
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,140
If you get this right,

731
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,240
you're the criminal.

732
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,330
He did that on purpose.

733
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,300
Criminals, be careful.

734
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:31,490
(Try to guess.)

735
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,930
Show me your answers.

736
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,660
- Lift it.
- I'm suspicious of Ji Hyo.

737
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,930
- She wrote a lot.
- She did.

738
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,500
Why is she so good?

739
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,130
Ji Hyo.

740
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,360
- Let's see hers.
- She's good.

741
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,090
Here.

742
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,240
- "Guess..."
- "Guess..." I mean...

743
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,210
- "Guess with me."
- "Guess with me."

744
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,070
"Stay here."

745
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,710
"I'll do something."

746
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,000
- "I'll do something."
- "I'll do something."

747
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,600
- What?
- "I'll do something."

748
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,040
That's what I heard.
"I'll do something."

749
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,720
- Kwang Soo?
- Can you copy his voice?

750
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,340
- Kwang Soo?
- "Write..."

751
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,490
"one with me."

752
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,610
"Rustling paddlelomy".

753
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,820
"Rustling"?

754
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,900
"I'll give you an enema."

755
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,930
("I'll give you an enema.")

756
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,900
(They can't believe it.)

757
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,200
An enema?

758
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,670
I...

759
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,210
- Hey.
- "I'll give you an enema."

760
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,140
"Meet up with me and write it down."

761
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,300
"I have a best friend
who's close to blue."

762
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,140
What? We don't understand you.

763
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,500
- I don't know.
- We don't understand.

764
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,500
- We don't understand.
- I'm not the criminal.

765
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,010
We don't understand you either.

766
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,890
All I heard is "Write it down."

767
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,190
"Write something down."

768
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,450
Are you kidding?

769
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
My bad. I couldn't hear anything.

770
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,390
- She earned all her points.
- She's nervous.

771
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,690
- This is fake.
- She's nervous.

772
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,850
I couldn't hear anything.
It was a foreigner.

773
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,290
- Jong Kook?
- "I came with a friend."

774
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,030
"He's my best friend."

775
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,500
- What?
- "He's my best friend."

776
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
"He really trusts me."

777
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,070
- He wrote that much?
- He could hear all those?

778
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,530
Isn't it "I'll give you an enema"?

779
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,250
He wrote that much?

780
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,150
You're acting strange.

781
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,610
It was "trust" at the end.

782
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,110
I'm curious. Let's see the answer.

783
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,390
Do you see this woman next to me?

784
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,280
She's my best friend's fiancee.

785
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,220
She hates me.

786
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,160
(Answer)

787
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,090
(From the movie "Yes Man")

788
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,900
She hates me.

789
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,400
How were we supposed to get that?

790
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,970
"She hates me."

791
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,000
- I heard it.
- He has a good pronunciation.

792
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,210
You can hear it.

793
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,030
Funny enough,
that's exactly what he said.

794
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,030
He was accurate.

795
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,740
This is Jim Carrey's line
from "Yes Man".

796
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,180
That was Jim Carrey?

797
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,150
It sounded like
"How's Jung Jun Ha?"

798
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,250
Combining scores
from the 1st and 2nd questions,

799
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,840
first place is Yeon Joo.

800
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,220
See?

801
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,490
Second place is Jae Suk.

802
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,110
Jae Suk is strange too.

803
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,930
Third place is Kwang Soo.

804
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,020
(Yeon Joo in 1st place,
Jae Suk in 2nd, Kwang Soo in 3rd)

805
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,490
(You're in 3rd place?)

806
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,290
- It's you, isn't it?
- Kwang Soo is third?

807
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,760
Okay, I understand
why you're doubting me.

808
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,700
- I was surprised too.
- Fourth place is Yi Kyung.

809
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,970
That hasn't changed.

810
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,470
Fifth place is Jong Kook,
Haha, and Suk Jin.

811
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,600
Haha?

812
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,710
This is insane.

813
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,830
Me out of nowhere?

814
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,240
- Haha.
- Really?

815
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,500
It's more odd that
Kwang Soo is third place.

816
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,680
I understand why you're
suspicious of me,

817
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,780
- but I guessed what I can.
- Fine.

818
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,990
Eighth place is Si Yang and Hyo Ju.

819
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,520
Tenth place is Ji Hyo and Se Chan.

820
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,890
Ji Hyo all of a sudden?

821
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,280
She fell behind all of a sudden.

822
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,250
Detective Yi Kyung,
you need to arrest somebody.

823
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,290
After discussing,

824
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,170
please put handcuffs on somebody,
and I'll tell you their identity.

825
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,590
- Yes!
- Please catch them.

826
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,410
- Catch 1 person.
- Let's start by catching 1.

827
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,710
Let's start by catching one.

828
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,240
(He's very cautious.)

829
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,570
First of all,

830
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,410
I'm most suspicious of Yeon Joo...
Jong Kook.

831
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,510
(Jong Kook?)

832
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,420
- Is that a mission?
- He's kind. How sweet.

833
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,950
- What's wrong with you?
- It was untied.

834
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,010
What a sweet guy.

835
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,720
So sweet.

836
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
(What a sweet guy.)

837
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,820
(He's shy.)

838
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,130
Go ahead.

839
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,130
(Nobody can stop him
from being sweet.)

840
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,320
I didn't expect it from this guy.

841
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,140
- Thanks.
- Sure.

842
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,700
(Thanks.)

843
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,910
There's one reason I picked Yeon Joo.

844
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,210
In comparison to
her tremendous resume and skills,

845
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,500
she only got 140 points.
She's 1st place,

846
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,610
but this is a low score.

847
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,250
- I agree.
- I object.

848
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,890
- Yes?
- I'm first place,

849
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,960
so there's no reason for me
to do bad.

850
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,220
- That's true.
- True.

851
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,960
She should have paced herself.

852
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,280
I'll pick the candidates,

853
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,000
- and let's do the majority vote...
- Sure.

854
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,290
among them. Okay.

855
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,820
First is Ji Hyo.

856
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,790
- She was odd.
- I agree.

857
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,790
(Candidate 1. Song Ji Hyo)

858
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,240
(She answered a question
nobody else got.)

859
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,140
Hyo Ju.

860
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,570
(Candidate 2. Park Hyo Ju)

861
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,070
I swear it's not me.

862
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:51,340
(She did well
on English children's song.)

863
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,580
I'm not sure about her,
but that's the general consensus,

864
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,580
so I pick Yeon Joo.

865
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:01,050
(Candidate 3. Ha Yeon Joo,
She could have earned high points.)

866
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,820
So I pick Yeon Joo.
It's 1 of those 3.

867
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,550
- I agree.
- Just the ladies?

868
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,700
Detective Yi Kyung,
please arrest the first criminal.

869
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,240
Can you give me one wrist?

870
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,560
- It's from those three?
- Everybody?

871
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,600
- You never know.
- You never know.

872
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,330
Yi Kyung.

873
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,800
I'm getting disappointed.

874
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,210
The criminal might have messed up.

875
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,770
- That's true.
- You did too well.

876
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,750
That's why I'm doubting you.

877
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,980
You're putting handcuffs on me?

878
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,950
I'm doubting you
because you did well.

879
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,340
- 1, 2...
- I only...

880
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,580
answered fair questions.

881
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,350
- Ji Hyo?
- It's not Ji Hyo.

882
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,190
(He arrests Ji Hyo!)

883
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,230
- It's not her.
- He arrested her.

884
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,400
- It's up to him.
- Gosh.

885
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,500
- Hey. You. What?
- It's not her.

886
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,400
- He's the illegal participant.
- It's you.

887
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,790
It's not Ji Hyo.

888
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,330
He's the illegal participant.

889
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,970
Ji Hyo? That came out of nowhere.

890
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,710
- You never know though.
- That's true.

891
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,500
- Detective Yi Kyung picked...
- We don't know what she is.

892
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,070
Ji Hyo. Let's check her identity.

893
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,010
- We don't know what she is.
- Please.

894
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,920
Ji Hyo...

895
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,780
is...

896
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:07,520
(Ji Hyo is...)

897
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
an illegal participant.

898
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,290
I got chills.

899
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,960
(Ji Hyo is an illegal participant.)

900
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,970
(He arrests Ji Hyo,
an illegal participant.)

901
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,000
Her English was too good
in the beginning.

902
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,830
This is the first Running Man Quiz
for the Ultimate Winner.

903
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,030
You're illegal participants who know
the answers to all questions.

904
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,330
English?

905
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,070
"She's my best friend's fiancee."

906
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,310
"She hates me."

907
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,010
This is so hard.

908
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,510
I couldn't hear it.

909
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,310
I can't believe it.

910
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,960
- Exactly.
- Detective Lee.

911
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,580
- That was incredible.
- How did you know?

912
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,780
But to be honest,

913
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,050
I didn't memorize anything.
I couldn't.

914
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,900
Please hand over
the detective badge and handcuffs...

915
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,820
- to Suk Jin.
- Okay.

916
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,470
- I'll keep playing. Okay.
- You can join.

917
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,060
You just need to get
within fifth place.

918
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,940
I'm telling you.
I'll get first place.

919
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,000
- Okay.
- I'll get first place.

920
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,710
- She got the answers,
- That's possible.

921
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,240
so she knows, but I want to see her
get questions wrong.

922
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,480
I'll memorize.

923
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,680
- I'm not sure if she can memorize.
- I'll memorize.

924
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,500
- That'd be more fun.
- I'm memorizing scripts these days.

925
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,770
Before the second quiz,

926
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,920
it's time for illegal participants
to memorize.

927
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,020
All of you will enter the
memorization room assigned to you.

928
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,930
So that's the memorization room.

929
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,700
This is where
the illegal participants...

930
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,900
will memorize answers
to the next quiz.

931
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,130
The rest of you will listen to music
with headphones on.

932
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,030
Please put your headphones on.

933
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,210
(Everybody enters
the memorization room.)

934
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,300
(Illegal participant 1 is relaxed.)

935
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,100
This is the answer.

936
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,140
(This is the answer.)

937
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,710
This song is always good.

938
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,880
I feel at ease because I got caught.

939
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,220
(Who are the other
2 illegal participants?)

940
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,160
Second quiz is called
Ranking Naggers.

941
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,850
"Ranking Naggers"?

942
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,750
We conducted a survey for
men and women in their 20s to 40s.

943
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,900
This?

944
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,230
So Min is good at this.

945
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,000
She's a dating expert.

946
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,140
Dating expert.

947
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,140
There's a topic for each round.

948
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,940
Guess number 1 to 4.

949
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,410
This is so difficult.

950
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,410
Since Suk Jin is the detective
for Round Two,

951
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,210
you can only speak
if he gives you the chance.

952
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,480
That's important too.

953
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,610
If somebody already takes
your answer, you can't say it. True.

954
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,340
Ji Hyo, did you study?

955
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,320
Of course. I saw the answers.

956
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm going to copy her.

957
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,260
- She really wants to spill it.
- Why?

958
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,360
- I want to speak.
- But...

959
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,190
- you know the answers.
- That's why.

960
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,690
I can't give you points.

961
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,190
But do I get a chance too?

962
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,400
You'll get your turn
at the very end.

963
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,500
Be patient.

964
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,300
You can't let her rise
from 10th place.

965
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,400
Right? You have to keep her there.

966
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,030
- Wait.
- Everybody,

967
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,510
here is the first question.

968
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,130
Top 5 things that make you upset
with your lover.

969
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,800
We need So Min for this.

970
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,670
Isn't it when you're sick?

971
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,320
- I'm sure.
- When I'm sick.

972
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
- When you need them.
- When they...

973
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,590
What do you think, Ji Hyo?

974
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,150
(What does illegal participant
Ji Hyo think?)

975
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,420
- I think...
- Listen to Ji Hyo.

976
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,630
when they care more about
somebody else.

977
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,760
- That's true.
- When they care about others?

978
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,300
That's when you feel upset.
That applies to this.

979
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,070
It's true though.

980
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,400
- But...
- I...

981
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,760
- But that...
- Wait, Suk Jin.

982
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,340
Ji Hyo was about to talk,
so let's listen to her.

983
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,340
Okay.

984
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,670
(Blinking)

985
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,030
- But...
- Please keep talking.

986
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,340
You were going to say something.

987
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,670
I forgot.

988
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,480
For goodness' sake, Suk Jin.

989
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,570
- Why did you do that?
- She was spilling information.

990
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,010
- I didn't say anything.
- It's all Suk Jin's fault.

991
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,380
You're the one who spoke the most.

992
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,860
- You should've listened to her.
- Taking care of someone.

993
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,760
She is trying to remember.

994
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,190
(She fails to remember anything.)

995
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,590
This one is childish,

996
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,760
but you become upset
with your lover...

997
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,260
- when the replies become short.
- Really?

998
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,960
- They become shorter.
- If they used to be longer...

999
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,760
- They become clipped.
- How about this?

1000
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,960
The lack of emojis.

1001
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,570
- Emojis?
- There are many things.

1002
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,940
- Some people don't use them.
- You become upset...

1003
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,760
when your lover doesn't use emojis.

1004
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,440
How do you feel when your lover
only replies with emojis?

1005
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,010
(Only emojis)

1006
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,250
The emojis would be like...

1007
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,710
"I am angry.
I will overturn the table."

1008
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,280
(That person doesn't want to have
a conversation.)

1009
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,690
I know the ones he is talking about!

1010
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,650
Let's say you asked,

1011
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,320
"How are you feeling?"

1012
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,820
(Completely unrelated)

1013
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,190
Adults do that.

1014
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,760
Every last text
Jae Suk sends me is...

1015
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,030
a series of strange emojis.

1016
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,800
It's completely unrelated
to the conversation.

1017
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,230
- He sends the bomb emoji...
- Really?

1018
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,260
- or the smiling face emoji.
- I often send Kwang Soo...

1019
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,130
- the angry face emoji.
- Yes.

1020
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,300
He sends me that last
regardless of what we have said.

1021
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,610
"See you tomorrow, Jae Suk."

1022
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,480
Then he suddenly sends
the angry face emoji.

1023
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,750
I reserve that emoji for two people,

1024
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,780
Sae Ho and Kwang Soo.

1025
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,380
I haven't received a single emoji
from him.

1026
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,590
With Suk Jin, I write words
in a businesslike tone.

1027
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,710
Emojis are for other people.

1028
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,860
With Kwang Soo, Sae Ho, and Se Chan,

1029
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,320
- I use the angry face emoji.
- The angry face emoji.

1030
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,130
You know,

1031
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,730
- there is something my wife hates.
- What?

1032
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,260
- Her name is Ryu Su Jung, right?
- Yes.

1033
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,690
Why are your palms so blue?

1034
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,690
- I touched these jeans.
- Did your wife cane your palms?

1035
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,130
- Why is the dye coming off so much?
- His palms are so blue.

1036
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,210
- Why is the dye coming off so much?
- It's because of my jeans.

1037
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,480
- Please be understanding.
- My goodness.

1038
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,610
- My jeans are really blue.
- I am worried about you.

1039
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,440
His blood doesn't reach his hands!

1040
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,320
I thought your palms were bruised.

1041
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,940
- You have Mongolian spots on palms.
- It's the color of my jeans.

1042
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,980
(Everyone worries about
Suk Jin's possible illness.)

1043
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,050
- Se Chan, what you think?
- Well,

1044
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,380
- lovers exchange gifts...
- That's right.

1045
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,420
- on an anniversary and such.
- Yes.

1046
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,590
If the man paid...

1047
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,000
this much...

1048
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,000
About 50 dollars?

1049
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,400
- Let's say he paid 50 dollars.
- Really?

1050
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,510
Then the gift receives
should cost 40 or 35 dollars.

1051
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,460
If it costs 20 or 10 dollars,
it's a bit upsetting.

1052
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,340
It's a bit upsetting.

1053
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,710
Isn't it great to receive
a handwritten letter?

1054
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,750
A handwritten letter is nice.

1055
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,150
- In exchange for this?
- A handwritten letter is nice.

1056
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,280
Still...

1057
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,090
I wouldn't be able to give
a nice reaction...

1058
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,280
if I received a handwritten letter
for a 50-dollar gift.

1059
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,050
It would make me ponder.

1060
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,650
"How did I receive
a handwritten letter?"

1061
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,500
That's so funny.

1062
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,760
If I receive a handwritten letter...

1063
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,500
- instead of a gift...
- It's a heartfelt gesture.

1064
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,730
That would be nice, but...

1065
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,300
We talked about
a lot of upsetting things.

1066
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,360
It's hard to determine
the top five things.

1067
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,710
Let's start from the bottom.

1068
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,530
10th place, Yang Se Chan.

1069
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,670
Everything we talked about
is plausible.

1070
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,380
- But people in their 20s and 30s...
- I bet we guessed some.

1071
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,550
Of course, we did.

1072
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,420
Let's say your lover
only looks at his or her phone.

1073
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,920
- That's right!
- That's the worst.

1074
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,820
- They only look at their phones.
- I know how it feels.

1075
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,690
- I will go with that one?
- Which one? The phone?

1076
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,650
When they meet you,
they only look at their phones.

1077
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,360
It must be on the list.

1078
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,420
(Se Chan intercepted
Jong Kook's answer.)

1079
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,730
(Will it be correct?)

1080
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,400
(Correct)

1081
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,210
I stole your answer.
What the ranking?

1082
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,980
- That's incredible.
- Top one?

1083
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,300
It's top one.

1084
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,380
(He got the top one item!)

1085
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,780
It's top one.

1086
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,300
- I should have said it.
- It didn't even occur to me.

1087
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,050
- I don't believe it.
- It makes sense.

1088
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,550
- Who brought it up?
- Jong Kook did.

1089
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,090
That's incredible.

1090
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,610
Jong Kook put it out there...

1091
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,730
and I got it right,
not an illegal participant.

1092
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,050
You receive 50 points.

1093
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,820
I gave him a big one.

1094
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,130
The second person to go...

1095
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,400
will be me.
I am not an illegal participant.

1096
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,360
- You said we will follow an order.
- I want to go next.

1097
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,360
- Why are you cutting in line?
- I want to go next.

1098
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,340
Hold on. You said we will move up
from the bottom.

1099
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,110
- You said we will follow an order.
- It's up to me.

1100
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,170
- It's true, but...
- Suk Jin is the absolute worst.

1101
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,340
Forgetting an anniversary.

1102
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,880
- That makes sense.
- It's bound to be in the top five.

1103
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,980
I don't know
if it's applicable to lovers.

1104
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,760
- Isn't it in the top five?
- No, it isn't.

1105
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,710
It isn't in the top five.
It isn't applicable to lovers.

1106
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,630
- Married couples do that.
- They forget an anniversary.

1107
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,630
Who is next?

1108
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,530
- I am suspicious of Jae Suk.
- I am not it.

1109
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,760
Jae Suk, I will give you a chance.

1110
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,130
They reply...

1111
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,300
too late.

1112
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
They replay too late?

1113
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,230
- Wait a second!
- Hold on.

1114
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
What do you think you are doing?

1115
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,110
They don't check their phones
when they go out.

1116
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,650
That's a good one.

1117
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,070
They don't check their phones
when they go out?

1118
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,440
No.

1119
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,880
Hold on.

1120
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
(You Quiz on the Break)

1121
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,190
What are you doing?

1122
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,360
- What are you doing?
- How many answers are you giving?

1123
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,090
It's just that
my thoughts aren't organized.

1124
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,480
Then don't go.

1125
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,590
- Let someone else go.
- Hold on.

1126
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,820
- Do you want to go next?
- Hold on.

1127
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,630
- Do you want to go next?
- I will go now.

1128
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,130
I think I know one.

1129
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,460
They don't check their phones
when they meet friends and such.

1130
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,670
Gosh, I thought it would be right.

1131
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,260
- There must be something similar.
- My goodness.

1132
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,900
Illegal participants,
aren't you going to make a move?

1133
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,150
Two illegal participants remain.
Aren't you going to make a move?

1134
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,300
Kwang Soo.

1135
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,010
There must be something
about keeping in touch.

1136
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,190
It's when they ignore texts.

1137
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,780
- It's when they reply late.
- Be quiet.

1138
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,260
They reply late.

1139
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,920
(Is it as Jae Suk said?)

1140
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,230
(Is it correct?)

1141
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,550
- I knew it.
- Okay!

1142
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,730
It's a guess though.

1143
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,960
By the way,

1144
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,190
why did Jae Suk give him
the answer?

1145
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,400
Why did you give him the answer?

1146
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,570
What is this?

1147
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,010
(Did Jae Suk give the answer
to avoid suspicion?)

1148
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,760
- What is this?
- He didn't mention the restroom.

1149
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,480
("Restroom" was
the important keyword.)

1150
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,400
Didn't someone mention
"Restroom" earlier?

1151
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
- Jong Kook did.
- That's...

1152
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,320
(When they were guessing
the answers earlier)

1153
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,340
(Don't you go to the restroom?)

1154
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,880
(Jong Kook mentioned "Restroom.")

1155
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,420
I got two answers right.

1156
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,610
He got the top 1 and 5.

1157
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,380
- Hold on. He got the top 1 and 5.
- Jong Kook.

1158
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,050
I simply made a guess.

1159
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,530
Jong Kook, you became...

1160
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,000
an illegal participant candidate.

1161
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,420
My goodness.

1162
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,500
He took out handcuffs.

1163
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,900
- Listen.
- Hey,

1164
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,230
- I just have...
- I was so surprised.

1165
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,710
a good hunch.

1166
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,860
- No way.
- No?

1167
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,300
I am not an illegal participant.

1168
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,210
We shouldn't give Ji Hyo a chance?

1169
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,250
I should still get a chance.
You can't skip me.

1170
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,650
We need to follow an order.

1171
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,150
She saw the answers.

1172
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,110
She saw the answers.

1173
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,320
I will go with...

1174
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,510
(It's a good chance for Ji Hyo
to move up places.)

1175
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,510
They...

1176
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,650
take better care of someone else.

1177
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,190
- Ji Hyo mentioned it earlier.
- It must be an answer.

1178
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,570
- Did she say an answer?
- It seems that way.

1179
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,730
- Isn't it an answer?
- Is it incorrect?

1180
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,170
It seems that way. Is it incorrect?

1181
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,340
What is going on?

1182
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,900
- What is up with her?
- What is up with her?

1183
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,030
(She is an illegal participant
who doesn't remember the answers.)

1184
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,110
- Hey.
- What is going on?

1185
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,530
- What is up with her?
- Is she a double agent?

1186
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,940
- What is up with her?
- How did I catch her earlier?

1187
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,110
Are you sure
you are an illegal participant?

1188
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,570
What kind of an illegal participant
is on the 10th place?

1189
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,280
Does she have a mission
within a mission?

1190
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,380
Didn't you give her the answers?

1191
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,690
You can get the answers right.

1192
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,380
(What is up with her?)

1193
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,550
The production crew
is incredulous.

1194
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,480
- What is going on?
- The producer became angry.

1195
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,420
Ji Hyo, what's going on?

1196
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,190
What's surprising is this.

1197
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,760
Some people have seen the answers.

1198
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,630
It wouldn't be strange
to get it right at this point.

1199
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,360
It wouldn't be strange, Kwang Soo.

1200
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,670
- I am not an illegal participant.
- Who saw the answers?

1201
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,010
Maybe they don't know the answers.

1202
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,110
Se Chan, you can go first.

1203
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,280
We are moving up from the bottom.

1204
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,070
Why do you keep letting
the bottom ones go first?

1205
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,440
The bottom ones should go first.
Se Chan.

1206
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,570
He keeps giving Se Chan a chance
because he won't get it right.

1207
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,050
Aren't you going to go?
Then someone else will go.

1208
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,170
- I will go.
- Pass.

1209
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,380
We can give Ji Hyo a chance.

1210
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,380
Ji Hyo, give us an answer.

1211
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,690
What?

1212
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,130
Ji Hyo, go ahead.

1213
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,980
- Go ahead.
- She won't get it right.

1214
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,690
- Ji Hyo doesn't remember.
- Her mind is blank.

1215
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,030
Ji Hyo doesn't remember.

1216
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,300
When you say "I love you"
and they answer halfheartedly.

1217
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,670
That can't be... What?

1218
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,860
Why did you give her a chance?

1219
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,900
(A big twist)

1220
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,110
She memorized the answers.

1221
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,960
Why did you give her a chance?

1222
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,630
She heard Yi Kyung's answer.

1223
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,840
When you say "I love you"
and they don't say it back.

1224
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,420
(She raised her hand
upon hearing Yi Kyung's words.)

1225
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,510
She heard Yi Kyung's answer.

1226
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,690
Did she hear Yi Kyung's answer?

1227
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,320
- I told Se Chan.
- I was going to say it,

1228
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,210
but you give Ji Hyo a chance.

1229
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,960
The police gave her a chance.

1230
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,460
You are a corrupt police officer.

1231
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,260
You should have told me
that you have an answer in mind.

1232
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,530
(After Ji Hyo got an answer right)

1233
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,570
When they don't introduce you
to their family.

1234
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,670
- That's right.
- Correct!

1235
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,710
Okay!

1236
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,730
When they don't side with you.

1237
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,110
Correct.

1238
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,440
(Kwang Soo gets the top 3 answer.)

1239
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,150
- I should handcuff him.
- I am not it!

1240
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,650
I am not it!

1241
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,840
- I should handcuff him.
- I am not it!

1242
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,250
It can't be helped.

1243
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,480
It's obvious.

1244
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,650
Kwang Soo is pretty suspicious.

1245
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,880
- It's you, right?
- I am not suspicious.

1246
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,050
I got the hints from the others.

1247
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,550
You should be apprehended
right away.

1248
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,260
- You should be put away.
- I know that I look suspicious.

1249
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,590
You will end up in prison.

1250
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,030
- Prison?
- This is...

1251
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,940
I have no choice
but to apprehend him.

1252
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,190
You are right.

1253
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,840
- He got 2 out of 5 answers right.
- When he told me...

1254
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,670
- about expressing emotions,
- That's right.

1255
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,940
I thought to myself,
"It's a really good one."

1256
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,380
- What?
- Massage my hand.

1257
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,750
For goodness' sake.

1258
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,550
He is strange.

1259
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,750
Why are you suddenly asking me
to massage your hand?

1260
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,840
Can't you just do it?

1261
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,940
Listen!

1262
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,380
Why would I massage your hand
when I am under fire?

1263
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,190
This is driving me crazy.

1264
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,550
(The first quiz ends.)

1265
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,030
The next one is...

1266
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,190
top 5 things women do
that mislead men.

1267
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,260
I know the answers.

1268
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,230
- I know the answers.
- I am 100 percent sure.

1269
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,860
This is...

1270
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,300
- I can give an answer right away.
- Me too.

1271
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,900
- Give me a chance.
- Aren't we going to talk first?

1272
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,230
- I will answer right away.
- Aren't we going to talk first?

1273
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,610
Give me a chance.
I will get it right.

1274
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,050
- Okay. Give it a go.
- Okay.

1275
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,980
You will blow your chance
if you don't get it right.

1276
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,010
When they laugh at your words.

1277
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,150
All right!

1278
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,940
(He gets a correct answer
right away.)

1279
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,420
- That one had to be up there.
- It goes without saying.

1280
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,050
- It's top 3.
- Top 3.

1281
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,320
That's right.

1282
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,730
It really misleads men.

1283
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,420
- I knew it would be up there.
- Think about it.

1284
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,400
Kwang Soo fell for it so many times.

1285
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,900
(Painful memories make him tear up.)

1286
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,210
Because I told you
that she definitely likes you,

1287
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,630
you confessed to her confidently.

1288
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,880
(He belatedly realized
that she simply laughs a lot.)

1289
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,880
I know something
that misleads men very easily.

1290
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,150
I bet Se Chan knows a lot
about this.

1291
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,650
Suddenly,

1292
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,090
women with long hair do this.

1293
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,510
They tie their hair in front of you.

1294
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,260
- No!
- No!

1295
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,150
- They do that when they are angry.
- Really?

1296
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:28,590
Why would they be angry?

1297
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,230
- They are either angry or hot.
- Isn't this one?

1298
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,760
I am sorry, but...

1299
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,000
Ji Hyo, how about you?

1300
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,820
When I pass by a guy
and our eyes meet,

1301
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,130
I do this because I feel awkward.

1302
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,840
(Men's hearts flutter.)

1303
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,440
"Why did she smile at me?"

1304
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,710
It misleads them like that.

1305
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,570
It would make men message her
that night.

1306
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,300
- Seriously.
- "What was that?"

1307
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,900
- "Are you asleep?"
- "What was that?"

1308
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,210
"Ji Hyo, are you asleep?"

1309
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,420
"What was that?"

1310
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,610
(A smile can mislead men big time.)

1311
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:57,090
- Kwang Soo gets misled a lot.
- That's right.

1312
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,110
- I will tell you one right away.
- Let me check the rankings.

1313
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,650
Yi Kyung is in fourth place.

1314
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:04,190
Yi Kyung. Pick Yi Kyung.

1315
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,500
Yi Kyung.

1316
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,360
I am practically controlling
Suk Jin.

1317
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,860
(His subconscious got taken over.)

1318
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,260
If it's going to be that way,
sit on Jae Suk's shoulder.

1319
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,230
- Be a parrot.
- Yi Kyung.

1320
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:21,210
They ask you what you are up to
and check your schedule.

1321
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,210
I see.

1322
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,510
- They ask you what you are up to.
- That's right.

1323
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,070
"What are you up to?"

1324
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,780
- "Are you asleep?"
- "Are you asleep?"

1325
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,320
(Correct)

1326
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,780
- It's top 4.
- Top 4.

1327
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,050
(Yi Kyung got a top 4 answer!)

1328
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,690
- "Are you asleep?"
- That's right.

1329
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,650
"What are you doing right now?
What are you doing tomorrow?"

1330
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,380
Why do some women do that...

1331
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,860
- if they aren't interested?
- Seriously,

1332
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,500
who would ask those questions
without an interest?

1333
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,000
Doesn't it show an interest?

1334
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,690
Ji Hyo, tell us.

1335
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,130
Why do women ask,
"What are you up to?"

1336
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,800
Since So Min isn't here,
I will tell you what I think.

1337
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,300
They suddenly became curious
about something.

1338
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,210
- Is that all?
- Suddenly.

1339
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,630
My heart aches.

1340
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,840
- For example...
- "What was his name?"

1341
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,880
"What was his name?"
"How was 'The Invisible Man'?"

1342
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,110
- "I am thinking about watching it."
- You just have a question.

1343
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,780
Do women really do that
out of curiosity?

1344
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,340
Let's say you wake up
and see a text that reads,

1345
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,510
"Are you asleep?"

1346
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,150
It's bound to wake you up.

1347
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,420
Then you call your friend.

1348
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,150
"Hey, I received a text..."

1349
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,150
(Is this a confession of love?)

1350
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,590
"while I was sleeping."

1351
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:12,820
The two of you would do that.

1352
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,320
I used to call Jae Suk
about these things.

1353
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,360
The two of you would do that.

1354
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,960
So I told him,

1355
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,230
"Confess your love to her."

1356
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,670
My goodness.

1357
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,070
I was like,

1358
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:25,340
- "What?"
- "Go! Kwang Soo, go!"

1359
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,630
I ran forward
like a racehorse, but...

1360
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,900
(He doesn't finish his sentence.)

1361
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,920
She was very taken aback.

1362
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,650
"There is no one like you."

1363
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,690
They say that to you.

1364
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,480
- I see.
- That's spot on.

1365
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,280
(Ji Hyo gets a top 5 answer!)

1366
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,550
Unnecessary touches.

1367
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,630
(Jong Kook comes next...)

1368
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,690
(and gets a top 1 answer!)

1369
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:44,920
Oh, my goodness.

1370
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,760
They give you small gifts.

1371
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,460
- They look after you.
- Yes.

1372
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,460
They look after you.

1373
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,940
(He gets a top 2 answer as well!)

1374
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,400
- Is it up there?
- It's top two.

1375
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,960
- It's top two.
- That's incredible.

1376
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,070
Is it top two?

1377
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,380
- Top two?
- That's incredible.

1378
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,400
- Is it top 2?
- Top 2?

1379
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,840
That's incredible.

1380
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,110
- How did he get all of them right?
- It's top two.

1381
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,750
- Top two?
- Hold on. Jong Kook is suspicious.

1382
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,380
- Seriously.
- You are really good.

1383
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,840
This is so confusing.

1384
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,190
Jong Kook is suspicious.

1385
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,460
Jong Kook is suspicious, right?

1386
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,360
- Jong Kook, you know what?
- What?

1387
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,050
You got the top 1 and 2 right.

1388
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,360
- I mean...
- He suddenly behaved suspiciously.

1389
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,800
- Even in the previous round...
- Jong Kook.

1390
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,320
This is so confusing.
Which one is it?

1391
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,500
- He is really suspicious.
- This is so confusing.

1392
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,440
Kwang Soo, you would know this.

1393
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,610
I enjoy talking about
romantic relationships.

1394
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,130
If I were an illegal participant,

1395
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,030
I wouldn't have tried so hard
to get all the answers.

1396
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,300
- I wouldn't have made it obvious.
- You know,

1397
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,670
I just collected hints
from the others.

1398
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,940
I didn't go overboard
like Kwang Soo.

1399
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,670
(The situation gets tight
for the two of them.)

1400
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,420
Hold on. What?

1401
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,090
- Give me a hand massage.
- Why do you keep asking me that?

1402
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,190
People are suspecting me.

1403
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,320
Why would I give you a hand massage?

1404
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,030
- Just do it.
- He keeps asking.

1405
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,670
Can't you do it when I am in pain?

1406
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,230
He kept pushing his hand toward me.

1407
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,460
- A hand massage, my foot!
- For goodness' sake.

1408
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,230
- You know...
- Hey.

1409
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,900
Those are the things.

1410
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,980
- So Min has done all of them to me.
- Really?

1411
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,380
Se Chan said...

1412
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,880
So Min has done all of them to him.

1413
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,250
So Min has done everything
from top 1 to 5.

1414
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,190
She has done everything.
She smiled at me every day...

1415
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,110
- and looked after me.
- That's right.

1416
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,380
She always met my eyes and smiled.

1417
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,590
"What are you up to?
Are you asleep?"

1418
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,760
- "There is no one like you."
- That's right.

1419
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,800
I had no choice...

1420
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,230
but to be misled.
She has done everything.

1421
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,670
- That's right.
- So Min.

1422
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,400
So Min does those things.

1423
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,840
So Min does all of those things.

1424
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,360
The top five items are spot on.

1425
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,800
So Min should have been here today.

1426
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,610
She would have gotten
all of them right.

1427
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,630
Seriously.

1428
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,230
There are 3 members in 1st place.

1429
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,550
(The current rankings
will be revealed.)

1430
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,610
3 members in 1st place.

1431
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,710
- There are 3 members in 1st place.
- Okay.

1432
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,880
Yeon Joo, Jae Suk, and Kwang Soo.

1433
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,050
Why me?
I didn't get any answers right.

1434
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,550
The member in fourth place
is Jong Kook.

1435
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,010
How many places did I move up?

1436
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,650
- Jong Kook is on the move.
- I just moved up one place.

1437
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,980
Since Haha is on the sixth place,
he will be the detective.

1438
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,650
Okay. Detective Haha.

1439
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,400
It's either Jong Kook...

1440
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,800
or Kwang Soo.

1441
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,110
Do you know what's suspicious
about Kwang Soo?

1442
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,010
He didn't even answer diligently
for the second quiz.

1443
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,880
- That's right.
- He passed over his turns.

1444
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,710
He usually gives me a hand massage.

1445
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,750
Don't be ridiculous.

1446
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,170
Do you know why
he didn't do it today?

1447
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:20,380
His hands are sweaty
due to his nerves.

1448
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,510
- His hands are sweaty.
- I will give you a hand massage!

1449
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:23,820
- Stop it.
- He is nervous.

1450
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,420
His hands are sweaty.

1451
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,480
(Suk Jin touches Kwang Soo's hand.)

1452
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,010
- His hands are sweaty.
- Right?

1453
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,380
Right?

1454
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,820
- Catch him.
- His hands are sweaty...

1455
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,090
- due to his nerves.
- He usually massages my hands.

1456
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,420
He rarely says no.

1457
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,500
- Give me your hand!
- I just remembered something.

1458
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,900
If we are the options,
you should go with him.

1459
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,300
- I think it's him.
- Listen.

1460
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,900
I simply repeated
what other people said.

1461
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,110
The illegal participants need to be
in the top five in the last round.

1462
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,750
So there is a chance
they are laying low right now.

1463
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,920
- That's right.
- They wouldn't try so hard now.

1464
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,010
Suk Jin, Jae Suk is
really suspicious.

1465
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,550
- Jae Suk?
- Why do you say that?

1466
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:59,280
- Jae Suk?
- He is suspicious.

1467
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,010
Jae Suk keeps...

1468
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:02,880
- He keeps framing other people.
- Yes.

1469
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,230
He keeps talking about
how suspicious other people are.

1470
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,400
- Si Yang is ridiculous.
- He is right.

1471
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,530
- He is ridiculous.
- He keeps doing that.

1472
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:09,570
That's right.

1473
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,860
He got some answers wrong
on purpose.

1474
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,860
Sometimes, he got the correct answer
right away.

1475
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,940
- I am not it.
- Here is the thing.

1476
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,010
To be honest,
it's not just Kwang Soo.

1477
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,030
- Right.
- Whenever we play a game like this,

1478
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,130
I become suspicious of him.

1479
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,570
- Whenever you play a game?
- I want to check his identity.

1480
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,650
- Seriously.
- I know what you mean.

1481
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:28,250
I know what you mean.

1482
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,940
- Even if you fail...
- Even if I fail...

1483
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,610
Why are you so suspicious of me?

1484
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,050
Please apprehend a member.

1485
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,480
- Please stand up.
- Okay.

1486
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,460
- Should I stand up too?
- Yes. Please come here.

1487
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,130
- The three of you.
- Me too?

1488
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,130
(Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, and Jong Kook)

1489
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,960
You are here
because you are annoying.

1490
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,030
Seriously.

1491
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,030
That's not true.
He is suspicious too.

1492
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,670
He is really suspicious.

1493
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,070
- The way he answered first...
- Yes, it was a bit strange.

1494
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:52,010
And you two participated
too diligently.

1495
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,130
- This is a good selection, right?
- Go ahead.

1496
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,610
- There is a chance, right?
- Do what you want to do.

1497
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,070
I don't know why
Jae Suk is so annoying.

1498
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,610
Go ahead and make a pick.

1499
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:00,670
- This is a good selection, right?
- Go ahead.

1500
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:01,750
- There is a chance, right?
- Do what you want to do.

1501
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,690
- I choose him.
- Gosh, I think it's Kwang Soo.

1502
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,750
- There is a chance, right?
- Do what you want to do.

1503
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,610
(He chooses Jae Suk.)

1504
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:08,090
- I am not it.
- All right.

1505
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:12,530
Let's check Jae Suk's identity,
the member Suk Jin has chosen.

1506
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,230
He is putting on
the handcuffs himself.

1507
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,000
- You look like a criminal.
- You are it, right?

1508
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,590
- You are it, right?
- He's putting them on.

1509
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,530
- Jae Suk's...
- This is scary.

1510
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,900
identity is...

1511
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,510
(Jae Suk was suspected at the end.)

1512
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,780
He is it, right?

1513
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,750
(Is he an illegal participant?)

1514
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,170
He is not an illegal participant.

1515
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,780
Really?

1516
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,840
- Really?
- I am not an illegal participant.

1517
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,210
I told you so.

1518
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,460
You said Jae Suk was suspicious.

1519
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,730
I said Kwang Soo is
more suspicious.

1520
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,320
He behaved strangely.

1521
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:46,900
Let's go
to the memorization room...

1522
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,090
- before the third round.
- Are we going again?

1523
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,960
(They enter the memorization room.)

1524
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,090
All right.

1525
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,610
Let's do this right the next time.

1526
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,300
(Who are memorizing the answers?)

1527
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:06,170
(Who are
the 2 illegal participants?)

1528
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,420
One of them must be a guest.

1529
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,440
That's right.

1530
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,550
The third quiz is...

1531
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:14,280
the Mute Dancing King.

1532
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,360
What is that?

1533
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,030
The person who gives the question...

1534
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,130
must describe the given keyword
in one minute with a dance.

1535
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,670
The rest needs to guess the answer.

1536
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,070
A dance.

1537
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:28,130
Since Ji Hyo got arrested,
she can answer...

1538
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,400
only after two incorrect answers.

1539
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,380
(Se Chan is the first one up.)

1540
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,570
- What?
- What is that?

1541
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:36,570
Is it aerobic dance?

1542
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,170
What?

1543
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,690
Let me answer. You were urinating,
and it spattered on you.

1544
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:42,690
What?

1545
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,090
- Watch.
- What's that?

1546
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,090
I will make it clear this time.

1547
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,090
- Let me answer!
- I see.

1548
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,820
An ugly man is dancing.

1549
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,360
A dancing squid.

1550
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,900
(Since 2 people gave wrong answers,
Ji Hyo can try too.)

1551
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,070
Ji Hyo.

1552
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,340
A man who lost weight
doing belly dancing.

1553
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,760
(Correct)

1554
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,360
Why did she have to suck
the fun out of that?

1555
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,400
- You stay out of this.
- I want to join you guys.

1556
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,400
We were having fun.

1557
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,400
(A person who falls in love
at first sight while roller skating)

1558
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,840
You're skating.

1559
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,070
Roller skating?

1560
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:14,070
Let me answer.

1561
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,940
While you go backward on skates,

1562
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,780
you are surprised to see a cute guy.

1563
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,650
Let me answer.

1564
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:25,760
- While roller skating,
- And?

1565
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,230
you fall in love at first sight.

1566
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:28,820
(Correct)

1567
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,300
- He's strange.
- This doesn't make sense.

1568
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,860
- You got it right on the first try?
- This is crazy.

1569
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,230
- At first sight?
- I can't believe this.

1570
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,570
I can't do this.

1571
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:40,670
(Please make a guess together.)

1572
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,880
- You should dance.
- Dance.

1573
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,710
- Good.
- You're doing good.

1574
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,210
Tap dance.

1575
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,150
(Did he spill something?)

1576
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,820
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1577
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
What is it?

1578
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:53,610
Go ahead.

1579
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:56,320
You dropped your phone tap dancing.

1580
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,150
- Wrong.
- My gosh.

1581
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,230
(He gives more hints.)

1582
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,460
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1583
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,920
While tap dancing,

1584
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,070
you dropped your iced Americano.

1585
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,170
- That's it.
- You dropped your iced Americano.

1586
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,940
(Iced Americano?)

1587
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,130
- Correct.
- Okay.

1588
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,610
- Iced Americano?
- Was it iced Americano?

1589
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,110
- Iced Americano?
- How did you know it's iced?

1590
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,880
Kwang Soo, how did you know that?

1591
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,170
Iced Americano?

1592
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,480
- Hang on.
- How did you know?

1593
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,780
- Wait.
- Iced Americano.

1594
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,780
- Wait.
- How did you know?

1595
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,190
How did he know iced Americano?

1596
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,820
- It's so strange.
- He knew the exact word.

1597
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,690
- Hey.
- Iced Americano?

1598
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,190
Was the answer iced Americano?

1599
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,230
Hang on.

1600
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,000
Did it say iced Americano?

1601
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Wait. No.

1602
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,130
- It's not like that.
- I'm so upset I didn't catch you.

1603
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,230
I'm not an illegal participant.

1604
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,500
Oh no. He got caught.

1605
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,030
- I'm sorry,
- This is crazy.

1606
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,300
but will you dance
with the shackles?

1607
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:42,940
Seriously, I'm not
an illegal participant.

1608
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,300
- I'm telling you.
- I'm sure it's you.

1609
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,670
Just handcuff him.

1610
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,880
(The results after the third quiz)

1611
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,570
Now it's time to arrest one.

1612
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,280
- Let's arrest someone.
- Haha was a little strange.

1613
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,280
- I think so.
- I swear it's not me.

1614
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,980
(Haha gave the right answer right
away with Ji Hyo's lame gestures.)

1615
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:00,320
- I think you are strange.
- What was strange?

1616
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,980
Iced Americano is even stranger.

1617
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,780
It was the strangest thing.

1618
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,800
Gosh, no.

1619
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,360
(Kwang Soo said iced Americano
of all kinds of beverages.)

1620
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,570
Just arrest him.

1621
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,300
(Haha is the detective
for this quiz.)

1622
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,760
- Catch him.
- But, Haha...

1623
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,840
(He arrests Kwang Soo immediately.)

1624
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:18,360
What's that?

1625
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,170
- Handcuff yourself.
- Seriously, it's not me.

1626
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,480
Go ahead and put them on.

1627
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,980
You can live at ease from now on.

1628
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,210
Who do you think it is then?

1629
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:25,820
Recommend someone.

1630
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,150
- I understand it can be mistaken.
- So recommend someone.

1631
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,690
What is that written on your arm?

1632
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,690
(What is that written on your arm?)

1633
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,760
- What?
- What is that written on your arm?

1634
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,960
(Did he write something on his arm?)

1635
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,050
What did you write?

1636
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,630
(Something is written
on Kwang Soo's arm.)

1637
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,360
Gosh, what's that?

1638
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,230
Get off. Let go.

1639
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,530
Hey, what is this?

1640
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,340
- Just let go of me.
- Look at this.

1641
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,570
Can't you memorize it?

1642
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,960
(Something is written in red.)

1643
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,170
(Kwang Soo is a usual suspect
with something written on his arm.)

1644
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,880
- Let go of me.
- Let me see.

1645
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:59,880
You guys are illegal participants
who know all the answers.

1646
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,710
I know all the answers?

1647
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,690
- Quiz?
- And...

1648
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:06,920
I know the answers?

1649
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,360
And Ji Hyo and I are here?

1650
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:15,460
(He has only himself to turn to,
so he made a cheat sheet.)

1651
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,670
Look at this.
It has all the answers.

1652
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:21,030
- My gosh.
- It's him.

1653
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:22,570
I can't believe this.

1654
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,670
This is so frustrating.

1655
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,940
I thought it didn't make sense.

1656
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,730
I told you. He sounded strange.

1657
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,380
Kwang Soo is...

1658
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,840
an illegal participant...

1659
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,750
- Can we say it all together?
- Sure.

1660
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,320
- He is an illegal participant.
- He is an illegal participant.

1661
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,590
- He is an illegal participant.
- My gosh.

1662
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,360
Why did you write it down here?

1663
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,630
- What does it say?
- We need one more.

1664
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,460
My gosh. This film set is amazing.

1665
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,550
What's all this?

1666
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,860
- Gosh, what's this?
- It's a large-scale studio.

1667
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,190
(It's a splendid stage...)

1668
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:54,670
(for the finals
of the 11 participants.)

1669
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,760
(It's the last place for
the Running Man Quiz Competition.)

1670
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,230
- What is all this?
- Is it that serious?

1671
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,010
You should've told me sooner.

1672
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,780
(We told you earlier.)

1673
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,340
- I'm intimidated.
- What's all this?

1674
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,880
Is it that big a deal?

1675
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,150
Like I said, this is our first
quiz competition in 10 years.

1676
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,150
So we want to do
things right for the finale.

1677
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,590
It makes me want to win.

1678
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,050
- You want to go up there, right?
- Yes.

1679
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:17,480
Forget it. We just need to pick out
the last illegal participant.

1680
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,130
- So it's not Jae Suk.
- It's not Jae Suk.

1681
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,460
- It's a good thing.
- It's not me.

1682
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,070
(Who is the last
illegal participant?)

1683
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:28,090
This is the first Running Man
Quiz for the Ultimate Winner,

1684
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,510
Quiz Kingdom.

1685
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,170
(The last round, Quiz Kingdom)

1686
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,570
Let me explain the rules
of the final round, Quiz Kingdom.

1687
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:38,780
Gosh, what's all this?

1688
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,510
The keywords for each question
will be revealed first.

1689
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:45,760
Then we will select players...

1690
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,380
for each question randomly
using this machine.

1691
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:54,230
The four selected players will go up
on the stage and give answers.

1692
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,670
Before the quiz,
you can make a bet...

1693
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,590
with the points you have scored.

1694
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:01,860
Okay.

1695
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,510
(If they get the right answer,
they score points.)

1696
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,170
We shouldn't fall for the keywords.

1697
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:09,750
Then let me show you
the keyword for this question.

1698
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,840
- Okay.
- Keyword.

1699
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,250
It's the keyword.

1700
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,610
The keyword for this question is...

1701
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,340
a four-character idiom.

1702
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,190
Please. I want
to avoid this question.

1703
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,380
A four-character idiom.

1704
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,420
four-character idioms are difficult.

1705
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,780
- It's quite difficult.
- It's not easy.

1706
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,530
It's hard to guess an idiom
with its meaning.

1707
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,150
- I know.
- All right then.

1708
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,460
Let's select the players then.
Please show us.

1709
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,230
Gosh, this is hard.

1710
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:33,500
Don't pick me.

1711
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,940
- Who will get picked?
- Don't pick me.

1712
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,340
This is difficult.

1713
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,610
The players for this question are...

1714
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:44,510
- Me?
- Yang Se Chan, Lee Kwang Soo,

1715
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,340
Lee Yi Kyung, and Yoo Jae Suk.

1716
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,480
- Me?
- Yang Se Chan, Lee Kwang Soo,

1717
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,610
(Besides Kwang Soo,
they all seem hesitant.)

1718
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,960
- Good luck.
- Please come up to the stage.

1719
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,210
Go, Jae Suk. Bet all your points.

1720
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,630
Gosh, look at this.

1721
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,780
I'm not sure
about four-character idioms.

1722
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,000
You're the best one here though.

1723
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,550
You are the best player here.

1724
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,900
I don't know four-character idioms.

1725
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:06,500
The keyword is a four-character
idiom. Make your bet.

1726
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:09,070
This is crazy. How many points
should I bet here?

1727
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:10,760
I'll just bet 50 points.

1728
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,480
(9th place, Yang Se Chan,
290 points)

1729
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,110
(3rd place, Lee Kwang Soo,
410 points)

1730
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,230
50 points.

1731
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,980
- Gosh, Kwang Soo...
- How many points did he bet?

1732
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,510
He wrote 200 points.

1733
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,980
This is what I'm best at.
four-character idioms.

1734
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,050
- I'll write 200 points.
- Go ahead.

1735
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,880
There are idioms
that are hard to guess.

1736
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,780
Jae Suk, it's you.

1737
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,630
- I'll go with 300 points.
- All right.

1738
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:34,090
(Jae Suk bets 300 points
with the support from the members.)

1739
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:35,260
Jae Suk bets 300 points.

1740
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,420
- He's good.
- Go all in.

1741
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:39,230
All the players are done
making their bets.

1742
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,940
I will give you a question then.

1743
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,840
(Is he looking at the palm
of his hand?)

1744
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,780
He's checking his palm.

1745
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,300
- What?
- He can't cheat.

1746
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,780
- He's cheating.
- He can't cheat.

1747
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,320
You told him to memorize
the answers. He can't write it down.

1748
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,380
He can't do that.

1749
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,780
I'll erase it all.

1750
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,050
He's like the movie, "Memento".

1751
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,190
- He has to erase it.
- I will erase it.

1752
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,710
- He can't even remember it.
- Let's go.

1753
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,730
Here's the question.

1754
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,980
If you have an ink hand at hand,

1755
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,460
you become smeared with ink
before you know it.

1756
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,070
And those who touch pitch
shall be defiled therewith.

1757
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,840
What is this four-character idiom...

1758
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,460
that emphasizes the importance
of the surrounding environment?

1759
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,510
- I know the answer.
- He knows it.

1760
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,510
I'm sure Jae Suk knows the answer.

1761
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,110
(Other members
are thinking carefully.)

1762
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,210
(What?)

1763
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:28,750
(He's cheating.)

1764
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,250
Kwang Soo! Don't look at it.

1765
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,480
- No.
- You can't cheat.

1766
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,590
He can't do that.

1767
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:38,320
You are given 10 seconds.
Please write down your answer.

1768
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,190
(Kwang Soo!)

1769
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,360
(Geunmujihyung?)

1770
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,070
Hey, Ji Hyo!

1771
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,460
Watch Ji Hyo carefully.

1772
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,070
Gosh, what are you doing?

1773
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,380
Do not cheat.
Cheating is not allowed.

1774
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,340
Please show us their answers.

1775
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:56,480
(Meokjaakhaeng, inmyeonsusim,
heukhwainsaeing, geunmukjaheuk)

1776
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,920
Se Chan's answer is meokjaakhaeng.

1777
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,750
(Does he want to eat up
all evil deeds?)

1778
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,420
It sounds plausible.

1779
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,920
Kwang Soo's answer...

1780
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:08,510
is inmyeonsusim.

1781
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,590
Inmyeonsusim?

1782
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:12,090
Inmyeonsusim.

1783
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:14,320
Yi Kyung's answer is
heukhwainsaeing.

1784
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,670
Lastly, Jae Suk's answer
is geunmukjaheuk.

1785
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:19,730
That's right.

1786
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:20,800
The answer is...

1787
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:21,960
(The answer is...)

1788
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,130
geunmukjaheuk.
Jae Suk got it right.

1789
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:25,130
Yes!

1790
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:28,400
Jae Suk knows
a lot of four-character idioms.

1791
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:30,750
- Hang on.
- What?

1792
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,980
Hey, can't you even cheat?

1793
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,150
The problem is there are
too many four-character idioms.

1794
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,940
- I only have the answers.
- He's so...

1795
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,360
He only has answers.

1796
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,960
He said inmyeonsusim.

1797
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,230
Inmyeonsusim?

1798
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,960
Why did you say inmyeonsusim now?

1799
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,300
(Kwang Soo's
cheat sheet didn't help.)

1800
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:49,860
I should've bet all my points.

1801
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,860
No.

1802
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,400
Why did you say inmyeonsusim?

1803
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,340
I've never heard
of the idiom before.

1804
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,340
Ji Hyo, did you tell him the answer?

1805
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,730
- Yes.
- Did you know the answer?

1806
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,610
- Apparently not.
- She didn't know it.

1807
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:04,570
- What are you two doing?
- Did you tell him the wrong answer?

1808
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:07,070
The keyword for this question is...

1809
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,880
a neologism.

1810
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,590
- Neologism?
- Neologism.

1811
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:11,840
I'm good at this.

1812
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,880
- I'm not good at this.
- We don't know many neologisms.

1813
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,320
- The keyword is coined words.
- I don't know.

1814
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,230
- It has to be Suk Jin.
- Don't pick me.

1815
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,170
Kim Jong Kook, Lee Yi Kyung,
Ji Suk Jin, and Haha. Come on up.

1816
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,860
(The 4 middle-aged men
are disappointed.)

1817
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,530
And Haha. Come on up.

1818
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,170
- My gosh.
- I'm in trouble.

1819
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,400
I don't know any new words.

1820
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,630
How difficult is it?

1821
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,300
- It's not too difficult.
- Medium difficulty?

1822
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:35,880
- Medium difficulty.
- Medium difficulty.

1823
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,110
Should I turn the game around?

1824
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:39,570
- Should we turn the game around?
- Medium difficulty?

1825
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:41,650
- If you want to, I'm in.
- I want to.

1826
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,010
- Let's do this.
- Are you sure?

1827
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:44,110
Let's turn the game around.

1828
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,110
Please make your bets.

1829
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,590
Let's turn the game around!

1830
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,980
- Jong Kook is betting 200 points?
- Let's do this.

1831
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:52,150
If Jong Kook doesn't get it right...

1832
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,190
- Yi Kyung is betting 300 points?
- 300 points?

1833
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,900
Yi Kyung is suddenly making
such a big bet.

1834
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,360
Jong Kook is suspicious, isn't he?

1835
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:01,940
He said it's of medium difficulty.

1836
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,900
It's supposed to be
of medium difficulty.

1837
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,780
They've all made their bets now.

1838
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,880
Here's the question.

1839
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:10,110
The coined word is,

1840
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:13,880
"oh-jeo-chi-go."

1841
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,280
- "Oh-jeo-chi-go"?
- "Shi-go"?

1842
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,610
- "Oh-jeo-chi-go."
- It's "chi-go."

1843
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,920
- This isn't of medium difficulty.
- Is this of medium difficulty?

1844
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,860
The meaning is not that difficult.

1845
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,730
- Still...
- I mean...

1846
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,500
It's definitely not
of medium difficulty.

1847
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:29,460
If Jong Kook gets this right,
we should suspect him.

1848
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,820
He doesn't seem to know.

1849
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,440
Is it used by students or employees?

1850
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,900
- It's used by them both.
- "Oh-jeo-chi-go"?

1851
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,570
Please tell us
in which situation it's used.

1852
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:39,280
- He can't tell you that.
- That'd be hyeongseoljigong.

1853
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,440
(Se Chan doesn't know
the meaning of the expression.)

1854
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,070
- It's totally hyeongseoljigong.
- Is it hyeongseoljigong?

1855
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,210
Yes, definitely.

1856
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:44,840
I just took a wild guess.

1857
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,980
(No one seems to know.)

1858
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,050
I'll write down whatever.

1859
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,320
If any of us get it right,

1860
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,480
- we should suspect them.
- 5, 4...

1861
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,980
2, 1.

1862
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,260
Please show us their answers.

1863
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:58,690
"I actually have piles."

1864
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,130
"I'll get rid of them."

1865
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,400
(It doesn't make any sense.)

1866
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,000
- Come on.
- Suk Jin wrote,

1867
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,300
"Oh, what a petty, mean jerk."

1868
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,440
Suk Jin wrote,

1869
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,300
- "Oh, what a petty, mean jerk."
- "Oh, what a petty, mean jerk."

1870
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:14,730
Let's see Jong Kook
and Yi Kyung's answers.

1871
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,280
They wrote different things.

1872
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,650
- What do you mean?
- Jong Kook and Yi Kyung.

1873
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:21,150
Jong Kook wrote,
"Chicken tonight, yes or no?"

1874
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:22,920
Yi Kyung wrote,

1875
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,280
- "Chicken and beer tonight."
- That must be it.

1876
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,260
- It's definitely one of them.
- Definitely.

1877
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,030
- It's one of them.
- Definitely.

1878
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:30,530
- There's no way Jong Kook knows it.
- It's Yi Kyung.

1879
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:32,460
It's Yi Kyung.

1880
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,800
- They both bet all they had.
- It's one of them.

1881
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:38,400
Let me announce the correct answer.

1882
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:39,900
- Students...
- What's the correct answer?

1883
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,170
(Jong Kook and Yi Kyung made
big bets and wrote similar answers.)

1884
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:44,760
- The correct answer is,
- What is it?

1885
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,130
- "Chicken..."
- "Chicken..."

1886
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:48,880
It's "chicken and beer," right?

1887
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,250
- "tonight, yes or no?"
- "Chicken"?

1888
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,150
What about...

1889
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,820
Only Jong Kook gets the points.

1890
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:56,280
- Yes!
- Jong Kook is suspicious.

1891
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:58,420
This one was impossible to guess.

1892
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,420
- I'm suspicious?
- You're suspicious.

1893
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,690
- Me?
- You are.

1894
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:04,050
- You're extremely suspicious.
- Me?

1895
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:05,860
Do you even like chicken?

1896
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,090
- This...
- Hey!

1897
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,500
I've never seen him use new words.

1898
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,300
And he bet 200 points.

1899
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:14,230
Jong Kook is suspicious.

1900
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,300
- Really?
- You never know.

1901
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,510
Jong Kook is suspicious.

1902
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,400
Here's the keyword
for the next question.

1903
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,300
"A question Ji Hyo got wrong."

1904
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,800
- There are too many.
- I've got many wrong.

1905
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,440
- Ji Hyo has got many wrong.
- There are too many.

1906
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,170
- It's too difficult.
- All right.

1907
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:30,780
Let's choose four players now.

1908
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,090
- I've got many questions wrong.
- Go!

1909
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:34,460
And many of them were actually hard.

1910
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,650
Not all of them were easy.

1911
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,190
Lee Kwang Soo, Yang Se Chan,

1912
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:39,190
- Park Hyo Ju, and Ha Yeon Joo.
- Ha Yeon Joo?

1913
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:40,420
- Yeon Joo is playing.
- Yeon Joo is playing.

1914
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:41,820
We should keep an eye on her.

1915
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,590
Ji Hyo got it wrong,
but I'll get it right.

1916
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:46,030
Please make your bets now.

1917
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,170
Kwang Soo made a bet first.

1918
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,480
If Ji Hyo got it wrong...

1919
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,610
- Yeon Joo bets 50 points.
- I don't have many points.

1920
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,800
- Yeon Joo.
- Come on.

1921
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:58,880
Make it 150.

1922
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,980
Kwang Soo, what are you looking at?

1923
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,650
(Kwang Soo,
what are you looking at?)

1924
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,280
I crossed it all out.

1925
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:06,710
(He fails to cheat.)

1926
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:07,880
I crossed it all out.

1927
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,280
I shouldn't have
crossed out everything.

1928
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,280
I should have just pretended.

1929
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,130
Here's the question.

1930
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:15,550
Ji Hyo got this question wrong...

1931
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:19,300
in the Survival Race
in the 47th episode.

1932
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,460
The 47th episode?
That's a long time ago.

1933
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:26,170
Which river was the water
Bongyi Kim Seon Dal sold...

1934
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:29,300
to the Hanyang merchants from?

1935
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,900
- What?
- That's easy.

1936
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,010
We should keep quiet.

1937
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,380
Look at Kwang Soo's face.

1938
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,940
Hey! Look at Kwang Soo!

1939
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:37,210
You don't know it, Kwang Soo?

1940
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,920
Please write down your answers.

1941
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:40,110
Which river?

1942
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:41,550
Which river was the water from?

1943
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:42,690
- I have no idea.
- It's obvious.

1944
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:43,960
- It's Julien Kang.
- It's Ahn Gil Gang.

1945
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,630
- It's Ahn Gil Gang.
- It's Julien Kang.

1946
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:50,130
- Is it in Seoul?
- You have 10 seconds.

1947
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:52,030
(Kwang Soo sends out an SOS
to Ji Hyo.)

1948
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:54,440
- The Taedong River.
- No!

1949
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,730
Please stop them.

1950
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:58,170
(Se Chan looks confident.)

1951
01:07:58,170 --> 01:07:59,380
Kwang Soo is cheating.

1952
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:01,940
- The Ganges.
- Four,

1953
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:03,610
- The Nile.
- three...

1954
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:04,780
(After saying she has no idea,
Yeon Joo writes something down.)

1955
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,880
- 2, 1.
- Bongyi Kim Seon Dal?

1956
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,210
Please show us their answers.

1957
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:09,920
(The Nakdong River,
The Hantan River)

1958
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,050
Okay.

1959
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:12,110
"The Nakdong River"?

1960
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,010
Kwang Soo wrote,
"The Nakdong River."

1961
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:15,610
- "The Hantan River"?
- It's wrong?

1962
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:17,530
- Se Chan wrote, "The Hantan River."
- It's the Taedong River.

1963
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:19,920
- Yeon Joo got it right.
- Hyo Ju wrote, "The Taedong River."

1964
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,100
- She said she has no idea.
- Yeon Joo got it right.

1965
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,470
Yeon Joo wrote, "The Taedong River."

1966
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,130
- I wrote, "The Han River."
- She's acting.

1967
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:26,640
- The correct answer is...
- Yeon Joo said she has no idea.

1968
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,670
- She's acting.
- I wrote, "The Han River."

1969
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:29,770
The Taedong River.

1970
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:33,010
Park Hyo Ju and Ha Yeon Joo
wrote the correct answer.

1971
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:35,570
- Yeon Joo.
- You're suspicious.

1972
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,310
- You're busted.
- You messed up.

1973
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,680
Se Chan, why did you write,
"The Hantan River"?

1974
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,880
- I thought it was the Hantan River.
- It's the Taedong River.

1975
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,390
You just have to stay where you are.

1976
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,850
But Kwang Soo is messing up.

1977
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:47,920
Jong Kook and Yeon Joo...

1978
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,320
- They're suspicious.
- Jae Suk.

1979
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:51,720
- I'm innocent.
- Are you sure?

1980
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,320
Yeon Joo is still suspicious.

1981
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,500
Yeon Joo is extremely suspicious.

1982
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,690
She's suspicious.

1983
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:58,220
Why did you tell me
it's the Nakdong River?

1984
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,770
- I said, "The Taedong River."
- You did?

1985
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:02,470
I said, "The Taedong River."

1986
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:04,310
Say it again.

1987
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,270
(She obviously says,
"The Taedong River.")

1988
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:08,230
Kwang Soo, this is not okay.
The top five...

1989
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,570
The keyword
for the next question is...

1990
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,310
- a "currency swap."
- What's that?

1991
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:14,920
I don't know much about it.

1992
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,020
What does that mean?

1993
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:18,220
- It's about finance.
- It's about money.

1994
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,310
- I have no idea. This is not good.
- Kwang Soo...

1995
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,110
The four players are,

1996
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:24,350
Ha Yeon Joo, Yoo Jae Suk,

1997
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,220
Song Ji Hyo, and Haha.

1998
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:28,100
- Gosh.
- Please come up to the stage.

1999
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,300
- Yeon Joo...
- My role model, Haha!

2000
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,030
- Currency swaps...
- Keep an eye on Yeon Joo.

2001
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:34,140
We'll keep an eye on you, Yeon Joo.

2002
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,640
- A currency swap.
- It might not be a hard one.

2003
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:38,140
I bet 200 points.

2004
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:40,070
- That's a lot.
- Good job.

2005
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:42,270
It'd be amazing
if Ji Hyo goes all in.

2006
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,750
Ji Hyo, bet a lot.

2007
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:46,310
- Should I bet a lot?
- Yes.

2008
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:47,520
You know the answer anyway.

2009
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,940
- You should bet a lot.
- Right.

2010
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,610
You should get ahead of the others.

2011
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,390
How much did she bet?

2012
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:54,760
Show us the amount.

2013
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,780
(She bets 700 points.)

2014
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,930
That's not what I meant.

2015
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,890
Ji Hyo bets 700 points.

2016
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:02,820
- That's not what I meant.
- What?

2017
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:04,770
- You said I should bet a lot.
- I didn't say you should go all in.

2018
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:06,430
- It doesn't matter.
- 700 points?

2019
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:08,840
She must know a lot.

2020
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,270
- She knows.
- She definitely knows.

2021
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,930
Then... Okay.

2022
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:13,100
You can change your bets.

2023
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,600
If I don't change my bet,
I can't catch up with Ji Hyo.

2024
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:18,400
I bet 710 points.

2025
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,610
- Okay!
- 710 points!

2026
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:23,550
- Why?
- Yeon Joo keeps pretending.

2027
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:26,260
Yeon Joo, if you get it right,
we'll suspect you.

2028
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:28,520
- Yeon Joo bets 50 points.
- Let's go!

2029
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:29,820
I'm not sure
if I'll know the answer.

2030
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,000
Here's the question.

2031
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,300
A currency swap is an agreement...

2032
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:40,600
where two countries exchange
a certain amount of money...

2033
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:45,670
and later exchange
the same amount again.

2034
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:46,840
If that the case,

2035
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:51,850
please spell the English word,
"country," correctly.

2036
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:53,420
- "Country"?
- Gosh.

2037
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,920
Look at Haha. He bet only 10 points.

2038
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,520
- That was a good call.
- I got nervous for nothing.

2039
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,560
- Gosh.
- Jae Suk, you're incredible!

2040
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,650
- This is too easy.
- This is too easy.

2041
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:03,650
I got nervous for nothing.

2042
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:06,390
- This is too easy.
- I told you.

2043
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:08,130
Ji Hyo, it was a good call
to go all in.

2044
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,890
Go, Ji Hyo!

2045
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,220
I think my answer is wrong.

2046
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:14,100
Then correct it! Hurry up.

2047
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,560
What is it? Is this right?

2048
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:19,310
How can a Mensa member
not know how to spell "country"?

2049
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,770
I'm getting confused too.

2050
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,680
No, it's easy.

2051
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,050
- I'm confused.
- One.

2052
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:25,710
Please show us their answers.

2053
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,250
I think my answer is wrong.

2054
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:29,310
Please show us their answers.

2055
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,520
Let's see them.

2056
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:33,920
Three of them wrote the same answer,

2057
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,610
and one wrote something else.

2058
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:37,630
(Haha wrote, "cuntry.")

2059
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:40,220
- What's that?
- What did you do?

2060
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,930
I changed it at the last minute.

2061
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,060
What did you write?

2062
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,890
I wrote, "country," at first.

2063
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:46,730
You really should study.

2064
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:48,030
Haha, you did a good job.

2065
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,530
The three of them wrote
the correct answer,

2066
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:51,100
and Haha wrote the wrong answer.

2067
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,570
- I got it right at first.
- Go, Ji Hyo!

2068
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,840
Gosh.

2069
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:56,570
How could you ask
us to spell "country"?

2070
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:58,380
Jae Suk has
over 1,400 points now.

2071
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,610
We spelled "country"
for a currency swap question?

2072
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,970
It was nothing.

2073
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:04,550
The scores are changing a lot
after each question.

2074
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:08,020
This time, the four players are,
Kwak Si Yang, Ha Yeon Joo,

2075
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:10,260
- Kim Jong Kook, and Park Hyo Ju.
- What should I do? Let's do this.

2076
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:13,150
Keep an eye
on Yeon Joo and Jong Kook.

2077
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:16,060
Keep an eye on them both.
Yeon Joo is suspicious too.

2078
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,670
She stays in the top five
without standing out too much.

2079
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:21,190
- She's acting.
- I know.

2080
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,310
They've made their bets now.

2081
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,970
Si Yang goes all in.

2082
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,710
Yeon Joo bets 30 points.

2083
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,470
Jong Kook bets 40 points.

2084
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:33,440
- Please.
- Hyo Ju bets 150 points.

2085
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,350
Here's the question.

2086
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:40,590
"Caution" by Tashannie
was released in 2000.

2087
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,220
That said,

2088
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:47,020
what is the business term
that means a threat...

2089
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,000
that is predictable
after a series of warnings...

2090
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,360
- but is easily neglected?
- Gosh.

2091
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,210
What does that have to do
with the song?

2092
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:58,060
- A business term?
- What is it?

2093
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,210
- It's a business term?
- What is it?

2094
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,310
A "gray rhino."

2095
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,510
That's hard.

2096
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:05,180
(Jae Suk knows the answer.)

2097
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,720
- That's right.
- Right?

2098
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,680
- A business term?
- Note, there are options.

2099
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,920
We get to choose?

2100
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,610
- Here are the options.
- Is it an English term?

2101
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:13,960
- Okay, let's try it.
- There are options.

2102
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,610
- I think I might know.
- I should have bet a lot.

2103
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:17,720
- I think it's either number 1 or 3.
- Please write down your answers.

2104
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,220
- I think Hyo Ju knows the answer.
- I know it.

2105
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:23,060
- Luckily, they gave us options.
- Let's see their answers.

2106
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:25,130
- An "elephant in the room..."
- Really?

2107
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:29,100
Yeon Joo and Jong Kook got it wrong.

2108
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:31,670
- I'm confused.
- These two?

2109
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:32,670
The answer is...

2110
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:34,340
number two, gray rhino.

2111
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,530
Hyo Ju is correct.

2112
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:37,180
That was a difficult question.

2113
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,550
I'm glad I didn't bet everything.

2114
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:41,020
I got it because
it was multiple choice.

2115
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:44,180
Jae Suk knew
before he heard the options.

2116
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:46,560
He got it
before the options were given.

2117
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,220
- I know.
- It can't be Hyo Ju.

2118
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,350
- It's not her.
- It's not.

2119
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:53,000
Watch Yeon Joo
and Jong Kook carefully.

2120
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,600
Here's the keyword
for the next question.

2121
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,430
Kwang Soo who doesn't concentrate
on filming.

2122
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,140
"Kwang Soo who doesn't concentrate
on filming."

2123
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,230
What?

2124
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,500
Please spin the slot machine.

2125
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,970
(This is the last question!)

2126
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:07,030
(Current rankings)

2127
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,970
(Jae Suk in 1st place,
Ji Hyo in 2nd, Yeon Joo in 3rd)

2128
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:11,470
(Kwang Soo can't get up there.)

2129
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,050
(This question will decide the fates
of the illegal participants!)

2130
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:19,310
Hyo Ju, Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and Haha.

2131
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:21,680
Please make your bets.

2132
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,060
(Key suspects Jong Kook and Yeon Joo
are excluded.)

2133
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,480
- Haha, how many did you bet?
- All in.

2134
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,320
All in? Should I do that?

2135
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,390
Do I have over 300 points?

2136
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:31,220
Hold on.

2137
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:32,930
Hyo Ju wrote 300.

2138
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,100
Why is she doing that near the end?

2139
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,810
- Why would she do that?
- Hyo Ju?

2140
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:38,470
You're betting that many points?

2141
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:41,400
No, I'm not attached.

2142
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,680
- I don't care about the prize.
- I'm starting to doubt you.

2143
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,810
Why would you bet all of a sudden?

2144
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,510
She was a key suspect in round one.

2145
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:46,750
That's true. Why now?

2146
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,550
- In Round One.
- She was the only one who bet 150.

2147
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:50,720
- 150.
- Earlier?

2148
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,750
She was also the only one
who got gray rhino.

2149
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,310
- Right. It's not me.
- That's odd.

2150
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:56,320
- I swear it's not me.
- Hyo Ju bet 300 points,

2151
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:58,390
Se Chan bet 10, Ji Hyo bet 100,

2152
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:01,220
and Haha is all in.

2153
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,130
Here's the question.

2154
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,600
Unlike Kwang Soo who doesn't
concentrate on filming,

2155
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,430
this is a psychological
phenomenon...

2156
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:13,030
that describes
the effect of concentration...

2157
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:17,310
on realizing an impossible task.
What is this phenomenon called?

2158
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:19,350
- I know this.
- Good luck, Ji Hyo!

2159
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,520
(Kwang Soo can't get
within 5th place.)

2160
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,750
You can do it, Ji Hyo!

2161
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,610
- I know this.
- Good luck, Ji Hyo!

2162
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:24,920
This is so easy.

2163
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,090
Let's look at
Hyo Ju's face carefully.

2164
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:27,810
- She's strange.
- We have to look at her.

2165
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:30,220
She sounds confident.

2166
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,280
- I don't know this.
- Four,

2167
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,130
3, 2, 1.

2168
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,560
Please show us their answers.

2169
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,770
I have no clue.

2170
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:39,020
(Pygmalion effect, placebo effect)

2171
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,100
This is easy.

2172
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,840
Se Chan wrote placebo effect.

2173
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:43,970
- Haha wrote placebo effect.
- Placebo.

2174
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,840
- Two people wrote placebo effect,
- I think I'm right.

2175
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,640
and the other two wrote
Pygmalion effect.

2176
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,970
The answer is Pygmalion effect.

2177
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:52,010
(Answer: Pygmalion effect)

2178
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:54,380
- I lost everything.
- Good luck, Ji Hyo!

2179
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,420
Haha, Hyo Ju is strange.

2180
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:58,750
- Right?
- Why did she do that at the end?

2181
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,420
Hyo Ju came out of nowhere.

2182
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:01,760
I think it's her.

2183
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,560
Before this, we thought it was...

2184
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,690
- either Jong Kook or Yeon Joo.
- We did.

2185
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:08,600
- It's not me.
- From gray rhino,

2186
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,170
- I swear it's not me.
- she kept on going for it.

2187
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:12,690
Everyone, the quiz is over.

2188
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:17,030
Before we announce the rankings,
arrest somebody first.

2189
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:18,970
- Can we get some time?
- I swear it's not me.

2190
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:20,010
Sure.

2191
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,940
- It's either Hyo Ju or Yeon Joo.
- I went for it in the end.

2192
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:25,810
- I wanted to make it fun.
- Yeon Joo, Jong Kook, or Hyo Ju.

2193
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,350
- It's not Jong Kook.
- It's 1 of the 3.

2194
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,550
- It's not me.
- Can we talk without these three?

2195
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:31,720
- Can three of you stand aside?
- Us?

2196
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:33,060
Can you go over there as well?

2197
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,780
- Why?
- Move over.

2198
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:35,960
- What did we do?
- Move over.

2199
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,430
- Go.
- I'm not going to do anything.

2200
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:38,460
Move over.

2201
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:39,820
- I swear it's not me.
- Suk Jin.

2202
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,320
- It's not Jong Kook.
- I know.

2203
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,220
- I was watching Hyo Ju.
- Jong Kook.

2204
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,170
- I was doubting him at first,
- Hyo Ju came out of nowhere.

2205
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,530
- but I don't think it's him.
- It's not.

2206
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:48,600
He's capable of getting
"oh-jeo-chi-go" right.

2207
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,470
(He gives a faint smile
after getting excluded.)

2208
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,380
(He got many questions right
in Round 2.)

2209
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,050
(He got number 1 and 2
that were worth many points.)

2210
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:02,180
(He got "oh-jeo-chi-go" right
unexpectedly.)

2211
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:05,110
(He earned 200 points
with this question!)

2212
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:07,090
(They were very suspicious of him.)

2213
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:11,460
(Is he trying to avoid suspicion
by acting like a victim?)

2214
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,560
- It's not Jong Kook?
- At this point,

2215
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,390
- we should exclude him.
- She got Pygmalion effect.

2216
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:16,770
- That was three in a row.
- Taedong River was difficult too,

2217
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,770
- but she could have known.
- That was easy.

2218
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:20,390
Can you describe Pygmalion effect?

2219
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:23,210
- Can you explain?
- On "Dr. Romantic",

2220
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,640
there's an episode by that title.

2221
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,010
- What does it mean?
- It's a term in psychology.

2222
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:29,010
On "Dr. Romantic",
when Lee Sung Kyoung...

2223
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:30,900
wants something,

2224
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:33,770
she takes migraine medicine
and does the surgeries.

2225
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:34,850
I'm right.

2226
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,390
This is so unfair!

2227
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:42,610
(They were suspicious when she knew
the foreign children's song.)

2228
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:45,980
(It looked like she was trying to
remember something.)

2229
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,220
Hyo Ju is correct.

2230
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:50,270
(She got difficult questions
during the quiz as well.)

2231
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:51,360
Why did she do that at the end?

2232
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,690
(She miraculously got within
5th place at the end. Is it her?)

2233
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:57,340
Under the circumstances,
it can't be her.

2234
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:58,400
But look.

2235
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,710
Yeon Joo looked awkward.

2236
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:01,810
- Her too.
- She's not saying a word.

2237
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,250
This is so difficult.

2238
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,440
She looked clueless,

2239
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,970
- but she got everything right.
- She did.

2240
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:10,180
(She's a member of Mensa,
but in Round 1,)

2241
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:11,980
(she only got 140 points.)

2242
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:16,650
(That was a low score considering
her resume and skills.)

2243
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,630
(She sounded like she didn't know
the easy questions,)

2244
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:25,690
(but she got them right
and collected points.)

2245
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,800
(Is she an illegal participant who
tried to trick others by acting?)

2246
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,860
All three are highly likely.

2247
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,310
Don't make a mistake.

2248
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:33,770
You know.

2249
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:35,880
- But in the end...
- You can tell.

2250
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:36,970
Everyone,

2251
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:38,440
here are the ballots.

2252
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,310
You arrested two already,

2253
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:42,020
so you only need to write
one person's name down.

2254
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,590
- We are already done.
- You two will vote too.

2255
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:44,890
- Do we vote too?
- Yes, everybody votes.

2256
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:46,980
- These two too?
- We have to do this as a team.

2257
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,760
- We have to pick one person.
- We have to pick one...

2258
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,480
- to win.
- Yes, you have to pick one.

2259
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,460
(Who's going to have
the highest votes?)

2260
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,890
- Please hand them back.
- I'm done.

2261
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,060
I have the results.

2262
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:59,100
The goal of
the illegal participants was...

2263
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,390
was to get 2 or more of them
within top 5.

2264
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,100
First of all,
the illegal participants...

2265
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:07,310
- succeeded in their mission.
- Okay!

2266
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:08,380
Of course, they succeeded.

2267
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,900
Let's go, Ji Hyo!

2268
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,770
(Ji Hyo ended up in top 5,
but Kwang Soo didn't.)

2269
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:13,920
Because those two had high scores?

2270
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,750
No, one of them didn't.

2271
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:17,610
- Did he lose points?
- There's another person.

2272
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,850
According to the voting results,

2273
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:21,460
the person
with the most votes was...

2274
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:26,650
(Suspect with
the highest number of votes was...)

2275
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,060
- Hyo Ju. Please come on up.
- Right.

2276
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:31,100
Me?

2277
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,220
(If she's an illegal participant,
the illegal participants lose.)

2278
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:34,190
- I really hope it's not Yeon Joo.
- If it's Yeon Joo...

2279
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:36,640
- I hope it's not Yeon Joo.
- Please, Yeon Joo.

2280
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:38,670
- I really hope it's not her.
- I hope it's not Yeon Joo!

2281
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:40,530
I tried my best.

2282
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,100
We were suspicious of Yeon Joo
and Hyo Ju until the end.

2283
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:44,640
- I was...
- It's not me.

2284
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,610
I was the only person
who was suspicious of Jong Kook.

2285
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:49,020
I thought it was him,
but I followed the majority.

2286
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,640
If it's not Hyo Ju,

2287
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:51,850
- I would get chills.
- I would get chills.

2288
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:53,220
I would get chills.

2289
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,680
Let's see, Hyo Ju.

2290
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,980
- Again...
- I swear it's not me.

2291
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:56,980
I'm going to rip it off.

2292
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:00,100
1, 2, 3.

2293
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,060
(Is she the illegal participant
like the voting results?)

2294
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:06,130
(Or did Yeon Joo trick everybody?)

2295
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,730
- three.
- It's her, right?

2296
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,510
(She was the illegal participant!)

2297
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:15,010
(Cheering)

2298
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,510
(They arrested
all the illegal participants.)

2299
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:18,600
I'm sorry.

2300
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:19,920
(She almost fooled them.)

2301
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,070
- I knew it.
- Jae Suk.

2302
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,020
- Why did you think it was me?
- I know.

2303
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,720
Of course, it wasn't him.

2304
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,480
- You were clever.
- Of course.

2305
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,720
- That was insane.
- I didn't know it was Hyo Ju.

2306
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,060
- I'm sorry, Yi Kyung.
- Great work.

2307
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,520
- Yi Kyung...
- Great job.

2308
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,390
Great acting.

2309
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:34,650
(She deserves to be applauded.)

2310
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,500
You are illegal participants...

2311
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,060
who know the answers
to all questions.

2312
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:41,190
(Pygmalion...)

2313
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,670
(She tried her hardest
to memorize "Pygmalion".)

2314
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,100
The answer is "Pygmalion effect".

2315
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,730
(She knew the answer,
so she bet large points,)

2316
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,100
(but this became
the source of her problem.)

2317
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:52,640
(It made her nervous.)

2318
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:55,550
(Good job, Hyo Ju!)

2319
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:59,140
(Unfortunately, she failed to
fool them until the end.)

2320
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,720
(Arrested illegal participants)

2321
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,720
(Arrested illegal participant)

2322
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,720
- What's that?
- Is it meat?

2323
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,650
1st place gets Korean beef,
2nd place gets Korean pork,

2324
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:09,800
3rd place gets a speaker,
4th and 5th places get candles.

2325
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,190
Okay!

2326
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,430
- This is neat.
- Thank you.

2327
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:14,890
- Thank you.
- Good work.

2328
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:16,900
That was fun.

2329
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:21,140
(The animals got invited
to the tiger's birthday party!)

2330
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:24,140
(This is a day just for Jong Kook!)

2331
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:26,810
(He's the birthday boy.)

2332
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:29,720
(Hyo Seong and Mingyu are here
to celebrate his birthday!)

2333
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:33,280
(There is workout equipment
for Jong Kook.)

2334
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:36,680
(They must win
Jong Kook's heart today.)

2335
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,780
(He was feeling great,
and the party seemed peaceful.)

2336
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:41,600
(Which animal
rubbed him the wrong way?)

2337
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:45,500
(Their party becomes chaotic!)

2338
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:47,360
(This is the real birthday party...)

2339
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,560
(he doesn't know about.)

2340
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,770
(Tiger's Birthday Party)
