1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,570
(One refreshing day
with a nice spring breeze)

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,030
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,230
- Hello.
- Hey.

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,280
Hi.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,280
(Jae Suk is coming in.)

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,510
Did you soak your pants
in bleach or something?

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,710
- What's wrong with them?
- No.

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,240
You're not supposed
to put them in bleach.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,690
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,490
You should let
experts take care of it.

12
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,720
(He starts the day
by teasing Kwang Soo.)

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,080
- Hello, Suk Jin.
- Hello.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,790
I'm not wearing my microphone yet.

15
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,790
Okay.

16
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,790
- He's professional.
- He's not wearing a microphone.

17
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,030
- He's a pro.
- He wouldn't talk to us...

18
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,630
if it weren't for the show.

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,170
- He just sounded...
- I'm disappointed...

20
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,890
that you don't want to talk to us
without a microphone.

21
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,530
You could at least say hello to us.

22
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,270
I know. He could've said hello.

23
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,340
Why are you staring at me?
Look straight ahead.

24
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,480
What?

25
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,810
We didn't do anything, but our
viewers will be quite surprised.

26
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,850
I think so.

27
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,520
- Have a seat.
- Look at his face.

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,880
- He changes his face immediately.
- My gosh.

29
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,920
He was frowning over there.

30
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,160
But he's smiling
in front of cameras.

31
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,820
You're so... My gosh.

32
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,560
- Have a seat.
- Ji Hyo.

33
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,130
- Hello.
- Hey.

34
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,850
- Hello.
- You seem to have lost weight.

35
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,300
No, I gained weight.

36
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,320
- We have two extra seats.
- Why are there two seats?

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,790
- We have guests for today.
- Who are they?

38
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,040
- Jong Kook is not here yet.
- Where's Jong Kook?

39
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,630
What? Is Jong Kook bringing someone?

40
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,070
Jong Kook is not here yet.

41
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,730
- What?
- What about Jong Kook?

42
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,310
- Jong Kook is...
- Who is that?

43
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,310
Isn't that Hyosung?

44
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,980
- She's Hyosung.
- Hello.

45
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,600
- What?
- Welcome.

46
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,450
- She's Hyosung.
- Hello.

47
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,840
- Hello.
- What is she doing here?

48
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,150
Hello.

49
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,320
- Hyosung.
- Yes.

50
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,680
- A devoted daughter, Hyosung.
- Hello.

51
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,180
You're here again?

52
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,460
- What?
- Hello.

53
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,820
- A devoted daughter, Hyosung.
- Hello.

54
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,180
Have a seat.

55
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,090
- How have you been?
- Hello.

56
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,230
Did you come alone?

57
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,620
Mingyu is here too.
It's good to have him again.

58
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,460
- Mingyu came here alone.
- Right.

59
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,930
I see.

60
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,460
- Where's Jong Kook, by the way?
- Please have a seat.

61
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,100
- Why isn't Jong Kook here?
- There's no seat for Jong Kook.

62
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,570
- You're right.
- I bet he's doing something.

63
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,870
Today,

64
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,040
we are having Tiger Jong Kook's
Birthday Party Race.

65
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,150
- What?
- It's Jong Kook's birthday.

66
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,980
- What?
- It's Jong Kook's birthday.

67
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,710
It's April 25.

68
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,350
How can you remember all that?
It must be tough.

69
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,460
That's what his assistant does.

70
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,790
- So he remembers it.
- I'm not his assistant.

71
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,030
- He should flatter Jong Kook.
- I'm not flattering him.

72
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,090
He even got a medical
checkup with In Sung.

73
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,220
Why would you talk about it?

74
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,840
- He's always like that.
- It's just for my health.

75
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,060
It's not flattery.

76
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,340
Did you carry around
his underwear there?

77
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,560
Why would I carry his underwear?

78
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,740
While he gets changed.

79
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,280
I changed my clothes too.
Why would I do that?

80
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,340
That's what he does all the time.

81
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,150
If you assist him like that,
does he pay for your checkup?

82
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,280
- He should pay for it.
- He does pay for it.

83
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,240
- But that's not why.
- So he paid.

84
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,460
In Sung works hard to make money.

85
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,560
Sure. It's not like
he gets money for free.

86
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,530
Do you get paid monthly or what?

87
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,930
I'm just curious.

88
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,620
You guys are so mean.

89
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,990
(You guys are so mean.)

90
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,370
He doesn't get paid.

91
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,560
They've ganged up on me.

92
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,030
Do you work 52 hours a week?

93
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,310
No, he's paid
on a case by case basis.

94
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,310
On a case by case basis?

95
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,430
What are you talking about?
What 52 hours?

96
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,530
Case by case.

97
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,000
- Case by case.
- Case by case.

98
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,810
Why are you nodding your head?

99
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,970
Mingyu is cheering you up.

100
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,240
Mingyu wants you to cheer up.

101
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,710
It's been 10 minutes since I came,

102
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,180
and all I've heard is them
taunting you.

103
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,440
My gosh.

104
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,090
That's what we always do.

105
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,890
We haven't even started the day,
but I'm exhausted already.

106
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,620
It's good that you're paid.

107
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,930
All right. This Saturday,
April 25 is Jong Kook's birthday.

108
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,990
So we will give out special gifts
at the end of the day.

109
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,590
That sounds nice.

110
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,530
You will see a roulette
with 16 different items.

111
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,640
It has 12 gifts that Jong Kook
will pick and 4 duds.

112
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,710
Jong Kook will spin
the roulette at the end...

113
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,080
and take the item he picks
as a birthday gift.

114
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,710
And one of you will pay...

115
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,870
for the gift with your own card.

116
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,990
(One of the members except for
Jong Kook will pay for the gift.)

117
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,020
My goodness.

118
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,020
Things have been quite
expensive lately.

119
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,060
I didn't give you my bank card.

120
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,930
You will be paying after the race.

121
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,780
- Can I make a transfer instead?
- One of you will have...

122
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,220
an honor to pay for the gift.

123
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,460
- My gosh.
- It's an honor.

124
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,400
And we will decide
who will pay with the Running Ball.

125
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,740
We have balls with each
of your names on it...

126
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,840
including Jong Kook's
in the machine.

127
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,740
If you complete a mission
hidden in each round,

128
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,780
you can add Running Balls
with the names of members you want.

129
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,080
(Those who complete hidden missions
in each round can add the balls.)

130
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,810
I don't get rid of my name,
but I can add someone else's.

131
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,180
It means you guys should complete
missions without Jong Kook knowing.

132
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,550
And if you succeed,
you can add someone else's name.

133
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,550
I see.

134
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,500
What if we get caught by Jong Kook?

135
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,420
If Jong Kook finds out about
your hidden missions at the end,

136
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,230
he will get more chances
to spin the roulette.

137
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,230
No.

138
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,270
And it means you will
have to pay for more gifts.

139
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,530
So it's important not to get caught.

140
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,300
- I see.
- I will give you the missions...

141
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,710
you need to carry out today.

142
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,840
- What's this?
- They are all the same.

143
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,340
(Ask Jong Kook where he is
and make him say "Here I am".)

144
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,610
(Make Jong Kook call your name.
Talk using Chinese idioms.)

145
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,020
(Link your arms with Jong Kook.
Put a sticker on Jong Kook's body.)

146
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,710
- All right.
- During the entire show,

147
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,260
just like last week,
ask him "Where is Jong Kook?

148
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,780
And if he answers "Here",

149
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,920
five balls excluding the person
who asked will be added.

150
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Let me try.

151
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,290
(Where's Jong Kook?)

152
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,220
(Here I am.)

153
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,630
(It's the answer
that only Jin Young can hear.)

154
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,230
- He'd never answer if we ask him.
- He would never answer us.

155
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,530
He might say that if Hyosung asks.

156
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,340
- Right. It's advantageous to you.
- Yes!

157
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,030
- "Here I am."
- Ask him to say that.

158
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,530
- "Here I am."
- You can try this mission...

159
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,100
anytime today.

160
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,210
During the opening, you should
make him call your name.

161
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,820
- Okay.
- You can add as many names...

162
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,910
- as he calls your name.
- Okay.

163
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,110
- Jong Kook...
- That won't work.

164
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,210
Make him call my name?

165
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,090
He never calls Se Chan, Kwang Soo,
and me by our names.

166
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,780
- How does he call you?
- "Hey, you."

167
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,050
(Hey, you.)

168
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,260
- Hey.
- You idiot.

169
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,130
(You idiot.)

170
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,630
You punk.

171
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,000
Every time he says that,
I look at him.

172
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,210
I just look at him
when he calls the three of us.

173
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,360
(He responds quickly
to the personal pronouns.)

174
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,010
I look at him
when he makes this sound.

175
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,440
What about you, Ji Hyo?

176
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,230
And for the first mission,

177
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,970
you should use
Chinese idioms as you talk.

178
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,520
We will count the number of times
you say it.

179
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,280
- I say it?
- Can I say the same idioms again?

180
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,820
- No, you can't.
- Only once?

181
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,520
- So I should say it first.
- If you say it wrong...

182
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
or more than twice,
it doesn't count.

183
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,710
What if we say it wrong?

184
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,020
Does it have to suit
the circumstances?

185
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,420
What about hyeongseoljigong?

186
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,190
Please count it
if it's close enough.

187
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,790
I might want
to say it wrong for fun.

188
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll say hyeongseoljigong.
It's mine.

189
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Hyeongseoljigong is mine.

190
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
- Okay?
- Wait.

191
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,530
This is just like hyeongseoljigong.

192
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,640
I'll say cheongomabi.

193
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,300
The second mission is to link
your arms with Jong Kook.

194
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,940
For the last mission,

195
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,400
you need to put a sticker on
Jong Kook without him knowing.

196
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,710
- We will definitely get caught.
- That's risky.

197
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,610
If he finds out one of these,
we won't be able to do anything.

198
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,610
Right.

199
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,890
Let's not try the sticker thing
at the beginning.

200
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,190
It's only for the third mission.

201
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,720
It says the third mission here.

202
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,130
- One for the first mission.
- What are you doing?

203
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,290
For the second mission...

204
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,900
- I get it.
- I thought a ghost was talking.

205
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,530
- There are three missions.
- I knew it.

206
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,770
You should send him
the script in advance.

207
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,160
- Okay?
- We're doing it in order.

208
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,530
I want you to act like you just met.

209
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,840
- Okay.
- Let's go.

210
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,100
Let's get it.

211
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,440
This isn't the opening.

212
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,600
It's a secret opening.

213
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,400
There's no way he will call my name
during the opening.

214
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,780
Where's Jong Kook?

215
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,780
Here I am.

216
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,910
Here you are.

217
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,690
If I say hello to him, he'll say...

218
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,040
"Hey, you rascal."

219
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,890
"Hey, you rascal."

220
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,190
He's here. Hello, Jong Kook.

221
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,980
Hello.

222
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,830
The season of shorts is back.

223
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,790
- It's a little early though.
- Hello.

224
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,200
He's not wearing white today.

225
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,630
Are you wearing shorts already?

226
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,790
- These days...
- You try to spruce up these days.

227
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,070
- He's been wearing bright colors.
- Do you not wear shorts?

228
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,340
It's a little chilly this week.

229
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,170
- It's warm today though.
- It rained yesterday.

230
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,340
It will be cold today...

231
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,800
- because it rained yesterday.
- Really?

232
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,510
(Nervous)

233
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,970
I should buy something like this.

234
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,820
- This one is good.
- It looks nice.

235
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,340
You know what, Jong Kook?

236
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,450
You said "here" and it became
the talk of the town.

237
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,350
Gosh, it's nothing.

238
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,280
- It's just...
- Where's Jong Kook?

239
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,900
(He tries the mission carefully
pretending to have a conversation.)

240
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,130
- You should answer us too.
- Right.

241
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,920
(He tries to steal the mission.)

242
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,440
(Ji Hyo tries to steal it too.)

243
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
Where's Jong Kook?

244
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,530
Don't be silly, guys.

245
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,160
Why aren't you saying that to us?

246
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,230
We prepared something for today.

247
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,100
- What is it?
- What did they prepare?

248
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,450
- What is it?
- My gosh.

249
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,210
Oh no. It's for Jong Kook.

250
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,280
My gosh.

251
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,320
(It's a birthday cake
for Jong Kook.)

252
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,820
Oh no. It's for Jong Kook.

253
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,110
Don't do things like that.

254
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

255
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,520
(Happy birthday, Jong Kook.)

256
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,850
My gosh.

257
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,720
He finds it really embarrassing.

258
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,900
Come here.

259
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,530
(Jong Kook is very shy.)

260
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,160
Gosh, I hate it.

261
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,090
- I hate it so much.
- We have to do this.

262
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,090
- I hate it.
- You have no choice.

263
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,530
I hate it!

264
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,010
- You have no choice.
- Seriously.

265
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,400
- It's for the show.
- I hate it.

266
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,380
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
- I hate it.

267
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,600
<i>Happy birthday</i>

268
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,750
- Yes!
- Hey!

269
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,880
Why couldn't you wait
for us to count to three?

270
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,380
- I hate it.
- Look at his clothes.

271
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,810
I hate it when people sing
"Happy Birthday" for me.

272
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,990
What's worse, look at his hands.

273
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,220
- He's doing this.
- What?

274
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,410
(The figure is making hearts
with his hands.)

275
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,490
Birthday cakes and hand hearts
are the two things I hate the most.

276
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,150
In addition to that...

277
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,130
- Where is Jong Kook?
- Where is Jong Kook?

278
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,320
(And this?)

279
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,430
(While Jong Kook is embarrassed, Jae
Seok asks, "Where is Jong Kook?")

280
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,470
(Please, Jong Kook.)

281
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,570
(Will he answer this time?)

282
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,380
I'm here. I'm right here.

283
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,700
(I'm here. I'm right here.)

284
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,520
Happy birthday, Jong Kook.

285
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,850
Stop it.

286
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,480
- We don't have to celebrate.
- He's wearing shorts and leggings.

287
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,680
(Everyone except Jae Suk gets
5 Running Balls.)

288
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,580
- Happy birthday.
- My goodness.

289
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,810
To celebrate Jong Kook's birthday,

290
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,860
we're having Tiger Jong Kook's
Birthday Party Race.

291
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,320
- Today's guests are his favorites.
- Really?

292
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,420
- Unbelievable.
- Hello.

293
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,730
Mingyu.

294
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,060
Hello.

295
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,240
- Nice to see you.
- Hyosung, the good daughter.

296
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,640
- Hi.
- Hello.

297
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,980
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.

298
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,010
- Hello.
- Where should I stand?

299
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,150
- Mingyu is so handsome.
- Right.

300
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,670
- He is.
- Thank you.

301
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,540
- He reminds me of some celebrities.
- He does.

302
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,720
Kangta, for example.

303
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,780
- Choi Si Won too.
- That's right.

304
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,990
He reminds me of them.

305
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,050
He has well-defined features.

306
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,410
- Doesn't he look like them?
- Yes.

307
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,920
He has the perfect
SM Entertainment face.

308
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,050
- The "SM Entertainment face"?
- The "SM Entertainment face"?

309
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,290
- He has the SM face.
- Definitely.

310
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,050
What about Se Chan?

311
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,820
- Which agency likes his face?
- Which agency?

312
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,920
Is there any agency at all?

313
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,470
- I know.
- Which one?

314
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,500
Oyang Seafood.

315
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,900
- Okay.
- Oyang Seafood.

316
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,430
- Oyang Seafood?
- Oyang Seafood.

317
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,430
- Oyang Seafood.
- Oyang Seafood.

318
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,070
Mingyu has something in common...

319
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,780
- with Jong Kook.
- That's right.

320
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,350
- They're both from Anyang.
- He's from Anyang too.

321
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,750
- What's Jong Kook's status there?
- Are there any rumors?

322
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,050
What rumors?

323
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,220
- I doubt he's heard anything.
- No?

324
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,950
(Jong Kook says Mingyu's name,
which is the hidden mission.)

325
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,950
- You haven't heard anything?
- He was a legend 10 years ago.

326
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,320
- 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?

327
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,420
I heard there's a statue of him
next to the statue of...

328
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,790
Admiral Yi Sun Sin
at Anyang Elementary School.

329
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,500
It looks like this.

330
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,500
The statue is doing this.

331
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,640
But the Anyang community is
very close-knit.

332
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,110
- We benefit from it a lot.
- The "Anyang community"?

333
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,070
Whenever I win an award,

334
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,880
- they put up...
- They put up banners?

335
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,350
- banners at the intersection.
- Right.

336
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,080
Your neighbors put up
a banner for you too.

337
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,310
They did? What does it say?

338
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,890
That you got a health check-up
with In Sung.

339
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,910
What are you talking about?

340
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,310
(Lee Kwang Soo Accompanies
Zo In Sung to His Health Check-Up)

341
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,490
Why would they put up such a banner?

342
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,420
Kwang Soo is running.

343
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,450
It's big news.

344
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,860
You escorted In Sung
to his health check-up?

345
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,060
It's definitely worth
putting up a banner.

346
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,770
They didn't put it up?

347
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,970
Why would they?

348
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,740
You're being ridiculous.

349
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,270
Why are you dressed...

350
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,780
like a moron today?

351
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,010
A "moron"?

352
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,850
- Hey.
- Hold on.

353
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,800
How could you say that?

354
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,250
- No one has ever called me that.
- What's with you today?

355
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,780
Did you dip your jeans
in bleach or something?

356
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm dressed like a moron today?

357
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,720
- A moron?
- Unbelievable.

358
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
(Today's star is feeling happy
after teasing Kwang Soo.)

359
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,990
Today, we're having...

360
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,190
Tiger Jong Kook's
Birthday Party Race.

361
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,290
At the end of the race, Jong Kook
will win a gift he picks...

362
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,630
- by spinning a roulette wheel.
- Me?

363
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,790
- Only him?
- Here's the thing.

364
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,530
The roulette wheel has...

365
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,270
12 slots filled with
gifts Jong Kook want...

366
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,800
and four slots that are duds.

367
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,240
What? Gosh.

368
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,940
For the missions,
you'll divide into 3 teams of 3.

369
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,720
If Jong Kook's team wins, one
dud slot will be filled with a gift.

370
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,250
If his team finishes at the bottom,
a gift will be replaced with a dud.

371
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,050
- We should win.
- What if we come in second place?

372
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,910
If another team wins,

373
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,150
they can add their team sticker
on a gift they want.

374
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,690
If Jong Kook spins
the roulette wheel...

375
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,030
and happens to pick that gift,

376
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,560
the gift goes to the team
that added the sticker.

377
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,900
- Jong Kook, here's a list...
- Yes?

378
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,200
- of gifts you can choose from.
- I can see it?

379
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,070
There are many nice things
these days.

380
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,530
- You're right.
- What should I choose?

381
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,700
Choose a sofa.

382
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,040
- A sofa?
- A sofa would be nice.

383
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,070
I got a sofa
from Kwang Soo's father's company.

384
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,280
(Jong Kook says Kwang Soo's name.)

385
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,780
- I got it for free.
- Really?

386
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,580
I didn't pay for it.

387
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,310
Please thank him for me again.

388
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,410
Okay.

389
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,630
- Thank you. I really like it.
- You're welcome.

390
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,890
Do you have a dryer?

391
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,730
What's that?

392
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,230
- A clothes dryer.
- It's really useful.

393
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,530
- It'll give you a new life.
- At home...

394
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,230
- It uses too much electricity.
- No, it doesn't.

395
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,660
- Gosh.
- It doesn't.

396
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,240
What about soccer socks?

397
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,660
I have a ton of them at home.

398
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,640
- Soccer socks are a bit...
- Suk Jin is being so petty.

399
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,650
Why would you choose soccer socks?

400
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,410
(One of them has to pay for the gift
with his or her own card.)

401
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,180
Things have been quite
expensive lately.

402
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,950
What about tanning oil?

403
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,920
I have a lot.
Why would I choose that?

404
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,990
- Choose a coffee machine.
- Choose a coffee machine.

405
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,190
- I have one at home.
- Choose a coffee machine.

406
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,500
Just choose it.

407
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,290
- I don't use it a lot.
- Choose workout clothes.

408
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,130
Wouldn't workout clothes be nice?

409
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,500
I already have a lot.

410
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,060
Don't choose anything then.

411
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,200
(Jae Suk explodes.)

412
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,830
Leave him alone.

413
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,670
(Who cares if it's your birthday.)

414
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,400
Why do you say no to everything?

415
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,520
Will you take this
a bit more seriously?

416
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,070
My goodness.

417
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,310
How does a gym equipment
voucher sound?

418
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,720
- That sounds good.
- A gym equipment voucher.

419
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,490
- Please write them down.
- Gym equipment sounds nice.

420
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,730
- He has to choose six, right?
- Yes.

421
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,950
Pick 6 gifts, and fill 2 slots
with each of them.

422
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,320
A clothes dryer is really nice.

423
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,030
It's too expensive.
Why are you doing this?

424
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,820
It's not like you're paying for it
anyway.

425
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,640
- What's with you?
- What do you care?

426
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,900
Still, SBS should save money.

427
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,400
Since when do you worry about that?

428
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,330
If you want SBS to save money,
go home.

429
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,300
- Jae Suk.
- Go home.

430
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,810
- We'll put you on the phone.
- That sounds good.

431
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,480
Let's just talk on the phone.

432
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,620
A clothes dryer costs
at least 1,200 to 1,300 dollars.

433
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,680
- My goodness.
- It's way too expensive.

434
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,320
- A laptop is expensive too.
- That's hilarious.

435
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,150
Since this is Tiger Jong Kook's
Birthday Party Race,

436
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,290
Jong Kook gets to decide teams.

437
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,900
- That's unfair.
- Really?

438
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,100
- Is that okay?
- In a moment,

439
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,790
we'll go up to the gym
on the 17th floor.

440
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,800
- What?
- Is there a gym?

441
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
While Jong Kook is outside,

442
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,570
the rest of you will put
a number assigned to you...

443
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,540
on the equipment
you think Jong Kook likes.

444
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,070
- I know it exactly.
- Me too.

445
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,070
I have no idea.

446
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,020
Jong Kook will pick
his two teammates...

447
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,050
by choosing two numbers
on the equipment.

448
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,530
Kwang Soo, Haha, and I have to know.

449
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,680
But here's the thing.

450
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,400
It might not be such a good idea
to team up with Jong Kook.

451
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,730
- Why not?
- If Jong Kook's team wins a gift,

452
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,320
it goes to Jong Kook.

453
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,370
If another team wins a gift,
it'll go to one of them.

454
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,900
- There's no point in winning.
- Right.

455
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,270
Just think of it
as you're giving me a gift.

456
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,300
And who knows if Jong Kook will
give away the gift to a teammate?

457
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,170
- You never know.
- That's right.

458
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,570
You know what I'm like.
I'll definitely give it away.

459
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,070
Do you think I'll accept it?

460
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,680
- I'll give it away.
- All right.

461
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,990
- Let's go up to the 17th floor.
- Okay.

462
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,620
Get your bags.

463
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,890
Let's go.

464
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,920
- Thanks, Se Chan.
- Here you go.

465
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,550
Thank you.

466
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,000
- He said my name.
- What?

467
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,730
- He said my name.
- He did?

468
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,970
He just said my name.
I'm sure it was caught on camera.

469
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,030
- What's this place? I had no idea.
- It looks very nice.

470
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,930
There's some gym equipment I prefer,

471
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,940
but when I go in,
I'll try everything out anyway.

472
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,040
If I find something...

473
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,980
- And then you'll make a choice.
- that works really well,

474
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,310
I might choose that equipment
instead.

475
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,450
Each of you has to choose
a different piece of equipment.

476
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,410
- Who goes first?
- You can all start now.

477
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,780
- All at the same time?
- All at the same time?

478
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,050
This is...

479
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,450
Hello.

480
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,130
- Hello.
- Give them to me.

481
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,650
The gym looks nice.

482
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,690
- Hello.
- Three.

483
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,030
- In order.
- How many do we get?

484
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,270
- The equipment looks very nice.
- This is not it.

485
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,400
This is definitely not it.

486
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,200
Chest? Shoulders?

487
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,980
He's never going to choose
a treadmill.

488
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,280
This is it.

489
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,880
(Kwang Soo has worked out
with Jong Kook a lot.)

490
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,040
- The leg press?
- Yes.

491
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,720
It's Jong Kook's favorite.

492
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,170
- It's for the legs?
- I put my number on it.

493
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,990
Gosh, I wanted this.

494
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,350
- Who's number four?
- I'm sure. It's me.

495
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,150
I wanted to choose this too.

496
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,490
- I'm confident.
- He might choose a treadmill.

497
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,920
For your information, Jong Kook
trained his upper body yesterday.

498
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,320
- Really?
- Yes.

499
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,530
(Hyosung can't tell the different
kinds of equipment apart.)

500
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,130
Where do I put my number?

501
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,920
- Would he choose the bench press?
- I'm 100 percent sure.

502
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,660
- This is it.
- He definitely likes it.

503
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,500
- This...
- The Smith machine?

504
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,370
(Haha picks the Smith machine.)

505
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,430
- The arms and shoulders...
- Have a seat.

506
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,470
Would he choose this?

507
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,280
- The Smith machine?
- This?

508
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,640
- Okay.
- The leg curl.

509
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,300
I choose this.

510
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,170
He might choose this.
He likes leg exercises.

511
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,750
He's still outside, right?

512
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,410
You sounded so awkward
in the elevator.

513
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,360
- Does Jong Kook do cardio?
- It's Hyosung's fault.

514
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,760
- Hyosung made it so obvious.
- What?

515
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,030
You want to be aggressive?

516
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,930
I watched the show yesterday,

517
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,120
- and "I'm here" was hilarious.
- Gosh, it's embarrassing.

518
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,270
If I say, "Where is Jong Kook?"
will you answer me?

519
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,360
Where is Jong Kook?

520
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,560
Please stop.

521
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,910
(Is this how she's going to play?)

522
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,630
- She's determined.
- I can't believe her.

523
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,450
- Where is Jong Kook?
- Hold on.

524
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,570
- Say it for me.
- Why are you doing this?

525
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,600
- Why are you doing this?
- Where is Jong Kook?

526
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,310
Guys.

527
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,420
If we don't play this right,
we all lose.

528
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,810
We should be careful
in the beginning.

529
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,760
If we win,
we get to add a sticker, right?

530
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,280
- Yes.
- That's right.

531
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,690
- We should try to win.
- In that sense,

532
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,200
it's better not to team up
with Jong Kook...

533
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,620
- to win a gift.
- But someone has to.

534
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,700
"Someone has to"?

535
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,440
Someone has to.

536
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,030
- Hold on.
- It's better not to.

537
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,740
Then I'll choose something
he's not going to choose.

538
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,030
It's better not to team up with him.

539
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,480
- He might not give the gift away.
- I think I'll choose that one.

540
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,910
I know he's definitely going to
choose this.

541
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,570
You should choose it.

542
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,520
- I chose that one over there.
- This stands out too much.

543
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,750
I know he's never going to choose
a gym ball.

544
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,280
- I can choose this, right?
- Of course.

545
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,490
Then I'll choose this.

546
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,110
(They're suddenly trying
not to be chosen by Jong Kook.)

547
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,760
(Se Chan chooses
a small medicine ball.)

548
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,660
You have only one minute left.

549
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,620
(Kwang Soo chooses a latex band
used for Pilates.)

550
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,240
(Which 2 pieces of equipment
will Jong Kook choose?)

551
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,240
- Hello.
- Hi.

552
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,980
- Welcome, Jong Kook.
- It's good to see you.

553
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,330
Jong Kook, hi.
Please take a look around.

554
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,510
It's nice.

555
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,910
Here's the inverted machine.

556
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,870
- Do you like that?
- Someone stuck a sticker on that.

557
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,840
I thought you liked that.

558
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,140
I do.

559
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,280
That's for the shoulders.

560
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,490
- The back machine.
- Oh, yes. My goodness.

561
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,520
You love this one, don't you?

562
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,550
I should try the ones
with the stickers on them.

563
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,730
Go ahead.

564
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,760
Jong Kook, how's the taste?

565
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,470
- How delicious!
- What does it taste like?

566
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,530
- Jong Kook?
- How tasty!

567
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,560
Is it that good?

568
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,710
This is Homecook Mr. Back.

569
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,240
Homecook Mr. Back.

570
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,600
It provides Jong Kook's back
with all the right nutrients.

571
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,780
It'd be incredible
with some soy sauce.

572
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
My gosh.

573
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,950
Then...

574
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,840
- No way.
- This one.

575
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,810
Are you choosing this one?

576
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,310
- This...
- It tastes incredible.

577
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,960
- That's it.
- How tasty.

578
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,820
Jong Kook's first choice
is equipment number eight.

579
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,350
- Number eight.
- Who chose that one?

580
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,500
Number eight, okay.

581
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,170
- Number 8.
- Number 8.

582
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,860
Jong Kook, here's another one
that works the lat muscles.

583
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,000
(It's another machine for the lats.)

584
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,240
- He's loving it.
- I love this one.

585
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
- This one's nice.
- This one?

586
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,940
It has a lot of features.

587
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,100
How does this work?

588
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,870
There's one of these in every gym.

589
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,070
Shouldn't you sit down?

590
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,340
You can stand if you want.

591
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,710
- If you do it while standing...
- How tasty.

592
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,140
Your muscles
are like hyeongseoljigong.

593
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,280
(Out of the blue)

594
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,920
(Saying a Chinese idiom
is for mission number 1.)

595
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,080
(We haven't begun
mission number one yet.)

596
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,520
- Why?
- Hyeongseoljigong?

597
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,920
- Seriously?
- Does it not make sense?

598
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,620
- Don't push it.
- How delicious.

599
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,660
Is it that good?

600
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,990
There's a gym ball here.

601
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,000
Where?

602
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,230
A gym ball.

603
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,930
A gym ball?

604
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This...

605
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,000
Who would use a gym ball?

606
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,330
(Who would use a gym ball?)

607
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,940
Who would use a gym ball?

608
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,010
(The cameraman was hit
by the bouncing gym ball.)

609
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,210
Are you all right?

610
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,510
- Are you all right?
- Hold on.

611
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,600
I saw you lose your balance.

612
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,030
He was hit in the back of his head.

613
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,370
The ball got him twice.

614
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,040
Whoever placed a sticker on there
wasn't taking this seriously.

615
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,540
Don't you find it appalling that
someone would put a sticker there?

616
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,140
- This...
- Right?

617
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,460
Just think about it.

618
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,990
Whoever this is
didn't want to be on my team.

619
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,190
Just look.

620
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,380
The ball is the smaller one too.

621
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,260
- That's...
- I find this disgraceful.

622
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,200
Right? That's someone being cheeky.

623
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,770
It sure is.

624
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,790
- I agree.
- Right?

625
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,170
Jong Kook, you want to see
who the cheekiest is?

626
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,530
What do you think about this?

627
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,060
Isn't this despicable?

628
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,830
- But that...
- This,

629
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,870
- this, and the gym ball.
- The gym ball.

630
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,870
Bring that over here.

631
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,140
- The problematic trio.
- The despicable three.

632
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,780
They clearly didn't want
to be on your team.

633
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,020
- You're right.
- Right?

634
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,850
They must've been chosen
by those who know me well.

635
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,380
- They're all awful choices.
- They know what I hate.

636
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,530
You must catch
the three who chose these.

637
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,200
- My gosh.
- The rubber equipment.

638
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,850
- You must sniff them out.
- Right.

639
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,030
- How funny.
- They must be caught.

640
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,090
(Jong Kook hasn't been
this serious before.)

641
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,090
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

642
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,770
Think about the rule of this game.

643
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,800
- Why are you speaking up?
- What?

644
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,300
You must be one of them.

645
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,030
You must've chosen 1 out of these 3.

646
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,980
You're better off choosing
the equipment you like.

647
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,300
- He must've chosen one of them.
- Right?

648
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,210
Whoever chose the resistance band
is more despicable.

649
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,370
- Why?
- Do you work out with that?

650
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,450
What's wrong with a resistance band?

651
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,720
(Why?)

652
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,750
What?

653
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,340
I mean...

654
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,920
I'm sure Jong Kook stretches.

655
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Would Jong Kook work out
with a resistance band?

656
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,050
- You saw me using this?
- That's far-fetched.

657
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,380
This lame thing?

658
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,200
This lame thing?

659
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,530
(He's close to arresting
rubber offender number 2.)

660
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,770
The ball is used
to work your back at least.

661
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,700
Exactly. I have no business
using a resistance band.

662
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,470
- It can be used for other things.
- Like what?

663
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,860
Like this. It can be used this way.

664
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,370
- Is that so?
- That's one of the functions.

665
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,130
To be honest though,

666
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,780
what I find most
despicable and shady...

667
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,480
is the fact that someone chose
this lighter ball.

668
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,720
- Right.
- Why?

669
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,250
That choice seems shady to you?

670
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,720
Imagine the thought process
behind that.

671
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,220
Jong Kook must be in shock.

672
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,420
What was the intention behind it?

673
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,380
Is that so?

674
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,090
- Really?
- Look at his expression.

675
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,290
- Is that how it is?
- No way.

676
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,170
By that rat?

677
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,470
(That rat chose this ball?)

678
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,630
- I wonder why.
- That's not it.

679
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,130
- But...
- I agree.

680
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,510
It truly is despicable.

681
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,710
- That rat?
- Just think about it.

682
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,440
That's why this rat chose this ball?

683
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,070
Whoever it is...

684
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,130
- But...
- Let me say one more thing.

685
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,640
- This is bad.
- The number was facing the back,

686
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,250
but I turned it around
for you to see.

687
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,370
- Is that so?
- Yes.

688
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,780
(And like that...)

689
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,140
Okay, all right.

690
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,020
- Then...
- Yes.

691
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,020
I choose this one.

692
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,420
You chose numbers 2 and 8.

693
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,920
(Jong Kook chooses number 2 and 8.)

694
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,930
Joining Team Jong Kook
is Se Chan who chose...

695
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,730
the medicine ball.

696
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,000
- Unbelievable.
- I chose that...

697
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,390
because I foresaw this.

698
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,290
- I doubt it.
- How cool is this, right?

699
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,740
I knew you'd choose
one you like and one you hate.

700
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,710
It wasn't easy
choosing the right one.

701
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,670
Jong Kook's second teammate...

702
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,010
is Mingyu.

703
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,100
(Mingyu from Anyang
joins Team Jong Kook.)

704
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,840
Was it you, Mingyu? Gosh.

705
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,020
- How sweet of him.
- You chose a good one.

706
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,220
The others must be
split into teams too,

707
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,250
so how will you do this?

708
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,880
Hyosung and Ji Hyo
can choose their teams.

709
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,380
Play rock-paper-scissors
to choose members.

710
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,780
(The teams:
Jong Kook, Se Chan, Mingyu)

711
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,530
(Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, Hyosung)

712
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,820
(Suk Jin, Haha, Ji Hyo)

713
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,360
- We should stand in our teams.
- Right.

714
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,500
Are you happy with your teams?

715
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,090
- Yes.
- It's perfect.

716
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,860
- Let's do this.
- Let's win today.

717
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,170
- It's too annoying to let him win.
- Exactly.

718
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,210
- The others...
- Hold on a second.

719
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,010
Haha and Suk Jin...

720
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,180
are enthusiastic about today's game,

721
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,450
- but Ji Hyo is silent.
- Where's your enthusiasm?

722
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,950
Better luck next week then.

723
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,040
- Take a pass on this week.
- Right.

724
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,610
We always have
next week to look forward to.

725
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,690
Of course.

726
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,460
This next mission
is perfect for Jong Kook...

727
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,960
since he's a man with keen insight.

728
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,280
The game is called
Do You See What I'm Eating?

729
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,930
(Round 1:
Do You See What I'm Eating?)

730
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,160
- I see it.
- Sound must be involved.

731
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,290
One team will sit behind
a divider...

732
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:02,030
and will get three minutes each...

733
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,170
to eat the chosen dish.

734
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,440
The other teams will win a point...

735
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,180
if they guess what dish is it
without smelling it.

736
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,280
So we have to rely
on our eyes and the sound.

737
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,310
Two teams will get to guess
what the dish is.

738
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,880
The team eating the dish
will win a point...

739
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,750
if the other teams...

740
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,880
don't manage to guess right
during those three minutes.

741
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,990
(That's how the team eating
can win a point.)

742
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,160
- Okay.
- Got it.

743
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,230
- What a hyeongseoljigong situation.
- Yes.

744
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,430
(Jae Suk fit in hyeongseoljigong
within his conversation.)

745
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,560
(Hidden mission)

746
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,200
(Talk using Chinese idioms.)

747
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,300
(It must be correct
and only used once.)

748
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,570
(Jae Suk successfully
squeezes in a Chinese idiom.)

749
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,480
Hyeongseoljigong is mine, you know.

750
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,250
That's my catchphrase from now on.

751
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,780
- Hyeongseoljigong.
- Gosh.

752
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,310
What was that idiom
with the black and...

753
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,520
- Geunmukjaheuk?
- What...

754
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,610
Geunmukjaheuk?

755
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,780
I was clueless, wasn't I?

756
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,190
Right, geunmukjaheuk.

757
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,190
What does geunmukjaheuk mean?

758
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,200
It means you turn black too...

759
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,730
if you dive yourself
into black colors.

760
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,120
So it's not something good.
You "geunmukjadeuk".

761
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,170
(Geunmukjadeuk?)

762
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,060
- Unbelievable.
- It's "heuk" not deuk.

763
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,710
- It's geunmukjaheuk.
- Deuk?

764
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,470
You got confused with jaupjadeuk.

765
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,940
- Right, jaupjadeuk.
- Jaupjadeuk.

766
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,010
It's confusing.

767
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,010
- How beeilbeejae.
- How iljamusik.

768
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,280
Iltassangpi.

769
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,450
(This one doesn't count.)

770
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,880
- Team Jae Suk will go first.
- Sure.

771
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,340
Okay.

772
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,580
(Team Jae Suk
randomly chose a dish.)

773
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,260
- Unbelievable.
- It'll be easy to guess.

774
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,030
This is too small for my nose.

775
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,550
Hey, it's Inspector Gadget.

776
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,260
Go, go, Gadget Arms.

777
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,560
Here comes the food.

778
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,320
My gosh.

779
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,440
Do you think
we can guess this right?

780
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,470
(They can only rely
on what they hear.)

781
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,670
- No way.
- This will be too obvious.

782
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,910
We need to duck while eating.

783
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,870
Ready, set, go.

784
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,680
(They eat the first dish.)

785
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,920
Go.

786
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,040
(The viewers at home
should try and guess too.)

787
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,160
- Wait, that...
- Unbelievable.

788
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,200
(They all prick up their ears.)

789
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,430
He took a bite.

790
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,730
(They keep hearing crunchy sounds.)

791
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,090
What could be that crunchy?

792
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,500
(They keep hearing crunchy sounds.)

793
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,770
It's young radish kimchi.

794
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,970
(Whispering)

795
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,130
- I'm sure of it.
- What could be that crunchy?

796
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,600
You should be trying to mask
what we're eating.

797
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,220
Don't just enjoy the dish.

798
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,640
We're not trying
to make it sound delicious.

799
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,190
- I think you're right.
- Right?

800
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,340
- Yes, what you said.
- Go ahead then.

801
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,880
- Young radish kimchi.
- Don't make it sound delicious.

802
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,550
(Young radish kimchi?)

803
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,350
- Shall we make a guess?
- I'm sure of it.

804
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,580
Let's do it. Say what you told us.

805
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,760
Let me answer!

806
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,090
Young radish kimchi.

807
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,000
(Team Jong Kook guesses
young radish kimchi.)

808
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,700
(The first dish sounded crunchy
when Jae Suk ate it.)

809
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,270
(Is it young radish kimchi?)

810
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,330
(That is incorrect.)

811
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,330
- That's not it?
- It must be something similar.

812
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,240
- Jae Suk knows what he's doing.
- Exactly.

813
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,210
Anyway, Jae Suk's done.

814
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,530
I'm worried.

815
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,800
- Let's see how Hyosung does.
- Hyosung, go ahead.

816
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,810
(Hyosung takes a bite
out of the dish too.)

817
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,450
It could have a different name.

818
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,350
- It's a fritter.
- Yes, I agree.

819
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,660
- Right?
- It's a fritter.

820
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,960
- A fritter.
- Deep-fried crab?

821
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,560
It doesn't have an easy name.

822
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
(Just then,)

823
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,270
(they hear a clear crunchy sound.)

824
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,000
- I'm sure it's a fritter.
- She took a bite.

825
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,410
How about deep-fried shrimp?

826
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,410
(He's not sure.)

827
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,740
How about deep-fried shrimp?

828
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,830
- Let's answer.
- Let's do this.

829
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,980
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

830
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,540
- Deep-fried shrimp.
- Deep-fried shrimp.

831
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,840
(Team Suk Jin
thinks it's deep-fried shrimp.)

832
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,980
(That is incorrect.)

833
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,140
Isn't it a fritter?

834
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,990
(She makes sure it looks crunchy.)

835
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,190
- She's not making a mess.
- Good job, Hyosung.

836
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,720
It's our turn to guess now.

837
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,550
- You have 20 seconds.
- Got it.

838
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,780
- Hey, Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo...

839
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,000
(Banging)

840
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
(Thudding)

841
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,500
(Bumping)

842
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,060
(The additional noise
of the plate thumping)

843
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,330
Don't tap on the table.

844
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,860
You shouldn't touch the plate.

845
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,270
I know he's my teammate,
but he sure plays dirty.

846
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,130
(The dirtiest player ever
does his very best.)

847
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,280
- So...
- From what I can tell,

848
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,250
he's only eating...

849
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,680
the surrounding pieces
and not what's in the center.

850
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,450
He's not touching
those that give off a crunchy sound.

851
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,840
It has to be a dish...

852
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,660
that gives off a lot of noise
when you eat it.

853
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,190
- Crunchy...
- I love this dish.

854
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,050
- Isn't it salty?
- Hold on.

855
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,490
I saw bits of cucumber.

856
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,050
I saw bits of cucumber.

857
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,500
(Kwang Soo made the mistake
of showing what he's eating.)

858
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,000
- Cucumber?
- I saw something white.

859
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,790
I saw something
when he opened his mouth.

860
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,890
It's white.

861
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:33,170
(They saw something white
in his mouth. What is it?)

862
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,010
- Cucumber?
- Yes.

863
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,010
- That's not a dish.
- One.

864
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,010
Pickled cucumber.

865
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,140
(Team Jong Kook's answer:
pickled cucumber)

866
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,540
(Incorrect)

867
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,190
It'd be a shame
if you don't get it.

868
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,190
Tonkatsu

869
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,760
- Let's go with tonkatsu.
- 1, 2, 3.

870
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,050
- I don't think so.
- Tonkatsu.

871
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,880
(Team Suk Jin's answer:
tonkatsu)

872
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,550
(Is tonkatsu correct?)

873
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,590
(Incorrect)

874
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,050
- Okay!
- That's not what I heard.

875
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,860
Okay!

876
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,120
- What was it?
- What is it?

877
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,770
It was fried dumplings.

878
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,530
Fried dumplings.

879
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,010
See? It was something fried.

880
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,530
That was so hot.

881
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,510
(Crunchy fried dumplings ASMR)

882
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,020
It could have a different name.

883
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,780
I didn't hear it.

884
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,080
It's crunchy around the border
and soft in the center.

885
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,550
- That's what I thought.
- You were right.

886
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,660
That's what made it tough.

887
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,430
(Team Suk Jin is next.)

888
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,690
(What will they get to eat?)

889
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,730
All right.

890
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,170
Who knows why
Suk Jin is sitting over here?

891
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,620
- He wants to eat.
- He's hungry.

892
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,770
Correct. He wants to eat.

893
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,590
- I might not get to eat at the end.
- That's right.

894
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,360
- Suk Jin can't hide it.
- No, he can't.

895
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,370
He can't be on an eating show
because he's a picky eater.

896
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,870
Oh, my. I'm a meticulous person,
so it won't be easy.

897
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,750
(Boasting)

898
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,780
Nobody is listening.

899
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
It's okay. I can talk to myself.
It's okay.

900
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,920
You live alone. It's all right.

901
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,520
Keep going. It's okay.

902
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,960
- Are you really okay?
- I talk to myself frequently.

903
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
It's okay.

904
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,320
It's okay.
I talk to myself at home too.

905
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,850
It's sadder because he pretends
he's cool about it.

906
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,120
It's okay.

907
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,890
Don't show it.

908
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,770
I hope we get it
as soon as he takes a bite.

909
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,090
That's not possible.

910
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,670
This is... What is this?

911
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,410
Suk Jin, I'll guess
as soon as you take one bite.

912
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,010
Ready, set, go.

913
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,180
(What will they get to eat?)

914
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,640
- Just start.
- This is overwhelming.

915
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
(He's careful.)

916
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,490
- It's guksu.
- It's noodles.

917
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,750
Right?

918
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,050
(It's guksu. It's noodles.)

919
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,990
(They guess on his first bite.)

920
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,880
Oh, gosh.

921
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,390
Gosh, Suk Jin.

922
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,260
It's guksu for sure.

923
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,670
(He tries to make up for it
with his poor acting.)

924
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,970
He won't be able to do an
eating show on Ji Suk Jin World.

925
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,060
(Ji Suk Jin World can't be
an eating show.)

926
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,570
He was reviewing cars last time.

927
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,510
(You must be a subscriber.)

928
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,640
- You must be a subscriber.
- Yes.

929
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,810
(Kim Jong Kook,
1 of 72.5 thousand subscribers)

930
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,520
That's great.

931
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,340
I want to see how far he gets.

932
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,880
Do you watch him?

933
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,110
I guess he really likes Suk Jin.

934
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,350
He doesn't know a thing about cars,
but he was doing a review on them.

935
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,350
You start as a hater
and become a fan.

936
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,120
- Is that true?
- Yes.

937
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,350
You realize what's on their heart.

938
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,350
Great strategy.

939
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,890
Give a hint to your subscriber.

940
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,700
(He doesn't give preference,
but he's giving out hints.)

941
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,060
- It's udon.
- Udon.

942
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,510
- Let me answer. Udon.
- Let me answer. Udon.

943
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,280
(Team Jae Suk's answer: udon)

944
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,630
That's too bad.

945
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,340
It's a type of noodle.

946
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,870
Kimchi guksu or janchi guksu.

947
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,810
Janchi guksu is a good guess.

948
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,840
Should we go with that?

949
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,660
(Black shell?)

950
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,660
- Be careful.
- Hey.

951
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,490
I see a clam.

952
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,960
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

953
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,760
I don't think that's good.

954
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,090
- Hold back. We have to win.
- Suk Jin.

955
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,790
- It's a clam, right?
- Kalguksu.

956
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,000
- Kalguksu with Manila clams.
- It's clam.

957
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,560
- Kalguksu with Manila clams.
- 1, 2, 3.

958
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,670
- Kalguksu with Manila clams.
- Kalguksu with Manila clams.

959
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,360
(Team Jong Kook's answer:
Kalguksu with Manila clams)

960
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,870
(Incorrect)

961
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,600
- He's not chewing on the clam.
- He's not.

962
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,780
- He made the sound on purpose.
- You can suck it.

963
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,250
If you're done,
the next person can start.

964
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,370
(It's Haha's turn.)

965
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,610
Watch him carefully.

966
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,840
Dong Hoon will savor the food.

967
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,140
Okay.

968
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,850
I'm going to eat now.

969
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,880
(This is the standard
eating show ASMR.)

970
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,120
- It's hot.
- He's good at this.

971
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,730
(This is the standard
eating show ASMR.)

972
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,270
(Haha's ASMR, live streaming)

973
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,270
(That looks good.
What are you eating?)

974
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,390
I'm sure it's noodles.

975
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,440
This is so hard.

976
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,570
(Slurping)

977
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,280
I'm getting hungry now. What is it?

978
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,800
(Swallowing)

979
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,750
What's that? It sounds so good.

980
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,070
Is it hot? What's the matter?

981
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,840
- What is it?
- He's good. He's good at ASMR.

982
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,080
(So this is how you do it.)

983
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,110
Are you eating the plate too?

984
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
This is good.

985
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,530
Is he done?

986
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,230
- Is he done?
- I'll eat one more time.

987
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,120
He's good.

988
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,700
(He's practically
giving it to them,)

989
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,510
(but they still have no clue.)

990
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,670
What can it be?

991
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,480
- It's a type of noodle.
- It is.

992
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,280
It doesn't have to be noodles
to sound like this.

993
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,340
- That's true.
- I heard this earlier.

994
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,280
Good job. Good job, Haha.

995
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,610
- Ji Hyo's next.
- It's Ji Hyo.

996
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,140
This is her first time
conducting an eating show.

997
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,280
This is my first time.

998
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,420
I'll eat without trying
to trick you.

999
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,590
(It's a mystery again.)

1000
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,590
This is driving me insane.

1001
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,790
I have no clue.

1002
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,390
- What is that?
- She's good.

1003
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,790
- Good luck, Ji Hyo.
- No wonder she's an actress.

1004
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,170
I'm sure it has soup.

1005
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,970
- What?
- It has soup.

1006
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,510
Is it hot? Hot soup?

1007
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,530
(Watching closely)

1008
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,070
Ji Hyo ate...

1009
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,870
- I think so.
- She exhaled.

1010
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,610
That means it's hot soup.

1011
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,250
What is it?

1012
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,750
- I don't know.
- Jjamppong?

1013
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,020
(Is it jjamppong?)

1014
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,080
Is it mala soup?

1015
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,190
1, 2, 3.

1016
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,280
- Jjamppong.
- Jjamppong.

1017
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,610
(Team Jae Suk's answer: jjamppong)

1018
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,580
(He saw her breath.
Is it jjamppong?)

1019
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,230
Okay!

1020
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,850
(Correct)

1021
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,030
Okay!

1022
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,500
- At the end.
- We almost had it.

1023
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,440
(Team Jae Suk earns 1 point
and leads with 2 points.)

1024
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,670
That was great reasoning.

1025
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,740
- Because...
- See?

1026
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,970
How did you know?

1027
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,240
- Ji Hyo...
- Right.

1028
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,450
At the end,
she did this with her lips.

1029
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,070
- Right.
- How did you know?

1030
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,180
(Detective Yu realized that
she was eating something spicy.)

1031
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,450
This is...

1032
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,990
(She drank the spicy soup.)

1033
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,990
(Exhaling)

1034
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,430
It looked spicy and hot.

1035
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,490
Right?

1036
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,430
How did you get jjamppong?

1037
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,990
Don't relax too much.

1038
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,330
Block your nose properly.

1039
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,540
- I know.
- I can't see at all.

1040
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,790
Jong Kook has to duck a little more.

1041
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,260
- They're getting something.
- Let's see.

1042
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,870
Oh, dear.

1043
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,140
- Here?
- Mingyu.

1044
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
- Yes.
- Are you doing good?

1045
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,350
It's something
Jong Kook doesn't like.

1046
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,350
- It's something he doesn't like.
- It's something he doesn't like.

1047
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,010
- It's something fried.
- I bet it is.

1048
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,010
- He doesn't look too happy.
- No.

1049
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,310
I don't think you'll ever get it.

1050
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,910
Let's get started. Ready, set, go.

1051
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:59,260
(He's being noisy.)

1052
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,560
- Is it noodles?
- What is that?

1053
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,720
It's ramyeon.

1054
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,660
- It's not.
- It's not ramyeon.

1055
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,760
He's making that sound on purpose.

1056
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
- I agree. It's not guksu.
- It's not guksu.

1057
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,910
It's something other than guksu.

1058
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,660
That's true.
It doesn't sound like noodles.

1059
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,870
- Is it tonkatsu?
- It's like wheat noodles.

1060
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,930
I'm done.

1061
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,350
- You're done?
- There's not much.

1062
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,350
- There's nothing on his lips.
- Really?

1063
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,540
You didn't eat.

1064
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,080
- What?
- You didn't eat.

1065
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,640
- I did.
- It's red.

1066
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,680
I have a good feeling.

1067
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,350
(Jong Kook is being noisy too.)

1068
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,620
(What is it?)

1069
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,290
That sounds the same as before.

1070
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,530
They make nice sounds.

1071
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,120
- It sounds tasty.
- We're good at this.

1072
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,370
(Sucking)

1073
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,430
It's something hard.

1074
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,540
Hey, I know what it is.
He's sucking the crab meat.

1075
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,600
It's kind of like that.

1076
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,280
It's like that, right?
He's sucking something.

1077
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,780
- In gochujang.
- Can we answer?

1078
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,180
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1079
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,540
- Spicy marinated crab.
- Spicy marinated crab.

1080
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,640
(Team Suk Jin's answer:
spicy marinated crab)

1081
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,060
(Was he sucking something hard?
Is it spicy marinated crab?)

1082
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,410
(Correct)

1083
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,580
That was amazing.

1084
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,680
(Correct)

1085
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,490
From Jong Kook's sucking.

1086
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,990
He got caught.

1087
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,700
(That's too bad!)

1088
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,720
I said he was sucking the crab meat.

1089
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,140
- How did you know?
- That was amazing.

1090
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,890
- We're the smart ones.
- How did he know?

1091
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,010
- That was amazing.
- The winner of this mission is...

1092
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,870
Team Jae Suk with two points.

1093
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,540
(Team Jae Suk scores 1st place
for this mission.)

1094
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,970
Great. Good job.

1095
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,180
Sure, guys.

1096
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,700
Hyosung is a singer
and a good daughter.

1097
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,870
(The first mission of
Tiger's Birthday Party is over.)

1098
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,910
On one of the spaces
Jong Kook wrote the prizes,

1099
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,890
Team Jae Suk's sticker
will be placed.

1100
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,260
The first mission is a freebie.

1101
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,410
Right, there are many missions left.

1102
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,560
We have to give them one
to make this exciting.

1103
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,850
We shouldn't win everything.

1104
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:40,850
Here.

1105
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,470
- Did you hurt your right leg?
- Yes.

1106
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,560
Your right butt cheek is
much smaller.

1107
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
That's not true.

1108
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,640
- What?
- My pants got stretched.

1109
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,740
Is that so?

1110
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,970
Team Jong Kook came in last,
so change one prize into a dud.

1111
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,700
(Team Jong Kook lost, so they must
change a prize into a dud.)

1112
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,280
When we lose once,

1113
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,780
- we take two blows.
- Yang Saeroyi.

1114
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,990
Cover VR gaming console.

1115
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,490
- He doesn't play games.
- Cover VR gaming console.

1116
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,910
I don't like VR.

1117
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,850
I covered VR.

1118
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,850
- Okay.
- Okay.

1119
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,720
(The roulette changes to this
after Round 1.)

1120
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,990
Is everybody still hungry?

1121
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

1122
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,120
Before we move onto
the next mission,

1123
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,260
we'll take lunch orders.

1124
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,060
- That's great.
- Today is Jong Kook's birthday,

1125
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,470
so we'll have
a special birthday meal.

1126
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,240
- Birthday meal?
- That sounds good.

1127
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,240
This is uncomfortable.
Birthday parties don't last long.

1128
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,780
I had no idea
we'd be doing this for this long.

1129
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,010
What if we write a card for him,
and he reads it at the end?

1130
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,870
- This is insane.
- That's the worst.

1131
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,990
But if he cries, he gets a penalty.

1132
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,180
"Jong Kook, it's Dong Hoon."

1133
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,350
(They would hate that
more than penalties.)

1134
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,850
It makes me feel weird hearing that.

1135
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,490
You will be drawing an item
you want to see...

1136
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,870
for Jong Kook's birthday meal.

1137
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,990
What's that?

1138
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,490
We'll look up the completed image
on an app,

1139
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,810
and if the picture is
within the top five...

1140
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,740
pictures or images that come up,

1141
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,600
we'll order that food immediately.

1142
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,870
- We'll order that food immediately.
- Is that possible?

1143
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,240
- It has to come up?
- One at a time.

1144
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,620
We tried it. If you draw well,
the food actually comes up.

1145
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,720
- That's crazy.
- Really?

1146
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,790
If you draw poorly,
something random comes up.

1147
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,450
We should draw something easy.

1148
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,990
Something simple.

1149
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,120
- What should I draw?
- Drumsticks are easy.

1150
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,760
Chicken is easy.

1151
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,850
- I'm going to draw a burger.
- I'll do ramyeon.

1152
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,530
I'm craving for
jjamppong and tangsuyuk.

1153
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,760
Jjamppong is difficult.

1154
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,030
Right? Jjamppong
and tangsuyuk are difficult.

1155
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,490
We could draw
the Great Wall of China.

1156
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,140
If we draw that,
a Chinese restaurant will pop up.

1157
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,430
You will have five minutes.

1158
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,330
You will give us the food, right?

1159
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,830
I will give you the food
after the mission.

1160
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,100
We can only draw one thing, right?

1161
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
- What?
- I can't draw.

1162
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,720
- Does it look like LA galbi?
- It looks like LA galbi.

1163
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,810
(Is that LA galbi?)

1164
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,620
How is that LA galbi?

1165
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,350
- It's LA galbi.
- That's funny.

1166
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,580
- LA galbi has these bones.
- Maybe I should draw a steak.

1167
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,160
(Mingyu draws without hesitation.)

1168
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,220
Is that chicken?

1169
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,700
It looks like poop, not chicken.

1170
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,890
- It's chicken.
- Really?

1171
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,990
Haha, you are doing great.

1172
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,660
- Haha.
- Is that naengmyeon?

1173
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,640
- It's jjajangmyeon.
- I need to draw the sauce now.

1174
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,430
Draw two peas.

1175
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,830
Drawing two peas is a great idea.

1176
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,370
It really looks like jjajangmyeon.
There is even pickled radish.

1177
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,280
Haha, you should have studied art.

1178
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,620
- I did study art.
- How about a cake?

1179
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,790
I drew a cake.

1180
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,450
(I see.)

1181
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,580
I am done.

1182
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,120
- Already?
- You are done?

1183
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,930
- What did you draw? A burger?
- It looks similar.

1184
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,680
- It looks like a burger.
- It looks like a burger.

1185
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,430
- What is that blue thing?
- The blue thing?

1186
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,060
I made a mistake.

1187
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,530
I am sure I will get a burger.

1188
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,600
I am sure of it.

1189
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,330
- Suk Jin, what is that?
- Tonkatsu.

1190
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,910
Tonkatsu doesn't look like that.

1191
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,870
I need to draw vegetables
like cabbage, but...

1192
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,580
I am sorry, but I want to see
Mingyu's drawing.

1193
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,640
(Jae Suk cuts him off.)

1194
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,200
I am sorry, but I want to see
Mingyu's drawing.

1195
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,120
(Laughing)

1196
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,080
- I was talking to myself.
- Really?

1197
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,850
You don't need to be sorry.

1198
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,580
- I was talking to myself.
- Okay.

1199
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,330
- You don't need to be sorry.
- Okay.

1200
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,430
(I won't accept an apology.)

1201
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,620
I have no idea what Ji Hyo drew.
What is that?

1202
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,890
- It's LA galbi.
- Don't you know what LA galbi is?

1203
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,100
- Don't you know what LA galbi is?
- I had no idea.

1204
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,930
Gosh, what is that?

1205
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,390
You have 10 seconds now.

1206
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,600
- Subway.
- Seven,

1207
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,180
- 6, 5,
- What?

1208
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,100
(As everyone colors the drawing,
Jong Kook's feast becomes complete.)

1209
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,140
- 2, 1.
- What is Jong Kook's drawing?

1210
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,680
- Put the markers down.
- Okay.

1211
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,720
Please show us your drawing in turn.

1212
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,890
I will go first. I drew ramyeon.

1213
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,120
While I couldn't draw the details,

1214
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,620
- I hope I get some kind of noodles.
- Okay.

1215
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,030
- I drew noodles.
- Okay.

1216
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,260
Jong Kook.

1217
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,350
- What is that? Soup?
- It's a sandwich.

1218
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,330
I hope I get a sandwich
or a hot dog.

1219
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,720
A hot dog.

1220
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,100
- You didn't have much time.
- You got the details.

1221
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,260
- I know.
- There are olives.

1222
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,060
I drew it quickly.

1223
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,200
- Mingyu will succeed.
- I drew fried chicken.

1224
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,410
- It looks like fried chicken.
- He can draw well.

1225
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,580
- I drew jjajangmyeon.
- Okay.

1226
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,810
Haha drew jjajangmyeon well.

1227
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,970
(Suk Jin is the next presenter.)

1228
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,140
It looks like fried chicken.

1229
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,640
He can draw well.

1230
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,080
It's incredible.

1231
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,850
Tonkatsu.

1232
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:05,180
(Is that tonkatsu?)

1233
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,060
(The atmosphere turns frigid.)

1234
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,100
Suk Jin.

1235
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,200
My goodness. That's...

1236
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,890
- That's...
- What? It's tonkatsu.

1237
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,140
I drew pickled radish
and vegetables.

1238
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,970
I wonder what he will get.

1239
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,470
- I am sure he will get something.
- I drew a knife and a fork too.

1240
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,600
Ji Hyo.

1241
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,680
I drew LA galbi.

1242
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,430
- Isn't that a train?
- It's LA galbi.

1243
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,850
- You need to erase the words.
- I will do that.

1244
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,280
- We will never get LA galbi.
- These are the bones.

1245
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,080
I drew a birthday must-have, cake.

1246
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,010
I drew a pizza
with the sweet potato mousse.

1247
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,080
- I drew a burger.
- He will surely get a burger.

1248
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,180
A burger.

1249
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,790
(Which drawing will succeed
the image search mission?)

1250
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,930
- I will take a photo.
- It's ramyeon.

1251
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,700
Because the bread is white...

1252
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,120
(It's a success if there is ramyeon
in the top five search results.)

1253
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,890
- Ramyeon.
- Top five search results.

1254
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,260
- Hold on.
- What?

1255
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,100
- Did you get ramyeon?
- What did you get?

1256
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,410
The first result is
some kind of a monster.

1257
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,910
- It's some kind of a monster.
- Try again.

1258
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,410
- What is that? Why did that pop up?
- This is the first image.

1259
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,600
This is fascinating.

1260
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,140
- Is that it?
- It's the image.

1261
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,310
What is this?

1262
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:08,080
You got ramyeon as the fourth image.
You succeeded.

1263
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,680
(The first dish, ramyeon,
is a success.)

1264
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,790
It's a drawing.

1265
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,120
I don't know whose work it is,
but it's a lousy drawing.

1266
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,530
- Is this ramyeon?
- It could be a famous artwork.

1267
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,660
That's incredible.

1268
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,120
Jong Kook, I improved.

1269
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,290
- Good job.
- Yang Saeroyi.

1270
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,600
(Link your arms with Jong Kook.)

1271
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,330
(Se Chan succeeds to link arms
with Jong Kook.)

1272
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,330
(Linking arms)

1273
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,700
(He succeeded.)

1274
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,310
- Next is Jong Kook's drawing.
- Mine?

1275
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,640
Jong Kook will surely succeed.

1276
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,740
Do a good job.

1277
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,240
(Will they succeed to get a sandwich
after ramyeon?)

1278
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,950
- Jong Kook, you got it.
- You got it.

1279
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,620
- It's the second image.
- What happened?

1280
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,260
- What?
- This is exactly what you got.

1281
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,720
- What?
- Subway.

1282
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,720
Someone drew
the exact same sandwich.

1283
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,620
- That's incredible.
- Let's see.

1284
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,470
That's incredible.

1285
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,100
- Is this the search result?
- Yes.

1286
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,200
- The sandwich is a success.
- Okay.

1287
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,060
- Jong Kook.
- This is good.

1288
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,910
- This is insane.
- This is good.

1289
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,040
(Jong Kook, let's link arms.)

1290
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,280
(Kwang Soo succeeds
to link arms with him too.)

1291
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,950
(Jong Kook
hasn't figured anything out yet.)

1292
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,510
What should I do
if I don't get fried chicken?

1293
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:10,680
This is a good vibe.

1294
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,010
- Let's try it.
- You'll get it.

1295
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,910
What is this?
Why is there spilled ramyeon?

1296
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,260
(Confused)

1297
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,080
There is a photo of spilled ramyeon.

1298
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,260
Fried chicken failed.

1299
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,890
I thought it would surely succeed.

1300
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,220
Tonkatsu is a fail.

1301
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,830
The burger is a fail.

1302
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,790
LA galbi is a fail.

1303
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,490
- Pizza.
- Let's stay hopeful.

1304
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,760
- It might work.
- Let's stay hopeful.

1305
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,640
- We got it!
- Did you get it?

1306
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,240
(They get pizza!)

1307
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,470
All the images are of pizza.

1308
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,040
That's incredible.

1309
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,540
That's incredible.

1310
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,910
- Okay!
- I did it!

1311
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,450
We have ramyeon.
It comes with soup.

1312
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,720
The dishes you secured are
ramyeon, sandwich, and pizza.

1313
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,010
Pizza.

1314
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,180
Pizza is perfect
for a birthday feast.

1315
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,490
(Jong Kook's birthday feast
is coming up.)

1316
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:51,180
While lunch gets prepared,
we will play...

1317
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,260
Speed Picasso for Jong Kook,
the man with artistic skills.

1318
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,830
That's good.

1319
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,060
After the whistle, the person
who gives the problem...

1320
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,470
will copy a famous scene
from a movie...

1321
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,870
in the calendar for 20 seconds.

1322
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,240
A famous scene from a movie.

1323
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,310
If the team members
correctly guess the movie title.

1324
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,240
the team will receive a point.

1325
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,010
It's a foul to write words
or provide an unrelated hint.

1326
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,470
Please clear the table.

1327
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,580
- Shall we cut the slate?
- No, no. We will keep going.

1328
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,720
(Oh, okay.)

1329
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,220
I showed my passion.

1330
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,850
- It's okay. Good job.
- Okay.

1331
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,430
(Se Chan is full of passion.)

1332
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,790
Start when you hear the whistle.

1333
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,160
- If you write words, you are out.
- Of course.

1334
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,890
- Turn the page.
- Okay.

1335
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,100
A famous scene
that comes to your mind...

1336
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,470
Hey, why...

1337
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,200
(A sudden hit on the head)

1338
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,870
- Did you do that?
- No!

1339
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,870
Me?

1340
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,640
(What is up with Suk Jin?)

1341
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,970
Why would he do that?

1342
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,510
That was a funny skit.

1343
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,620
- He hasn't hit me yet.
- "Did you do that?"

1344
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,720
(Slapstick comedy
from the "Humor No. 1" days)

1345
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,790
- Mingyu was unfazed. "No."
- "No."

1346
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,680
(Stern)

1347
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,560
He hasn't hit me yet.

1348
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:59,580
Did you take out your bang
on purpose?

1349
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,390
No. Did it come out?

1350
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:03,390
Suk Jin, you look so cute.

1351
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,030
You look so cute.

1352
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:07,120
- I don't believe you.
- You look so cute.

1353
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,290
Since the day you were like,
"You can do it"...

1354
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,560
(Whistling)

1355
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,310
(The buttcrack whistle)

1356
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,740
(A clear sound from the deep valley)

1357
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,780
- It was a nice skit.
- It was a nice skit.

1358
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,410
- I will subscribe.
- That was funny.

1359
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,580
I will like and subscribe.

1360
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,490
- Did you do that?
- No!

1361
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,220
- "Did you do that?"
- I will like and subscribe.

1362
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,410
Are you sure?

1363
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,760
My stomach is full.
I mean, my stomach hurts.

1364
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,990
(Everyone is going crazy
from laughing so much.)

1365
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,160
It has been a while
since we heard Suk Jin fart loudly.

1366
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,220
Seriously.

1367
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,220
- That was nice.
- I know.

1368
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,870
Start when you hear the whistle.

1369
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,430
Each person has 20 seconds.
Get ready.

1370
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,430
Set.

1371
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,040
(Start.)

1372
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,240
I bet it's hard.

1373
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,640
(How will I draw this?)

1374
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,910
- It's hard to draw in 20 seconds.
- Get the important bits.

1375
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:56,540
(He draws diligently.)

1376
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,290
- 20 seconds isn't very long.
- You are right.

1377
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,450
10 seconds.

1378
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,660
(Mysterious droplets)

1379
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,850
Haha can draw well.

1380
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,560
- Wrap it up.
- Five seconds.

1381
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,830
- Gosh, I made a mistake.
- What?

1382
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,220
2, 1. Show them.

1383
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,450
- Show them.
- Show us.

1384
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:11,620
- Time's up. Show us.
- Show them.

1385
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,490
- We guess the movie title, right?
- Yes.

1386
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,510
(What is that?)

1387
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,660
It's...

1388
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,910
- I think I know.
- It's...

1389
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,540
- "Welcome To Dongmakgol".
- That's right.

1390
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,370
- "Welcome To Dongmakgol".
- That's right.

1391
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,580
- You guys don't disappoint!
- You are good.

1392
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,890
(It's a popcorn scene
from "Welcome To Dongmakgol".)

1393
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,310
- You guys don't disappoint!
- You are good.

1394
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,120
- Haha drew well.
- Good job.

1395
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,830
He really drew well.

1396
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,100
- That's incredible.
- Good job.

1397
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,700
- Haha.
- Time is ticking.

1398
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,330
- Hurry up.
- Time is ticking.

1399
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,390
- You are in the best condition.
- Time is ticking.

1400
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,160
- What?
- The time is ticking.

1401
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,470
You are almost out of time.

1402
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:51,470
(Time dissipates
even before he sees the problem.)

1403
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,040
- Time is ticking.
- Show us.

1404
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,040
- 2, 1. Show them.
- 2, 1.

1405
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,010
All right. Here you go.

1406
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,240
- What?
- You can get it right.

1407
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,700
(What is that?)

1408
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,870
- What is that?
- What is that?

1409
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:02,780
- Are those dumplings?
- What is that?

1410
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,180
Is it a kiss?

1411
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,350
What is that?

1412
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,390
(Blinking)

1413
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,290
- "Dumb and Dumber".
- No, no.

1414
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,680
- Hurry up.
- Are those tongues stuck together?

1415
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,490
- I can't explain.
- You can pass.

1416
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,890
I had to draw in a hurry.

1417
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,120
- I know what it is.
- Five,

1418
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,890
(The game is ongoing,)

1419
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,930
- It's the answer, right?
- My goodness.

1420
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:21,240
- How did you know?
- I knew right away.

1421
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,330
(but the 2 of them are busy
with the hidden mission.)

1422
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,430
- These aren't tongues.
- Are those noses?

1423
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,010
- "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial".
- What?

1424
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,060
"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial".

1425
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,330
Correct!

1426
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,450
- Correct!
- Are those fingers?

1427
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,700
(A signature touch
from "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial")

1428
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,010
Are those fingers?

1429
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,740
These are fingers.

1430
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,450
- Suk Jin.
- I didn't hear that.

1431
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:40,390
What's wrong with telling them
that they aren't tongues?

1432
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,120
(Beeping)

1433
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,350
(Laughing)

1434
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,990
(It's the artistic Ji Hyo's turn.)

1435
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,430
(Which movie did Ji Hyo get?)

1436
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,120
- Is it a scene?
- It's a famous scene.

1437
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,640
Five seconds remain.

1438
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,970
- Are you done?
- Are you done?

1439
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,140
(She finishes the drawing
with 5 seconds remaining.)

1440
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,010
- What?
- What is that?

1441
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,280
(A square and a circle?)

1442
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,310
- What?
- What is that?

1443
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,100
- What?
- What is that?

1444
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,680
- Let me answer.
- What is that?

1445
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,580
(He takes a good look.)

1446
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,680
Let me answer.

1447
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,720
- "The Man from Nowhere".
- That's right!

1448
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,810
(Correct)

1449
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:17,680
My goodness.

1450
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,290
(How is that
"The Man from Nowhere"?)

1451
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,330
- I mean...
- How did he get it right?

1452
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,160
- A hair clipper.
- A hair clipper.

1453
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,660
A hair clipper.
He is shaving his hair.

1454
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,970
(Hair clipper, Won Bin)

1455
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,040
- That's Won Bin?
- The hair.

1456
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,060
- Is it that scene?
- It's this scene.

1457
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,490
- Good job.
- How could this be...

1458
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,640
- "The Man from Nowhere"?
- That was incredible.

1459
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,330
She even left some time
on the clock.

1460
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:35,830
This game is all about quick wits.

1461
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:36,930
- It's all about quick wits.
- Hey.

1462
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:39,540
- Where did it go?
- Draw with anything.

1463
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,950
Time's running out.

1464
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,350
He is wasting so much time.

1465
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,640
Why can't you take out a marker?

1466
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,950
It took him 20 seconds
to find a marker.

1467
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,310
Seriously. He wasted so much time.

1468
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,720
- For goodness' sake.
- I know what it is.

1469
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,720
10 seconds.

1470
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,890
(Se Chan continues to do
the hidden mission.)

1471
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,680
- It's the answer, right?
- Jong Kook.

1472
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,950
- I figured it out right away.
- Five...

1473
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:55,950
(The 2 of them
monopolize the arm-linking.)

1474
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:56,990
Let me answer!

1475
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,200
- Five...
- I drew this.

1476
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,560
Let me answer!

1477
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,830
"Tazza".

1478
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:02,870
Okay!

1479
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,100
(How are they so good?)

1480
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,280
(They complete the mission
after a buzzer-beater.)

1481
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,280
- Haha. You are so good.
- I figured it out.

1482
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,540
We are so good at this game.

1483
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,140
Kwang Soo, let's go.

1484
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,510
- Okay.
- We are so good at this game.

1485
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,180
- This is bad.
- Stand behind us.

1486
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,640
Let's do a good job.

1487
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:23,850
I will hit him.

1488
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:26,060
If he gets it wrong, I will end him.

1489
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,790
(Suk Jin wants revenge
for what he suffered earlier.)

1490
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,100
Can I hit like this?

1491
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,100
- Of course. That's fine.
- Okay.

1492
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,330
- Is this fine?
- Yes.

1493
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,640
Can I move in like this
and hit you with the handle?

1494
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,740
Yes, you can.

1495
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,930
In that case,

1496
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,660
- can I poke you with the handle?
- Don't draw blood.

1497
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,740
(I will draw with care.)

1498
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,600
You have five minutes. Get ready.

1499
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,240
(Team Jae Suk starts.)

1500
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,370
What?

1501
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,850
(Which movie surprised Hyosung?)

1502
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,350
Gosh, what should I do?

1503
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:52,540
This is... Oh.

1504
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,790
There you go! That's it!

1505
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:55,990
How many seconds remain?

1506
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,890
- Let's go!
- 10 seconds remain.

1507
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,350
- She doesn't hesitate.
- Let's go.

1508
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,220
I will hit like this.

1509
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,490
Five,

1510
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:05,700
four...

1511
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,290
- I get it.
- Good job.

1512
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,930
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1513
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,370
- Be quiet.
- I get it.

1514
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,560
- Keep your mouth shut.
- What is that?

1515
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:16,830
Do you shake that thing?

1516
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,600
- This movie was a big hit.
- She drew well.

1517
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,180
This movie was a big hit.

1518
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,010
I get it.

1519
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,640
(The hidden mission is going well.)

1520
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,810
- My goodness, that's...
- I know.

1521
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,410
That one is hard.

1522
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,220
If you don't know, pass.

1523
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,560
- Pass.
- Pass.

1524
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,680
Pass.

1525
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,180
- It's "Inside Men".
- The answer is "Inside Men".

1526
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,580
- It's "Inside Men".
- Gosh.

1527
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:35,620
That's right.

1528
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,430
Was it this scene?

1529
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,600
(Was it this scene?)

1530
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,430
(Which scene will Kwang Soo draw?)

1531
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,540
This is hard.

1532
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,640
(It's "Nowhere to Hide.")

1533
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,060
Keep the drawing simple.

1534
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,240
10 seconds remain.

1535
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,180
(He seems to be drawing the scene
similarly.)

1536
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,580
3, 2, 1.

1537
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,010
- I have an idea.
- Show them.

1538
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:54,640
(Pow!)

1539
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,640
(What?)

1540
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,040
- He wrote a word.
- He wrote a word.

1541
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,620
(Writing words is a foul.)

1542
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,640
You wrote a word.

1543
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,290
- You can't write words.
- Why did you do that?

1544
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,660
That's...

1545
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,350
(What do you think you are doing?)

1546
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:08,120
Why did you do that?

1547
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,990
Why didn't you write the title?

1548
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,530
- Why didn't you write the title?
- I wasn't thinking.

1549
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:12,530
You don't have time.

1550
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,220
- I was pressed for time.
- "Nowhere to Hide".

1551
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:16,290
That's right.
It's "Nowhere to Hide."

1552
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,640
- Why did you write a word?
- You drew well.

1553
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,870
- I was pressed for time.
- Hold on.

1554
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:21,410
How do I draw this?

1555
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,780
You should have drawn
something else.

1556
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,100
Seriously.

1557
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,040
- He didn't need "Pow!"
- 10 seconds remain.

1558
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
- They would have gotten it.
- I know.

1559
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,180
(How will he draw this masterpiece?)

1560
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,080
It's well-known
that Jae Suk can't draw at all.

1561
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,410
Get ready to have a laugh.

1562
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,240
I can't wait.

1563
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,140
(A mental breakdown)

1564
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,180
Fish?

1565
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,540
(He really drew a parasite.)

1566
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,910
- What is that?
- Fish?

1567
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,580
Let me answer.
"Collective Invention".

1568
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,640
What was it called?

1569
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,680
- What was it called?
- What is that?

1570
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,140
- Don't mouth words.
- It's...

1571
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,040
- It's an anchovy.
- What is that?

1572
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,040
Salmon!

1573
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,210
Don't mouth words.

1574
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,330
- Who did that?
- Stop mouthing words.

1575
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,460
What is that?

1576
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,500
- What was it called?
- Pass.

1577
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,660
Isn't that poop?

1578
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,290
- An alien.
- Pass.

1579
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,330
- Pass. Pass.
- That's too bad.

1580
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,390
- It's "Parasite".
- "Parasite".

1581
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,100
(You're not thinking.)

1582
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,330
- For goodness' sake.
- This is hard.

1583
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:18,910
You didn't get
a single question right.

1584
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,370
This is...

1585
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,140
The movies are hard.

1586
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,140
(I will succeed this time!)

1587
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,100
You have 10 seconds left to draw.

1588
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,850
This is so hard.

1589
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,870
This one is easy. This one is easy.

1590
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,390
3, 2, 1.

1591
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,080
(However,)

1592
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,160
(there is another word.)

1593
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,060
He wrote something again.

1594
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,460
Why did you write a word?

1595
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:41,850
Hold on.

1596
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,730
- He wrote a word again.
- He wrote a word.

1597
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,230
- I didn't see it!
- Why did you write a word?

1598
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,560
I didn't see it!

1599
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,960
- Why did you write "Wham"?
- I didn't see it!

1600
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,060
For goodness' sake.

1601
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,940
- Forget it.
- Go and sit down.

1602
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,140
- Go.
- It was "Shaolin Soccer"!

1603
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,180
- Why did you write "Wham"?
- "Shaolin Soccer".

1604
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,940
Anyone would have known
that it's "Shaolin Soccer."

1605
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,750
- Why did you write a word?
- I was pressed for time.

1606
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,810
This is...

1607
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,750
(Which movie did Jae Suk get?)

1608
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,790
All right. With this one,

1609
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:09,960
I will draw the scene
exactly as it is.

1610
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,480
- He can't do draw it.
- He did draw a parasite earlier.

1611
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,350
- That's right.
- Right?

1612
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,500
- 2, 1.
- Let's get one right.

1613
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,190
- Show them.
- Time's up.

1614
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,270
- Stop drawing.
- Okay.

1615
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,640
(An alien creature appears.)

1616
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,180
(What is that?)

1617
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,000
- What?
- I think I know.

1618
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,410
Let me answer. Pringles.

1619
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,750
What is that?

1620
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,640
- Isn't that Pringles?
- What is that?

1621
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,750
"Edward Scissorhands"!

1622
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,940
(Incorrect)

1623
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:42,520
I know because Jae Suk is
on my level.

1624
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,830
If we play this game together,
we would get everything right.

1625
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,020
"The Terminator".

1626
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,790
- What is that?
- No!

1627
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,750
- "Inspector Gadget"!
- No.

1628
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,290
- This is driving me crazy.
- What is going on with the arms?

1629
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:53,000
- Pass. Pass.
- What's the movie?

1630
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,640
- It's over.
- Lee Jung Jae.

1631
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,040
"Assassination".
He has two bullet wounds.

1632
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,210
- He has 2 bullet wounds.
- He has 2 bullet wounds.

1633
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,270
- Look.
- How is this...

1634
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,040
I got these wounds
from an assassination attempt.

1635
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,310
I have two wounds.

1636
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,350
(Are these Lee Jung Jae's fingers?)

1637
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,750
"Assassination".
He has two bullet wounds.

1638
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,750
- He has 2 bullet wounds.
- He has 2 bullet wounds.

1639
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:10,910
That's ridiculous.

1640
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,620
- How is this...
- My goodness.

1641
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,410
- Jae Suk.
- How is this...

1642
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:16,960
- I did my best.
- You didn't draw the bullet holes.

1643
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,290
- You should have drawn the wounds.
- These two look the same.

1644
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,690
That's either Pringles or a snowman.

1645
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,890
These two look the same.
For goodness' sake.

1646
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,620
Team Jae Suk has zero points.

1647
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,000
"I have two wounds."

1648
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,390
(Jae Suk left 2 masterpieces.)

1649
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,830
- For goodness' sake.
- Get ready.

1650
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,500
Set...

1651
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,910
(Team Jong Kook starts.)

1652
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,600
My goodness.

1653
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,870
(The first question is
"The Lord of the Rings.")

1654
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,350
This should be enough.

1655
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,310
(Peeking)

1656
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,480
Give Suk Jin a warning
for his flippant behavior.

1657
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,520
Oh, that movie.

1658
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,520
It isn't a flippant behavior.
I am simply curious.

1659
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,980
(Members of other teams have
a war of nerves.)

1660
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,690
- Is the time up?
- 3, 2,

1661
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:55,960
- 1.
- He got done 1st.

1662
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,390
I think they will know.

1663
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,020
(The One Ring and Gollum)

1664
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,160
- An alien?
- "Sonic the Hedgehog".

1665
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,060
- "Sonic the Hedgehog"?
- "Men in Black".

1666
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,770
(They don't have a clue.)

1667
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,000
It's a person on a bicycle.

1668
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,600
- How do you not know this?
- As soon as I saw the drawing,

1669
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,810
I thought he drew really well.

1670
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:11,040
"The Avengers"?

1671
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,180
What is that round thing?

1672
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,620
- Oh, it's "The Lord of the Rings."
- That's right.

1673
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,410
- It was a ring.
- It was a ring.

1674
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:19,890
What?

1675
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,460
It was hard.

1676
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,620
I don't know this movie.

1677
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,520
It's okay. Just draw what you see.

1678
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,160
- Just...
- Hey.

1679
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,660
Okay.

1680
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,330
(His enthusiasm is at its max.)

1681
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:31,190
- That's incredible.
- It looks similar.

1682
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:32,870
- 2, 1.
- They will surely get it right.

1683
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:33,940
Show them.

1684
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:35,890
- "Leon: The Professional".
- No.

1685
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,140
- "A Better Tomorrow".
- Yes!

1686
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,500
"A Better Tomorrow".

1687
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,270
Anyone would have gotten it right.

1688
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,680
The details.

1689
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,600
- Mingyu can draw well.
- The details.

1690
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,750
I don't know the movie.

1691
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,040
- What?
- Mingyu is good at this game.

1692
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,370
What? What is this?

1693
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,310
Just do what you can. It's okay.

1694
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,960
- He is drawing really fast.
- Five,

1695
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,020
four,

1696
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,080
- three,
- You are drawing so fast.

1697
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,160
two,

1698
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,230
one. Show them.

1699
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,290
Let's see it.

1700
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:02,750
What is that?

1701
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,000
I get it.

1702
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,830
- What is he, a kindergartener?
- Show them.

1703
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,330
What is that?

1704
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,870
I get it.

1705
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,000
(His teammates are flustered.)

1706
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,210
I get it.

1707
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,500
"Friend"?

1708
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,080
(Correct)

1709
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:17,910
(Jong Kook channeled
the spirit of guessing.)

1710
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:19,940
You did it!

1711
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,350
It's "Friend."
They have arms around the shoulders.

1712
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:22,750
How is that "Friend"?

1713
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,120
It's "Friend."
They have arms around the shoulders.

1714
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,310
- How is that "Friend"?
- How is that "Friend"?

1715
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,410
How did he get it right?

1716
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,690
This is ridiculous.
How is that "Friend"?

1717
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,390
How is that "Friend"?

1718
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,430
Is there a secret mission?

1719
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,390
How is that "Friend"?

1720
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,870
(That drawing doesn't depict
friends.)

1721
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,770
- "Friend".
- This is ridiculous.

1722
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,460
Do they know the answers?

1723
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,710
Did you tell them the answers?

1724
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,730
I get that they have arms
around the shoulders.

1725
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,770
But how could he know it's "Friend"?

1726
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:50,000
I didn't draw it right.
It's okay though. It's easy.

1727
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,180
- "Joker".
- Okay.

1728
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,440
(They answered "Joker" right.)

1729
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,680
One.

1730
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,850
(It looks like
a mathematical formula.)

1731
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,020
"Miracle in Cell No. 7".

1732
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,020
(But they get it right immediately.)

1733
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,660
Look at it carefully.

1734
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,460
- "The Host"?
- Correct.

1735
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,830
- Is it right?
- You got it right.

1736
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,330
Jong Kook!

1737
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:06,330
(The game is over
with their great teamwork.)

1738
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,730
- What's that?
- This one was difficult.

1739
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:08,730
- It's good enough.
- Well done.

1740
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,120
- We did a good job.
- Look.

1741
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,190
They would've
answered "Assassination".

1742
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,620
What are you talking about?

1743
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,640
- This is disappointing.
- How would we answer this?

1744
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,060
"I have two."

1745
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,100
Let me announce
the results of Speed Picasso.

1746
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,710
First place is Team Jong Kook.

1747
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,730
Well done, guys.

1748
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,910
- We won.
- Jong Kook answered them all.

1749
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,180
Team Suk Jin is second place.

1750
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,310
Gosh, we're in second place again.

1751
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,310
And Team Jae Suk is
in third place with zero points.

1752
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:31,810
We didn't get anything right.

1753
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:32,910
Please bring in the roulette.

1754
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,190
Should I put something on the dud?

1755
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,210
Yes.

1756
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,520
- I think this one is good.
- Here?

1757
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,690
This one looks good.

1758
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,930
(They wrote a laptop computer.)

1759
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,890
Let's go have a meal.

1760
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:45,930
Okay.

1761
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,790
(They go to eat
after the second mission.)

1762
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,660
(The dishes on their bucket lists
have arrived.)

1763
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,870
It's ramyeon and pizza.

1764
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,560
- My gosh.
- Sandwich.

1765
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,730
- Try this.
- Okay.

1766
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:57,080
This is what Hyosung drew.

1767
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,180
- Right.
- That's true.

1768
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,870
We're eating this
thanks to Hyosung.

1769
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,210
And we're eating ramyeon
thanks to Se Chan.

1770
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,310
The ramyeon is really good.

1771
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,620
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1772
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,120
If that's not true,
I'll slap you in the face.

1773
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,120
What?

1774
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,910
What did I do?

1775
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,690
I like it though.

1776
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,230
Slap him in the face?

1777
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,930
I should eat more pizza.

1778
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:15,960
It's good.

1779
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,560
(While they enjoy the food...)

1780
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,890
(I should complete the mission.)

1781
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,640
Is it because of your shirt?
Why do you look so big?

1782
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,160
- What?
- This.

1783
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,810
- Your arm.
- I've been working out my arms.

1784
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,480
It's good, isn't it?

1785
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,830
(What is he doing?)

1786
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:31,270
They got big, right?

1787
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,270
I didn't do it for a while.

1788
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,410
- They are firm, right?
- Gosh, look at this.

1789
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,620
They are amazing.

1790
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,690
Is it because of your shirt?

1791
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,620
(All right. That was natural!)

1792
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,960
(After hesitating for a moment,)

1793
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,750
(Kwang Soo approaches Jong Kook.)

1794
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,190
(He sneaks up to Jong Kook.)

1795
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,770
(By the way...)

1796
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:53,830
By the way...

1797
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,640
(What?)

1798
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,640
What is it?

1799
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:58,940
- Nothing.
- What?

1800
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,270
(Why is he smiling?)

1801
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,410
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

1802
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:04,640
- Do you like the food?
- It's really good.

1803
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:06,440
Enjoy.

1804
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,020
(Kwang Soo looks nervous.)

1805
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:12,120
(And Joon Kook
watches him feel that way.)

1806
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,210
(Humming)

1807
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,560
Why is he humming?

1808
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,120
What's with him?

1809
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,690
What's with the humming, Kwang Soo?

1810
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,830
- Why are you humming?
- What did I do?

1811
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:23,960
You just seem so relaxed.

1812
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,270
- Why do you even care?
- What makes you...

1813
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,600
feel so relaxed?

1814
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,040
I really enjoyed the food.

1815
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,140
Kwang Soo, eat a lot.

1816
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,540
- What?
- Eat a lot.

1817
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,270
(A counterattack)

1818
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:38,210
What are you guys doing?

1819
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,350
Eat a lot.

1820
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,440
(He got it. We're doomed.)

1821
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,870
I don't know.

1822
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,190
- Are they fighting?
- Eat a lot.

1823
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,290
(There you go, Ji Hyo.)

1824
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,960
(He knows what's going on.)

1825
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,250
Darn it.

1826
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:54,000
I hate this. What's all this?

1827
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,500
Let's just sing
a birthday song to him.

1828
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,120
Let's do that.

1829
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,830
(Happy birthday to you)

1830
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,500
My friend, Jong Kook.

1831
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,790
(They are doomed already,
so they just sing to him.)

1832
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,270
I love you, Jong Kook.

1833
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,730
(They all take Jong Kook's arms.)

1834
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:12,310
(Nice try.)

1835
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,910
(It's completely failed.)

1836
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:16,440
Happy birthday!

1837
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,520
Now it feels like a birthday.

1838
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,520
(Let's enjoy it together.)

1839
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,660
Why were you guys hesitating?

1840
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,290
You can just celebrate it.

1841
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,190
My gosh.

1842
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,600
All right. 1, 2, and 3.

1843
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,230
(He claps in desperation.)

1844
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,890
(Jong Kook found out about the
mission. What about the next one?)

1845
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:33,890
It was fun.

1846
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,690
What is this?

1847
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,410
There's a blindfold.

1848
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,440
- A blindfold?
- A blindfold.

1849
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,100
- And there are cookies.
- There are cookies?

1850
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,580
- What are they for?
- We should...

1851
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,410
bring something
before someone else moves.

1852
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,710
I see.

1853
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,020
Jong Kook already knows what to do.

1854
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,020
How did you know?

1855
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,690
We should bring it.

1856
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,080
This is the last mission.

1857
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,290
It's the last one already.

1858
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:57,480
After this mission, you will
spin the roulette.

1859
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,690
Let's do this!

1860
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:00,830
Okay.

1861
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,230
- All right.
- Let's do this right.

1862
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,160
- Let's do this.
- Congratulations.

1863
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,290
- This is the last mission.
- Good luck.

1864
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:09,100
- The last one.
- The last mission...

1865
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,460
is perfect for Jong Kook.

1866
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,580
It requires physical strength and
quick wit. It's Defend Your Cookies.

1867
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,830
- Defend Your Cookies?
- Okay!

1868
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,680
It's a game
of attacking and defending.

1869
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,910
Team Offense will decide
one person to defend cookies...

1870
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,310
and two people to move cookies.

1871
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,910
The eight members
except for the guard...

1872
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:28,120
can move around while music plays.

1873
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,850
Two members from
Team Offense should put...

1874
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:33,290
as many cookies in their basket
in front of the guard...

1875
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:34,850
as they can.

1876
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:37,500
Meanwhile, members
from Team Defense should...

1877
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,660
eat as many cookies as they can.

1878
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,640
- Should we eat them?
- Are we eating the cookies?

1879
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,500
The guard sitting here...

1880
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,100
should wear
a blindfold during the game.

1881
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,440
And he can squirt a water pistol
at one person when the music stops.

1882
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,210
The person who's shot
should go back to the starting line.

1883
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,680
(The member who's shot should
go back to the starting line.)

1884
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,810
- It's hard.
- You're given five minutes.

1885
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,410
After three rounds,

1886
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,310
the team with most cookies
will win the game.

1887
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:02,520
- I see.
- I see.

1888
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,850
All right.

1889
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,730
Can we simulate the game once?

1890
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:08,020
Why did he even answer?

1891
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,120
He just said he understood.

1892
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,060
- Did you not understand it?
- Why would he want to simulate it?

1893
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,440
You should get him
a tutor or something.

1894
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,230
Wait. Did you understand?

1895
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,730
Of course I did.

1896
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,810
(Surprised)

1897
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:22,210
(He sounds embarrassed again.)

1898
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:25,000
- I see.
- How could he say that?

1899
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,020
Okay.

1900
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,120
(Who will get more cookies
and win the game?)

1901
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,390
- Team Suk Jin will go first.
- Okay.

1902
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:34,120
You can't move
when there's no music playing.

1903
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,020
- Ji Hyo. You can't see, can you?
- No.

1904
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,190
What should we do there?

1905
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,430
We should put these in the basket.

1906
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,230
We should put...

1907
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,430
as many cookies in there as we can.

1908
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,390
It's not easy to eat them.

1909
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,790
It's not easy.

1910
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,000
- Let's begin.
- Watch out for the squirt gun.

1911
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,870
Start.

1912
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,000
(Music starts.)

1913
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,830
(They can move around
only when music plays.)

1914
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:59,210
(Once the music stops,
the guard can quirt the gun.)

1915
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,540
Haha is my team.

1916
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,120
(I sensed someone's
presence around here.)

1917
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,810
(She hit Kwang Soo right away.)

1918
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,230
(He's denying it.)

1919
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,850
You should go back.

1920
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,020
(It's been only 5 seconds.)

1921
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,060
Did someone get hit?

1922
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,790
Was it Mingyu?

1923
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,790
(They move forward quickly
while music plays.)

1924
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:22,000
(They all stop.)

1925
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,600
(She squirts the water gun.)

1926
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,910
(Jae Suk is right in front of her,
but she shoots at the floor.)

1927
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:29,810
(Haha puts cookies in the basket.)

1928
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,410
(And Jae Suk steals them.)

1929
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,850
(Giggling)

1930
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,810
(They burst into laughter
all of a sudden.)

1931
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:37,810
(Sneaking down)

1932
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,750
(She shoots him in the back.)

1933
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,560
(He's really bad at games.)

1934
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:45,560
Go back to the starting line.

1935
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,580
(He goes back without
showing good performances.)

1936
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,690
(While Mingyu goes back,
they all come up to Ji Hyo.)

1937
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,560
(Gobbling up)

1938
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,890
(They are busy
bringing more cookies.)

1939
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,290
(The music stops.)

1940
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,100
(Rustling)

1941
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,100
(Stumbling)

1942
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,810
(She squirts the water gun at him.)

1943
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:04,810
(It's Kwang Soo again.)

1944
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:06,980
- I think someone's right here.
- Go back.

1945
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,440
(She keeps shooting at me.)

1946
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:12,440
(Suk Jin is here again
to deliver more cookies.)

1947
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:16,910
(Turning)

1948
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,520
(Squirting)

1949
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,020
(She shoots at her team member.)

1950
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:25,930
- Hey.
- My gosh.

1951
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,000
It was Suk Jin.

1952
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,370
I can't see.

1953
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,600
I can't see anything.

1954
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:31,210
Gosh.

1955
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,270
(I should eat it all up.)

1956
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,940
(Rustling)

1957
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,600
(Kwang Soo is
right in front of her again.)

1958
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,270
(Fortunately, Ji Hyo makes a turn.)

1959
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:44,080
(He managed to escape the crisis.)

1960
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,410
(Meow)

1961
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,690
(I heard a cat around here.)

1962
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:51,580
(She shoots at Kwang Soo again.)

1963
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,520
(Frustrated)

1964
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,190
I can't see.

1965
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,690
(Pinching)

1966
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,440
(Groaning)

1967
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,910
(She heard something around here.)

1968
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:11,680
(She shoots straight at his lips.)

1969
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,850
(How could she shoot him
right in the lips like that?)

1970
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,640
It got into my mouth.

1971
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,660
(Jae Suk is still alive.)

1972
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,210
Stop eating my cookies.

1973
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,960
(He's even savoring the cookies.)

1974
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,930
(I can't let him do that!)

1975
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,060
(How could you pinch me?)

1976
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,660
(Pinching)

1977
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,290
(Groaning)

1978
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:38,830
(She looks in the direction
of the sound.)

1979
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,810
(Squirting)

1980
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,600
(He got even with Jae Suk.)

1981
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:46,180
(You wait and see, Se Chan.)

1982
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,710
What is happening here?

1983
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:52,080
They are going to finish
my cookies at this rate.

1984
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:56,120
(The given time is almost up.)

1985
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,830
(The music stops.)

1986
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:00,430
(Pinching)

1987
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,390
I got you.

1988
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:05,060
(I got you.)

1989
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:10,790
(Prince with squid ink)

1990
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,080
(He has an ink-and-wash
painting on his face.)

1991
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,940
(Round 1 is over.)

1992
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:19,850
Gosh. What happened
to you, Kwang Soo?

1993
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:22,020
Now I know how to play this game.

1994
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,350
It's really easy.

1995
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,480
Okay.

1996
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,190
My gosh. What happened
to you, Jae Suk?

1997
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:28,690
What's wrong with you?

1998
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:30,620
- You did this to me.
- My gosh.

1999
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,290
- I couldn't see anything.
- You were...

2000
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,730
- You did a good job.
- I couldn't see.

2001
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,730
Well done.

2002
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:36,690
We will collect the cookies
on the floor and measure the weight.

2003
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,430
- Really?
- Those who will be shot...

2004
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,500
have already been decided.

2005
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:41,790
- It's strange, isn't it?
- It's strange.

2006
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,660
- Who's next?
- Jong Kook.

2007
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,210
Let's do this right.

2008
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:46,330
- Okay?
- It's his birthday.

2009
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:47,660
He's volunteering.

2010
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,710
- I think it'll be hard.
- It's not easy.

2011
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:50,940
Ready.

2012
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:53,750
(Round 2 starts.)

2013
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,850
(Focusing)

2014
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,910
(Silent)

2015
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,520
Nice!

2016
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,620
(Suk Jin is hit.)

2017
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,120
(Suk Jin is sent back
to the starting line.)

2018
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:11,930
(Haha, a member of Team Defense
has to eat cookies.)

2019
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:14,290
(He goes behind Jong Kook.)

2020
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,830
(No one is even touching
the cookies?)

2021
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,440
(Everyone surrounds Jong Kook...)

2022
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,850
(and starts putting stickers
on his body.)

2023
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,910
(The hidden mission
for Mission 3 is...)

2024
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:30,810
(putting stickers
on Jong Kook's body.)

2025
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:33,910
(Everyone expected this mission
to be the hardest.)

2026
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:36,290
(How are we going to put
stickers on Jong Kook?)

2027
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:40,290
(No one dared to carry out
this mission.)

2028
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,790
(This is our chance!)

2029
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:45,060
(Someone is behind me.)

2030
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:47,290
(Crowded)

2031
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,910
(Everyone focuses on the hidden
mission instead of the cookies.)

2032
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,310
(The newbie, Mingyu, is the only one
playing the game.)

2033
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,680
(Careful)

2034
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,940
Someone is carrying out
a mission behind me.

2035
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,580
(Jong Kook finds out.)

2036
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,190
(We're doomed.)

2037
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:08,190
Why do you keep
carrying out missions?

2038
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:09,910
That's enough.

2039
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,330
(What do we do now?)

2040
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:12,520
I said, that's enough.

2041
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:16,460
(This hidden mission failed too.)

2042
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,560
(Just then)

2043
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,020
(Kwang Soo's eyes suddenly
look completely different.)

2044
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,810
(Memories of being humiliated by
Jong Kook flash through his mind.)

2045
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,960
(Irritated)

2046
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,780
(With angry eyes,
Kwang Soo approaches Jong Kook.)

2047
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,980
(His opponent is
a blindfolded tiger.)

2048
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:34,870
(Kwang Soo carefully approaches
Jong Kook...)

2049
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:37,020
(and attacks the top of his head.)

2050
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:39,150
(You didn't expect this, did you?)

2051
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:41,320
I shouldn't just sit still.

2052
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,650
Gosh, I can't believe you guys.

2053
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:46,080
(The top of the head is
the only part without muscles.)

2054
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,530
(Everyone is busy putting stickers
on Jong Kook.)

2055
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:51,060
Everyone, please focus on the game.

2056
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,200
I can't believe you guys.

2057
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,290
(Jong Kook is about to explode.)

2058
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:56,140
(The angrier the tiger gets,)

2059
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,310
(the more aggressive
Kwang Soo gets.)

2060
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,310
This isn't what the game is about.

2061
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:04,440
This isn't...

2062
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,870
Seriously.

2063
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:08,980
(You ruined everything for us.
Do something about it!)

2064
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,610
Stay still.

2065
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,080
(Is it really okay to do this?)

2066
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,320
Kwang Soo, please go back.

2067
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:17,860
Kwang Soo, go back.

2068
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:20,450
(Haha puts more stickers
on Jong Kook.)

2069
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:21,820
Kwang Soo.

2070
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,530
(Here's my hidden mission!)

2071
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,600
- Eat the cookies.
- Time-out.

2072
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:28,400
- This isn't how you play this game.
- Hold on. You punk.

2073
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,570
You punk.

2074
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,790
Gosh, the stickers are
all over my hair.

2075
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:33,400
- Kwang Soo ignores the rules.
- What's with you?

2076
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,780
- Kwang Soo.
- You ignore the rules.

2077
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,400
I knew there was a mission,

2078
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,900
but how could you do it so openly?

2079
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:40,650
We did it openly
because you found out.

2080
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,480
(Why did you have to find out
so fast?)

2081
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,580
Well said.

2082
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:46,210
He means it.

2083
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,520
Please take the basket away.

2084
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,750
Here it is.

2085
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:51,190
They're catching up with us.

2086
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:52,250
(No one paid attention
to the cookies.)

2087
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:53,490
It's our turn now.

2088
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,950
- It's our turn.
- It's our turn.

2089
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:56,250
- I'll be the guard.
- All right.

2090
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,650
(Jae Suk volunteers
to be the guard.)

2091
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,400
- Can we start?
- Let's start.

2092
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,960
(Round 3 starts.)

2093
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,700
(Hyosung is carrying
a lot of cookies.)

2094
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,370
(Hyosung's hands are
full of cookies.)

2095
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:14,570
(Se Chan stops her.)

2096
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:18,280
(Kwang Soo is delivering
cookies too.)

2097
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:22,250
(You can't put those cookies
in the basket.)

2098
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,060
Please.

2099
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,320
(Jae Suk shoots
at his own team member.)

2100
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,290
(Kwang Soo is
the race starter of 2020.)

2101
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:33,900
(Annoyed)

2102
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,530
(After killing his own team member,)

2103
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,960
(Jae Suk enjoys
playing James Bond.)

2104
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,940
(He pretends to be sharp.)

2105
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,680
(While Jae Suk plays with his gun,
his cookies are taken.)

2106
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,980
(Hyosung is the only one
filling the basket with cookies.)

2107
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,110
(Busted!)

2108
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:51,040
(Jae Suk kills
his own team member again!)

2109
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,650
It was me!

2110
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,190
- Was it you, Hyosung?
- Yes.

2111
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,390
(What were you doing there?)

2112
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,190
(The tiger is on the move.)

2113
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:01,230
(Kwang Soo puts stickers on him.)

2114
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:02,930
(Let me join you.)

2115
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,740
(Kwang Soo pretends
he didn't do anything.)

2116
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,660
(Kwang Soo gets punished
right away.)

2117
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:15,610
(Haha punishes himself.)

2118
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:18,950
(I can't believe these guys.)

2119
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:22,650
(While everyone is distracted,
Suk Jin moves forward.)

2120
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:24,320
(Not knowing when to stop,)

2121
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,450
(he ends up right in front of
Jae Suk.)

2122
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,020
Who are you?

2123
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,280
(Suk Jin's nose is covered in ink.)

2124
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:37,030
(Jae Suk is hooked on
playing James Bond.)

2125
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,620
Who are you?

2126
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:39,620
(He grabs Ji Hyo's cap...)

2127
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:43,160
(and shoots his water gun
ruthlessly.)

2128
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:46,240
(Ji Hyo tries to steal cookies
instead of going back.)

2129
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,200
Who are you?

2130
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:52,480
(Ji Hyo is shot right in her face.)

2131
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,780
(Se Chan screams
with his mouth full of cookies.)

2132
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,280
(Worried Se Chan will choke,)

2133
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,650
(Jae Suk shoots ink
into his mouth.)

2134
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,650
(Jae Suk is out of control.)

2135
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,690
It's mine.

2136
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:08,560
(There's only 1 minute left.)

2137
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,400
Suk Jin.

2138
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:11,600
Here he is.

2139
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,270
To the right.

2140
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,270
- Here?
- Hold on.

2141
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:16,570
(Jae Suk takes aim.)

2142
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,110
- Is he here?
- A little lower.

2143
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,960
- Here?
- Even lower.

2144
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,610
(I'll shoot you wherever you are.)

2145
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:23,780
- Here he is.
- Wait.

2146
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,610
- Here he is.
- Wait.

2147
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:27,350
(Bull's eye)

2148
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:30,320
- Give me a new gun, please.
- How many guns are you using?

2149
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:32,080
Why did you give him a machine gun?

2150
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,950
(James Bond with a machine gun)

2151
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,750
(Who is his next target?)

2152
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:40,930
(Ji Hyo is caught stealing cookies.)

2153
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:45,730
(She's wearing black lipstick now.)

2154
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,530
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo
are out of control.)

2155
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,740
I'm scared.

2156
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,700
(Kwang Soo comes back
after sending Ji Hyo away.)

2157
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,070
It's me.

2158
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,700
(Desperate)

2159
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,740
It's me.

2160
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,610
(I'll teach you a lesson.)

2161
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:03,740
This isn't what the game is about.

2162
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,210
Everyone.

2163
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:09,750
(After seeing this mess, the staff
decided never to play this again.)

2164
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:10,910
You have 20 seconds left.

2165
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,030
(There are only 20 seconds left.)

2166
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,320
(Jae Suk is still enjoying
playing James Bond.)

2167
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,620
(The players gobble up the cookies.)

2168
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,030
(Round 3 is over.)

2169
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:20,160
Okay!

2170
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,360
Please pick up everything
on the floor.

2171
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,990
We have more cookies
than I expected.

2172
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,270
- That's a relief.
- Okay.

2173
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,740
- Unbelievable.
- That was hilarious.

2174
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:27,640
- Okay.
- That was fun.

2175
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,680
(That was fun.)

2176
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,370
- We're weighing the cookies now.
- Okay.

2177
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:35,040
Everyone, let me announce
the final mission result.

2178
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,240
- What's the result?
- It's over.

2179
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,780
With 0.648kg,

2180
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,110
Team Jong Kook is in first place.

2181
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:42,080
(Team Jong Kook wins first place
with 0.648kg.)

2182
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,450
We worked hard.

2183
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,080
With 540g, Team Suk Jin is
in second place.

2184
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,580
- No way.
- Really?

2185
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:50,320
- We're in 2nd place again.
- We keep coming in 2nd place.

2186
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,400
With 292g, Team Jae Suk is
in third place.

2187
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:55,440
According to the result, let's make
changes to the roulette wheel.

2188
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,570
Please bring it in.

2189
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:59,570
- We're in first place again.
- I know.

2190
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,900
(A dud is replaced
with a Korean beef set.)

2191
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,040
We'll definitely win a gift.

2192
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,450
There are too many gifts.

2193
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,650
(This is not good.)

2194
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,450
Before Jong Kook spins
the roulette wheel,

2195
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:14,320
I'll reveal the hidden missions,
which Jong Kook didn't know about.

2196
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,780
- He didn't know about them?
- He didn't know about them?

2197
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,360
There were missions
that he didn't know about?

2198
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,730
Today's hidden missions
were carried out...

2199
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,950
to decide who will pay
for Jong Kook's birthday gift.

2200
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,700
- Surprise!
- Yes!

2201
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:24,730
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

2202
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,600
One of us will pay for the gift
you pick.

2203
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,290
I see.

2204
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:29,770
If Jong Kook...

2205
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:32,500
manages to guess
all five hidden missions...

2206
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,640
carried out by the other members,

2207
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,280
he can spin the roulette wheel
three times.

2208
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:40,310
If he guesses 3 or 4,
he gets to spin it 2 times.

2209
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,370
If he guesses two or less,
he gets to spin it only once.

2210
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:46,650
It's not easy to guess
all five of them.

2211
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,210
- It's not easy.
- Take a guess.

2212
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:50,320
First, linking their arms with me.

2213
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,390
(Confident)

2214
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,120
And then putting stickers on me.

2215
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:55,400
Putting stickers on you.

2216
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,730
Let me see.

2217
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,930
What else?

2218
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,600
Making me say, "Here I am"?

2219
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,460
Making me say, "Here I am"?

2220
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,270
(Kim Jong Kook, Tiger,
Extremely good at guessing)

2221
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:07,500
Making you say, "Here I am."

2222
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,700
(How did he know?)

2223
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,830
And?

2224
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:11,950
(Jong Kook has already guessed
3 missions right.)

2225
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:13,950
What else, you punk?

2226
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:19,020
(Out of frustration,
Suk Jin snaps at Jong Kook.)

2227
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,280
Gosh.

2228
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,280
(It makes everyone feel better.)

2229
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:23,210
(Disappointed)

2230
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:25,030
Let's see how many you get right.

2231
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,560
- What did we do all day?
- It's the worst.

2232
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:28,790
Hold on.

2233
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,650
I'm not sure about the other things.

2234
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:31,860
Making me eat something?

2235
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,200
- Jong Kook got three right.
- It's too hard.

2236
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:36,360
You can spin the roulette wheel
two times.

2237
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,200
(Jong Kook gets to spin
the roulette wheel 2 times.)

2238
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,330
- We'd love to get him a present.
- Of course.

2239
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:42,980
- Of course.
- All right.

2240
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,140
(The Running Balls have been
distributed.)

2241
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,500
(Ji Hyo: 56, Haha: 43,
Se Chan and Kwang Soo: 27)

2242
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,540
(They can transfer their
Running Balls to someone else.)

2243
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,480
Decide who you want to transfer
your Running Balls to.

2244
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,320
- Shall we decide?
- Yes.

2245
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,910
(They write down who will receive
their Running Balls.)

2246
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:55,190
We're a team.

2247
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:57,710
- You and I are a team.
- I know.

2248
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,250
We've been through so much together.

2249
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,490
(Whispering)

2250
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,600
Why...

2251
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,360
- Why are you listening to him?
- That's not it.

2252
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,490
- Let me just hear him out.
- Whose side are you on?

2253
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:06,770
You and I are a team.

2254
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,160
Your teams don't matter anymore.

2255
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:09,440
Write Jae Suk's name.

2256
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,790
Everyone should write
Jae Suk's name.

2257
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,640
- I...
- Write Jae Suk's name.

2258
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,000
(Suk Jin wants all the
Running Balls to go to Jae Suk.)

2259
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,330
I'm giving five to Jae Suk.

2260
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:16,870
- This is not...
- Write, "Yu Suk Jin."

2261
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:18,030
"Yu Suk Jin."

2262
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:19,350
"Yu Suk Jin"?

2263
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:20,540
"Yu Suk Jin."

2264
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,480
"Yu Suk Jin"?
He wants me to write, "Yu Suk Jin."

2265
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,850
(What are you talking about?)

2266
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,110
"Yu Suk Jin"?

2267
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:27,650
Let's see what happens.

2268
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:30,280
Please spin it.

2269
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,990
It'd be unbelievable
if he picks Team Jae Suk.

2270
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,530
- Here we go.
- That'd be incredible.

2271
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:34,930
- Spin it hard.
- A laptop.

2272
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,320
Please.

2273
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,400
- Let's go!
- Please.

2274
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:40,270
Look at the dust.

2275
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:41,740
- Please.
- Let's see.

2276
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:42,990
Pick a dud!

2277
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:44,200
It's almost there.

2278
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:46,830
- Here it comes.
- This is dangerous.

2279
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,440
- Why?
- It's coming back.

2280
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,940
Keep going. This is dangerous.

2281
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,850
- Jong Kook.
- It's coming back.

2282
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:53,950
("Sports massage pass")

2283
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:56,110
(What will be the first gift for
Jong Kook's birthday party?)

2284
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,210
- Stop.
- Keep going.

2285
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:58,950
"Tonic".

2286
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,280
- Tonic.
- Tonic.

2287
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,060
- It's worth 300 dollars.
- That's not too expensive.

2288
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,030
- Tonic.
- That's not expensive.

2289
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:07,250
- It's fine.
- Tonic.

2290
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,430
- Sure.
- Should we keep going?

2291
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:09,650
Tonic.

2292
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,820
- Korean beef set is good.
- Is this his last chance?

2293
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:11,900
It is.

2294
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,270
Please. Please.

2295
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:17,200
This is...

2296
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,860
- making me nervous.
- It makes you tense up.

2297
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,740
- It's getting there.
- It's going.

2298
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,110
(Is the last one a dud?)

2299
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,640
- You never know, Jae Suk.
- It's coming.

2300
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,370
- It's coming.
- Jae Suk!

2301
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:27,400
- Team Jae Suk!
- It's coming!

2302
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,350
(Will it land on
Team Jae Suk's "laptop"?)

2303
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,950
- Laptop!
- What is it?

2304
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:32,850
- Laptop!
- Laptop!

2305
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,280
- Laptop!
- What is it?

2306
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,490
- Laptop!
- Laptop!

2307
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:36,490
(Laptop?)

2308
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:38,210
- Laptop!
- Laptop!

2309
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:39,430
It's a laptop.

2310
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,360
It's a laptop.

2311
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,490
Really?

2312
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:45,320
- This is insane.
- It's a laptop.

2313
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:48,440
- Why did you suggest it?
- He's so lucky.

2314
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,100
- Who?
- He's lucky.

2315
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:52,160
- Who's going to pay for it?
- I got a laptop.

2316
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,940
- Tonic.
- This is insane.

2317
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,960
Okay!

2318
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:57,200
He got the tonic and the laptop.

2319
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,150
We'll draw two balls later.

2320
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:01,480
The 1st will pay for the tonic,
and the 2nd will pay for the laptop.

2321
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,040
- Look at that.
- What's wrong with Suk Jin's?

2322
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,520
I have fewer balls than expected.

2323
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,910
- Suk Jin...
- I have more than I thought.

2324
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:10,750
It would be strange
if Suk Jin doesn't get picked.

2325
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:13,530
I didn't know
you all loved me so much.

2326
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:15,450
It would be strange
if Suk Jin doesn't get picked.

2327
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:17,120
Close it.

2328
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,620
The one who deserves
it will get picked.

2329
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:20,530
I can get tonic for Jong Kook.

2330
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,490
- The first person...
- Can't you?

2331
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,600
is for the tonic.

2332
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,810
Please give a round of applause.

2333
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:27,070
Happy birthday, Jong Kook!

2334
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,180
I hope you feel energized
after drinking the tonic.

2335
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,400
I wish you good health.

2336
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,350
Here we go. This is for the tonic.

2337
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,040
This is so much fun.

2338
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:36,570
Is one coming out? There is.

2339
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:38,020
- Don't look.
- Is there one?

2340
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:40,110
There's one person.
This is for the tonic.

2341
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:41,820
Tonic is good for your health.

2342
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:42,990
This is our chance
to give him a gift.

2343
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:44,060
It's our chance. Who is it?

2344
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:47,650
(Who is the lucky person
that gets to pay?)

2345
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,560
Tonic is good for your health.

2346
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,400
Suk Jin.

2347
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,030
(Suk Jin is the lucky one.)

2348
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:54,600
This is nerve-racking, right?

2349
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,790
- Let's laugh. Laugh.
- I had no clue.

2350
01:18:57,790 --> 01:18:59,310
I didn't think
it was going to be him.

2351
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:00,660
I'm happy.

2352
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:03,400
I'm happy because instead of him,
I want to get it for his mother.

2353
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,070
You're blushing too much
to be happy.

2354
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:06,850
- Next person.
- Laptop.

2355
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:07,870
- This is for the laptop.
- Laptop.

2356
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:08,980
This is the real deal.

2357
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,520
This is more expensive.

2358
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:12,990
I wonder
who the lucky person will be.

2359
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:16,410
1, 2, 3. Here we go.

2360
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:17,650
What are the odds?

2361
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,430
- Is one coming?
- There is.

2362
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:21,430
Who will be paying for the laptop?

2363
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,820
1, 2, 3.

2364
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,560
Se Chan.

2365
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,620
(It's Se Chan,
Jong Kook's favorite.)

2366
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,860
(Gosh...)

2367
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,960
(He's so happy
that his legs give out.)

2368
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,270
Suk Jin.

2369
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,140
I am the poorest here.

2370
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,500
- How did this happen?
- It never works out.

2371
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,570
A laptop?

2372
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,110
I thought
it was going to be Suk Jin.

2373
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:45,540
(Admirable Se Chan)

2374
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:46,710
There are 100 dollar laptops.

2375
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:48,150
- We'll sign it.
- They like gifts.

2376
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,250
I know.

2377
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:51,150
- We'll present the gifts.
- Sure.

2378
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:52,820
- There you go.
- Jong Kook.

2379
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,930
- Happy birthday.
- Congratulations.

2380
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,400
Happy birthday!

2381
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,990
- Happy birthday, Jong Kook.
- Yes!

2382
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:59,430
Happy birthday.

2383
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:03,330
(May is the month of festivals.
5 Almighty of Festivals are here!)

2384
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:04,900
(Ahn Ji Young of BOL4)

2385
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,460
(Jin Hyuk of UP10TION,
Hyojung of OH MY GIRL)

2386
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,900
(BewhY, Jessi)

2387
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,350
(Whoever gets more money wins!)

2388
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,350
(Team Idol Stars?
More like stars in my heart.)

2389
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,400
(Team Idol Stars, Team Hip-Hop,
and Team Indie compete...)

2390
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,680
(with pride for
the title Almighty of Festivals.)

2391
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,110
Don't get mad unnecessarily.

2392
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:20,020
(It was peaceful in the beginning,)

2393
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:23,450
(but that changed all of a sudden.)

2394
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:25,620
(The festival is over.)

2395
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,430
(It's not about teams anymore.)

2396
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:30,560
(It's a brutal festival
with rivalry.)

2397
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,900
(Monopoly, Share)

2398
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,790
(The temptation to take it all
is uncontrollable.)

2399
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:35,790
(Share and monopoly,)

2400
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:39,440
(betrayal and deals continue
between these options.)
