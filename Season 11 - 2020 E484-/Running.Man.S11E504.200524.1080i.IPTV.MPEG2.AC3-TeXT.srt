1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,460
(One spring day in May)

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,900
There's something.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,960
- What's that?
- I guess we're sitting there.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,710
Bo Pil, you're wearing a shirt.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,710
- Why do you even care?
- We all are wearing shirts.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,950
Why would you even care about that?

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,170
You're wearing two shirts.

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,240
It's one shirt.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,920
- You're wearing 2 shirts.
- No, it's 1.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,440
Are you wearing
one of them inside out?

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,510
No, it's one shirt.

13
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,190
Ji Hyo, it's winter again for you.

14
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,560
She's wearing winter clothes.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,190
- It's a grandma's vest.
- That's what my grandma wears.

16
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,760
It's a grandma's vest.

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,260
- It's winter for Ji Hyo.
- Grandma's vest.

18
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,660
Jong Kook said he doesn't believe
in fortune, but he wears pink a lot.

19
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,770
I know.

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,360
He wears pink in TV shows.

21
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
(Jong Kook has been
wearing pink a lot is...)

22
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,840
(because he was recommended
to do it by a fortune teller.)

23
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,910
(He didn't seem
to care about it back then.)

24
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,430
He's wearing pink again.

25
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,100
- He's all pink.
- I just want...

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,070
Jong Kook to be honest.

27
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,070
Just say you are affected.

28
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,140
It's not like you don't care at all.

29
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,380
You can say it bothers you a little.

30
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,450
You better not do things
that are bad for you.

31
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,250
(He's being honest.)

32
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,090
- Okay.
- You know what I mean.

33
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,280
- I get it.
- It's done.

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,850
I understand.

35
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,860
Kwang Soo, you fell in the mud.

36
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,660
Did you apply paint or something?

37
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,970
- No.
- He spilled paint on his pants.

38
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,860
I heard something about it.
It's not official though.

39
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,080
Thankfully, we are sponsored
by some apparel companies.

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,940
But Kwang Soo pays for it.

41
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,500
(A rumor has it that Kwang Soo
pays for his clothes.)

42
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,380
- What are you talking about?
- Isn't it true?

43
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,720
I thought you were
a popular celebrity.

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,810
- Isn't it true?
- My gosh.

45
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,940
I don't pay money for that.

46
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,350
Really? Isn't it true?

47
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,520
A rumor has it that
you pay for your outfit.

48
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,550
Ji Hyo's new movie, "Intruder"
is finally being released.

49
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,520
(Ji Hyo's new movie, "Intruder"
is being released on June 4.)

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,660
"Intruder".

51
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,890
You should promote your movie.

52
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,020
Where do you intrude on?

53
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,100
What kind of promotion is that?

54
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,470
You don't have to
force yourself to do this.

55
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,560
What are you talking about?

56
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,770
I'm trying to help her.
She must intrude on something.

57
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,270
After he started running
his own YouTube channel,

58
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,140
I realized that he's not good
for TV shows.

59
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,800
I'm telling you.

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,830
- Is it too raw?
- Don't you think so?

61
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,880
Is he too unrefined?

62
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,910
I should get my part cut.

63
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,640
I know.

64
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,270
I just wish you good luck.

65
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,940
All right. It's being...

66
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
released in rough times.

67
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,660
But I hope it will be loved
by a lot of people.

68
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,990
Me too.

69
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,520
- Watch it wearing a mask.
- It will go well.

70
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,550
- Sure.
- And So Min is...

71
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,150
- finally coming back next week.
- Yes.

72
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,150
She can't wait to join us again.

73
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,860
I thought she'd come today.

74
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,670
(So Min is wearing a microphone.)

75
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,040
(The daily life of So Min who's
coming back after a long break...)

76
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,860
(will be revealed soon.)

77
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,800
Today, you are having Dilemma Race
where you should choose...

78
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,870
between personal gain and
your team's victory with R coins.

79
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,240
- Dilemma Race?
- Gosh.

80
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,820
- Before...
- Already?

81
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,640
- He's sighing already.
- Before we start the race,

82
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,340
I will introduce today's guests.

83
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,150
- Really?
- That's nice.

84
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,180
Behind the shade,

85
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,120
we have three guests
who faced acute dilemmas...

86
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,090
in their dramas.

87
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,650
- Acute dilemmas?
- Yes.

88
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,020
The guests randomly picked...

89
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,990
10, 20, and 30 coins beforehand.

90
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,070
Gosh, this is hard.

91
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,110
You will talk to the guests
and pick a number you want.

92
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,840
Then the guests you pick will
share their coins with you.

93
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,240
We better be separated.

94
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,840
We should pick a guest
with more R coins.

95
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,050
But the guest can lie
about the R coins...

96
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,450
they have.

97
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,960
The members should try
not to fall for their lies...

98
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,830
and pick a guest
without gathering all together...

99
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,650
in order to get more coins.

100
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,920
We should get as many
coins as possible.

101
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,570
Please say hello to the guests then.

102
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,640
(The shadows of the 3 guests
are revealed.)

103
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
- We have two female guests.
- First...

104
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,540
- Female guests.
- And we have one man.

105
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,010
Number two...

106
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,040
looks handsome. Even his shadow
is good-looking.

107
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,240
Just take a look at him.

108
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,640
Look at the silhouette.
He has a long neck.

109
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,840
He looks handsome.

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,520
His shadow is good-looking.

111
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,920
Imagine that Se Chan
is sitting there.

112
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,550
Even his shadow looks ugly.

113
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,260
(Imagine that Se Chan is sitting
there. Even his shadow looks ugly.)

114
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260
You will notice that
my mouth is sticking out.

115
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,590
You'll be able to tell
it's my shadow.

116
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,830
Even the shadow looks handsome.

117
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,890
Look at the neckline.

118
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,620
His neckline is so...

119
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,670
So they faced
dilemmas in their dramas.

120
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,540
- Dilemmas.
- I wonder what dilemma it was.

121
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,960
- Number one.
- Yes?

122
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,110
What dilemma it was that
you went through in your drama?

123
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,140
I couldn't...

124
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,840
get away from...

125
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,170
the dating violence of my boyfriend.

126
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,020
(Dating violence?)

127
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,390
Dating violence?

128
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,060
Whenever I tried to avoid it,
he got me a ring,

129
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,630
- money, and...
- Hang on.

130
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,630
(Hang on.)

131
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,200
Jae Suk, I think I know her.

132
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,390
I know this voice.

133
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,460
I think I know her.

134
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,460
If you say it,
we all know will know who she is.

135
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,130
- She's...
- Who is she?

136
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,570
- Why? Who is she?
- "A World of Married Couple".

137
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,160
- Kim Hee Ae's...
- The bobbed-hair.

138
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,570
Right. Hee Ae's assistant.

139
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,640
Exactly.

140
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,770
I didn't watch
"A World of Married Couple".

141
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,600
- I watched it.
- No way.

142
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,510
She must be really busy.

143
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,510
It might not be her.

144
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,340
- Is the drama over?
- Hang on.

145
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,950
Number one, have you ever met
one of us before?

146
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,210
No.

147
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,710
I think it's her.

148
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,020
- Then...
- It's her.

149
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,120
Number two, have you ever met...

150
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,760
one of us before?

151
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,520
- Yes, I have.
- What? Who?

152
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,720
Se Chan.

153
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,130
- Is he younger than Se Chan?
- Se Chan?

154
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,570
- Se Chan?
- Am I older than him?

155
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,500
Let me ask you this question.

156
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,660
How many coins did you get? Number
one, how many coins do you have?

157
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,530
- This is important.
- Would they tell us the truth?

158
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,530
I got 10 coins.

159
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,600
I don't think she's lying.

160
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,750
- She sounds honest.
- I guess it's true.

161
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,140
What about you, number two?

162
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,120
I got 10 coins.

163
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,640
They are lying.

164
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,250
- They should share them with us.
- I think number two is lying.

165
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,840
- He's lying.
- He pretends to be poor.

166
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,390
Because they don't
want to share coins with us.

167
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,910
- What about number three?
- I'm...

168
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,060
rich at heart.

169
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,630
So how many coins do you have?

170
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,830
- I'm rich.
- My gosh.

171
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,350
- She's...
- She's changing the subject.

172
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,090
- How many coins?
- She's been in many variety shows.

173
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,140
- My gosh.
- She's not telling us the truth.

174
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,090
She doesn't give us
the exact answer.

175
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,140
Wait. I can't pick one.

176
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,270
- Did you make your decision?
- Yes.

177
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,970
- All right.
- 1, 2, and 3.

178
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,530
- I'm picking number 1.
- Me too.

179
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,750
- I picked number one.
- What?

180
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,880
- She doesn't lie.
- 4 people picked number 1.

181
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,540
2 people picked number 2,
and 1 person picked number 3.

182
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,340
Let's have them here now.

183
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,120
Please open the shade.

184
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,120
(Who are the 3 guests...)

185
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,630
(who put the members in a dilemma?)

186
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,760
- It's her.
- We were right.

187
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,460
(A rising star, Sim Eun Woo)

188
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,000
(She's a scene-stealer who
mesmerized viewers with her acting.)

189
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,180
(She's Actress Sim Eun Woo
with a promising future.)

190
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,100
- It's her.
- Who's number two?

191
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,140
Who are you?

192
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,750
It's Min Gue.

193
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,040
- And Jaekyung.
- She's Jaekyung.

194
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,120
I knew it.

195
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,820
Jaekyung and Min Gue.

196
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,620
(Kim Jae Hyung played a detective
who has a criminal father.)

197
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,130
(And she gives fans an unavoidable
dilemma with her charm.)

198
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,350
(Kim Min Gue played a king who faces
a dilemma with precognitive dreams.)

199
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,570
(He also gives off his charm
in many variety shows.)

200
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,660
I didn't know it was Jaekyung.

201
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

202
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,440
Hello, Eun Woo.

203
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,640
It was you, Eun Woo.

204
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,940
Nice to meet you.

205
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,440
- I really liked your drama.
- Jaekyung.

206
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,140
- Hello.
- It's you, Min Gue.

207
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,180
- You were amazing in the drama.
- Jaekyung, long time no see.

208
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,180
I know.

209
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,520
Come over here.

210
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,640
Let me introduce them one by one.
We have Kim Jaekyung here.

211
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,390
- Jaekyung.
- It's good to have you here.

212
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,260
This is her first appearance
in Running Man.

213
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,080
- I'm back in 6 years.
- It's been 6 years.

214
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,150
It's her second time.

215
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,350
(It's been 6 years.
It's her second time.)

216
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,150
Don't be so presumptuous.

217
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,520
Why are you twisting your legs?

218
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,370
Don't pretend to be handsome.

219
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,640
Jaekyung, do you
think he's fashionable?

220
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,770
- He's my style.
- Are you serious?

221
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,160
(Unexpectedly, he happens
to be her type.)

222
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,180
Do you like the pants
covered with mud?

223
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,710
Isn't it cool?

224
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,040
It's covered with paints.

225
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,540
It looks like he sat
on a painted bench.

226
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,880
He looks like a guy
with a free spirit.

227
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,040
Are you serious?

228
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,910
- He's happy.
- My goodness.

229
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,460
Jaekyung is back in our show
after six years.

230
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,850
Last time she joined our show,

231
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,630
- we had Gary here.
- That's right.

232
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,520
- Gary was here.
- He was my partner.

233
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,830
- I see.
- Really?

234
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,960
We moved around
provinces cooking.

235
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,270
- Exactly.
- I see.

236
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,660
You have a good memory.

237
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,900
My throat is choked.

238
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,010
- All of a sudden?
- Is it because of Gary?

239
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,380
Ji Hyo.

240
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,640
She still remembers it
while we don't.

241
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,710
- And...
- She doesn't remember yesterday.

242
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,270
Ji Hyo suddenly weighed in.
That doesn't happen a lot.

243
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,980
I know.

244
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,960
Next up is... Gosh, I really liked
"A World of Married Couple".

245
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,650
- I was really...
- Gosh.

246
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,850
I couldn't believe my ears.

247
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,080
- She made me cry.
- She's Sim Eun Woo.

248
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,560
Hello.

249
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,890
You started studying classics?
What does that mean?

250
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,020
I really like your show,

251
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,940
- "Hangout with Yoo".
- I see.

252
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,160
You played the harp...

253
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,730
- That's right.
- in the show.

254
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,370
And I was very impressed by that.

255
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,970
So that's when I...

256
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,440
- Harp?
- Did you learn to play the harp?

257
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,970
- Do you play the harp?
- No, that's my dream.

258
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,550
I listen to classical music.

259
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,740
- You listen to classical music.
- Classical music.

260
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,550
It's not that
surprising news though.

261
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,320
- She just listens to music.
- Why would you put it in here?

262
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,250
What's the big deal?

263
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,380
I thought it was something amazing.

264
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,400
I thought she bought the harp.

265
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,030
I listen to trot songs
because of his show.

266
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,720
Is there any song...

267
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,300
you'd like to recommend us?

268
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,090
Gustav Mahler.

269
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,310
Gustav Mahler?

270
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,730
"Adagietto" by Gustav Mahler.

271
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,940
"Adagietto"? Can you hum the song?

272
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,100
For us to see what it's like.

273
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,710
It's quite majestic.

274
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,550
If it's a lie, just tell us now.

275
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,450
- Is it a lie?
- Hey!

276
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,650
- Just to make sure.
- She said "Adagietto".

277
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,710
She can't hum the song.

278
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,290
How dare you talk
to a big star like that?

279
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,460
No, it's not like that.

280
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,960
- She's a star.
- I'm a star too.

281
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,120
I'm a star.

282
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,030
You're not a star.

283
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,830
I'm a star.

284
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,720
You're a burner.

285
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,960
What? A burner?

286
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,730
So what's "Adagietto"?

287
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,130
It's my fault.

288
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,040
(It's my fault.)

289
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,040
She's good.

290
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,130
- Okay.
- You're good at this.

291
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,370
- It's nice that she's being honest.
- You're good.

292
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,870
- This feels a lot better.
- All right.

293
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,340
Eun Woo, do you realize...

294
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,050
how popular you've become?

295
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,510
Well, I'm on Running Man.

296
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,690
(Well, I'm on Running Man.)

297
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,750
She's so witty.

298
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,430
- That makes me so happy.
- She's a good talker.

299
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,590
- She's so kind.
- She's a really good talker.

300
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,960
- What's your major? Singing?
- I majored in...

301
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,120
musical theater.

302
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,670
- Really?
- Really?

303
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,130
- You must be a great singer.
- You do have an amazing voice.

304
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,670
Then you must be...

305
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,100
- Please give her a big hand.
- Yes!

306
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,410
She starts acting right away.

307
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,830
("Hopelessly Devoted To You"
from the musical, "Grease")

308
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,710
(She sings confidently...)

309
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,420
(with a pure and clean voice.)

310
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,530
(Since the moment
I fell in love with you)

311
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,430
- She's an amazing singer.
- She has a beautiful voice.

312
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,700
- Right?
- Unbelievable.

313
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,860
(I've been only thinking of you)

314
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,200
- She's really good.
- She's incredible.

315
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,970
(I only think of you)

316
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,710
(She finishes off with
impressive, clean high notes.)

317
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,870
She's so good.

318
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,240
- She's amazing.
- I didn't expect this.

319
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,880
(We haven't seen such
a nice performance in a while.)

320
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,660
Are you interested in
joining a mixed-gender group?

321
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,920
- Hold on.
- Oh, wait.

322
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,250
I saw it.

323
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,560
- She's an incredible singer.
- Why do you bring up that show?

324
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
I'm sorry.

325
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,030
Do that when you hang out.

326
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,120
(You're on Running Man right now.)

327
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,490
Next up is...

328
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,400
- Se Chan's good friend.
- He's a good friend of mine.

329
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,990
- Min Gue!
- Min Gue!

330
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,230
- Hello.
- He's so good-looking.

331
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,540
We're friends too.
Why didn't you mention it?

332
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,810
But we're not that close.

333
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,310
(Min Gue sounds so cold.)

334
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,470
- Still...
- Just say that you're close.

335
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,080
- You're in trouble now.
- Jong Kook...

336
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,420
- Just say that you're close.
- Jong Kook seems hurt.

337
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,920
- You're in trouble now.
- How...

338
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,510
- Talk to Jong Kook.
- We do know each other.

339
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,030
- Jong Kook made a friendly gesture,
- We know each other.

340
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,750
- but Min Gue drew a line.
- He sounds serious.

341
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,720
We do know each other,

342
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,660
- but we didn't...
- Take this away. I quit.

343
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,360
(Jong Kook is already
throwing a tantrum.)

344
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,720
- Why?
- Just go down on your knees.

345
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,440
- You're in trouble now.
- We never exchanged our numbers.

346
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,460
(He didn't want to be rude.)

347
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,810
- Okay.
- He didn't want to be rude.

348
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,970
If Min Gue doesn't
put this right today...

349
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,780
It'll stay this way forever.

350
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,500
It might take a long time.

351
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,100
What's worse,
Jong Kook chose number two.

352
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,210
Really?

353
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,610
I chose number two.

354
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,840
Min Gue has appeared in...

355
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,210
the dramas, "Queen: Love and War"
and "Perfume".

356
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,960
He was in that drama too.

357
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,210
Was it "Signal"?

358
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,790
- He played a detective.
- That's right.

359
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,880
- He was in "Signal"?
- Yes.

360
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,720
- Jong Kook knows a lot.
- "I Can See Your Voice" too.

361
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,900
- He became famous from that show.
- He was on that show too.

362
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,490
- He became famous.
- Thanks to Jong Kook,

363
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,630
I received a lot of attention.

364
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,330
Forget it. It's too late.

365
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,960
I'm doomed.

366
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,630
To solve this,

367
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,910
you have to start from a ball boy.

368
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,910
Seriously.

369
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,810
He's an amazing singer.

370
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,080
- Really?
- You're a good singer?

371
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,420
- He is.
- I'd love to hear it.

372
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,610
- Min Gue, can you sing for us?
- Please go ahead.

373
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,380
- Eun Woo sang for us too.
- All right.

374
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,920
- Should I sing without any music?
- Yes, please sing just a little.

375
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,190
He has dimples too.

376
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,720
- That's his charm.
- He has dimples.

377
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,960
I have them too.

378
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,200
- Where?
- No, you don't.

379
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,070
You do have them.

380
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,260
(Here they are.)

381
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,230
Isn't that an ax cut?

382
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,540
"An ax cut"?

383
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,670
- Isn't that just a scar?
- Did you make it with your finger?

384
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,730
It's a dimple.

385
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,780
- That's not a dimple.
- That's not a dimple.

386
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,340
- I haven't seen dimples in a while.
- Thank you.

387
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,600
- I'll sing just a little.
- Okay.

388
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,510
I love Jong Kook's songs.

389
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,010
I'll sing one of them.

390
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,190
Jong Kook is not angry anymore.

391
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,740
He's smiling. Good job!

392
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,250
Congratulations.

393
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,560
Good job.

394
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,530
It's from the album he released
right after his military service.

395
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,990
- You remember that?
- You have a good memory.

396
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,460
Jong Kook is not angry at all
anymore.

397
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,300
(Jong Kook forgives Min Gue
completely.)

398
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,460
- I'll just sing the climax.
- Sure.

399
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:35,410
(I love you more today
than yesterday)

400
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,230
(Both Min Gue and the song
make him happy.)

401
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,950
(The song is nearing its climax.)

402
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,240
(What?)

403
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,190
What are you doing?

404
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,820
- That was so random.
- Look at your face.

405
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,790
That was nice.

406
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,190
- He's a great singer.
- His dimple is so deep.

407
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,830
- I'm sorry, Min Gue.
- That was really nice.

408
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,460
- You couldn't help it.
- I loved it.

409
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,170
It's time to distribute the coins
within the teams.

410
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,990
Eun Woo was chosen by most people.

411
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,260
We're a group of idiots.

412
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
(Jae Suk, Haha, Kwang Soo,
and Se Chan chose Eun Woo.)

413
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,310
It's going to be fierce.

414
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,500
- Eun Woo.
- Like this?

415
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,100
(Team Eun Woo has...)

416
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,180
- Show us.
- I'm sorry.

417
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,650
- Gosh.
- Okay!

418
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,810
- You were...
- Okay!

419
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,470
- You were being too honest.
- She really has 10 coins.

420
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,210
- I mean...
- I thought...

421
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,840
She was emphasizing so much
that she has 10 coins,

422
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,190
so I thought she'd have 30.

423
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,510
The rest of you
will become one team.

424
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,880
- Who chose Min Gue?
- I did.

425
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,720
- Ji Hyo and Jong Kook did.
- Ji Hyo and Jong Kook did.

426
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,030
Show us how many coins you have.

427
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,990
(Team Min Gue has 20 coins.)

428
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,170
The 3 of you get 6 coins each.

429
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,040
The remaining two coins will be
distributed by Min Gue.

430
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,460
- There are 2 coins left.
- There are 2 coins left?

431
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,000
If I give you the coins,

432
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,130
can we end our relationship?

433
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,210
(Can we end our relationship?)

434
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,340
What do you mean?

435
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,740
That's not what I mean.

436
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,050
He means...

437
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,280
You want me to take the coins...

438
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,710
- and get lost?
- That's not it.

439
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,290
He did make it sound that way.

440
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,820
- You want me to get lost?
- That's not what he means.

441
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,750
I mean, can we end
our misunderstanding?

442
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,590
Don't worry. You can take the coins
if you want.

443
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,830
- Jong Kook is hurt again.
- It's up to you.

444
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,900
Both of them?

445
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,090
I'll give one to each of you.

446
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,170
Really? You're so kind.

447
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,440
- Jong Kook is happy again.
- And...

448
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,460
Jaekyung and Suk Jin get
15 coins each.

449
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,080
Like I said earlier,

450
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,730
today you'll compete for coins
in Too Much Dilemma Race.

451
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,500
After every mission,
there will be Coin Dilemma.

452
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,240
At the end of each round,

453
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,550
each of you will hand in
as many coins as you want secretly.

454
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,190
The team that hands in
the most coins wins a point.

455
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,190
- Really? That's simple.
- The team that wins...

456
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,060
2 rounds out of 3
will be the final winner.

457
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,990
The two people with the most coins
in the winning team will win prizes,

458
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,430
and the bottom two in the losing
team will be penalized.

459
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,590
Considering the people on my team,

460
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,070
- we'll only play for ourselves.
- Seriously.

461
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,910
None of them would sacrifice
themselves for their team.

462
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,410
After each mission,
the winning team and losing team...

463
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,470
will receive different amounts
of coins.

464
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,550
So pay attention
to the mission results.

465
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,680
Now please change
and go to the first mission spot.

466
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,790
(Let's start the dilemma mission.)

467
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,350
(Team Eun Woo, Team Min Gue)

468
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,220
Eun Woo, please come here.

469
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,830
1, 2, 3.

470
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,800
(With a clap,
everyone is ready for shooting.)

471
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,990
I hope it goes well.

472
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,590
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

473
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,540
- Are you at a cafe?
- Have we started?

474
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,670
(Are you at a cafe?)

475
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,230
(Suk Jin is still relaxing.)

476
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,040
Jong Kook is having coffee too.
Why do you only talk to me?

477
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,870
Jong Kook is...

478
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,150
Also, you should have hidden
the logo.

479
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,180
- I got rid of it.
- Listen.

480
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,010
I didn't know we'd started.

481
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,370
Of course we did. Everyone's here.

482
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,510
Suk Jin acts differently
on camera...

483
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,710
more than anyone I know.

484
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,580
(Suk Jin can't deny it.)

485
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,480
Jaekyung, you look...

486
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,480
- a lot like Kim Ji Won.
- Who?

487
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,990
- From "Descendants of the Sun".
- Kim Ji Won.

488
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,660
She looks a lot like Ji Won, right?

489
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,860
- Do people ever tell you that?
- At restaurants,

490
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,990
- they give me more food.
- I knew it.

491
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,360
Do you tell them you're not her?

492
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,500
I just smile.

493
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,810
(I just smile.)

494
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,340
(The smile explains everything.)

495
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,600
You accept all the food
they give you?

496
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,240
- She should.
- She couldn't tell them.

497
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,050
- Right.
- It'd embarrass them.

498
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,860
Eun Woo, do people tell you
you look like anyone?

499
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,510
They tell me I look like Android 18.

500
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,050
- From "Dragon Ball"?
- Yes.

501
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,290
- I get it.
- She does look like her.

502
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,600
She looks exactly like her.

503
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,520
- She looks exactly like Android 18.
- They look the same.

504
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,060
I don't know how "Dragon Ball" ends.

505
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,530
- I never finished it.
- I should.

506
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,230
- Did it end?
- It ended very sadly.

507
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,460
What?

508
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,640
It ended?

509
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,030
It did about 30 years ago.

510
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,410
(It did about 30 years ago.)

511
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,710
(It ended back in 1995,
which is 25 years ago.)

512
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,120
It's true that Ji Hyo is
a little isolated from the world,

513
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,150
- but how could you say that?
- It ended 30 years ago.

514
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,420
Why couldn't you just say,
"Yes, it ended."

515
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,920
Do you know Porori?

516
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,280
- Porori?
- Yes, I think you look like Porori.

517
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,780
Do you know Porori?

518
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,360
(The two suddenly start talking
about Porori.)

519
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,630
Did she just do an impression?

520
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,700
- Did you just do an impression?
- Why did you do that?

521
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,900
- Did you two plan this?
- Was it a comedy sketch?

522
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,340
- Did you plan this?
- Did you do an impression?

523
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,300
- Poroporo...
- She suddenly asked me...

524
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,770
- What about you, Min Gue?
- I look like Ji Suk Jin.

525
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,770
- What?
- What?

526
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,910
(Min Gue looks like Suk Jin?)

527
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,150
(What?)

528
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,150
Suk Jin?

529
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,270
Oh, that came out wrong.

530
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,740
I mean Ji Jin Hee.

531
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,150
I mean Ji Jin Hee.

532
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,210
(Their names are similar,
but they look completely different.)

533
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,660
Why did you do that?

534
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,960
Min Gue.

535
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,320
- I almost got angry.
- Thanks.

536
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,960
- Thanks anyway.
- I was so surprised.

537
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,900
I was like, what is he saying?

538
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,050
I thought...

539
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,870
- You do look like Ji Jin Hee.
- I meant Ji Jin Hee.

540
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,170
I thought...

541
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,870
- he must be really ambitious.
- He's determined.

542
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,110
Now I get it.

543
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,880
Show us 3 ways to look cute. In 1...

544
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,180
- Sorry, what did you say?
- Three ways to look cute.

545
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,740
- What does that mean?
- Hey!

546
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,070
Three ways to look cute!

547
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,850
(Because of Min Gue, Suk Jin's face
is slammed with cream.)

548
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,120
(Here and here too.)

549
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,310
You practically punched him.

550
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,520
Team Eun Woo wins.

551
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,980
(Team Eun Woo wins
the warm-up mission.)

552
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,630
The coins will be distributed
according to the results.

553
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,460
The winning team gets cards with
0, 5, 6, 7, and 8 written on them.

554
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,910
The losing team gets cards with
0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 written on them.

555
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,340
Each of you gets as many coins
as the number you pick.

556
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,610
- 7.
- 6.

557
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,610
- Eight.
- Gosh.

558
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,610
Five.

559
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,650
- Who picked zero?
- Haha.

560
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,180
- 4.
- I picked 0.

561
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,210
(Jaekyung 4, Min Gue 3,
Jong Kook 2, Ji Hyo 1, Suk Jin 0)

562
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,850
Gosh, how did this...

563
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,280
This is unbelievable.

564
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,310
The Coin Dilemma starts now.

565
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,960
First, the members of
the losing team will...

566
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,700
hand in coins at the booth
over there one by one.

567
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,820
The team that hands in
more coins will win...

568
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,960
and receive one point.

569
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,630
Guys, let's do this.

570
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,990
We have to win.

571
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,170
We should try to meet
the minimum winning number.

572
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,440
- We should hand in more than 6.
- At least 5 or 6.

573
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,210
We'll definitely win if we get
a total of five coins.

574
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,710
- Most definitely.
- That team will have less.

575
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,210
- That's from each.
- Who'll go first?

576
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,240
- Right, go ahead.
- Sure.

577
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,450
(Will everyone keep their promise?)

578
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,550
(Min Gue hands in one as promised.)

579
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,320
(Jong Kook also hands in one.)

580
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,200
(Their other teammates
hand in theirs as well.)

581
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,860
The winning team can...

582
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,290
ask one from the losing team
how many he or she handed in.

583
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,140
- Really?
- Name the person and I'll tell you.

584
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,210
- Do we all get to hear it?
- Yes.

585
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,300
- Suk Jin...
- He's too obvious.

586
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
- I agree.
- He probably didn't hand in any.

587
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,070
How about Jaekyung or Min Gue?

588
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,350
- Right.
- Let's get a feel for them.

589
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,470
(They don't know if Jaekyung
and Min Gue are the betraying type.)

590
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,970
- Jaekyung?
- Yes, Jaekyung.

591
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,420
- We choose Jaekyung.
- I heard a rattling sound.

592
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,810
- Jaekyung?
- Yes.

593
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,650
Jaekyung...

594
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,550
I'm sure she handed in at least one.

595
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,860
(Team Min Gue agreed
to hand in 1 coin each.)

596
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,820
- She handed in seven.
- She handed in that many?

597
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,820
What?

598
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,930
(Jaekyung, 7 coins)

599
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,700
(Jaekyung handed in 7 coins?)

600
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,260
You'll hand in at least 1, right?
You could spare even 2.

601
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,440
I'm rich with coins.

602
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,800
(Rich Jaekyung handed in 7 coins
for her team!)

603
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,140
You didn't have to!

604
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,040
- That's a bit too much.
- Hey.

605
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,570
- Jae Suk, how about this?
- You didn't have to!

606
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,150
- Let's give up the first round.
- No way.

607
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,950
If you think about it...

608
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,540
You're right.
We should save our coins.

609
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,850
Jaekyung handed in too many coins.

610
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,710
It's not a bad choice
to let them win this round.

611
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,360
We can win the next round instead.

612
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,430
Winning the next round
will make us even.

613
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,400
Winning the first round
is important though.

614
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,290
- But we can't.
- How can we?

615
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,200
Jae Suk, who says
we can win the next round?

616
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,200
You just need to hand in
3, 3, 3, and 2 coins.

617
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,100
- I'll contribute a coin too.
- How much is that in total?

618
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,940
- What?
- What's our total then?

619
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,340
That's 9 plus 2, so 11.

620
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,970
- But they...
- It won't be enough.

621
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,040
- 11 will be enough.
- No, it won't.

622
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,680
- They handed in more than 11.
- Jaekyung handed in 7.

623
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,950
The rest wouldn't
have handed in any.

624
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,240
- They handed in more than 11.
- Won't you hand in any?

625
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,510
- Hold on.
- I'll hand in one.

626
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,950
Can you butt out?
We're trying to work here.

627
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,120
Me too!

628
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,360
(Can you butt out?
We're trying to work here.)

629
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,860
(Me too!)

630
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,420
I'm trying to work here too.

631
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,050
How else do you explain
what I have on my face?

632
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,930
- Just listen to Jae Suk.
- What?

633
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,660
- Where am I supposed to go?
- Also...

634
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,870
Who thinks we should
make a play for the first round?

635
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,020
We should.

636
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,060
I agree.

637
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,490
(Thud)

638
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,530
(Groaning)

639
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,300
- He lowered his hand.
- Why?

640
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
(Kwang Soo suddenly
withdrew his vote.)

641
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,000
We should go all-in
in the second round.

642
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,610
Who thinks we should
aim for the second round?

643
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,010
- It's settled then.
- It's 3 to 2.

644
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,650
- We'll let them win.
- Sure.

645
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,710
(Giving up the first round
was forced upon them.)

646
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,420
They wouldn't have given up
had they not heard about her coins.

647
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,710
- Exactly.
- We would've played.

648
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,160
- Let me reveal the result.
- Sure.

649
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,430
(The result)

650
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,860
I can't believe
she handed in seven coins.

651
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,600
Team Eun Woo handed in...

652
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,130
- zero coins.
- That's right.

653
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,100
Team Min Gue handed in
a total of 10 coins...

654
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,260
which makes them the winning team.

655
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,100
(Team Min Gue wins with 10 coins.)

656
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,670
- One didn't hand in a coin.
- One didn't hand in.

657
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,840
Who betrayed us?

658
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,840
Suk Jin, of course.

659
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,230
You can't seem
to hold a straight face.

660
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,800
We were going to lose anyway.

661
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,610
I can't believe him.

662
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,380
They didn't hand in a whole lot.

663
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,450
- I thought it'd be 13 coins.
- In the second round...

664
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,710
- Sure.
- Let's wish us luck.

665
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,690
- 1, 2, 3. Go, team!
- 1, 2, 3. Go, team!

666
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,250
- We need to win this round.
- Exactly.

667
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,490
It was my son's birthday recently,
and I was shocked.

668
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,490
Someone rang the doorbell...

669
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,630
- at midnight.
- Really?

670
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,900
Four of his friends
came by as a surprise...

671
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,640
- with a cake.
- Those are some good friends.

672
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,440
He must be popular in school.

673
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,210
- Didn't you say anything?
- What?

674
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,440
"Go home!"

675
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,030
Gosh, you startled me.

676
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,650
- Actually...
- "Do you know how late it is?"

677
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,450
We think...

678
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,510
that it's rude to come by that late,

679
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,850
- but that's not how kids think.
- Of course not.

680
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,780
- He has some great friends.
- Exactly.

681
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,660
I don't know if you remember this,
but Suk Jin...

682
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,660
had an English name
known as Cody IV Drop.

683
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,200
- Kwang Soo's was Dung Perry.
- Right.

684
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,460
Do the others
have English names too?

685
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,990
- Jong Kook has one.
- I'm JK.

686
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,840
- I'm JK too.
- Really?

687
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,840
- Really?
- Those are her initials.

688
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,960
My nickname in high school...

689
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,210
- was Kim Jong Kook.
- Why?

690
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,910
Because I'd write my initials KJK
on my books.

691
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,230
- That's right.
- Hold on!

692
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,620
Jong Kook has finally found someone!

693
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,740
Look at them.

694
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,150
- This must be fate.
- Guys, stop it.

695
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,950
- They're also sitting together.
- Look at you, Jaekyung.

696
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,510
- Why are they side by side?
- Your initials are the same.

697
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,390
- No way.
- They have matching bags too.

698
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,480
(No way!)

699
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,660
They have matching bags too.

700
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,550
(All members of the team
have the same bag.)

701
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,960
Haha's ruining things once again.

702
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,250
Get over here, you two.

703
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,560
You ruin everything!

704
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,170
Are you kidding me?

705
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,140
- We'll dial it down.
- Must you force it?

706
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,800
They're doing it
to please themselves.

707
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,340
- It's one amazing coincidence.
- I'm fascinated.

708
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,380
- What about the others?
- Mine is Jimmy.

709
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,110
- What?
- Jimmy?

710
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,740
- Jimmy?
- As in baggage?

711
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,150
- Baggage?
- Are you kidding me?

712
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,420
- Jimmy?
- Why Jimmy?

713
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,420
- Is that what they call you?
- Gosh.

714
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,540
Min Gue, what about you?

715
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,960
I let people call me Ming.

716
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,050
- Ming?
- Ming?

717
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,280
Isn't that Chinese?

718
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,960
- It sounds Chinese.
- M-I-N-G.

719
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,160
I see.

720
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,360
- Ming.
- Ji Hyo, what about you?

721
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,050
I don't have one.

722
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,930
Isn't yours Dam?

723
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,720
- Dam.
- What about Wall?

724
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,560
- Dam.
- Yes, Dam.

725
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,170
- Dam!
- Dam, sure.

726
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,230
I'll go with Dam. So Dam!

727
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,340
Eun Woo, what about you?

728
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,570
I don't have an English name,
but I have one in Sanskrit.

729
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,570
- What?
- Sanskrit?

730
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,450
You've been odd
since the opening, you know.

731
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,310
- What's "Sanskri"?
- Sanskrit.

732
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,510
- What's that?
- It's an ancient Indic language.

733
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,120
- Prana.
- Is that the name?

734
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,590
Why do you have a name in Sanskrit?

735
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,360
I practice yoga,
and it's the name...

736
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,720
my instructor gave me.

737
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
(A unique Sanskrit name)

738
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,700
- I see.
- They give you names too?

739
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,100
Why did you ask
about our English names?

740
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,640
You will be facing
a dilemma in name-calling...

741
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,560
in this game called
What's Your Name.

742
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,000
With those names,
you'll play the Frying Pan Game.

743
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,740
I hope you recall
all the others' names.

744
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,710
The team to reach
10 points first wins.

745
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,980
- What about us then?
- Do we go with something else?

746
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,280
Your nickname is Loser.

747
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,190
- Loser!
- That's not in English.

748
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,890
- Then Large.
- How about Large?

749
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,480
- Large.
- As in x-large.

750
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,280
- Loser as in Go Large?
- That's the one.

751
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,130
- Go Large.
- What's Suk Jin's?

752
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,290
- IV Drop.
- IV Drop?

753
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,170
- IV Drop?
- From Cody IV Drop.

754
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,930
- I'm Perry.
- As in Dung Perry.

755
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,260

- Yes, Jimmy.

756
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,100
- I'm just Perry.
- No, Dung Perry.

757
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,340
- Sebastian.
- Sebastian.

758
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,070
- Quanninomalisquare.

- Seriously?
- What?

761
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,570
- Keep it simple.
- Is this a joke?

762
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,740
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I'm Double Ha.

763
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,310
We'll begin with Double Ha then.

764
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,120
- Okay, Double Ha.
- We're playing offense.

765
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,360
- I'm IV Drop.
- Ready, set, go.

Hold on a second though.

773
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,300
Ming doesn't know
how to play this game.

774
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,000
- You got it wrong though.
- I'm just saying.

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,180
You're making excuses.

776

Don't try to buy some time.

778
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,420

- Aren't you aware of the game?

- Not Prada.

00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,710
- It's in four counts.
- It's Prana.

- Ming...

1023
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,760
Min Gue got zero.

1024
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,900
- Rest got 1, 2, 3, and 4 in order.
- Okay.

1025
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,170
Losing team,
hand in the coins first.

1026
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,640
- Is it losing team first?
- Yes, that's what we did earlier.

1027
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,760
Can we ask after?

1028
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,380
Yes, you can.

1029
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,710
It'll be better for you
to give up the coins.

1030
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,240
How many?

1031
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,170
- Hand in four coins.
- Okay, and then?

1032
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,400
We'll hand in one each.

1033
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,320
Do you think we have a chance?

1034
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,090
Look at those people.
Look at their eyes.

1035
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,150
Look at Kwang Soo.

1036
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,880
(Eyes of a traitor)

1037
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,720
- Hurry up.
- Okay, we'll go.

1038
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,360
(Suk Jin promised
to hand in 2 coins.)

1039
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,170
(Will he hand in 2 as promised?)

1040
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,800
(Submission complete)

1041
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,740
Our team has to win.

1042
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,440
"Our team has to win."
Think about what he just said.

1043
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,030
- Did I confuse you?
- He handed in one at most.

1044
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,030
Right?

1045
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,880
I don't like what he said.

1046
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
(I don't like what he said.)

1047
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,010
Did I confuse you?

1048
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,740
- Here.
- Are they done?

1049
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,650
Yes, you can ask about one person.

1050
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,550
What did Suk Jin say?

1051
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,550
He said he's doing it for the team.

1052
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,990
- Should we ask about him?
- Let's ask him.

1053
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,550
It'll be better for their team too.

1054
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,150
- I agree.
- Really?

1055
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,220
If it's zero, that means
they barely handed in any.

1056
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,900
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1057
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
(Suk Jin has a mysterious smile.
How many coins did he hand in?)

1058
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,670
- My gosh.
- Suk Jin...

1059
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,720
(Suk Jin has a mysterious smile.
How many coins did he hand in?)

1060
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,760
No.

1061
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,840
Suk Jin handed in two.

1062
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,530
(He handed in 2 coins as promised.)

1063
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,970
(He handed in 2?)

1064
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,130
- He took the safe route.
- Really?

1065
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,340
Really?

1066
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,970
They all handed in two.

1067
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,710
- 10.
- It is 10.

1068
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,440
I'm sure they handed in two each.

1069
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,050
Minimum is 10.

1070
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,740
- We have to go larger than that.
- Okay.

1071
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,510
Let's do 11.

1072
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,960
- Sure.
- How many do you have?

1073
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,860
- How many do you have?
- 12?

1074
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,720
- You have 13.
- Oh, right.

1075
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,820
(Stop lying.)

1076
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
Why would you ask if you know?

1077
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,490
- I know.
- You already know.

1078
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,030
- Why would you lie?
- Why won't you tell us?

1079
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,490
Why did you lie?

1080
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,690
- We know, so why did you lie?
- Don't test me.

1081
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,340
- Why would you ask if you know?
- Why did you lie?

1082
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,530
- You know.
- I got confused. 13.

1083
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,570
What about you, Eun Woo?

1084
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,400
- 14.
- Why are you not saying anything?

1085
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,710
You have more than me.

1086
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,900
Prana has to hand in four.

1087
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,110
Prana should hand in four.

1088
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,150
We'll lose otherwise.

1089
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,440
I don't think he'll hand in any.

1090
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,610
- I will.
- We'll lose then.

1091
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,240
- We'll lose.
- I'll let you hear the sound.

1092
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,610
- Really?
- 3 so 9.

1093
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,360
Just calculate and hand it in.
What's the matter?

1094
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,780
- Wait until you come here.
- We have to win this round?

1095
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,960
Just hand in...

1096
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,800
- as many as you need.
- It's a mess.

1097
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,900
3, 3, 2.

1098
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,030
- 1 and 1.
- 1 and 1.

1099
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,400
- Right.
- You have to hand in a coin.

1100
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,440
- We're a team.
- Of course.

1101
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,800
- If we don't hand in coins,
- We'll lose.

1102
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,710
we'll lose.
If we don't make 11, we lose.

1103
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,130
- We'll lose otherwise.
- I'll let you hear it.

1104
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,800
- You go first.
- You can hear it.

1105
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,400
Please come up.

1106
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,510
(Kwang Soo promised to hand in 3.)

1107
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,510
(Rattling)

1108
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,150
- We'll lose.
- It's in his gene.

1109
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,880
He submitted three. I heard it.

1110
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,050
(He's certain.)

1111
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,690
Did you hear that?

1112
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,760
Hey.

1113
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,860
Why? You heard it.

1114
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,990
- I think that was something else.
- Something else?

1115
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,420
Like what?

1116
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,130
- Stand up.
- What else?

1117
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,820
What are you doing?

1118
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,490
- The caps are gone.
- They're all gone.

1119
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,530
Hey!

1120
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,970
(The caps are all gone.
They're all gone.)

1121
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,010
(Hey!)

1122
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,760
- Kwang Soo.
- Come here.

1123
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,110
That was legendary.

1124
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,510
- Kwang Soo.
- Come here.

1125
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,550
- Hey.
- That was legendary.

1126
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,380
- He can't go back.
- Hey.

1127
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,170
- It's over after one time.
- It's over.

1128
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,440
(How did he do it?)

1129
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,420
(He opened the water bottle
in the middle of a discussion...)

1130
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,610
(and put it in his bag.)

1131
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,860
(He collected 3 bottle caps
in various ways.)

1132
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,030
(He tries to hand in more coins.)

1133
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,900
- It's over.
- It's over.

1134
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,130
- Right.
- He handed in zero.

1135
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,170
(He acts like he's sorry.)

1136
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,590
It's over.

1137
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,440
Rest of you have to hand in more.

1138
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,800
He's unbelievable.

1139
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,840
Rest of you have to make up for it.

1140
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,550
- For real?
- Is he human?

1141
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,340
- For real?
- For real.

1142
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,550
Don't you think
this can be a strategy?

1143
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,720
During the next round...

1144
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,190
You handed in none.

1145
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,610
We'll lose.

1146
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,760
(He gets slapped with water.)

1147
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,460
Strategy... Is this a team?

1148
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,550
Did you just say that to us?

1149
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,650
This is driving me crazy.

1150
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,590
Let's do it among us.
We should give him up.

1151
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,300
- We have to get rid of him.
- Kwang Soo.

1152
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,340
You look like a drunkard
sitting like that.

1153
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,760
(He has a new English name
from today.)

1154
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,170
You look like a drunkard.

1155
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,970
Kwang Soo is cool. He's on our side.

1156
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,010
(Jae Suk promised to hand in 3.)

1157
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,840
I'll hand in four.

1158
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,340
(I'll hand in 4!)

1159
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,840
I'll hand in four.

1160
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,150
Why is he saying that out loud?

1161
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,010
- He said it out loud?
- He did.

1162
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,960
Why is he saying that out loud?

1163
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,720
- He's all talk.
- Who were you talking to?

1164
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,820
I said it out loud. I'm confident.

1165
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,590
That sound is fake.

1166
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,900
(Haha promised to hand in 1.)

1167
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,170
(He does as promised.)

1168
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,610
Where are you going? No!

1169
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,940
What?

1170
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,240
Eun Woo handed in a lot.

1171
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,740
- Did you hand in one?
- Who is it?

1172
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,880
Let me announce the results.

1173
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,050
I did it.

1174
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,940
I'm curious.

1175
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,320
Team Min Gue lost.

1176
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,190
(Team Min Gue lost!)

1177
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,720
- Team Min Gue handed in four.
- What?

1178
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
- What?
- What?

1179
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,960
- You handed in 4.
- 4?

1180
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,150
- What?
- What?

1181
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,130
- 4?
- I handed in 2.

1182
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,420
What? We handed in four?

1183
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,130
I handed in 2, but 4?

1184
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,490
- We handed in 4?
- 4?

1185
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,220
What's wrong with you guys?

1186
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,590
I think they'll check
how many I handed in.

1187
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,440
(0 coin)

1188
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,240
(Jaekyung...)

1189
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,940
(handed in 0.)

1190
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,940
No.

1191
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,050
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook handed in 1
each as promised.)

1192
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,340
Team Eun Woo won.

1193
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,150
- How many did we hand in?
- How many did we hand in?

1194
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,190
(Team Eun Woo won,
and they handed in...)

1195
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,380
Five coins.

1196
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,820
- By one.
- See?

1197
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,150
- You didn't hand in any.
- Who did?

1198
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,190
Jae Suk didn't hand in any.

1199
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,220
- He didn't.
- Four?

1200
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,900
I handed in one. I swear.

1201
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,070
- Did you?
- Only we did.

1202
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,220
I did.

1203
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,420
(Haha handed in 1.)

1204
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,900
(I'll hand in 4!)

1205
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
(He pretended like
he was going to hand in some...)

1206
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,070
(and took them back.)

1207
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,070
He did.

1208
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,530
The sound tells me
that he is faking.

1209
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,380
There is no need to make the sound.

1210
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,880
(Jae Suk and Se Chan
didn't hand in any coins.)

1211
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,240
Eun Woo handed in multiple coins.

1212
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,340
How many coins did she hand in?

1213
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,380
(Eun Woo handed in 4 coins!)

1214
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,090
We won thanks to you
with a difference of one coin.

1215
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,190
We won thanks to you.

1216
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,510
We will hand in the coins
the next time.

1217
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,820
We will do that.
You don't need to hand in anything.

1218
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,990
We won economically.

1219
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,820
- It was a great win.
- We won with one more coin.

1220
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,920
It was a great win.

1221
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,170
- Gosh, this is unbelievable.
- It's time for a fight!

1222
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,990
- Don't live that way.
- Okay!

1223
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,970
- What is this?
- Gosh, this is...

1224
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,440
(The soccer goalposts
and foam-filled field)

1225
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,710
- This is...
- It will be fun.

1226
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,900
My goodness.

1227
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,340
I guess we will play soccer.

1228
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,710
It will be fun.

1229
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,840
We need to win.

1230
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,440
This is the last mission.

1231
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,220
- It will be fun.
- We need to win.

1232
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,490
(Expectant)

1233
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,780
Will we determine the winning team
with this game?

1234
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,820
All right.

1235
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,960
(Enthusiastic)

1236
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,420
Jong Kook, come here.

1237
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,130
- You are right.
- Yes.

1238
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,550
Jong Kook, you shouldn't be here.

1239
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,490
He was standing
next to his close friends.

1240
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,470
He is like that.

1241
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,800
You know that, right?

1242
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,110
- His close friends.
- He was standing next to them.

1243
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,710
<i>His close friends</i>

1244
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,840
- The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd are here.
- The suck-ups.

1245
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,510
- The suck-ups are here.
- The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd suck-ups.

1246
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,880
- All of the suck-ups are there.
- The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd suck-ups.

1247
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,420
This is the last mission.

1248
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,650
The dilemma
will be choosing between...

1249
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,320
being funny and securing screen time
with slapstick comedy...

1250
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,760
and making sure your team wins.

1251
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,720
- I Want to Be the King of Soccer.
- Slapstick comedy.

1252
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,920
2 players and 1 goalie will come up
from each team...

1253
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,170
and play a 3-on-3 match.

1254
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,740
The goalies must stay inside
the wheeled washbowl.

1255
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,630
They can use their hands
only within the penalty line.

1256
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,260
The team that scores more goals
in the 1st and 2nd half wins.

1257
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
- The rules are simple.
- Yes.

1258
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,800
Other rules of soccer apply.
A foul results in a free-kick.

1259
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,210
- That's nice.
- Handling results in a warning.

1260
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,320
- Please come up with the lineup.
- What should we do?

1261
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,780
- Eun Woo, be an offensive player.
- Shall I be a goalie then?

1262
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,260
(The players stretch on the field
before the game starts.)

1263
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,380
The ball...

1264
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,030
- Is the ball hard or soft?
- It's soft.

1265
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,650
- Is the floor slippery?
- It's very slippery.

1266
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,030
- There are foams.
- If I run, I will slip.

1267
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,800
(You won't get hurt
even if you fall down.)

1268
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,530
(Kicking)

1269
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,570
My goodness.

1270
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,840
(Eun Woo warms up
with a fierce shoot.)

1271
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,130
That was great. Good job, Eun Woo.

1272
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,840
- That was great.
- You are intense.

1273
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,340
(Carefree)

1274
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,320
In the first half,
this team will have a kick-off.

1275
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,440
- Get ready.
- Let's go!

1276
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,840
Eun Woo, are you ready?

1277
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,220
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1278
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,320
Set.

1279
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,860
- Let's go.
- Eun Woo.

1280
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,150
- That's good.
- Eun Woo, kick.

1281
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,280
That's good.

1282
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,590
Kick, kick. Eun Woo. Eun Woo.

1283
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,490
(Eun Woo shoots.)

1284
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,970
- Min Gue.
- That was a good pass.

1285
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,030
Eun Woo, that was good.

1286
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,130
I see that Min Gue isn't athletic.

1287
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,840
Min Gue. Min Gue.

1288
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,340
Min Gue!

1289
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,110
- Min Gue!
- Min Gue!

1290
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,570
Min Gue, you hit me here.

1291
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,550
You hit me here.

1292
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,050
That was good, Eun Woo.

1293
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,940
- That was good.
- That was a good pass.

1294
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,460
- That was good.
- That was good, Eun Woo.

1295
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,320
Are you okay?

1296
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,490
- Block them.
- Eun Woo.

1297
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,030
My goodness.

1298
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,190
- Block them.
- Get close to them.

1299
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,960
- Pass the ball behind you.
- Pass the ball behind you.

1300
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,300
- Eun Woo.
- Eun Woo.

1301
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,920
- Eun Woo, kick.
- Eun Woo!

1302
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,630
(Falling down)

1303
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,690
- Eun Woo!
- Get the ball!

1304
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:00,760
You are playing defense.

1305
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,070
- Throw it!
- Give it to Jae Suk.

1306
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,630
(It's your first time
at a foam-filled field, right?)

1307
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,780
I can't believe him.

1308
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,170
I can't believe him.

1309
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,740
- Min Gue, it's your chance!
- Min Gue!

1310
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,880
Eun Woo, go.

1311
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,940
- This is fun.
- Go, go. Here.

1312
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,610
- Jae Suk, block them.
- Hey.

1313
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,690
Tackle her!

1314
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,280
Good job.

1315
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,050
- Tackle her!
- Shoot!

1316
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,460
(Falling down)

1317
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,490
(The slapstick comedy is as fierce
as the soccer match.)

1318
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,690
Hey!

1319
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,400
- Get it.
- Eun Woo, kick it.

1320
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,860
- Kick it.
- Eun Woo.

1321
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,820
(Slipping)

1322
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,670
- Eun Woo, kick it. Kick it.
- Eun Woo.

1323
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,570
My goodness.

1324
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,300
(That's so funny.)

1325
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,400
No!

1326
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,610
What was that?

1327
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,800
Is it that slippery?

1328
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,340
Keep calm.

1329
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,740
Suk Jin is being weird.

1330
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,050
- Don't miss this chance.
- Tackle.

1331
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,690
- Kick it.
- There you go.

1332
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,380
Head the ball!

1333
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:51,820
It's a goal.

1334
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,380
It's a goal.

1335
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,650
Okay.

1336
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,460
(This goal resembled...)

1337
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:04,490
(Park Ji Sung's goal
that brought down Portugal in 2002.)

1338
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,210
(Everyone went crazy.)

1339
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:15,150
(Min Gue recreated the moment
in the foam-filled field.)

1340
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,840
(It's a goal!)

1341
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,240
He is incredible.

1342
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,420
- Yes!
- Nice!

1343
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,490
Okay!

1344
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,010
- That was great.
- Good job.

1345
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,510
- Nice.
- It's okay.

1346
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,610
- It's okay.
- Let's go. You can score a goal.

1347
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:29,130
All right.

1348
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,530
It's okay.

1349
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,900
Eun Woo, watch out
for the open space.

1350
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,990
Score a goal right away.

1351
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,530
- Shoot!
- That's good.

1352
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:37,690
- It's a chance!
- It's your chance.

1353
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,840
- Kick!
- It's open.

1354
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,760
Nice save.

1355
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,470
Okay.

1356
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,240
(Kwang Soo's superb save)

1357
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,380
Throw it right away.

1358
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,070
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1359
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,300
Come on!

1360
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,470
(His pass was too long.)

1361
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,110
(Suk Jin tosses the ball back!)

1362
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,590
- Good job.
- What was that?

1363
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,840
- Hey.
- Jaekyung. Jaekyung.

1364
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,320
(Jaekyung makes a long shot,)

1365
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,460
(but Kwang Soo blocks it easily.)

1366
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,460
(Grunting)

1367
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,760
Eun Woo. There you go.

1368
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,170
- Move it to the front. Jae Suk.
- Pass.

1369
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,590
Keep going.

1370
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,570
Suk Jin is good at saving.

1371
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,840
(What?)

1372
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,110
Kwang Soo, you need to stay
at the goalpost!

1373
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,280
Jae Suk, center the ball!

1374
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,510
- Eun Woo, get in there.
- Jae Suk.

1375
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,780
(He leaves the goalpost
because he wants to score a goal.)

1376
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,550
- Eun Woo, get in there.
- Eun Woo.

1377
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:29,840
(Ouch!)

1378
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,320
Hey!

1379
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,220
This is bad. Tackle!

1380
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,690
The goalpost is empty!

1381
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,190
(The goalpost is empty!)

1382
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,190
- Hurry up.
- The goalpost is empty!

1383
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,650
Tackle.

1384
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,990
- Get it away from the goalpost.
- No!

1385
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,090
Kwang Soo, you need to stay
at the goalpost!

1386
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,800
Hurry up!

1387
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,510
No!

1388
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,530
(Jae Suk kicks the ball away,)

1389
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:54,650
(but Min Gue shoots
and scores a goal.)

1390
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,440
Good job!

1391
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,110
- Kwang Soo.
- My goodness.

1392
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,110
Why did you come on out?

1393
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,740
What are you, Kim Byung Ji?

1394
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,340
Three minutes remain.

1395
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,490
Let's go!

1396
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,920
- Eun Woo!
- Shoo!

1397
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,050
(Kung fu shoot)

1398
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,170
Eun Woo.

1399
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,760
Eun Woo, please.

1400
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,900
- Eun Woo.
- Go.

1401
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,340
- Dribble.
- No!

1402
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,760
- Block the ball.
- You need to score a goal!

1403
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,340
(Jae Suk gets a 1-on-1 chance.)

1404
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,800
(Will Jae Suk score
or will Suk Jin block?)

1405
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,710
Yes!

1406
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,710
(The score goes from 2 to 0...)

1407
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,880
(to 2 to 1.)

1408
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,340
Jae Suk, that was great.

1409
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,880
- You looked cool.
- Good job.

1410
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,920
Eun Woo, good job.

1411
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,320
- Two minutes remain.
- Let's go.

1412
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,690
(Team Eun Woo is on a roll
with 2 minutes remaining.)

1413
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,720
Here is the ball.

1414
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,050
- Suk Jin, please throw the ball.
- What?

1415
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,490
- Just take it.
- Okay.

1416
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,320
(Suk Jin
makes teamwork impossible.)

1417
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:46,030
- What is up with you?
- You are the goalie.

1418
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,530
What is up with you?

1419
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,720
It's hard to stand.

1420
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,090
You could kick right away.

1421
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,570
- Right away?
- Yes.

1422
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:54,940
- That's good.
- Okay.

1423
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,400
- Throw it right away.
- Throw it.

1424
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,630
(What?)

1425
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,380
What are you doing?
You can't do that.

1426
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,610
It's a foul.

1427
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:04,970
You can't do that. It's a foul.

1428
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,110
- Kwang Soo!
- The other team gets a free-kick.

1429
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:09,280
Is there a free-kick?

1430
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,380
- Nice!
- Is there a free-kick in this game?

1431
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,920
- Nice!
- Why did you do that?

1432
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,260
- Let's go.
- Why...

1433
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,760
I will block it.

1434
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,130
Come on.

1435
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,800
- I will block it.
- Stay at the front.

1436
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,920
Only one person can stand
in the wall.

1437
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,670
- Jaekyung.
- Go.

1438
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,530
- You can kick well, right?
- Stay at the front.

1439
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,740
Jae Suk,
why are your hands up there?

1440
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,860
They should be down here, right?

1441
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,130
I am embarrassed.

1442
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,530
Jaekyung...

1443
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,610
Jaekyung is in front of me,
so I am embarrassed.

1444
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,300
I was so surprised for a second.

1445
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,550
(A war of nerves ensues.)

1446
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,840
- There you go.
- That's good.

1447
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,490
That's good, Jaekyung.

1448
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,320
Nice!

1449
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,530
(With the inside of her foot,)

1450
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,700
(Jaekyung kicked the ball
to the open spot.)

1451
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,030
That was incredible.

1452
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,320
You kicked so well.

1453
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,070
(The shy wall was useless
in front of the sharp kick.)

1454
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,140
That was wild. That was amazing.

1455
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,240
(The score is 3 to 1.)

1456
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,070
What was that?

1457
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,840
(Disheartened)

1458
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,110
Why did you move up?

1459
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,570
How can there be a free-kick?

1460
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,370
(He still doesn't understand.)

1461
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,140
He said
the official rules will apply.

1462
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,280
One minute remains.

1463
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,050
- That's good.
- Jae Suk, you need to score.

1464
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,050
(Jae Suk, please.)

1465
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,280
You need to score.

1466
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,910
Good job. Jaekyung, nice tackle.

1467
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,120
- Nice tackle.
- How is she so good at this?

1468
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,160
My knees... Gosh, that startled...

1469
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,550
(Grunting)

1470
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:32,890
(With Suk Jin, the goalie,)

1471
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,800
It's a goal.

1472
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,070
(the ball goes past the goal line.)

1473
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,570
My knees... Gosh, that startled...

1474
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,470
(Suk Jin scores an own goal!)

1475
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,800
- It's a goal.
- What are you doing?

1476
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,370
He scored an own goal!

1477
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:49,470
- How is this a goal?
- The score is 3 to 2.

1478
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,070
Okay. Okay.

1479
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,390
Jaekyung, be the goalie.

1480
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,780
40 seconds before end.

1481
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,890
- Hurry up and go.
- Then you should just play.

1482
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,050
No. Hurry up and go.

1483
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,030
- Come here.
- Play the game.

1484
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,260
- For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

1485
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,200
Sir.

1486
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,890
Sir.

1487
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,300
Why are you putting shampoo
in your hair?

1488
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,490
Why are you washing your hair?

1489
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,570
(Why are you washing your hair?)

1490
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,430
(Suk Jin shampoos his hair
during the soccer match.)

1491
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,200
- What is up with him?
- What are you doing?

1492
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,370
What is he doing?
What is up with him?

1493
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,640
What are you doing?

1494
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,050
- What is wrong with you?
- He is trying to be funny.

1495
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,140
What?

1496
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,280
He keeps ruining the atmosphere.

1497
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,620
Suk Jin.

1498
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,780
- Why is the foam turning dark?
- I don't know.

1499
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,950
It's turning dark.

1500
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,950
- Why is the foam turning dark?
- It's turning dark.

1501
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:32,990
Right now...

1502
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:34,360
Hurry up and play.

1503
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,930
- Why is the foam turning dark?
- Come on.

1504
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:36,950
(Suk Jin distracts people
and passes the ball.)

1505
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,720
- Grab it.
- Throw it.

1506
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:39,990
Grab it. No, no.

1507
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,090
You are too far from the goalpost.

1508
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,840
(Grabbing)

1509
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:46,590
What was that?

1510
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,070
- Hey.
- Handling! It's a foul!

1511
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,680
- Is handling a thing in this game?
- For goodness' sake.

1512
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,180
Kwang Soo, there are lines.

1513
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,280
- Go back.
- Is handling a thing in this game?

1514
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,180
The other team gets a penalty kick.

1515
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,680
- A penalty kick.
- A penalty kick?

1516
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,840
- That's ridiculous.
- Does that exist in this game?

1517
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,620
Don't you know
what a penalty kick is?

1518
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,720
- Suk Jin isn't that good.
- There is no space.

1519
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,930
It will spin
and go past the goal line.

1520
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,320
I will aim for your face.

1521
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:11,490
Okay.

1522
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,530
It was weak. It was nowhere close.

1523
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,260
How could you be worse
than Jaekyung?

1524
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,700
The first half is over.

1525
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,800
(The 1st half ends
with a score of 3 to 2.)

1526
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,530
- I should stay a goalie.
- You did an amazing job.

1527
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,470
- Let's go. Good job.
- We aren't too far behind.

1528
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:24,910
Haha, let's go in.

1529
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,870
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1530
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,870
I know Jong Kook's strategies.
Don't be scared.

1531
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,120
I can read Jong Kook
like an open book.

1532
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,390
I can bet my left hand
that he will use a feint.

1533
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,280
You look the most scared.

1534
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,160
- You shouldn't enter the circle.
- Okay.

1535
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,050
You don't know much
about soccer, do you?

1536
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,390
Whistle.

1537
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,430
Why do you even watch soccer?

1538
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,660
- Get ready. Set.
- It doesn't matter.

1539
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,800
There isn't enough space.

1540
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,300
- Block him.
- Block him.

1541
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,470
- Go, go.
- Come on.

1542
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:54,240
- Come on.
- He is good.

1543
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,760
(Here comes the tyrant
of the foam-filled field.)

1544
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,340
Make it a 1-on-1 match.

1545
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,110
- Block him.
- Go.

1546
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:01,510
(He continues to move the ball
despite the blocking.)

1547
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,240
- It's out of the field.
- Okay.

1548
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,070
- Okay.
- We were close.

1549
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,090
- Tackle Jong Kook.
- Okay, okay.

1550
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,340
A throw-in.

1551
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,860
Hold on. We haven't begun yet.

1552
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,450
- Really?
- Move back 1m.

1553
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,280
- Why are you being so strict?
- Move back 1m.

1554
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,930
- This isn't real soccer.
- Move back 1m.

1555
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,300
- Move back 1m.
- The entire field is 3m long, okay?

1556
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,370
- What?
- This isn't real soccer.

1557
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,090
Okay!

1558
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:28,110
(The magician of the right foot
scores a goal!)

1559
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:30,030
(The score goes from 3 to 2...)

1560
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,870
(to 4 to 2.)

1561
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,910
It's okay.

1562
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,570
- You need to do a better job.
- It's okay.

1563
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:38,910
If you keep being that way,
I will switch you out with Eun Woo.

1564
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,990
Haha, I am close
to switching you out.

1565
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,010
Kick it right away.

1566
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,890
Haha, this spot is empty.

1567
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,010
Here.

1568
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,410
Get it.

1569
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,430
Use the tip of your feet.

1570
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,780
Are you a fool?

1571
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,360
(Give me the ball!)

1572
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,800
That's good.

1573
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,570
Are you a fool?

1574
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,470
Nice!

1575
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,390
(He flies like a butterfly
and heads the ball like a bee!)

1576
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,570
- It's back-header.
- Nice!

1577
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,640
Ahn Jung Hwan moves in...

1578
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,530
and heads the ball.

1579
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,950
- It hit the back of his head.
- Yes.

1580
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:12,410
- Ahn Jung Hwan heads the ball!
- It was like...

1581
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:17,010
(Dreams come true.)

1582
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,160
No way.

1583
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,280
(Team Eun Woo almost caught up
with Team Min Gue.)

1584
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,180
You scored a goal.

1585
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,660
(The score is 4 to 3.)

1586
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,200
You are doing great.

1587
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,930
- We need to score a goal.
- Let's go.

1588
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:29,120
Let's go.

1589
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,760
This team has two men playing.

1590
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,390
- That's right.
- What about it?

1591
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:35,640
- Two men...
- Then have Suk Jin come in.

1592
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,240
I am not a man.

1593
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,870
- You aren't a woman.
- Okay. Ji Hyo, step out.

1594
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:45,280
(Like a man, he slips!)

1595
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,510
- What are you doing?
- You need to rest.

1596
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:49,450
Go to the bench.
Come on out when I call you.

1597
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,910
Go to the bench.

1598
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,550
Why did you enter the field
as you wanted?

1599
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,160
- You need to score a goal!
- Let's go!

1600
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,360
Watch the wall.

1601
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,390
Haha. That's good.

1602
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,550
Kick.

1603
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,620
That's good.

1604
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,800
(He kicks powerfully
twice in a row.)

1605
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:07,200
Good job.

1606
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,840
(That was close.)

1607
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:12,780
- It was like a real sport.
- It was cool.

1608
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,870
Score a goal!

1609
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,280
- That's good.
- There you go.

1610
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:17,620
They are good.

1611
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,950
- It's 2 against 1.
- Run, run!

1612
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,840
- It's 2 against 1.
- Come on.

1613
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,280
- Tackle.
- It's 2 against 1.

1614
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,950
- Come on.
- Go, go.

1615
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,490
Nice.

1616
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,220
- Nice tackling.
- Nice defense.

1617
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,890
- That was good.
- Nice defense.

1618
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,200
That was good.

1619
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,490
I see that Jong Kook just likes
soccer.

1620
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,200
Jong Kook isn't that great.

1621
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,760
The foams make him weak.

1622
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:46,200
- Eun Woo, go. Do you want to play?
- Okay. Go.

1623
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,640
- Go ahead.
- Eun Woo, go.

1624
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,700
- You can switch out the players.
- Let's switch out the players.

1625
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:52,220
I entered the field
when Jong Kook is angry.

1626
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,490
(He laughs loudly
to hide his anger.)

1627
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:55,510
- Jong Kook isn't that great.
- Hey.

1628
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,890
- Jong Kook is angry.
- His body is heavy.

1629
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:59,590
Eun Woo and I entered...

1630
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,320
- The foams made his body heavy.
- Really?

1631
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,530
Stand at the front. It's okay.

1632
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,890
I am scared.

1633
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,300
Stand at the front, Eun Woo.

1634
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,490
(Play ball!)

1635
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:07,720
Let's score another goal.

1636
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,590
Eun Woo, it would be cool
if you score a goal.

1637
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,240
Move. You need to move.

1638
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,340
- That was good.
- How did he dribble the ball?

1639
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,370
(Jong Kook uses a feint.)

1640
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,800
- That was good.
- How did he dribble the ball?

1641
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,780
Defense. Defense.

1642
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,910
Eun Woo, get close to Jong Kook.

1643
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:24,620
Kwang Soo!

1644
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,720
(This is the beginning!)

1645
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,820
Pass the ball this way.

1646
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,910
(When the ball comes to him,)

1647
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,220
(he kicks.)

1648
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,680
Jong Kook isn't that great.

1649
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,490
The foams make him weak.

1650
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,530
(He will put an end to that rumor.)

1651
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,990
Pass the ball this way.

1652
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,820
(The ball goes over the goalpost.)

1653
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,050
- That was close.
- That was close.

1654
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,260
While you have the power,
the shoot...

1655
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,370
(The foams make you weak.)

1656
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:44,700
The shoot was unsuccessful.

1657
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,590
I know Jong Kook's strategies.
You don't need to be scared.

1658
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:47,700
One minute remains.

1659
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,410
- Eun Woo.
- We need to score one more goal.

1660
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,530
Eun Woo, that's good.

1661
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,010
- Eun Woo, that's good.
- I heard something.

1662
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:53,070
Don't touch it.

1663
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,910
Don't touch it, Kwang Soo.
Keep going, Eun Woo.

1664
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:57,840
How is Eun Woo blocking Jong Kook?

1665
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,950
Don't touch it, Kwang Soo.

1666
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,280
Keep going, Eun Woo.

1667
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,090
- Jae Suk, run forward.
- You are doing great.

1668
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,640
- I am exhausted.
- Don't make it go out.

1669
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,410
- Jae Suk is fast.
- Kick.

1670
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:06,550
(Determined to win,)

1671
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:08,160
(he makes a foul!)

1672
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,950
- This way.
- Kick it!

1673
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,220
That's great!

1674
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,030
(It was a goal like a lightning!)

1675
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:15,370
Eun Woo!

1676
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:16,430
What was that?

1677
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:21,200
(She aimed for the open spot...)

1678
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,970
(and made the net shake.)

1679
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:27,410
(Eun Woo's perfect goal
shakes up Running Man!)

1680
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,570
(Eun Woo created a drama
without a script!)

1681
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,820
What was that?

1682
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,070
She is good.

1683
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,320
What was that?

1684
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,550
Eun Woo was like Messi.

1685
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,590
- Eun Woo is really good at soccer.
- We won!

1686
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,860
- We did a good job.
- We won.

1687
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,260
- Good job.
- One goal made a difference.

1688
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,550
Eun Woo, good job.

1689
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,930
- Eun Woo did well.
- You are really good at soccer.

1690
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,370
After a great match,

1691
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:48,820
Team Eun Woo won.

1692
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,160
The last goal was really regretful.

1693
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,740
- The other team did well too.
- I agree.

1694
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,910
They didn't do badly.

1695
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,640
Instead of drawing cards,

1696
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,910
- we will play Name Tag Elimination.
- Okay.

1697
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,840
The winning team will choose
a member of the same sex...

1698
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,410
from the losing team.
The winner receives two coins...

1699
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,640
and the loser
gets two coins taken away.

1700
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:08,950
Do you understand?

1701
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,590
You can choose your partner.

1702
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,820
You can pick someone
who was picked before.

1703
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:17,360
Why don't you go against Ji Hyo?
You said you wanted to meet her.

1704
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,320
I pick Ji Hyo.

1705
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:22,200
- Yes.
- Rip off Ji Hyo's name tag.

1706
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,070
We pick Suk Jin.

1707
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,160
Not all of you picked me, right?

1708
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,430
- All of us picked you.
- All of us did.

1709
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,640
(Not all of you picked me, right?)

1710
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,070
(All men picked Suk Jin.)

1711
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,930
- Really? Why? What's the reason?
- All of us picked you.

1712
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,280
- There is no reason...
- I don't understand.

1713
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,800
There is no reason
to pick someone else.

1714
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,280
The first match will be
between Jae Suk and Suk Jin.

1715
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:39,910
- Let's go.
- I will be exhausted.

1716
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,990
It will be over if you fall down.

1717
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:44,390
- I might win if that happens.
- That's right.

1718
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:45,410
Get ready.

1719
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,410
(Suk Jin and Jae Suk)

1720
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:48,280
(Catch the Tail starts.)

1721
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,160
You are too far from the wall.

1722
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,820
- What?
- Stay close to the wall.

1723
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,120
Suk Jin, if you run fast,
you will rip off his name tag.

1724
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,660
I know. I am running fast.

1725
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,590
- Really?
- Yes.

1726
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,930
- Their speed is about the same.
- It's...

1727
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,570
It's so slippery.
Suk Jin keeps getting off track.

1728
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:04,680
(His breath quickens
after two laps.)

1729
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,300
Suk Jin, you need to go against
three more people after this.

1730
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,450
Until when will we run?

1731
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:10,820
Suk Jin's speed fell drastically.

1732
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,220
Suk Jin, you need to do this
three more times.

1733
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,840
I can't close the distance.

1734
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,090
My goodness.

1735
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:19,260
- It's so slippery.
- Let's finish it this way.

1736
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,360
- We should use the centerline.
- Shall we do that?

1737
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,660
The match will end faster that way.

1738
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:26,300
Let's start over.

1739
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,070
"Let's start over."

1740
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,760
- Suk Jin, let's start over.
- Let's start over.

1741
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,300
- Three more times.
- This is the real match.

1742
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,300
The real match.

1743
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:35,070
Three more times.

1744
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:36,740
You can't enter the circle.

1745
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,800
- Okay.
- Get ready.

1746
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,970
Take small steps. That's right.

1747
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:44,570
- Take small steps.
- What...

1748
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,840
What is this?

1749
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:49,180
Are you doing your best?

1750
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,260
Suk Jin, don't force yourself.

1751
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,990
I am doing my best!

1752
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:54,780
- Run! Run!
- What is this?

1753
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,430
I am doing this with gritted teeth.

1754
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,620
(The match between
the two proud geniuses)

1755
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,030
My back hurts.

1756
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:02,200
- Jae Suk is losing.
- Seriously.

1757
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,890
I feel like I am going to puke.

1758
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:05,070
Let's change directions.

1759
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:06,570
- Let's change directions.
- Okay.

1760
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,610
Okay.

1761
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,760
Jae Suk, you were so close
to catching him.

1762
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,910
- Jae Suk.
- He was right in front of you!

1763
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:12,970
(Why did you change direction?)

1764
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,470
- This is hilarious.
- Is this a show for the elders?

1765
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,510
He is nearly there.

1766
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,470
Suk Jin is playing it
in a strange way.

1767
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,890
You're almost there.

1768
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:22,620
(Suk Jin suddenly falls down.)

1769
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,740
We don't know it yet, Suk Jin.

1770
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:26,090
No, we don't know it yet.
Keep running.

1771
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,220
(Struggling)

1772
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,220
They are cute. They are so lovely.

1773
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,590
Keep running.

1774
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,320
Go.

1775
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,160
He's right here.
He's right in front of me.

1776
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,700
This is working.

1777
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,740
(It's a close match.)

1778
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,110
- Okay.
- All right.

1779
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,760
Okay.

1780
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,300
All right. One more time.

1781
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,010
I want to go next.

1782
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,410
You guys do it.

1783
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,800
- Let's move on.
- So Min should go next.

1784
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,240
Where's So Min?

1785
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,640
What? Is he seeing things?

1786
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,620
- Suk Jin.
- So Min is not here.

1787
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,050
No, Suk Jin.

1788
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:58,720
- It's not So Min.
- Suk Jin

1789
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,160
What's wrong with you?

1790
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,320
- I'll do it with Suk Jin.
- Okay. Se Chan goes first.

1791
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,050
- What?
- I'm doing this with you.

1792
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,820
(Laughing)

1793
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,570
You jerk.

1794
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,030
- Why...
- Okay.

1795
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,200
Start.

1796
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,240
You should walk in big steps.

1797
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,300
Good. That's great.

1798
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,800
You're doing a good job.

1799
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,200
Good.

1800
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,780
(Slipping)

1801
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,180
Just take it off.

1802
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,840
Don't go easy on him.
Why would you do that?

1803
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,140
(He's getting exhausted.)

1804
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,450
Are you all right, Grandpa?

1805
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,720
(He struggles to hold out
with shampoo.)

1806
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:33,160
Look at him.

1807
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,360
Suk Jin is fast.

1808
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,530
(Se Chan keeps walking
right behind him.)

1809
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,700
Suk Jin, just make sure
you're one step ahead of him.

1810
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,120
Just rip it off.

1811
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,820
(Go ahead and
rip it off, you punk.)

1812
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,760
Here. Just rip it off.

1813
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,160
(Despite his struggle,
he's losing 2 times in a row.)

1814
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,910
Suk Jin, this is fun.
You should try it.

1815
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,510
- You can't go back.
- Wait in line.

1816
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:53,510
This game is really fun.

1817
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,610
What is it like?
I can't wait to try it.

1818
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:58,220
You should wait in line.

1819
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,340
Ready.

1820
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,510
(The 3rd match starts.)

1821
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:03,740
Wait. Haha has big feet.

1822
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,510
I can't do this.

1823
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,220
- My gosh.
- Good.

1824
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,450
That's nice.

1825
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,390
Good one.

1826
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,160
(But...)

1827
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,470
He's slow though.

1828
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,200
Why is it hard? Why am I slow?

1829
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,240
Haha is losing.

1830
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,200
He's right in front of you.

1831
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,410
- Gosh, this is hard.
- He's right in front of you.

1832
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:25,970
- Hang on.
- Something's not right.

1833
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,140
This is too hard.

1834
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,700
Hang on. What's going on?

1835
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,410
Gosh. What is he doing?

1836
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:31,870
- What's going on?
- Hey.

1837
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,590
- I can't believe this.
- This is called know-how.

1838
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,680
(This is called know-how.)

1839
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:37,950
(This is called know-how.)

1840
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:38,950
(Throwing it away)

1841
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,010
How did you do it?

1842
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,090
This is my know-how.

1843
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,680
This is so funny.

1844
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,050
- What happened?
- Show me.

1845
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,430
You looked so cool
when you threw it away.

1846
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:47,820
- Was it cool?
- Yes.

1847
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,530
Eun Woo and Jaekyung.
No, is it Ji Hyo?

1848
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,800
- Ready.
- Be careful.

1849
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:55,070
(The last match between Eun Woo
and Ji Hyo starts.)

1850
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,010
Ji Hyo is fast.

1851
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,030
You should hurry.

1852
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,570
Eun Woo, walk faster.

1853
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:01,840
Good.

1854
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,200
- Walk with big strides.
- Ji Hyo is really fast.

1855
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,640
- Eun Woo.
- Ji Hyo looks like a giant.

1856
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,990
I know. Why is she so tall?

1857
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,220
Is she a giant or what?

1858
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,820
How can you walk
with such big strides?

1859
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:12,720
(Eun Woo is in a rush,
but Ji Hyo seems relaxed.)

1860
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,720
Eun Woo...

1861
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,590
She's right in front of you,
but it's not easy to catch her.

1862
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:17,360
- I know. It's not easy.
- Keep trying.

1863
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,360
(Slipping)

1864
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,930
- I know. It's not easy.
- Keep trying.

1865
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,220
She's letting it go.

1866
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,930
- Eun Woo, go.
- Hurry.

1867
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,340
(She just looks at Eun Woo
with a smile.)

1868
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,070
- Eun Woo, go.
- Hurry.

1869
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,530
Run away from the giant.

1870
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,110
Ji Hyo is just walking nonchalantly.

1871
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,240
- That's even scarier.
- She's brutal.

1872
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,410
She's so cruel.

1873
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:34,700
She's almost there.

1874
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,780
Go ahead and do it.

1875
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,050
Hurry.

1876
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,220
(What?)

1877
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,510
(Is she letting it go again?)

1878
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:42,820
She will rip it off
once you start to move.

1879
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:43,950
Hurry and go.

1880
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,720
What was that?

1881
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,090
Just kill her.

1882
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,720
- Ji Hyo is so...
- Ji Hyo, you...

1883
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,890
- She's unbelievable.
- This is like "I Saw the Devil".

1884
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,200
She's scary.

1885
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,870
She's playing with Eun Woo.
She's having so much fun.

1886
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:56,320
This is really fun.

1887
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,340
Ji Hyo, gosh.

1888
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,700
Go closer to the circle.

1889
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,240
Where are you going?

1890
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,260
What is going on?

1891
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,280
(Eun Woo is exhausted.)

1892
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,870
(She's out.)

1893
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,280
- She's really good.
- I know.

1894
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,950
How can you be so good, Ji Hyo?

1895
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,570
This isn't easy.

1896
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,450
(Current Number of Coins)

1897
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,320
(Jae Suk 17, Kwang Soo 10,
Suk Jin 14, Jae Hyung 14)

1898
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:18,090
We will have the last Coin Dilemma.

1899
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:21,490
Since Team Min Gue lost,
they will turn in their coins first.

1900
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,680
If we go all in,
we are going to win.

1901
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,800
- We can win, right?
- Sure.

1902
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,930
Let's do this.

1903
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:27,260
- All right.
- Let's do it.

1904
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:29,620
Please turn in your coins
one by one.

1905
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,620
I'll go first.

1906
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,340
I'll do it first.

1907
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,160
For your information,
the winner will...

1908
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,930
get the Bluetooth earphones
of A company.

1909
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,340
- Really?
- Yes. The new model.

1910
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,610
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1911
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:40,800
(They should have their team win and
make the top 2 to win the prize.)

1912
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,140
I'm going all in.

1913
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,410
(Jong Kook hands in all his coins.)

1914
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,720
(The rest of his team members
are done handing in their coins.)

1915
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:51,320
Now the winning team can
choose one member.

1916
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,390
Who should we pick?

1917
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:53,720
What about Suk Jin?

1918
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,950
- Let's pick Ji Hyo.
- What about Ji Hyo.

1919
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:56,050
Let's go with Ji Hyo.

1920
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:57,760
- Ji Hyo?
- Yes.

1921
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,360
She has a subtle smile.

1922
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,530
Hey, you...

1923
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:01,930
You'll be in serious trouble.

1924
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,030
Ji Hyo.

1925
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,530
Ji Hyo has changed.

1926
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,800
Ji Hyo handed in...

1927
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,140
(How many coins did Ji Hyo hand in?)

1928
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,300
- 10 coins.
- What?

1929
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,030
Seriously?

1930
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:13,180
(Did she hand in 10 coins?)

1931
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,700
It's done, Ji Hyo.
That's good enough.

1932
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:17,720
See? We should hand in
all coins we have.

1933
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,840
Hand in all the coins you have.

1934
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:20,780
We picked the right person.

1935
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,590
- It's 10 coins.
- We should hand in all of them.

1936
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,260
You should remember this.

1937
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,260
If we lose, you won't
get the prize anyway.

1938
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,680
- He's right.
- Seriously,

1939
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,820
we will lose if you don't do this.

1940
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,950
If you keep the coins,

1941
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:32,160
- they will be useless.
- I know.

1942
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,590
- But...
- Make sure to hand them in.

1943
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,320
I will. Why would I keep them?

1944
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,840
Kwang Soo, if your team loses,
you'll get a penalty.

1945
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,970
Even if your team win,
you're not going to get the prize.

1946
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:43,740
Kwang Soo, I would say differently
if there was a chance to win.

1947
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,070
But to be honest, I don't know.

1948
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,280
We can still win.

1949
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:48,200
- We can win.
- We all have to do this.

1950
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,950
We have to hand in the coins
and win the game.

1951
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:52,180
You can just keep one coin.

1952
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,970
- If you win, give him the prize.
- I will.

1953
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,990
Is this good enough for you?

1954
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,450
Why do we have to do this though?

1955
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,260
Calm down.

1956
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,260
This is really upsetting.
Why do we have to do this?

1957
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:04,160
- Why are you being like this?
- I didn't ask for it.

1958
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,430
I have 14 coins, and I'll
hand in all my coins.

1959
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:07,820
- Just do it.
- I will.

1960
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,430
You can't watch it.

1961
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:11,530
- Don't look.
- Kwang Soo, you...

1962
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:13,760
- Hey, don't drop them.
- You dropped the coins.

1963
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,970
(Dropping coins)

1964
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:18,070
- Hey, don't drop them.
- You dropped the coins.

1965
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,280
You dropped the coins.

1966
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,200
You're not supposed to look.

1967
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,970
I'm just sick of this.

1968
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,180
- What's wrong with him?
- We should win.

1969
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,450
It's a disease.

1970
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:28,510
I'm having a hard time today...

1971
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:29,890
because of you, not this show.

1972
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,360
- Just do it.
- What's the problem?

1973
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,590
What is it you want?

1974
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,620
Just keep one coin
and hand in the rest.

1975
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,090
Okay. We will hand it
all our coins. We will lose.

1976
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,260
Just keep one coin with you.

1977
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:40,030
- Can I keep one coin?
- Yes.

1978
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,890
- Happy now?
- Do you believe them?

1979
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:44,220
I'm sure someone keeps two coins.

1980
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,090
I'm pretty sure. Some of them...

1981
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,740
- will keep two coins.
- Let's do this, Kwang Soo.

1982
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,430
I'm doing it. I will keep one coin.

1983
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:50,570
Okay.

1984
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,800
Kwang Soo, think carefully about it.

1985
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:54,840
My gosh.

1986
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:57,450
(However...)

1987
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,410
Kwang Soo, can I ask
what's taking you so long?

1988
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:04,990
(Kwang Soo, can I ask
what's taking you so long?)

1989
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:06,720
What's taking so long?

1990
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,220
Just put the coins down. Hey.

1991
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,160
- Darn it.
- Just do it.

1992
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,320
Gosh, I'm so tired.

1993
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,320
So Min is coming tomorrow.

1994
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,740
(The female Lee Kwang Soo
is coming next week.)

1995
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,340
I'll be more tired from tomorrow.

1996
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,740
(Kwang Soo has been fighting
against himself for quite long.)

1997
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,070
Okay. Just one coin.

1998
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,430
- Did you do it?
- Kwang Soo is done.

1999
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:29,180
- I did it.
- Who's next?

2000
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:32,140
(Jae Suk currently has 17 coins.)

2001
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,470
- 17 coins?
- Yes.

2002
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,120
Were you talking to me?

2003
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:42,120
Hang on. What's taking him so long?

2004
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,450
(Hang on.
What's taking him so long?)

2005
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,450
Wait.

2006
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:45,620
What are you doing there?

2007
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,430
- He says...
- What are you talking about?

2008
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:49,260
He asked me something.

2009
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,470
- About life?
- Yes.

2010
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,990
He asked me something.

2011
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,470
(Is he getting counsel
in the middle of the shoot?)

2012
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:55,470
- All of a sudden?
- About that,

2013
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:57,530
I'll tell you after the shoot.

2014
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:59,740
He needs some life advice.

2015
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:01,450
This is crazy.

2016
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:05,340
I'll hand in all my coins.
It's simple.

2017
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:07,570
Let me announce the results.

2018
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,180
- I don't expect anything.
- No.

2019
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:10,910
- I handed in all my coins.
- I think we will win.

2020
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:12,390
We don't know it yet.

2021
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,390
The winner of the final round is...

2022
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:16,550
We should win.

2023
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:18,530
Hang on. Why do you
even expect to win?

2024
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,050
Seriously, I handed in all my coins.

2025
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,160
(The top two members
will win a prize.)

2026
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,370
The winner of the final round is...

2027
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:27,200
(And the last two members
will get a penalty.)

2028
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:30,610
Team Min Gue won
with the score of 14 to 47.

2029
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,340
- What?
- 14?

2030
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:34,800
Team Min Gue won
with the score of 14 to 47.

2031
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,340
(They turned in only 14 coins?)

2032
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,870
What did they do?

2033
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,220
- Only 14 coins?
- 14?

2034
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:43,010
14? Do you mean 14 coins?

2035
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:44,760
- Seriously?
- 14?

2036
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:45,910
Is it 14?

2037
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,320
Do you call yourselves
a human being?

2038
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,990
This is just unbelievable.

2039
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:51,360
- Only 14 coins.
- Guys.

2040
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,430
We will give the penalty first.
Please bring it in.

2041
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:56,070
Is it 47 to 14?

2042
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:57,430
What's the penalty?

2043
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,240
- It's cold water.
- The penalty is...

2044
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,530
lower-body bathing in iced water...

2045
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,760
- It has ice in it.
- for you to have cool summer.

2046
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:05,700
(They feel cold already.)

2047
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,780
During the closing,

2048
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,050
you will soak in the tub.

2049
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,910
- My gosh.
- Does that mean...

2050
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,620
two of us will get the penalty?

2051
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,240
Yes, there will be two people.

2052
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:17,220
- 14 coins?
- Darn it.

2053
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,680
Let's see. We don't know it yet.

2054
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,820
I could've been in big trouble.

2055
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,280
I saw this coming.

2056
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:24,720
- I knew it.
- 14 coins.

2057
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,050
The two players...

2058
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:29,260
with the least coins
in Team Eun Woo is...

2059
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:30,430
Who is it?

2060
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:31,740
- Let me announce the bottom first.
- Okay.

2061
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,740
Eun Woo?

2062
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:35,740
It's Kwang Soo
who turned in nine coins.

2063
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,930
My gosh.

2064
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,030
(It's Kwang Soo
who turned in nine coins.)

2065
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,410
(Kwang Soo explodes with anger.)

2066
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:42,410
(Startled)

2067
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,620
Seriously? Is it true?

2068
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,120
(She struggles to survive.)

2069
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,120
Is it true?

2070
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,720
Why did you hit her?

2071
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,180
What are you doing?

2072
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,590
Don't hit her.

2073
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,320
(Eun Woo is surprised.)

2074
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,530
Hey.

2075
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,930
He's mad at her.

2076
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:57,930
(They all feel bad for Kwang Soo
who turned in 9 coins.)

2077
01:07:57,930 --> 01:07:59,450
Hey.

2078
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:01,120
- Hey.
- Did you turn in your coins?

2079
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,530
(I'll keep one coin as I promised.)

2080
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,240
(It was his first time to keep
his promise for the past 10 years.)

2081
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,200
Did you do it? Did you turn in
your coins, Kwang Soo?

2082
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,260
Kwang Soo did it.

2083
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,280
- Did Kwang Soo hand in nine coins?
- Did he?

2084
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,300
- Then...
- Why did you do that?

2085
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,910
Kwang Soo handed in 9 coins,
and now he has only 1 coin.

2086
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:18,950
- Please get into the tub.
- You have only one left?

2087
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,680
- Hey, you were too naive.
- That's so nice of you.

2088
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,990
I'm touched.

2089
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:23,410
- You were too naive.
- Kwang Soo.

2090
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:24,720
- You were naive.
- Kwang Soo.

2091
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,820
- He kept his promise.
- That's amazing.

2092
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:29,050
- He kept his words.
- I'm going to cry.

2093
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:31,080
If we had handed in 10,
we would have won.

2094
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,550
Kwang Soo, please go into the water.

2095
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,960
The other person
who will be penalized is...

2096
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,030
(It's the person
in second-to-last place.)

2097
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,960
Haha, who has 4 left
after handing in 0.

2098
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,000
- Gosh.
- I'm sorry.

2099
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,040
You handed in nothing?

2100
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,370
(Haha goes into the water
right away.)

2101
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:44,830
(I'm going into the water.)

2102
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,000
Gosh. I'm sorry.

2103
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,110
He handed in nothing?

2104
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:51,140
He handed in nothing at the end?

2105
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,450
(He didn't have many coins
in the first place.)

2106
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,120
- Gosh.
- Unbelievable.

2107
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:55,920
That will teach you a lesson.

2108
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,990
- Jae Suk handed in five.
- He did?

2109
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,250
Se Chan and Eun Woo
handed in nothing.

2110
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:00,860
You didn't hand in anything?

2111
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,130
You didn't hand in anything?
Good job.

2112
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,490
Hurry up!

2113
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:06,530
(The cold bath makes you scream.)

2114
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:08,220
Please bring in the prizes.

2115
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:09,590
(Screaming)

2116
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,000
Okay.

2117
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,460
Kwang Soo.

2118
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,540
You were amazing.

2119
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,540
Let me announce
the two prize winners.

2120
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:20,040
Jaekyung, who has 3 left after
handing in 11, is in 1st place.

2121
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,610
(Jaekyung, who has 3 left after
handing in 11, is in 1st place.)

2122
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:23,140
Min Gue, who handed in eight,

2123
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,280
and Suk Jin, who handed in 12, are
in 2nd place.

2124
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,420
Play rock-paper-scissors.

2125
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,780
Hurry up!

2126
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:29,640
All right.

2127
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,490
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Just a second.

2128
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:34,320
If you don't play, you lose.
Rock-paper-scissors.

2129
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,460
Calm down.

2130
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,550
If you don't play, you lose.

2131
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,660
I mean it.
Rock-paper-scissors.

2132
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:41,000
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

2133
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,330
Rock-paper-scissors.

2134
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,830
(Suk Jin wins 2nd place.)

2135
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:46,290
- I win.
- The second prize is...

2136
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,740
a car fridge.

2137
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:50,000
(1st prize: Bluetooth earphones
2nd prize: a car fridge)

2138
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,470
- Let's...
- Thank you.

2139
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,470
Let's ask our guests how they feel.

2140
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:55,380
I bet they're happy!

2141
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,250
Of course, they're happy.

2142
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,920
Come on the show again!

2143
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:01,580
Jaekyung, it was nice seeing you.

2144
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:02,710
(Haha wants the shooting to end.)

2145
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:04,990
I had so much fun.

2146
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:08,490
Thank you for the prize.
Please invite me again!

2147
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:09,630
Thank you.

2148
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:10,860
- Yes!
- Thank you!

2149
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,920
(The shooting is finally over.
There's someone we should meet.)

2150
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,260
(One sunny day)

2151
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:20,590
(The man with flowers is Se Chan.)

2152
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:21,800
Kwang Soo.

2153
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,300
I mean...

2154
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:26,240
- You won the game...
- This is not a penalty.

2155
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,610
You won a prize, right?

2156
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:32,170
(Se Chan won the race
in the 500th episode.)

2157
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:35,880
(As a prize, he gets to do
house chores at So Min's place.)

2158
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,790
(Se Chan has to go then.)

2159
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:41,960
(Se Chan was forced to visit
So Min's place.)

2160
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,160
So what am I doing here?

2161
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,750
- This is our chance...
- Why am I wearing a microphone?

2162
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,290
This is our chance to get together
as the younger members.

2163
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:49,500
If I had to come here alone,

2164
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,090
it would have been embarrassing.

2165
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,870
Why are you using me like this?

2166
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,460
I feel like I'm being used.

2167
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,970
Who's the leader of
the younger members? It's you.

2168
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,240
Let's go.

2169
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,110
Hurry up.

2170
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,880
This way.

2171
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,880
(Kwang Soo is forced
to follow Se Chan.)

2172
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,880
(Sighing)

2173
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,040
But you'll do the house chores,
right?

2174
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:11,960
- Yes, we'll do them together.
- Right.

2175
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,720
(They arrive at her place
with heavy steps.)

2176
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,920
Gosh.

2177
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,460
This is apparently a big project.

2178
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,550
How many cameras are there?

2179
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:24,330
I feel burdened.
Are there cameras inside too?

2180
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:26,090
(They feel
both burdened and excited.)

2181
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:29,500
(It's finally time to meet her.)

2182
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,240
Hey.

2183
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:34,280
- I'm already tired.
- Why am I here?

2184
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:36,080
- Already...
- I feel uncomfortable.

2185
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,500
She sounds too excited.

2186
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,510
She sounds too excited.

2187
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,080
So Min.

2188
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,490
Hi, So Min.

2189
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:44,640
Hi. What's that?

2190
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,080
So Min.

2191
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,320
Hi, So Min.

2192
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,490
Hi. What's that?

2193
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:49,580
Are you wearing makeup?

2194
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,920
I just put on some lipstick.

2195
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,160
Why did you bring flowers?

2196
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,420
It's for you.

2197
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:54,790
She's not even looking at me.

2198
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,700
Come here.

2199
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,740
- It's not like that.
- What is this?

2200
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,500
Why did you bring flowers?

2201
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:03,330
The note said
I should bring flowers.

2202
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,240
(I miss Mom.)

2203
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,830
Come here.

2204
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,840
- Forget it. Go inside.
- Come here.

2205
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,750
Why didn't you just bring
a cardboard cutout of me?

2206
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,080
- Why is he here?
- Who?

2207
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,250
That guy.

2208
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,420
(I mean you.)

2209
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,620
He's the leader
of the younger members.

2210
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:19,580
I thought you were coming alone.

2211
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:21,830
- He dragged me here.
- Let's go in.

2212
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:24,290
Don't make it look like
I'm forcing you.

2213
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,890
Just go inside.

2214
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,670
(They finally enter So Min's place.)

2215
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,460
Don't you think this is too much?

2216
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,700
They've always been there.

2217
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,960
You want your apartment
to look pretty?

2218
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:36,610
Have a seat.

2219
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:38,630
- Have a seat.
- Okay. Let's sit down.

2220
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:40,300
(Awkward)

2221
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:43,610
(He sits on the floor
instead of the sofa.)

2222
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:44,880
Why are you sitting on the floor?

2223
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,880
This is more comfortable.

2224
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,250
It would look weird
if we all sit next to each other.

2225
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,820
You look super awkward right now.

2226
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,490
When there's so much space here,

2227
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,680
you sat on the floor.

2228
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:57,030
I think I'd feel more uncomfortable
if I sit on the sofa.

2229
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,390
He hesitated at the door too.

2230
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:01,390
- "Should I go in or not?"
- You should relax.

2231
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:03,590
- It's not like that.
- Also, when So Min came out,

2232
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:04,830
Se Chan stayed so close to the wall.

2233
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:05,930
(Close to the wall)

2234
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:08,430
As if to show us
that he's never been here before.

2235
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,710
Why are you doing this?
You lie on this sofa all the time.

2236
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,210
Cut it out. Stop lying.

2237
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,500
- I'm leaving. I've had enough.
- No!

2238
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,670
- No.
- I'm leaving.

2239
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:19,670
You're our leader. Stay here.

2240
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:20,670
- I mean...
- Sit back down.

2241
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:21,990
What do you mean,
I lie here all the time?

2242
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:24,680
Give me a camera or something.
I need something to do.

2243
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,360
Give us some work.

2244
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,750
I have some towels to fold.

2245
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,580
They're in the dryer right now.

2246
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:31,790
You can do the dishes too.

2247
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,530
I'm sorry,

2248
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:36,030
but can you look at Kwang Soo
just once?

2249
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:37,890
I gave up at some point.

2250
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,830
- Why do you only look at me?
- At some point...

2251
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:41,260
Look at Kwang Soo too.

2252
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,540
To be honest,

2253
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,130
I don't care if they decide to
completely edit me out.

2254
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:46,780
Look at Kwang Soo too.

2255
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,380
Why do you only look at me?

2256
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:49,970
Look at Kwang Soo too.

2257
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,840
So Min, you haven't put on
a microphone in a while.

2258
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:56,140
Put on your microphone.
It's been so long.

2259
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,880
- This is such an honor.
- Exactly.

2260
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,290
Kwang Soo and I get to watch this.

2261
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,630
Should I help you?

2262
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:02,720
I can do it myself.

2263
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,290
I haven't worn two microphones
in a while.

2264
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,720
So Min is putting on microphones.

2265
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:10,220
(Congratulations
on putting on microphones.)

2266
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,390
I'm happy to be here.

2267
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:12,430
- Running Man...
- You wear...

2268
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,330
You wear jeans at home?
That's too much.

2269
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,240
- Stop it. Just think to yourself.
- You...

2270
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,500
I just thought it was strange.
"She wears jeans at home?"

2271
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:20,430
She probably got a pedicure too.

2272
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,780
(She painted her toenails
to be on the show.)

2273
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,820
Good job, So Min.

2274
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:30,040
Order some food. It'd take too long
to make something.

2275
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:31,990
- Order something.
- You don't have any food at home?

2276
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:33,210
I thought you'd bring something.

2277
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:34,380
You don't even have any ramyeon?

2278
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:37,580
I do have some different ramyeons,

2279
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,500
but you can't mix them.

2280
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:41,460
- These are all I have.
- These three?

2281
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,070
- We could mix them.
- Then it'd taste weird.

2282
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:44,220
It'll be fine.

2283
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,130
(An invisible wall)

2284
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:52,300
Is it expired?

2285
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,210
(Kwang Soo leaves the kitchen.)

2286
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:57,210
(Kwang Soo becomes invisible again.)

2287
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,620
- Come back here.
- What?

2288
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,040
- Where are you going?
- What?

2289
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,340
It expired on May 4?

2290
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,180
(They leave Kwang Soo out again.)

2291
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,010
I think it should be okay.
It only expired a few weeks ago.

2292
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,880
I'll just watch TV or something.

2293
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,490
I have some lunchboxes too.

2294
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:12,590
(They find lunchboxes
in the fridge.)

2295
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:13,960
We could microwave them.

2296
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,530
(What do you think?)

2297
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:18,930
Hey, this is not an escape room.

2298
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,870
(Escape So Min's apartment.)

2299
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:23,710
- I mean...
- Why would you...

2300
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:26,410
Do you want to eat those
and escape from here?

2301
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:28,710
- You want to microwave them?
- We have nothing else to eat.

2302
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,670
- What are they anyway?
- They're low-calorie lunchboxes.

2303
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,880
- I feel uncomfortable.
- I mean...

2304
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,320
You want to eat microwaved
chicken breasts and leave?

2305
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,620
We could have ramyeon too.

2306
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,880
Or get some takeaway food
from the restaurant near here.

2307
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,290
That would be faster.

2308
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:42,880
(You're telling me to go?)

2309
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,460
- What are you waiting for?
- Kwang Soo,

2310
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,660
go get some takeaway food.

2311
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,260
- Just imagine I'm not here.
- Hurry up.

2312
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:51,460
I have to do the dishes
and get takeaway food?

2313
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:52,740
Should we play rock-paper-scissors?

2314
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,460
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2315
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,430
- The winner decides who should go.
- The winner decides.

2316
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:58,380
- The winner decides.
- Okay.

2317
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:59,470
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2318
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,910
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2319
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:02,880
(So Min wins.)

2320
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:05,580
- I just...
- Go.

2321
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:06,750
Go, Kwang Soo.

2322
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,320
(It's always Kwang Soo
who gets penalized.)

2323
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,160
That'd be best.

2324
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,750
(It was decided from the beginning.)

2325
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,860
Go now.

2326
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,220
What are you going to get?

2327
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:17,960
What should I get?

2328
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,050
If she had chosen me,
I would have gone.

2329
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,160
- See you.
- Should I just get ramyeon?

2330
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,200
Yes, just get ramyeon.

2331
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:23,720
(Sighing)

2332
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,040
(Kwang Soo leaves.)

2333
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:27,040
So Min, the thing is,

2334
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,170
I feel so uncomfortable.

2335
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:29,870
- Why?
- I don't know.

2336
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,000
There's nothing much
for you to do here.

2337
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,950
Why are you laughing?

2338
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,970
You feel uncomfortable too, right?

2339
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,580
I do.

2340
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:42,010
But this is better.

2341
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,880
If Kwang Soo wasn't here today,

2342
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,050
it would have been bad.

2343
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:49,490
I would have blushed the whole time
without doing anything.

2344
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,790
- Why would you blush?
- I don't know.

2345
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,000
It's not like
you have a crush on me.

2346
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,200
That's not...

2347
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,290
That's not what I meant. The whole
thing would have been awkward.

2348
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,630
(So Min loves teasing Se Chan.)

2349
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:01,710
Should I do the dishes?

2350
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:04,240
Tell me what to do.

2351
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:06,170
- What's that?
- Put on an apron. You'll get wet.

2352
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:07,880
- I never wear an apron.
- But you'll get soaked.

2353
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:09,750
I mean it.

2354
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,910
(What's going on here?)

2355
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,250
We're not shooting
"We Got Married" here.

2356
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,640
So Min, this isn't "We Got Married".

2357
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:17,490
This is Running Man.

2358
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:18,990
- I mean...
- I never wear an apron.

2359
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:20,320
You'll get completely soaked.

2360
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,080
Really? I don't usually
wear an apron.

2361
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,830
Put it on yourself.
This is too awkward.

2362
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:25,030
Should I tie it for you?

2363
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:29,790
- This isn't "We Got Married".
- I know.

2364
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:31,960
I feel uncomfortable too.
I don't like it either.

2365
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,040
But what can I do?

2366
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,800
(We haven't seen their chemistry
in a while.)

2367
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,500
Don't worry. And I dry them
with this afterwards?

2368
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,170
- Yes.
- Okay.

2369
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,750
You're the first guy
who has done the dishes at my place.

2370
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:46,320
(So Min takes a picture.)

2371
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,420
(The atmosphere is getting weird.)

2372
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,580
This feels weird.
Doing the dishes...

2373
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,750
- "What am I doing here?"
- How did you feel?

2374
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:56,130
It's just work for me.

2375
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:57,630
Are you really here for work?

2376
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,530
- I'm here to do the dishes.
- I mean...

2377
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,530
Did you come here...

2378
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:03,460
to visit me or...

2379
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,030
I don't have to ask Kwang Soo...

2380
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:07,700
because he came here
even though he didn't have to.

2381
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:10,300
Kwang Soo came back
just at the right moment.

2382
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,800
Kwang Soo, help me!

2383
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,540
- What?
- I feel suffocated.

2384
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:15,970
- Kwang Soo.
- Why?

2385
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,880
- Should we eat here?
- Did you do the dishes?

2386
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,780
I did the dishes.

2387
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,210
Explain.

2388
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:22,880
What did you get?

2389
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,840
I have non-alcoholic beer.

2390
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:27,010
Sit down.

2391
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:29,580
I have a family problem.
I have to go.

2392
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,530
Don't go. Stay for a bit.

2393
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:33,330
- What did you get?
- Dumplings.

2394
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:35,720
Thank you.

2395
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,130
- Thank you, Kwang Soo.
- No problem.

2396
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:40,570
Try sundae. It's good.

2397
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,110
It's good.

2398
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:44,540
Dumplings are good too.

2399
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:46,280
Do you know I became a new person?

2400
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,640
Your attitude changes
after you're sick.

2401
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,000
What changed?

2402
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,710
I want to be nicer.
I was nice all this time...

2403
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:54,780
- Why are you glancing around?
- I'm not.

2404
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,820
Didn't you say
you're going to be nice? Continue.

2405
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:59,050
- Yes.
- I was just asking.

2406
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:03,360
I'll be considerate of others,
respect the elderly,

2407
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,990
- and love my friends.
- Try the soup.

2408
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:06,830
Try the soup.

2409
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,630
- Eat and shut my mouth?
- This is really good.

2410
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:10,170
- No.
- Eat and shut my mouth?

2411
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:12,540
What changed?

2412
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,390
When did I tell you
to shut your mouth?

2413
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,110
The soup is really good,
so I told you to try some.

2414
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,330
Are you all right?
Are you back to normal?

2415
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:22,380
Do you talk a lot
when you're home alone?

2416
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,950
I rarely did.

2417
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,780
- Why?
- She's exploding right now.

2418
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:27,950
Am I talking a lot?

2419
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:30,710
- Can't you feel it?
- Don't you know?

2420
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:34,360
Since I entered your house,
you talked nonstop.

2421
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,990
I'm not talking a lot at all.

2422
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:37,160
- You?
- Yes.

2423
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,630
You're back. We don't have to worry.
We can leave.

2424
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:41,090
You can't leave
until you finish this.

2425
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:43,670
Hold on.

2426
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:45,740
(It's white carpet. Be careful.)

2427
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:47,200
Spill it.

2428
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:48,930
(Chuckling)

2429
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,540
(He spills fish cake soup.)

2430
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,380
- Hey!
- No.

2431
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,080
- No, no!
- Hey!

2432
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,110
(No, no.)

2433
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:59,120
- I don't know.
- You did.

2434
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,970
- It's fish cake soup.
- I only got it on my pants.

2435
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:02,040
- Look.
- I swear.

2436
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,990
It's on the floor.

2437
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:05,210
Did you spit it out?

2438
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:07,290
What's this?

2439
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:08,920
It's sundae.

2440
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,790
It's the liver.

2441
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:12,360
- It was chewed.
- No.

2442
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,050
It is. Look. It's liver.

2443
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:16,460
So Min, I caught him.
I told you first.

2444
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:19,260
It's obvious like a dot
because it's white carpet.

2445
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,330
(How dare he?)

2446
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:23,040
Why? I'm right.

2447
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,670
Right, So Min? It's like a dot.

2448
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:25,910
Look. It won't get erased.

2449
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:27,970
Once this dries up...

2450
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,500
Once this dries up...

2451
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,610
(He explodes.)

2452
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:34,750
Why? Why?

2453
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,990
I'm right.

2454
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:37,250
Stop it.

2455
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,460
(This is hilarious.)

2456
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,750
Fold the towels.

2457
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:41,820
(They had fun,
so it's time to fold the towels.)

2458
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,130
You should fold the towels.
We can do it together.

2459
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:46,830
(Sighing)

2460
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,960
Pause and pull to open it.

2461
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:53,430
Don't bring them if they're not dry.
Only bring them if they're dry.

2462
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:54,430
(They went home
after they folded all the towels.)

2463
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:55,760
They're here.

2464
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,260
(Somebody is waiting
for the members.)

2465
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:00,910
(So Min is back in good health.)

2466
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:02,470
You're celebrities!

2467
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:05,140
(The atmosphere boosts
thanks to So Min.)

2468
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:08,280
(She has an invitation
to a village.)

2469
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,510
You just have to dig for treasures.

2470
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:13,320
(There's a golden village
where you can dig up treasures?)

2471
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:16,160
(Everything starts going wrong.)

2472
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:18,890
(They hear people screaming
inside the village.)

2473
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,860
(They find people's name tags
one by one.)

2474
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:23,420
Why are you being fooled?

2475
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,500
- Where is he going?
- I saw him hiding something.

2476
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,390
(Suspicious people
in a strange village)

2477
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,210
(Mysterious serial eliminations)

2478
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:31,040
(Don't trust anybody.)

2479
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,130
(Find a clue
about this village's mystery.)

2480
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,670
(There's somebody
who's behind everything.)

2481
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,300
(What's the secret
surrounding this old village?)

Secret of the Old Village)
