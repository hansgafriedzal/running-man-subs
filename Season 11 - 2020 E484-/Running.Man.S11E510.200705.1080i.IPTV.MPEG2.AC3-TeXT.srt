1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,540
- Hello.
- Hi.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,370
We should move as little as possible
on a day like this.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,910
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,770
- Hello.
- I'm glad we're under the shade.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,780
- It's really hot today.
- It's scorching hot.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,780
We'd get a sunburn.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,350
I know. I was in the sun
just for a moment.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,710
It's going to be really hot.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,820
It's like a calm before the storm.

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,030
What? A calm before the storm?

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,600
Did you just say
a four-character idiom?

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,690
What does this have to do
with a calm before the storm?

14
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,070
A calm before the storm means
before something happens.

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,600
- It's...
- Is it correct or not?

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Is it appropriate
for this situation or not?

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,790
- It's not.
- A calm before the storm?

18
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,900
- Isn't it correct?
- It means...

19
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,710
something big is happening soon.

20
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,710
- I mean...
- It's quiet before it happens.

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,750
About 30 people here
are on Jong Kook's side.

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,900
What? That's what
a calm before the storm means.

23
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,380
- Hello.
- It's very hot now.

24
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,020
You can't say it's
a calm before the storm.

25
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,640
So the monsoon front...

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,710
Ji Hyo!

27
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,060
(Ji Hyo!)

28
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,960
(He escapes the crisis
by saying hello too loud.)

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
(I'm just excited to see her.)

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,780
- Hello, Ji Hyo.
- You're here.

31
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,890
- I thought she was someone else.
- What?

32
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,290
Today, we're having...

33
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,360
the second part of the race
that viewers wanted to see...

34
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,900
which will decide members to receive
the penalty during the live show.

35
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,960
What?

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,460
- It's the Reincarnation episode.
- Reincarnation?

37
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,640
- Reincarnation?
- It's a really old one.

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,010
- Right?
- It was a long time ago.

39
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,200
(The Reincarnation episode
from 2013?)

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,280
(It was a race set in the 1930s.)

41
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,370
(Later on, the members were
born again in 2013.)

42
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,680
(And there was a secret
behind their reincarnation.)

43
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,290
(They were born again
as different members.)

44
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,090
(They figured out their identities
from the race of the 1930s.)

45
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,260
(Haha won the race
and got the treasure chest.)

46
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,260
(The Reincarnation episode will
be remade for 2020 today.)

47
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,820
(Part 1 of the race that viewers
wanted to see, Superpower)

48
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,430
(Part 2 of the race that viewers
wanted to see, Reincarnation)

49
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,090
(The live show on July 12)

50
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,840
We did the episode a long time ago.
We were independence fighters.

51
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,200
- Right.
- Exactly.

52
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,730
We were born again
after crossing some line.

53
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,340
- Right.
- I barely remember it.

54
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,700
We were born again
after crossing some line.

55
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,750
You know what?

56
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,810
- Exactly.
- I don't remember.

57
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,980
I think I won the race.

58
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,510
We weren't there, right?

59
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,340
- We weren't there, were we?
- I barely remember that.

60
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,680
- I feel left out.
- I had no idea.

61
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,310
I just thought reincarnation
sounded so cool.

62
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,980
Me too. I thought they were
talking about the Grim Reaper.

63
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,790
- Me too.
- Today, you are...

64
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,700
going on the Reincarnation Camp
as reincarnations.

65
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,400
- The Reincarnation Camp?
- Yes.

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,160
And you will have a guide
who will take you to the camp.

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,370
- A guide?
- We have a guide.

68
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,460
I see.

69
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,710
- Is someone getting off the bus?
- That's what it says on the bus.

70
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,870
- What does it say?
- "The 1st Reincarnation Camp".

71
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,370
It says welcome.

72
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,400
- The guide is getting off soon.
- Is someone getting off?

73
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,580
(Who's the camp guide
getting off the bus?)

74
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,750
- She just got off.
- She's here.

75
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,840
Who is it?

76
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,550
It's SUNMI. She's SUNMI.

77
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,710
- SUNMI.
- Hello, SUNMI.

78
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,150
- SUNMI.
- SUNMI is here?

79
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,780
- Why did SUNMI get off?
- SUNMI is...

80
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,880
- our guide.
- She's our guide.

81
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,000
She's the reincarnation guide.
Hey, SUNMI.

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,430
- It's SUNMI.
- I'm...

83
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,960
your guide
for the Reincarnation Camp.

84
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,430
- Are you?
- You're the guide.

85
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,000
- It's nice to see you.
- Did you come here alone?

86
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,190
No. We have other members
on the bus now.

87
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,770
Really? Let's get on the bus.

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,710
(Are there more campers on the bus?)

89
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,970
- Are there more people?
- What? My gosh.

90
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,750
What? My gosh. ZICO!

91
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,150
- Hello.
- What's going on?

92
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,150
Hello.

93
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,550
- Today...
- Hello.

94
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,180
- Hello.
- What is Cho Sae Ho doing here?

95
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,410
Hello.

96
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,380
- Hey, Do Hyun.
- What are you doing here?

97
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,960
- Hello.
- Hey, Do Hyun.

98
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,780
- Hello.
- Long time no see.

99
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,030
- Do Hyun is here too.
- Do Hyun.

100
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,000
Jo Young Gu is here.

101
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,060
What is Jo Sae Ho doing here?

102
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,090
Hello, Jo Young Gu.

103
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,460
I'm not Young Gu.

104
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,800
Oh, he's not Jo Young Gu.

105
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,930
Is Young Gu here?

106
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,210
- This is the Reincarnation Camp.
- Okay.

107
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,430
I'd like you to make
good memories on your way.

108
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,610
So your guide, SUNMI,
will take pictures of you.

109
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,000
She's the guide.

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,610
And the crew members will
join you as well.

111
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,150
Why are we taking pictures
all of a sudden?

112
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,310
Is something going on?

113
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,940
You have to hold the name tag.

114
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,650
You shouldn't take a picture alone.

115
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,180
- Why not?
- Look at the camera.

116
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,880
What?

117
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,430
Are we taking pictures
for no reason?

118
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,930
Where are we going?

119
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,120
Guys.

120
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,620
Like I said, this is
the Reincarnation Camp.

121
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,770
You guys have been reincarnated
from previous episodes.

122
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,300
- I see.
- And you all know...

123
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,270
- which episode you are from.
- Yes.

124
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,630
Since SUNMI has never
been eliminated before,

125
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,180
she will be the camp guide
for you guys today.

126
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,210
- Really?
- She's never been eliminated.

127
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,810
Is that true?

128
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,020
- You've never been eliminated?
- I haven't.

129
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,210
That's amazing.

130
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,990
I got eliminated
in the Hades episode.

131
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,340
- That's right.
- I remember that.

132
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,710
The one that featured Sung Dong Il.

133
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,490
- I died there.
- There was Bae Seong Woo.

134
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,380
- Actors from "Metamorphosis".
- Sung Dong Il was there.

135
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,560
They burned my chair.

136
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,360
- That's right.
- It was Jae Suk.

137
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,450
- Exactly.
- Right?

138
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,500
- I remember that.
- Ji Hyo...

139
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,890
threw a tantrum for real.

140
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,620
- I remember that.
- Right.

141
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,470
I'm still upset about it.

142
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,170
She's still upset.

143
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,470
I'm still upset.

144
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,910
What about you, ZICO?
I bet it was recent.

145
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,040
Yes. I recently got killed
three times...

146
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,700
- by one person.
- Oh, right.

147
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,440
- I remember that.
- It was Jong Kook.

148
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,550
- It was me.
- By one person.

149
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,680
(In episode 496, he got killed
three times by Jong Kook.)

150
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,620
I can't believe this.

151
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,290
Just by the one person?

152
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,080
I still resent him for that.

153
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,320
- I see.
- You resent me?

154
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,690
So Min, what about you?

155
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,760
I was reincarnated
from a recent episode too.

156
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,470
Se Chan eliminated me
in Gujeon Village.

157
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,430
- The scarecrow episode?
- Yes, the scarecrow.

158
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,410
He ripped off my name tag.

159
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,310
- That's right.
- It was my first episode back.

160
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,070
That's right. I'm sorry.

161
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,140
(Se Chan ripped off her name tag
her first episode back.)

162
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,810
(Even Se Chan was flustered.)

163
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,620
- I'm sorry.
- My time was cut short.

164
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,490
I'm really sorry about that.

165
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,680
Suk Jin, what about you?

166
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,220
- Jee-rasoni.
- It was on the 10th episode.

167
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,010
Cha Tae Hyun was a guest back then.

168
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,430
I was hiding inside the elevator.

169
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,320
- As soon as the doors opened...
- Right.

170
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,820
I pressed the close button,
but you opened them from outside.

171
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
It was the day
I received back surgery.

172
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,190
For me, it was during
the Battle of Supernaturals...

173
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,000
when Kwang Soo was dressed
as the humanoid from "Avatar".

174
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,970
I ripped off your name tag,
but you could bounce it back.

175
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,260
- That's right!
- I was eliminated instead.

176
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,570
That's the episode
I'm reincarnated from.

177
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,910
- It's recent for me too.
- When was it?

178
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,850
Hyo Seong and Kwang Soo...

179
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,350
- I remember.
- They were directors.

180
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,220
- Exactly.
- That episode.

181
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,250
- I remember too.
- That's right.

182
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,620
- They tricked me.
- Exactly.

183
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,950
We've been eliminated
in the most dramatic ways.

184
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,290
Everyone at the camp...

185
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,790
must solve the secret
to their reincarnation.

186
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,190
Someone from the losing team
will receive the penalty.

187
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,170
We're to solve
the secret of the reincarnation?

188
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,040
- Sounds like fun.
- We must unlock the secret.

189
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,670
- Jong Kook...
- Would you like some?

190
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,060
I feel like we were asked back
for a special installment.

191
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,430
- Yes, the 10th anniversary.
- It's a special episode.

192
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,500
Sae Ho, you're joining us
on a special episode?

193
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,050
Tell me about it.

194
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,250
- I can't believe it.
- It's nothing to celebrate.

195
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,070
- You squeezed your way in.
- I'm just grateful.

196
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,380
There's no need to congratulate me.

197
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,720
- But having this chance...
- I didn't know Sae Ho was here.

198
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,510
I didn't know that he was here.

199
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,880
So Min didn't even know
that you were here.

200
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,880
- I didn't realize it.
- Don't be ridiculous.

201
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,820
- You saw me a second ago.
- But...

202
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,800
- Anyway, now you know.
- Your body shrank...

203
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,390
along with your presence.

204
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,630
- Gosh.
- Yes, attack him.

205
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,060
- I mean...
- Do you know why I lost weight?

206
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,910
- Why?
- This is upsetting, you know.

207
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,040
- Why?
- Why did you lose weight?

208
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,680
Because I wanted you
to see a new side of me.

209
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,740
Because I wanted you
to see a new side of me.

210
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,770
(He says the most cringy line ever.)

211
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,440
- It makes me sick.
- Seriously?

212
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,750
(They all feel like vomiting.)

213
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,070
So Min likes it though.

214
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,720
Do you still not get it, So Min?

215
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,790
She's loving it.

216
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,680
- So Min?
- <i>Why are you being a fool?</i>

217
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,010
She fell for that line.

218
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,520
Can't you see that the song
was written for you?

219
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,100
Then why did you
turn me down back then?

220
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,060
Because you could've
turned me down,

221
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,620
and I didn't want to get hurt.

222
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,760
- What?
- What's going on?

223
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,630
If this is made into a web series,

224
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,330
about 20 people will watch it.

225
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,310
- Just us.
- Yes, just the people here.

226
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,980
- To make fun of them.
- Exactly.

227
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,630
I'm curious as to
what'll happen though.

228
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,870
- Are we at the location?
- I think we are.

229
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,420
- I think we're there.
- Where are we?

230
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,850
- Gosh.
- It's like a lodging.

231
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,310
- It's a lodging?
- This is nice.

232
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,880
- I see grass.
- Goodness, what's this place?

233
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,010
Grass?

234
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,220
- What will we be doing?
- It's going to be a hot day.

235
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,930
- Let's head inside.
- Let's go!

236
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,600
(Will they be able
to unlock the secret?)

237
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,100
Welcome to
the 2020 Reincarnation Camp.

238
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,560
(They safely arrive at
the Reincarnation Camp.)

239
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,760
We've been reincarnated!

240
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,800
Before we begin the camp activities,

241
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,060
we should hear the new songs
released by both artists.

242
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,260
- Right.
- Their new songs.

243
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,130
- "Summer Hate".
- "Summer Hate".

244
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,830
- By ZICO.
- "Summer Hate".

245
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,350
- I can't wait for the choreography.
- I'm excited.

246
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,550
I'm definitely taking part
in the challenge this time.

247
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,250
("Summer Hate" by ZICO)

248
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,180
- Nice.
- It's light and simple.

249
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,310
- Like this.
- Look at that.

250
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,490
- I love that move.
- He's adorable.

251
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,950
I love this.

252
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,320
- Nice one.
- It's so cute.

253
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,170
Whoever loses the game
of rock-paper-scissors...

254
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,930
I see.

255
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,760
We should all participate
in the dance challenge.

256
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,610
How nice.

257
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,430
(The fanning adds
to the fun vibe of the song.)

258
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,500
That was nice.

259
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,910
I liked this move especially.

260
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,180
It could be turned...

261
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,440
- into a dance challenge.
- Exactly.

262
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,220
- Many will do it.
- Kwang Soo, you looked good.

263
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,820
Nicely done.

264
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,880
(Flailing)

265
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,040
Nice.

266
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,380
That was great. Next up is SUNMI.

267
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,960
No way, it's SUNMI!

268
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,200
Her new song is...

269
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,100
- "Pporappippam".
- Ppam!

270
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,870
("Pporappippam" by SUNMI)

271
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,610
It has her unique flair to it.

272
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,800
(SUNMI's vibe fits
the hipster beat.)

273
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,530
- She seems so relaxed.
- Pporappippam!

274
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,110
I knew it.

275
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,980
(Even Kwang Soo
is swaying his hips.)

276
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,850
(The summer night song
makes you want to do body rolls.)

277
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,910
Let's try it.

278
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,380
- Pporappippam!
- Pporappippam!

279
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,750
("Pporappippam" is perfect
for a dreamy summer night.)

280
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,750
Pporappippam!

281
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,750
- Pporappippam!
- Pporappippam!

282
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,150
Aren't the two songs
going head to head?

283
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,790
- Yes, they're in a battle.
- The song is incredible.

284
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,870
Nice.

285
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,230
Next is Sae Ho.

286
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,290
You're a member of
the group ChoNam Zone,

287
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,440
and you recently released
a new song.

288
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,110
- A new song?
- Yes.

289
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,800
- It's been quite a while though.
- Let us hear it anyway.

290
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,710
"Why Are You Stupid?"
is the title of the song.

291
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,030
Are you sure it's not
"What's Wrong with Your Face?"

292
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,500
- No, it's not.
- Isn't it?

293
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,870
- It's not...
- "Droopy Face"?

294
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,450
No, that's not it either.

295
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,870
The moment you started to talk,
the five of them started attacking.

296
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,910
- We've been dying over here.
- We're closing in on him too.

297
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,190
- "Droopy Face".
- We needed to vent.

298
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,320
This may be
slightly inappropriate to ask,

299
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,520
but were you officially asked
to be on the show...

300
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,920
or did you come here
without being invited?

301
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,020
Who in their right mind...

302
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,050
would come here
without officially being asked?

303
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,050
- Because...
- Would I...

304
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,470
- You never know.
- You could've been passing by.

305
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,620
- Are you sure?
- I agreed on the payment too.

306
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,790
- Do you get paid to be here?
- What?

307
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,530
Why would I be here
if I'm not getting paid?

308
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,370
- How much were you offered?
- How much?

309
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,170
I'm afraid I can't say.

310
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,040
(He'd rather plead the Fifth.)

311
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,770
Then we'll respect your wishes.

312
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,870
- Okay.
- Let's move on.

313
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,750
- So, guys...
- Is that it?

314
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,380
- Hold on a second.
- Sae Ho wants a longer interview.

315
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,320
The first class of
the 2020 Reincarnation Camp...

316
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,490
is called
My Glorious Past Envelopes Me.

317
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,420
- What?
- You will compete in a quiz...

318
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,050
after being split up
into 4 teams of 3.

319
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,050
It's a quiz.

320
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,370
Each team will choose
two members to represent them.

321
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,940
While sitting on the chair,
they will press the button...

322
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,500
with their foot to get a chance
to answer the question.

323
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,610
With our foot?

324
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,940
The third teammate
will poke as many swords...

325
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,300
as the team would like to bet.

326
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,400
If the pirate stays in,
your bet will be placed.

327
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,480
- Okay.
- If the team answers correctly,

328
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,080
the bet you placed
will be converted into points.

329
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,220
- We played this before.
- If you get the question wrong...

330
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,040
or the pirate pops out,
points will be deducted,

331
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,050
and the chair
will flip over backward.

332
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,590
- Got it.
- Sounds difficult.

333
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,520
After the scores are tallied,

334
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,730
the top two teams
will be served a meal.

335
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,920
The remaining two teams...

336
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,700
will have to find food
that's been stashed away.

337
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,790
We must find them ourselves?

338
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,340
- Seriously?
- In this hot weather?

339
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,500
- It's hot outside.
- Food that's on the floor?

340
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,400
The four guests
will be the team captains.

341
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,630
- Really?
- Yes.

342
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,370
Please choose a color out of...

343
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,980
red, green, blue, and yellow.

344
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,250
Please choose one each.

345
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,820
I guess we've been split up fairly.

346
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,620
Here's the first question.

347
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,350
In 2008, on a variety show,

348
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,820
Suk Jin said that his wife
seemed like...

349
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,860
a character from this movie...

350
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,460
when she peeled fruit for him
10 minutes after an argument.

351
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,230
What's the name of this movie?

352
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,650
Of course, I know this.

353
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,100
I should've been in the chair.
I know the answer for sure.

354
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,570
I said it on "Happy Together".

355
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,890
- I don't remember.
- Don't you remember, Jae Suk?

356
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,030
I don't remember the title.

357
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,530
Can I give you a hint?

358
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,800
It's a foreign film.

359
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,170
(Team ZICO presses the button
as soon as they hear the hint.)

360
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,800
So Min, please place your bet.

361
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,820
I'll go with four.

362
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,120
- Four?
- Sounds reasonable, right?

363
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,620
- You're playing it too safe.
- It's only the first question.

364
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,380
(If the pirate stays and the answer
is correct, they win 4 points.)

365
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,730
(If the pirate pops out,
the other two will pay the price.)

366
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,290
- Have some faith in me.
- Please pop out.

367
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,100
- Trust me.
- Let it pop out.

368
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,390
You can trust me.

369
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,620
(She only has one left to stick in.)

370
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,970
- I think she did it.
- Okay!

371
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,660
- Okay, good.
- See?

372
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,110
ZICO and Kwang Soo,
what's the answer?

373
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,470
- Dr. Hannibal Lecter...
- Dr. Hannibal Lecter...

374
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,710
- in "The Silence of the Lambs".
- in "The Silence of the Lambs".

375
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,980
(Is the answer Dr. Hannibal Lecter?)

376
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,110
Dr. Hannibal Lecter?

377
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,610
- What a relief.
- I doubt it.

378
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,170
- What a relief.
- I doubt it.

379
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,850
- The chairs...
- Will we be flipped over?

380
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,990
What...

381
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,280
(The wrong answer
has their chairs flip over.)

382
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,550
Nicely done. Nice.

383
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
(Those watching are satisfied.)

384
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,230
- My gosh.
- Nicely done.

385
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,000
Look how ugly Kwang Soo is.

386
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,070
- Look how ugly he is.
- Right?

387
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,700
You're super ugly.

388
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,870
I didn't expect that at all.

389
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,800
I thought it'd at least be slower.

390
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,500
Suk Jin, give them another hint.

391
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,850
It's a foreign film,
and the main character is female.

392
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,320
It has to be a famous movie.

393
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,750
- Yes?
- I know. I remember now.

394
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,120
- Place your bet.
- We bet five.

395
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,720
- Okay.
- It's game over now.

396
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,010
(Jae Suk was the host
of that variety show.)

397
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,020
Okay.

398
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,190
(Jae Suk was the host
of that variety show.)

399
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,830
- What...
- Are you kidding me?

400
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,200
(The pirate pops out
on the first try.)

401
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,660
What on earth are you doing?

402
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,370
- Wait!
- Was that the first one?

403
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,240
Can this actually happen?

404
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,660
Was that the first one?

405
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,710
Can this actually happen?

406
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,710
(They lose a point
for failing to place their bet.)

407
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,900
- Nice!
- It was on my first try.

408
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,980
Here's the keyword.

409
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,040
A remote house.

410
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,170
- Yes, I know.
- Go for it.

411
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,120
- We were first.
- Sure.

412
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,010
- Five.
- I'm not sure if I can do it.

413
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,410
- Just do it.
- Okay, five.

414
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,590
(Please don't fail this time.)

415
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,590
- Please.
- Let the pirate pop out.

416
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,390
- It's the last one.
- Haha, please.

417
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,830
- Pirate, please pop out.
- Let it pop out.

418
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,620
- He's on the last one.
- Jae Suk knows the answer.

419
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,100
Please...

420
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,130
- Seriously?
- Nice!

421
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,110
- Seriously?
- Are you kidding me?

422
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,480
- Is this a joke?
- You only had one left.

423
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,530
You had so many slots
to choose from.

424
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,080
Are you kidding me?

425
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,640
What...

426
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,820
This is insane.

427
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,850
Place a smaller bet then.

428
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,950
- Okay.
- Good.

429
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,490
- All right.
- Go with five.

430
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,780
- 5.
- We'll bet 5.

431
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,550
- It should be at least five.
- Okay.

432
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,830
- Yes.
- Nice!

433
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,250
- What's the answer?
- Let us answer.

434
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,290
In 1, 2, 3.

435
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,600
- "Misery".
- "Misery".

436
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,470
(If the answer is correct,
they'll win 5 points.)

437
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,600
It's correct!

438
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,890
- Okay.
- Nice.

439
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,710
("Misery" was the movie
his wife reminded him of.)

440
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,760
I knew it before
you gave us the hint.

441
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,340
- "Misery".
- Of course.

442
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,900
Right, the remote house.

443
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,350
Here's the next question.

444
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,870
In 2006, at the age of 28,
Haha said that...

445
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,120
he'd want nothing more
than for this...

446
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,410
- to be written on his tombstone.
- It's too difficult.

447
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,220
What did he want as his epitaph?

448
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,460
- It's too difficult.
- This is too difficult.

449
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,960
- An epitaph at 28?
- An epitaph?

450
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,050
What did you say?

451
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,120
- In 2006?
- Is it a famous saying?

452
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,290
- Or...
- He partly used a famous saying.

453
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,970
- I guess...
- Right.

454
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,000
- he tried to copy something.
- Back then...

455
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,100
Also, it includes "Ha Dong Hoon".

456
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,470
It's already annoying.

457
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,610
(I don't know what it is,
but it's annoying.)

458
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,710
Is my name annoying?

459
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,240
That's not what I mean.
The epitaph...

460
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,630
(Team Do Hyun gives it a go.)

461
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,870
- "The versatile entertainer..."
- What's your answer?

462
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,540
- Okay.
- I don't remember it at all.

463
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,800
We bet 10.

464
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,820
(Team Do Hyun bets 10.)

465
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,410
- Are you sure, Do Hyun?
- Yes.

466
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,820
- It'll pop up.
- He wants to fail.

467
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,850
- Stick in hard.
- It'll pop up.

468
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,450
- It'll pop up.
- That's enough.

469
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,150
- Stop.
- Okay, okay.

470
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,320
Do Hyun, stop now.

471
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,280
- Stop, you punk!
- Do Hyun, stop.

472
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,420
- Okay, okay.
- Seven.

473
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,520
That's enough. You can stop now.

474
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,200
- He's good.
- That's enough.

475
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,970
- You can stop.
- He won't stop until it pops up.

476
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,260
Eight.

477
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,100
(He really kept going
until it popped up.)

478
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,740
- Okay!
- Okay!

479
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Eight.

480
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,470
(We told you to stop.)

481
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,580
Okay!

482
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,740
Good job!

483
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,770
Gosh, my hair is almost dry though.

484
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,350
Do you have any idea?

485
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,370
We all have negative points.

486
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,640
What is this?

487
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,990
(Team Do Hyun loses 8 points.)

488
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,960
Let's try it.

489
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,460
Let me answer. We bet five.

490
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,360
- Be confident.
- It's okay.

491
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,750
Make it pop up, ZICO.

492
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,790
It makes me so nervous
when they stick them in.

493
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,660
There are two left.

494
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,940
- There you go.
- I hope it'll pop up.

495
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,290
(He has to stick in just one more.)

496
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,570
- There you go.
- Okay!

497
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,840
(Team ZICO successfully bets 5.)

498
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,530
But it's a hard question.

499
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,610
It's hard.

500
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,130
"Here lies the versatile artist,
Ha Dong Hoon."

501
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,580
(Here lies the versatile artist,
Ha Dong Hoon.)

502
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,720
- That can't be it.
- That's wrong.

503
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
He can't have said, "artist",
back in 2006.

504
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,220
- Kwang Soo, think some more.
- Yes.

505
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,280
I'm sorry.

506
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,620
- You got ahead of yourself.
- Kwang Soo.

507
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,820
(They calmly wait for the penalty.)

508
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,460
(What?)

509
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,520
(Kwang Soo pours his water
into So Min's bowl.)

510
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,600
(Amazed)

511
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,660
- It was wrong.
- What happened?

512
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,530
He's a genius.

513
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,710
- He's a genius.
- It's not "versatile artist"?

514
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,300
- That's incredible.
- He's the worst.

515
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,770
It's not "the versatile artist,
Ha Dong Hoon"?

516
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,980
- Do you want to switch?
- What? No.

517
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,640
We should continue.
What are you talking about?

518
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,870
What are you doing?

519
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,880
That feels nice.

520
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,250
- Do you allow this?
- Why?

521
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,620
(She's soaking her feet.)

522
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,960
This feels really nice.
What's wrong?

523
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,880
- It'll go to her face anyway.
- Yes, it'll go to my face anyway.

524
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,350
This is nice.

525
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,290
(Kwang Soo suddenly starts
washing his face.)

526
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,700
(Culture shock)

527
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,800
- Gosh.
- No!

528
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,470
- He's the worst.
- The water is so dirty.

529
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,100
- He's the worst.
- Come on.

530
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,600
(He is ready for war.)

531
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,380
Let me do something funny too.

532
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,450
- We know the answer this time.
- What?

533
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,720
Yes, we know the answer.

534
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Pop up!

535
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,720
- Please.
- We know the answer.

536
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,460
- Make it pop up, ZICO!
- We know it.

537
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,050
We'll get it right this time.

538
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,930
- ZICO, there are two left.
- We know it.

539
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,990
It's popping up.

540
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,320
There you go.

541
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,290
(This is a signal of war.)

542
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,930
(Sighing)

543
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,700
- I told you.
- I can't wait.

544
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,140
What are you going to do? Oh, no.

545
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,360
I can't wait.

546
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,800
- What are you going to do? Oh, no.
- The water is dirty.

547
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,560
Oh, no.

548
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,100
- She soaked her feet in it.
- Let's see it.

549
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,140
(They washed
their feet and face in it.)

550
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,240
Hold on.

551
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,100
(The two moths sense their fate.)

552
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,150
The chairs. Team Three.

553
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,190
- Let's not do it.
- 1, 2,

554
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,220
- Let's not...
- three.

555
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,250
Exactly.

556
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,690
(The negotiation breaks down.)

557
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,160
(They splash water on themselves.)

558
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,520
(It's a catastrophe.)

559
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,820
Gosh.

560
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,200
That's so funny.

561
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,140
(They're equally soaked now.)

562
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,500
That's so funny.

563
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,300
- Let us try.
- It's our turn, right?

564
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,070
- Yes.
- We'll bet three.

565
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,070
It's our turn.

566
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,880
- Okay.
- I think they know the answer.

567
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

568
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,070
- "Here lies..."
- "Here lies..."

569
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,780
- "actor and rapper Ha Dong Hoon."
- "actor and rapper Ha Dong Hoon."

570
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,840
It's correct, right?

571
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,780
(If it's correct,
they win 3 points.)

572
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,630
"Actor and rapper".

573
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,360
(Correct)

574
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,560
"Actor and rapper".

575
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,740
(Team Sae Ho gets
another question right.)

576
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,500
We got it right?

577
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,970
- Unbelievable.
- We got it right?

578
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,000
(They're surprised themselves.)

579
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,180
- I'm good at this.
- We got it right?

580
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,570
Reincarnation Camp. Here are
the results of the first mission.

581
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,150
- First place, Team Sae Ho.
- Okay!

582
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,070
- Second place, Team ZICO.
- Okay!

583
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,610
Third place, Team SUNMI.

584
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,990
Fourth place, Team Do Hyun.

585
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,580
- Team SUNMI, find cup noodles.
- I love cup noodles.

586
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,490
Team Do Hyun, find rice and kimchi.

587
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,630
Before we go, SUNMI has
something for you.

588
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,520
- What is it?
- I have bracelets for you.

589
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,750
- Please wear them.
- What is it?

590
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,060
There are bracelets?

591
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,020
They'll help you find the secret...

592
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,470
- of your reincarnations.
- Really?

593
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,290
It's so cute and tiny.

594
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,470
It's not product placement.

595
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,860
- It's not?
- No.

596
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,640
- It has a touch screen.
- It's not product placement.

597
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
- It's not?
- Is it family-friendly?

598
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,270
It's not product placement.

599
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,180
- It's not product placement.
- It is family-friendly.

600
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,810
SUNMI, please hand out
the photos you took earlier.

601
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,880
- Okay.
- Really?

602
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,040
- I'll hand out the photos.
- Can we keep them?

603
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,850
- Yes.
- Sae Ho.

604
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,920
(The photos are handed out.)

605
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,310
- Thank you.
- That's a good one.

606
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,630
Why are you giving them to us?

607
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,580
(Why do you give us photos
before eating?)

608
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,850
Is it a gift?

609
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,290
Teams in 3rd and 4th places,
please get going.

610
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

611
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,360
- Let's go.
- Let's go eat.

612
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,170
- It looks delicious.
- Oh, my.

613
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,940
(Teams in 1st and 2nd place
get 3-layer lunchboxes.)

614
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,940
- It's still warm.
- It's tasty.

615
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,260
- I must have been hungry.
- Me too.

616
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,600
It's delicious.

617
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,530
It's nice to win.

618
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,210
(While they enjoy
their lunchboxes...)

619
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,540
- Ramyeon is the best on a hot day.
- I know.

620
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,220
Slurping the hot soup in the heat...

621
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,010
The temperatures will go up
to 36°C today.

622
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,850
- That's crazy.
- It calls for...

623
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,080
- some hot noodles.
- Cup noodles.

624
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,050
- What's this place?
- Is this it?

625
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,090
I guess so.

626
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,290
This is it.

627
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,320
- Here's the kimchi.
- We only get kimchi?

628
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,000
- Oh, there's rice too.
- We get rice and kimchi.

629
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,240
My goodness.

630
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,290
If only we had ramyeon too.

631
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,500
I found ramyeon!

632
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,560
Oh, there it is.

633
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,910
- We can just have this.
- Is this it?

634
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,100
I think so.

635
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,880
I was so shocked
when you turned out to be a spy.

636
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,180
- You were?
- Yes.

637
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,510
I bet we played a big part...

638
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,420
in you starting on that drama.

639
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,160
I agree.

640
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,130
- Are you surprised?
- No.

641
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,320
(The two members brag shamelessly.)

642
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,930
Will it be you and me next week?

643
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,500
What?

644
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,330
(They're attacked by
mysterious creatures.)

645
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,410
What?

646
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
(Startled)

647
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,450
(The Reincarnation Camp
is taken over...)

648
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,610
(by a swarm of zombies.)

649
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,080
(There are zombies everywhere.)

650
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,020
(Flustered)

651
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,750
- Hey, close the door.
- Close the door.

652
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,700
Close the door.

653
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,860
Gosh, I was so startled.
I almost got an upset stomach.

654
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,440
(They can't figure out
what's going on.)

655
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,710
Gosh.

656
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,600
What is this?

657
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,270
(What is going on here?)

658
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,000
What's going on? Who are they?

659
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,310
(Team SUNMI is
getting ready to eat.)

660
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,420
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

661
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,510
(They're attacked by zombies too.)

662
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,220
(SUNMI freezes.)

663
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,460
(All of a sudden,
zombies appear everywhere.)

664
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,590
(What's going on
at the Reincarnation Camp?)

665
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,430
(Startled)

666
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,000
What?

667
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,470
What's going on?

668
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,940
What is that?

669
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,100
What's going on? What happened?

670
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,140
(Scared)

671
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,010
(Zombies appear everywhere
at the Reincarnation Camp.)

672
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,840
- Do you like...
- What happened?

673
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,920
(Team Sae Ho and Team ZICO
hear the siren too.)

674
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,050
Is that a siren?

675
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,110
(Why is the siren going off?)

676
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,280
- Ji Hyo, something arrived.
- Something arrived?

677
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,730
- News arrived.
- What is it?

678
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,790
(A video is sent to their phones.)

679
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,470
- What is it?
- It's a video.

680
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,790
Breaking news. A swarm of
zombies that can spread viruses...

681
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,790
appeared at the Running Man
Reincarnation Camp.

682
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,410
A swarm of zombies...

683
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,240
(Zombies Appear
at the Reincarnation Camp)

684
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,910
(A swarm of zombies)

685
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,340
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

686
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,270
Zombies appeared?

687
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,190
(Now?)

688
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,280
These zombies have excellent
intelligence and physical abilities.

689
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,020
Shockingly, they can spread
zombie viruses...

690
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,350
by ripping off humans' name tags.

691
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,290
Did the other guys
turn into zombies?

692
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,290
Really?

693
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,730
They're known to have
a keen sense of hearing and smell.

694
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,290
Due to their keen sense of smell,

695
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,830
you can keep them off
for 10 seconds...

696
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,830
by using hand sanitizers
and shouting, "Hurray!"

697
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,530
Make sure you have
enough hand sanitizers.

698
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,070
- They have a keen sense of smell.
- Our food...

699
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,380
(You can keep them off
by using hand sanitizers.)

700
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,100
- We need hand sanitizers.
- We need hand sanitizers.

701
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,720
An ambulance will arrive at 4 p.m...

702
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,570
for the survivors.

703
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,510
All survivors watching this...

704
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,990
are required to gather in the
seminar room of the safe zone.

705
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,010
(They're required to gather
in the seminar room.)

706
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Until 4 p.m... It's 1:53 p.m. now.

707
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,490
All right.

708
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,550
Let's try to make a noise
over there.

709
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,790
- Let's throw a pack of wet wipes.
- Let's try this.

710
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,060
Shall we try throwing this?

711
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,140
Give it to me.

712
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,710
(Will the zombies react
to the noise?)

713
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,070
(It drops with a noise.)

714
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,450
Let's hurry. That way.

715
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,250
(The three escape
while the zombies are distracted.)

716
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,450
There are zombies everywhere.

717
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,580
- Gosh, why are there so many?
- What should we do?

718
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,230
(Zombies are all over the place.)

719
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,020
Guys, look.

720
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,290
- What is it? A hand sanitizer?
- It's a hand sanitizer.

721
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,400
Really?

722
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,060
(Hand sanitizers can keep off
the zombies for 10 seconds.)

723
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,880
(After throwing a rock
to distract the zombies,)

724
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,600
(Jae Suk tiptoes away.)

725
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,410
There are so many.

726
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:47,110
(They can't decide what to do
with the zombies standing so near.)

727
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,520
(He carefully walks toward
the safe zone.)

728
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,240
Is there something there, Ji Hyo?

729
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,270
- I found it.
- There's only one.

730
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,880
- Did you find it?
- There's one here.

731
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,250
- Gosh, I'm sweating.
- Is one enough?

732
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,450
(There's a zombie in every street.)

733
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,010
There's a zombie over there.

734
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,250
Gosh. Go away! Hey!

735
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,650
We found it.

736
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,810
- Hold on.
- Don't scream.

737
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,840
Don't scream.

738
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,660
How are we supposed to go?

739
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,890
(The zombies gathered
at Ji Hyo's screams.)

740
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,820
- Oh, no.
- The zombies can't run.

741
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,520
We almost got away.

742
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,250
(If you use hand sanitizer
and yell "Hurray",)

743
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,520
(the zombies can't approach you
for 10 seconds.)

744
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,900
Hurray. Hurray.

745
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Hurray.

746
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
(They passed the zombies
thanks to the hand sanitizers.)

747
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
What?

748
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
- Hurray! Hurray!
- Hurry.

749
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,410
- Hurray!
- Let's get out of here!

750
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,040
- Hurray!
- Don't come near me!

751
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,570
Hurray!

752
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,770
(The hand sanitizer
is only effective for 10 seconds.)

753
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,190
- Hurray!
- Come here!

754
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,050
SUNMI, come here. Ji Hyo!

755
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,280
Where are you going? Hey!

756
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,630
How can you just leave me here?

757
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,550
We lost Ji Hyo.

758
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,550
Let's ditch her for now.

759
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,350
(Se Chan, SUNMI, Ji Hyo)

760
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:11,740
(Se Chan and SUNMI head to the
safe zone after ditching Ji Hyo.)

761
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,060
- Hey.
- What?

762
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,530
This is not the time to be eating.

763
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,980
(Jae Suk barely gets to the Safe
Zone after escaping the zombies.)

764
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
- You're not a zombie, right?
- Hey.

765
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,750
- You're not a zombie?
- You're a zombie now, right?

766
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,750
You're not a zombie?

767
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,270
(Groaning)

768
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,270
He's not. If he's doing this,
he's not a zombie.

769
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,690
He's not.

770
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,340
He's not a zombie.

771
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,750
(He pretends to be a zombie...)

772
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,350
(and heads straight to the food.)

773
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,690
What kind of zombie eats bread?

774
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,900
What is he doing?
Why is he eating a sandwich?

775
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,960
Hey.

776
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,550
What kind of zombie eats bread?

777
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,260
How did you know
there were zombies?

778
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,200
- We saw it on the news.
- We were sent a video.

779
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,670
Do Hyun is here.

780
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,300
- What's going on?
- Why is he coming in like a zombie?

781
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,860
He's a zombie.
Look at his expression.

782
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,710
- Are you a zombie?
- What happened?

783
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,910
(Did something happen to Do Hyun
on his way here?)

784
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,140
They seem weird.

785
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,800
What's this box?

786
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,450
What's in this box?
Come here and take a look.

787
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,510
- Hold on.
- What is it?

788
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,510
Is there something there?
What is it?

789
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,950
There's something inside the box.

790
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,040
What is it?

791
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,850
- What is it?
- They're eyes.

792
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,110
Did you say "eyes"?

793
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,020
What is that? What is it?

794
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,250
- What is that?
- What is it?

795
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,290
- There's a memo.
- There's something written on here.

796
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,460
(There's something written
on here.)

797
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,000
"How to use the Judgment Stand".

798
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,060
"Judgment Stand"?

799
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,290
"The zombies are divided into
low-class and high-class zombies."

800
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,910
"High-class zombies look
and act like normal humans,"

801
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,980
- "and low-class zombies don't."
- I told you.

802
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,980
- Is that so?
- I had no idea.

803
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,980
There must be high-class zombies
among us.

804
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,340
After voting to choose the most
suspicious person,

805
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,810
you can put them in the Judgment
Stand to find out who they are.

806
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,340
There's a caste system
among zombies?

807
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,580
If you find the Judgment Tickets
hidden around this place,

808
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,040
the Judgment Stand opens.

809
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,250
You have to write the name of
the most suspicious person...

810
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,280
on the zombie eyes and submit them.

811
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,160
"If the person in the Judgment Stand
is a high-class zombie,"

812
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,430
"they will be removed from
the safe zone immediately."

813
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,930
- It would be upsetting.
- "They'll be a low-class zombie."

814
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,700
- The zombie would be upset.
- See? I told you.

815
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,970
There must be a zombie among
these three people.

816
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,970
- One of them must be a zombie.
- You're right.

817
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,000
- If you're infected with the virus,
- Hey.

818
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,800
- your wristband will vibrate.
- I see.

819
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,410
(If you get infected with the zombie
virus, your wristband will vibrate.)

820
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,710
"If you take the vaccine within
10 minutes of getting infected,"

821
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,950
"you'll be cured."

822
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,840
"If you don't take the vaccine
in 10 minutes,"

823
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,280
"you'll become a high-class zombie."

824
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
(How you become a high-class zombie)

825
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,080
"Be aware that if a low-class zombie
rips your name tag off,"

826
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,250
"you will automatically become
a low-class zombie."

827
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,050
"Nobody is allowed to rip off name
tags except for low-class zombies."

828
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,790
Jae Suk and Haha are
high-class zombies,

829
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,700
so they are acting like us and not
ripping off our name tags, right?

830
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,170
That's why they came in here
and ate something.

831
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,170
Right.

832
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,590
Zombies can't come in here though.

833
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,640
They said high-class zombies
are the same as humans.

834
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,640
How did you...

835
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,500
- There's a zombie among us.
- They are the same as humans, so...

836
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,540
I know we seem suspicious
in this situation.

837
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,600
- Yes, since you came from outside.
- What is this monitor?

838
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,920
I think it's Jae Suk.

839
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,150
Gosh, ZICO. You're driving me crazy.

840
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,340
- Seriously.
- A rapper who acts.

841
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,510
I also think...

842
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,550
(What?)

843
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,850
- You need a ticket.
- It's there.

844
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,750
(He saw something on the monitor
and took out the cord quickly.)

845
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,090
He just took out the cord.

846
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,130
What is it?

847
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,290
He just took out the cord.

848
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,290
- What is it?
- Why?

849
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,290
- Why did you do that?
- Why did he unplug it?

850
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,360
- What is it?
- Why did you do that?

851
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,560
- Why'd you unplug it? What is it?
- Hey.

852
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,360
- Why'd you unplug it?
- What are you up to now?

853
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,640
- Was there was something on here?
- Why did you take it out?

854
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,800
Are you a zombie?
You're a zombie, aren't you?

855
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
It's not because I'm a zombie.

856
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,830
- Then why did you take it out?
- Why did you unplug it?

857
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,440
It said that there are 10 humans.

858
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,150
(It said that there are 10 humans.)

859
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,270
It said that there are 10 humans.
That's what was on the monitor.

860
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,920
(12 people came to the Reincarnation
Camp, but only 10 are humans.)

861
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,180
It says "10 humans" on the monitor.

862
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,250
(12 people came to the Reincarnation
Camp, but only 10 are humans.)

863
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,190
(That means 2 of them are zombies.)

864
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,460
That means that since
there are 11 of us,

865
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,780
there's a high-class zombie
among us.

866
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,050
Why did you unplug it?

867
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,400
Why did you unplug it? Tell us.

868
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,630
Why did you unplug it?

869
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,660
First...

870
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,790
- Come over here.
- It could be a clue.

871
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,820
Don't say "first".
Tell us why you unplugged it.

872
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,900
Everyone was standing here,
and I saw him.

873
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,670
- No, it's not that.
- Get over here.

874
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,970
I wanted to think first.

875
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,470
- Get over here.
- Guys.

876
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,470
What is it?

877
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,000
There's a swarm of zombies outside.

878
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,910
- Are there really zombies?
- There are a lot of them.

879
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,270
- There are 10 humans among us.
- SUNMI,

880
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,570
- There are two zombies among us.
- did you find the hand sanitizers?

881
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,950
- We found them.
- We have to find them?

882
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,420
Kwang Soo is suspicious,

883
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,280
so he should go look for tickets.

884
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,040
- I have no reason to leave.
- I received something.

885
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,190
I'm telling you.

886
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,920
(I received something.)

887
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,190
- You're a zombie.
- You got infected.

888
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,460
- He's a zombie. What is this?
- Is he a zombie?

889
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,550
- Why is your wristband ringing?
- What's going on?

890
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,850
(They said you'd get a signal on
your wristband if you got infected.)

891
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,900
What's going on?

892
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,660
- What?
- Is it Ji Hyo?

893
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,520
Are you sure it's not a call
telling you that you're infected?

894
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,760
- That's right.
- He got infected.

895
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Both of them.

896
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,560
- I didn't get a call.
- They said...

897
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,470
we'd get a signal on our wristband
if we got infected.

898
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,830
- I didn't get a signal.
- You must be infected.

899
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,940
- That must be it.
- Have you become a zombie?

900
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,600
- Everyone.
- Yes?

901
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,010
This is a reincarnation special
as well as a zombie special.

902
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,380
It's about zombies.

903
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,840
You saw the Judgment Stand, right?

904
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,250
- There are two types of zombies.
- Right.

905
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,610
If you don't take a vaccine within
10 minutes of getting infected,

906
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,320
- you'll become a zombie.
- Go take the vaccine.

907
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,630
Go look for the vaccine.

908
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,250
If you don't take it in 10 minutes,
you'll get infected.

909
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,290
- What? The vaccine?
- The vaccine.

910
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,460
Go look for the vaccine.

911
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,000
By myself?
Can you come with me, Sae Ho?

912
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,470
- Why would I?
- You're a zombie.

913
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,060
- You're already a zombie.
- You're a zombie.

914
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,760
- Come with me.
- You're a zombie.

915
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,560
- Why would I go with you?
- I'm asking because I'm scared.

916
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Go with Kwang Soo.

917
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,740
- I shouldn't go with him.
- Since Kwang So is a zombie,

918
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,830
- No.
- go with him.

919
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,830
- Let's go together.
- I don't want...

920
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,910
- Kwang Soo knows the hint.
- Why would I go with you?

921
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,150
- You're a zombie.
- You could come with me.

922
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,270
Just start walking like a zombie
in 10 minutes.

923
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,040
- Come with me!
- Go look for the vaccine!

924
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,420
- Ji Hyo's here! Go look for it.
- The zombie is here.

925
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,420
(Ji Hyo, whom Se Chan ditched,
arrives while they fight.)

926
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,460
- Another zombie is here.
- Hey.

927
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,280
- What?
- How can you ditch me like that?

928
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,080
- The situation is bad here.
- You guys are so mean.

929
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,550
Ji Hyo, I became a zombie.

930
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,550
- You?
- Yes.

931
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,550
They said he's a zombie.

932
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,260
- Why are you a zombie?
- He got infected.

933
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,000
I squeezed this out.

934
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,200
- I'm going to look for the vaccine.
- You need to take it now.

935
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,470
When did I get infected?

936
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,210
Did I get bitten?

937
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,270
I think I'm going to end up
becoming a zombie.

938
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,540
(He leaves
the safe zone by himself.)

939
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:27,450
(Outside the safe zone,
there are zombies everywhere.)

940
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,890
- The zombies...
- Gosh, that surprised me.

941
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,920
(That surprised me.)

942
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,730
There are so many outside.

943
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,630
- Really?
- You'll be eliminated...

944
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,730
if the zombies rip off
your name tag.

945
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,960
The zombies are different
from before.

946
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,290
- They're smarter.
- If we get our name tags...

947
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,560
ripped off by them, we're out.

948
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,290
- If they rip it off, we're out?
- Of course.

949
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,470
(You become a low-class zombie if
one of them rips your name tag off.)

950
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Then you become a zombie.

951
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,030
- Hold on. Se Chan...
- If they rip off your name tag,

952
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,170
you become a low-class zombie.

953
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,880
They can hear us.

954
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,000
- Look at them.
- They can hear us.

955
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,710
They're sensitive
to sound and smells.

956
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,800
(They can't come into
the safe zone.)

957
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,040
(Banging)

958
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,680
Stop it. Don't goof off like that.

959
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,890
Stop fooling around!

960
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,150
(I'm scared,
so stop fooling around.)

961
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,160
(Zombie lover, Mr. Jee, is fearless
thanks to the safe zone.)

962
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,780
- My gosh, Suk Jin is...
- In movies, people like him...

963
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,630
Let's wait for our chance
and push him out.

964
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,930
It'll be like the movies,
and you'll be the first to die.

965
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,560
(Charge!)

966
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,760
- Hold on.
- Push him out.

967
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,530
- Haha. Don't push me out.
- Push him out.

968
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,670
Push him out.

969
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,940
(They grab on to
the zombie lover...)

970
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,030
(and push him out
into the zombie den.)

971
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,000
- Let's do this.
- Push him out.

972
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,040
- Hey.
- Push him out.

973
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,000
- Push him out.
- Push him out.

974
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,250
(The zombies approach one at a time
when they hear the sound.)

975
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,010
We pushed him out.

976
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,310
Oh, my.

977
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,020
No.

978
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,050
No!

979
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,930
- No!
- They got him!

980
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,900
(The person in a green hat, Mr. Jee,
is being chased by zombies.)

981
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,400
- Oh, my!
- They ripped his name tag off.

982
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,430
- They ripped his name tag off.
- They ripped his name tag off.

983
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,090
No.

984
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,400
No!

985
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,470
(He's the 1st person to get eaten,)

986
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,470
(and the 1st person
to be sacrificed.)

987
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,600
- They ripped his name tag off.
- It's over.

988
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,800
- Is that it?
- It's over.

989
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,070
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was right in front of our eyes.

990
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,720
(The end.)

991
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,840
- What is this?
- It's over.

992
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,750
- What's happening to Suk Jin?
- What are we going to do?

993
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,650
- Suk Jin!
- My gosh.

994
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,050
I had no idea it would be like this.

995
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,610
- My gosh, that was scary.
- This...

996
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,280
We did this to him.

997
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,550
- It's not that.
- But he kept fooling around.

998
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,930
He kept playing games with them.

999
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,360
- They just ended him.
- Hey.

1000
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,820
- You guys...
- He's done for.

1001
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,060
- They completely devoured him.
- You guys...

1002
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,090
He kept goofing off.

1003
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,500
- I'm done. What happens next?
- So...

1004
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,940
My gosh, those punks.

1005
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,640
(It's only been 10 minutes since
they started, but he's a zombie.)

1006
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,250
Zombie. Big Nose. Zombie.

1007
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,000
(You scared me.)

1008
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,340
Zombie.

1009
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,540
Zombie. I'm a zombie.

1010
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,280
I'm Big Nose. I just got infected.

1011
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,340
(He tells everyone that he got
infected in case they didn't know.)

1012
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,550
My gosh. Zombie.

1013
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:49,930
Everyone, the zombie amongst you
can infect you in any way.

1014
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,350
- Really?
- You must look for the vaccine.

1015
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,560
Can we find a vaccine in here?

1016
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,590
There aren't any in here.

1017
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,630
- Really?
- We have to go out?

1018
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,640
We have to go out.

1019
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,290
We can't go out right now.

1020
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,060
- That zombie is the scariest.
- They can't come in.

1021
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,360
That zombie is the scariest.

1022
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,500
- He's afraid of that zombie.
- That zombie is the scariest.

1023
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,800
I'm really scared.

1024
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,540
If you give me hand sanitizer,

1025
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,840
I'll make them stop.

1026
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,180
- A zombie is...
- Okay.

1027
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,840
If someone gives me hand sanitizer.

1028
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,250
I get the hand sanitizer,

1029
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,150
- put it on, and yell "hurray".
- Put it on and help Se Chan,

1030
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,250
so he can come back here.

1031
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,260
If you shout "hurray",
you can stop them for 10 seconds.

1032
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,650
Find Se Chan first.

1033
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,460
Don't shut the door.

1034
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,030
We should.
We never know what will happen.

1035
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,260
- Just in case.
- They can't come in anyway.

1036
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,300
- Close it after I run away.
- Okay.

1037
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,300
- Okay. We'll leave it open.
- Okay.

1038
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,400
- Go.
- Go.

1039
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,170
(He barely took a step forward.)

1040
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,900
Go find Se Chan.

1041
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,230
(Screaming)

1042
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,610
- My gosh that scared me.
- You surprised me.

1043
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,650
- Hurry up.
- Come in!

1044
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,550
- Come in.
- Come in.

1045
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,750
Why are you locking the door?

1046
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,110
Why are you locking it?

1047
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,010
(Why did you lock the door?)

1048
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,360
- I'm alive.
- How did you get in here?

1049
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,480
- How did you come?
- How did you get in here?

1050
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,590
I'm alive.

1051
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,630
How did you get in here?

1052
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,780
- Where were you?
- I took the red potion.

1053
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,820
- A red potion?
- Yes.

1054
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,900
Hang on.

1055
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,260
Can high-class zombies
come into the safe zone?

1056
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,820
I heard it's a blue potion.

1057
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,130
No, it's red.

1058
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,940
I'm sure they said
the potion is blue.

1059
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,840
- I heard it's blue.
- What I had was red.

1060
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,530
What I heard was blue.

1061
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,730
What I had was red.

1062
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,400
(Se Chan says he took
the red vaccine. Is it true?)

1063
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,900
You should go check it. It's red.

1064
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,110
- Hang on.
- What?

1065
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,070
What is it?

1066
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,920
- What's that?
- Look at this.

1067
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,420
- What is it?
- Se Chan is back.

1068
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,340
(Jae Suk has some
mysterious file in his hands.)

1069
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,510
(The list of Reincarnation Campers?)

1070
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,420
I should take a look
around this place.

1071
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,800
I can't waste time
looking at the zombies there.

1072
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,590
(While they were preoccupied with
zombies, Jae Suk searched around.)

1073
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,500
What is this?

1074
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,530
The list of Reincarnation Campers?

1075
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,090
(He found the list of campers.)

1076
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,210
What is this?

1077
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,070
- What's that thing?
- What is it?

1078
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,400
Look.

1079
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,440
(In the list...)

1080
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,840
This is the list of
the Reincarnation Camp attendees.

1081
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,150
There are Human Antibody
and Parent Zombie.

1082
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,380
(There are Human Antibody
and Parent Zombie.)

1083
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,320
(Human, Human Antibody,
Parent Zombie)

1084
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,690
This is the list of
the Reincarnation Camp attendees.

1085
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,650
There are Human Antibody
and Parent Zombie.

1086
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,150
(Human Antibody and Parent Zombie?)

1087
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,050
- Parent Zombie?
- There's Human Antibody?

1088
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,300
Human Antibody...

1089
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,800
literally has an antibody...

1090
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,260
- Is it okay to get bitten?
- to Parent Zombie.

1091
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,070
And this is
the condition of winning.

1092
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,800
It's the condition
of winning for humans.

1093
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,280
We should find out Parent Zombie...

1094
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,880
- and eliminate it.
- We should get rid of it.

1095
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,670
Three of us will get
in the ambulance...

1096
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,840
that's coming at 4 p.m.

1097
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
So three humans will get
in the ambulance.

1098
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,050
And this is
what we should do to win.

1099
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,880
(Condition 1, Human Antibody
must get in the ambulance.)

1100
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,960
And Parent Zombie must
not be in the ambulance.

1101
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,360
(Humans win.)

1102
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,380
But...

1103
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,730
Low-class zombies
can't get in the ambulance.

1104
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,460
- Do we need to find Parent Zombie?
- Hang on.

1105
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,760
- Calm down.
- Okay.

1106
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,670
- I just asked one question.
- Don't get so excited.

1107
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,440
If you keep doing this,
we all will die.

1108
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,630
- Keep calm.
- Okay.

1109
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,800
- In short...
- Only three of us will survive?

1110
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,960
we just need to keep
Parent Zombie from the ambulance.

1111
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,130
(Protect Human Antibody
and eliminate Parent Zombie.)

1112
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,840
And Human Antibody is not safe.

1113
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,900
If Parent Zombie...

1114
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,250
can eliminate Human Antibody,

1115
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,420
- Is it over like that?
- the race is over.

1116
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,980
So we must stop that from happening.

1117
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,920
Human Antibody shouldn't
reveal its identity.

1118
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,150
Hang on. If Se Chan was infected,

1119
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,780
it means someone has been...

1120
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,320
- It means there's someone.
- with us the whole time.

1121
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,630
Something was done.

1122
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,860
SUNMI and Ji Hyo...

1123
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,320
- are his team.
- They are my team.

1124
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,960
(SUNMI and Ji Hyo were
in the same team with Se Chan.)

1125
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,460
- Then we should...
- What about the bus?

1126
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,840
I was sitting
next to Haha on the bus.

1127
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,460
(Haha was sitting
next to Se Chan on the bus.)

1128
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,980
I was sitting
next to Haha on the bus.

1129
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,010
(Me?)

1130
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,570
- It was Haha.
- Okay.

1131
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,010
Were you sitting with Haha
on the bus?

1132
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,650
Okay.

1133
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,480
- Go ahead and pick me.
- There are two zombies...

1134
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,710
I told you I'm human.

1135
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,840
There's one.

1136
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,820
- Don't regret your choice.
- We should go out.

1137
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,190
We should go out and find
the ticket to Judgment Stand.

1138
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,360
- I wasn't touching it.
- I guess you're right.

1139
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,590
For now,

1140
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,570
we should go out and get it.

1141
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,530
(They start to search around
the place, walking stealthily.)

1142
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,840
You're not Parent Zombie, are you?

1143
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,210
I'm nothing. I'm serious.

1144
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,110
Se Chan, come here.

1145
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,610
You were infected. It means...

1146
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,980
- there's something on your body...
- Is it checked?

1147
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,570
or your name tag.

1148
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,840
So the zombie did something...

1149
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,650
- to infect you.
- Exactly.

1150
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,860
What's the picture you got?

1151
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,980
- Is that it?
- SUNMI took this picture.

1152
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,320
SUNMI took this too.

1153
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,780
She took this picture.

1154
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,420
And there was something
strange about Haha.

1155
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,760
I was sitting here.

1156
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,460
But he told me to sit here instead.

1157
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,860
- Really?
- He kept saying that.

1158
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,170
That's not what Haha usually says.

1159
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,360
Haha is being strange.
There's Haha in the picture, right?

1160
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,130
- Haha is strange.
- We should find Haha.

1161
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,130
- Haha is in all the pictures.
- Wait.

1162
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,980
Hang on. Jong Kook,
we should check other pictures too.

1163
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,780
All the pictures have Haha in them.

1164
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,480
- His back and everything.
- Really?

1165
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,280
Once we find the Judgment Stand,

1166
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,650
we should put him on the stand.

1167
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,440
That's what I'm thinking about.

1168
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,980
(The members go out
and look for the Judgment Ticket.)

1169
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,530
What is this?
Hey, it says Vaccine Room.

1170
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,300
(Vaccine Room)

1171
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,920
(If you complete the mission
in the room, you get 1 vaccine.)

1172
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,960
- What do you mean?
- Hey, let's go in there.

1173
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,360
(Safe Zone, Vaccine Room)

1174
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,630
Hey, let's go in there.

1175
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,940
(They carefully open the door
of Vaccine Room.)

1176
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,610
- Look. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- You shouldn't make a sound.

1177
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,070
Low-class zombies
might come running.

1178
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,480
We should go get the vaccine.

1179
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,250
We shouldn't step
on the broken board.

1180
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,280
It's a mission.

1181
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,820
- Hang on.
- There are zombies.

1182
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,610
The potion is blue.

1183
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,050
(The potion is blue?)

1184
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,530
(Se Chan said he just
took the vaccine.)

1185
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,300
(And he said the potion was red.)

1186
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,130
The potion is blue.

1187
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,460
You're being really strange.

1188
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,230
- What's going on?
- My gosh.

1189
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,980
- I'm sure he's lying.
- I think so.

1190
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,150
I'm sure it was a lie.

1191
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,650
Let's go, Mr. High-class Zombie.

1192
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,940
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo is looking
for the Judgment Ticket.)

1193
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,480
(He walks carefully
holding his breath.)

1194
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,360
(Flinching)

1195
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,610
(Right at the moment!)

1196
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,610
(Kwang Soo found something
between two trees.)

1197
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,670
"If you insert the ticket, you can
reveal one person's identity."

1198
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,840
(He got the Judgment Ticket.)

1199
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:22,550
(With this ticket, he can
figure out one person's identity.)

1200
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,110
(He rushes to the safe zone
that has the Judgment Stand.)

1201
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,420
Was that the Judgment Stand?

1202
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,880
(He rushes to the safe zone
that has the Judgment Stand.)

1203
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,760
"If you insert the ticket, you can
reveal one person's identity."

1204
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,530
(He inserts the ticket.)

1205
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,030
(Number of humans, 8)

1206
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,590
(There are 8 humans?)

1207
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,590
Suk Jin is out.

1208
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,210
(There were 10 humans before.)

1209
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,630
One more human is infected.

1210
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,610
(Who's the additional zombie?)

1211
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,010
(High-class zombie)

1212
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,900
The Judgment Stand is open.

1213
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,380
Attendees of the Reincarnation Camp,
please gather around.

1214
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,420
You were here.

1215
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,190
- I found a ticket.
- It was you.

1216
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,650
I found a ticket and inserted it.

1217
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,920
- Did you find the ticket?
- I did.

1218
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,260
- What? 8 humans?
- There are only 8 humans.

1219
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,820
- You want to hide your identity.
- I know. He has changed.

1220
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,420
- He's changed.
- Because...

1221
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,960
One of them is Suk Jin.

1222
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,260
- And...
- And there's one more.

1223
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,170
- He became a high-class zombie.
- Okay. It's done.

1224
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,090
- Did you find the ticket?
- I found it.

1225
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,340
- He found the ticket...
- Okay.

1226
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,400
- and the zombie.
- I found the zombie too.

1227
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,840
The potion is blue.

1228
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,440
Let's begin the first judgment.

1229
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,440
What if I'm picked here?

1230
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,800
If you're picked
and turn out to be human,

1231
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,550
the ticket becomes invalid.

1232
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,340
There aren't many tickets.

1233
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,690
We should use this ticket carefully.

1234
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,940
(If they pick Parent Zombie,
humans win the race.)

1235
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,920
- I'm sure it's him.
- Write it down.

1236
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,190
- Se Chan is obviously a zombie.
- Write down Se Chan's name.

1237
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,260
- Can I write a name I want?
- Just write Se Chan's name.

1238
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,380
I witnessed it first hand.

1239
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,000
I saw it.

1240
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,030
The result is in.

1241
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,360
Out of 11 votes,

1242
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,500
Se Chan got nine votes.
Please get in there.

1243
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,070
I knew it. I'm sure it's Se Chan.

1244
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,900
(Se Chan is the one
to go in the Judgment Stand.)

1245
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,800
- Okay.
- He said he had a red potion.

1246
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,070
If Se Chan turns out to be human,

1247
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,710
this ticket will be invalid.

1248
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,900
What if he's a zombie?

1249
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,280
If he's a zombie, he will
turn into a low-class zombie.

1250
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,570
And he will be dragged out.

1251
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,050
I said I had the red potion.

1252
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,920
It should've been a blue potion.

1253
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,650
- There's a room with a red potion.
- What?

1254
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,030
There's a room with a red potion.

1255
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,320
Please show us Se Chan's identity.

1256
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,630
(If what he says is true,
he must've been cured.)

1257
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,900
1, 2...

1258
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,000
(Se Chan got the most votes.
What's his identity?)

1259
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Three.

1260
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:21,760
Three.

1261
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,230
He's a zombie.

1262
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,510
(Zombie!)

1263
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,570
- He's a zombie.
- Look at him.

1264
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,610
(Se Chan was a high-class zombie.)

1265
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,980
I need the vaccine.

1266
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:35,780
(After Se Chan got infected, he ran
around looking for the vaccine.)

1267
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,250
I'm infected.

1268
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,050
(He failed to find
the vaccine in 10 minutes.)

1269
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,360
(And he became a high-class zombie.)

1270
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,000
Is it a bad one?

1271
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,570
I knew it.

1272
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,170
Can we continue now?

1273
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,630
- You zombie.
- My gosh.

1274
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,710
- What happens to Se Chan now?
- He's a low-class zombie.

1275
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,170
He said there's a room
with red potion.

1276
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,360
He's become a low-class zombie.

1277
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,170
- Am I leaving just like this?
- He'll stay with Suk Jin.

1278
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,210
I can get out of here
and walk myself.

1279
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,050
- No.
- He's a low-class zombie now.

1280
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,210
Are they dragging me like this?

1281
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,210
He's a low-class zombie.

1282
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,150
If he gets caught, does he
become a low-class zombie?

1283
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,510
So there's a high-class zombie...

1284
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,880
- in here.
- There's one left.

1285
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,110
And the high-class zombie
will do something to us.

1286
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,420
We should be careful.

1287
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,300
Now I want you to go out
to find the next ticket and vaccine.

1288
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,070
- Vaccine?
- Let's go together.

1289
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,170
We should go out again.

1290
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,670
- I don't want to go out.
- What? There's no zombie out there.

1291
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,300
(While there was no one around,
the zombies disappeared.)

1292
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,630
I think we can go out.

1293
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,710
- Now...
- Suk Jin.

1294
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,300
I'm sorry.

1295
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,150
(Suk Jin who lost
his name tag to the zombies...)

1296
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,710
(has become the low-class zombie.)

1297
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,320
(This is what a comedian with
29 years of experience has got.)

1298
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,050
Big Nose.

1299
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,820
(He runs into his friend
for the first time.)

1300
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,050
Nice to meet you.

1301
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,400
Isn't he Suk Jin?

1302
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,170
(Big Nose Zombie is showing
his enthusiastic performance.)

1303
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,340
Me.

1304
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,940
Why do you keep wearing
makeup since last week?

1305
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,510
(His face looks good
with the zombie makeup.)

1306
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,980
- I'm a low-class zombie.
- Zombie?

1307
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,980
(Dumbfounded)

1308
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,750
(Haha is looking
for the Judgment Ticket.)

1309
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,590
(What is this place?)

1310
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,150
(The container is full of zombies.)

1311
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,590
(Is there a Judgment Ticket
in this place?)

1312
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,570
(My goodness.)

1313
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,440
(He opens the door carefully.)

1314
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,170
(Clattering)

1315
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:42,170
(The zombies respond
to the sound immediately.)

1316
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,880
(They walk slowly toward the sound.)

1317
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,510
(The zombies go into the room
following the sound.)

1318
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,650
(When the zombies are in the room,)

1319
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,150
(he closes the door right away.)

1320
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,530
(Rattling)

1321
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,570
(Let us out!)

1322
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,840
(Haha blocks the door
with desperation.)

1323
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,130
(Meanwhile, the zombies calm down.)

1324
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,940
(He used his quick wits
to avert a crisis.)

1325
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,170
(Is there something in here?)

1326
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,550
(When Haha finds something,)

1327
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,710
(the zombies start
swarming the place again.)

1328
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,050
(Startled)

1329
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,190
(My goodness.)

1330
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,260
What is it?

1331
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
What is this place?

1332
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,670
(What is this place?)

1333
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,170
(What is the purpose of this place?)

1334
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,340
(While Kwang Soo is scared,)

1335
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,730
(Haha enters a mysterious room.)

1336
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,440
(What is this room?)

1337
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,070
(Vaccine Room)

1338
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,150
(You succeed
if you retrieve the vaccine...)

1339
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,440
(without sounding the bells.)

1340
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,780
(So that the zombies
won't swarm in,)

1341
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,690
(avoid sounding the bells...)

1342
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:04,900
(and retrieve the vaccine.)

1343
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,150
Okay. There is the blue potion.

1344
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,300
(How do I get through this?)

1345
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,610
That jerk! How dare he rip off...

1346
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,380
my name tag?

1347
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,780
(Haha moves past the lasers
carefully.)

1348
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,420
(He keeps his movements minimal
to avoid making a sound.)

1349
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,690
(The vaccine
is right in front of him!)

1350
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,110
(Ringing)

1351
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,190
(Haha touched the bell
right in front of the vaccine.)

1352
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,480
My name tag.

1353
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,820
Big Nose.

1354
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,630
(The zombies swarm like crazy.)

1355
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,590
(Groaning)

1356
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,360
(No, I am almost there.)

1357
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,300
Jeon So...

1358
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:52,840
Jeon So...

1359
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,670
Jeon So...

1360
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,980
(His zombie performance
is cringeworthy.)

1361
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,670
Jeon So Min.

1362
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,480
(What is up with him?)

1363
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,320
(Groaning)

1364
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,780
Can't I go inside?

1365
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,110
My goodness.

1366
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:11,030
(He retrieves the vaccine
while Big Nose Zombie struggles.)

1367
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,230
I don't need to take it now, right?

1368
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,260
I don't need to take it now, right?

1369
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,630
(Big Nose Zombie continues
to put on a performance,)

1370
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,610
(but the reality hits him
when Kwang Soo takes out a camera.)

1371
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,610
(Embarrassed)

1372
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,510
(I want to be alone.)

1373
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,440
(Let's take a photo together.)

1374
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,710
Cheese.

1375
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,010
(Laughing)

1376
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,610
(Haha bursts out laughing
without thinking.)

1377
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,860
(Big Nose Zombie awakens.)

1378
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,900
(The zombies who were outside join.)

1379
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,500
- Hurray!
- Okay!

1380
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,340
(So Min quickly escapes
after using the hand sanitizer.)

1381
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:57,030
Haha! Rip it off!
Rip it off! Rip it off!

1382
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,840
(The zombies become mad
upon seeing the prey.)

1383
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,980
Rip it off!

1384
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,480
(The zombies surround Haha.)

1385
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,550
Rip it off! Rip it off!

1386
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,650
Hurray!

1387
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,610
Hurray!

1388
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,920
(The zombies pause
due to the hand sanitizer.)

1389
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,820
(Haha escapes with the vaccine.)

1390
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,630
(Thank goodness.)

1391
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,030
(ZICO is looking
for the Judgment Ticket.)

1392
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,630
(He finds something.)

1393
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,440
What is this?

1394
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,840
(He found the UV flashlight!)

1395
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,510
What is this?

1396
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,340
(What is this flashlight for?)

1397
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,400
What is this?

1398
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,480
It's hot.

1399
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,710
(Meanwhile, Se Chan Zombie
got his makeup done.)

1400
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,440
Stay in the shade.

1401
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,110
Stay in the shade. It's hot.

1402
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,980
The zombies up there have it easy.

1403
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,260
They have it easy
due to the air conditioner.

1404
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,260
(The cool working environment)

1405
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,420
It's cool there.

1406
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:55,920
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo
run into each other.)

1407
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,400
- Did you find a hint?
- No.

1408
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,730
- I don't get what's going on.
- We need to find a hint.

1409
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,130
I don't get what's going on.

1410
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,510
(Laughing)

1411
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,280
- You are tired, right?
- Yes.

1412
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,750
Wake up! What are you doing?

1413
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,340
- Wake up!
- But...

1414
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,820
- I will try.
- When did you go to bed last night?

1415
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,880
- I went to bed in the morning.
- For goodness' sake. Drink coffee.

1416
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,650
- All right.
- You will be a zombie at this rate.

1417
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,880
All right. I haven't become one.

1418
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,260
If you don't wake up,

1419
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:23,090
you will have to wear makeup...

1420
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:24,860
and walk around
without a moment of rest.

1421
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,000
- Get ahold of yourself.
- Okay. Okay.

1422
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,690
SUNMI, did you find something?

1423
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,400
- No, I didn't. But there is...
- Are you a zombie?

1424
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,210
a setup like "Mission: Impossible".

1425
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,510
<i>Why are you so down?</i>

1426
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,010
<i>What's the problem? Say something</i>

1427
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,150
<i>Why are you so down?</i>

1428
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,010
<i>Why are you so down?</i>

1429
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,320
(He is 5 seconds from passing out
due to the heat.)

1430
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,090
A fling?

1431
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,090
(This zombie is nosy.)

1432
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,510
- A fling?
- No.

1433
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,650
- Love.
- A fling?

1434
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,510
- No fling. Love.
- A crush.

1435
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,090
A crush.

1436
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,690
- Gosh, we will burn to death.
- What?

1437
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:00,960
(These two zombies are exhausted
due to the heat.)

1438
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,900
Zombies like shades too.

1439
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,860
(Kwang Soo and Sae Ho
are searching diligently.)

1440
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,570
I think there was something here.

1441
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,570
What?

1442
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,730
(A glass bottle?)

1443
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,800
(A mysterious note
is inside the glass bottle!)

1444
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,570
(While Kwang Soo is looking away,)

1445
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:24,010
(he takes out the note...)

1446
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,780
(and leaves the glass bottle.)

1447
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,880
- What are you doing?
- There is a glass bottle.

1448
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,300
- What?
- A glass bottle.

1449
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,550
- What is it?
- A glass bottle. It was here.

1450
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:35,800
It has the R sticker.

1451
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,570
(What is this in his back pocket?)

1452
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,500
Hold on.

1453
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,070
What is it?

1454
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,070
Sae Ho, we came
all the way here together.

1455
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,260
- Hold on.
- Don't be like that.

1456
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,400
- What is it?
- All right.

1457
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,670
We can't show Jae Suk.
Let's take a look by ourselves.

1458
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,570
- What is it?
- There he comes.

1459
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,010
I will show you. I mean it.

1460
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,070
Stay with me, okay?

1461
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,380
Pretend not to know anything.
We can't show Jae Suk.

1462
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,150
- I will show you.
- You guys, come here.

1463
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,380
- What did you find?
- It was here.

1464
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,920
There is nothing inside.

1465
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,460
- Let's see.
- It looks like this.

1466
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,150
(He shows Jae Suk
the empty glass bottle.)

1467
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,190
- I bet someone ate what's inside.
- That must be the case.

1468
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,960
I bet someone took what's inside.

1469
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,320
Maybe it was a potion.

1470
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,690
I don't know.

1471
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:10,800
(Sae Ho leaves
because he is nervous.)

1472
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,030
Maybe someone took a potion.

1473
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,360
Sae Ho put something
in his back pocket.

1474
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,530
He told me he will show me
if I don't say anything to you.

1475
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,610
What are you talking about?

1476
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,170
- He put it in his back pocket.
- Let's see.

1477
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,900
Why do I need to share it?

1478
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,010
Are you going to be that way?

1479
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,440
We need to survive this together.
Are you human or not?

1480
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,610
- I am human.
- You are human.

1481
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,420
Jae Suk, he keeps farting
as he passes the zombies.

1482
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:31,110
- He actually farts.
- What?

1483
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:32,550
- Are you going to be that way?
- Should I fart right now?

1484
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,280
- I can fart right now.
- Do it.

1485
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,650
- Is it okay if I fart?
- Listen.

1486
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,820
I can fart right now.

1487
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,230
- I can fart right now.
- He keeps doing that.

1488
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,690
(He gathers his energy
and passes gas.)

1489
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:42,730
- Are you crazy?
- It's ridiculous.

1490
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,000
I told you that I can fart.

1491
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,130
- Are you crazy?
- It's ridiculous.

1492
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,440
You should go to the restroom
and check.

1493
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,900
Judging from the sound...

1494
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,300
- I am 100 percent sure.
- No.

1495
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,880
Hold on. So Min is coming.
Let's hurry up and take a look.

1496
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,010
(So Min smells something
and approaches them.)

1497
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,820
(What does it say?)

1498
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,980
(Instructions on the Photo Room)

1499
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,610
(If you insert a Polaroid,)

1500
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:05,510
(you can check how many zombies
are in the photo.)

1501
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,050
The guide, SUNMI, can take photos.

1502
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,420
(SUNMI had a Polaroid camera.)

1503
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,920
(She took photos on the bus.)

1504
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,170
(She continued to take photos
upon arrival.)

1505
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,570
If we insert a Polaroid,

1506
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,340
we can see how many zombies
are in the photo.

1507
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,530
- Where are the photos?
- Sae Ho.

1508
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:21,170
- At the cafe...
- The photos...

1509
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:23,070
- I don't have any photos.
- I know where they are!

1510
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,730
Earlier, I saw... I am not joking.

1511
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:26,170
There is a photo studio.

1512
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,780
- I saw it.
- I saw it too. I know where it is.

1513
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,840
It was closed.

1514
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:31,210
What is this place?

1515
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,280
(10 minutes ago)

1516
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,440
(Jae Suk found the Photo Room
in a secluded place!)

1517
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,750
In and out?

1518
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,820
What is this?

1519
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,150
What does that mean?

1520
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,590
(Inserting a photo helps you discern
who the zombies are.)

1521
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,030
Let's go.

1522
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,860
(The four of them head
to the Photo Room.)

1523
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,690
(She finds a mysterious tablet PC!)

1524
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,450
(She carefully opens it.)

1525
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,200
I found something.

1526
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:16,570
(With a scream,)

1527
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,760
My goodness.

1528
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,900
(SUNMI becomes a low-class zombie!)

1529
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,740
I will insert it first.

1530
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,840
Will you see how it works? Okay.

1531
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,570
(Jae Suk inserts the photo he had.)

1532
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,900
Does he have to see the result
by himself?

1533
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,110
How many zombies are there?

1534
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,700
- I think he can see it with us.
- I couldn't find it.

1535
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,150
I need to find the ticket to know.

1536
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:36,340
(How many zombies are
in the group photo of 12 people?)

1537
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,840
He said something else.

1538
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,380
- It's out.
- No way.

1539
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,780
- What is it?
- Jae Suk.

1540
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,090
(There are 6 zombies.)

1541
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,260
- There are 6 zombies.
- 6 zombies?

1542
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,450
- What are we going to do?
- Really?

1543
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:49,760
- How...
- Look at this.

1544
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,360
There are six zombies.

1545
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,700
- Then...
- So many of us are zombies.

1546
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,900
- There are six zombies.
- This is insane.

1547
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,110
That means
there are six people left.

1548
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,030
This is insane.

1549
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,470
- Why are there so many zombies?
- I guess...

1550
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:00,800
more people got infected.

1551
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,200
Did more people get infected?

1552
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,840
I guess Parent Zombie got to work.

1553
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,670
Did more people get infected?

1554
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,240
- Se Chan,
- There are six zombies in here.

1555
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,880
- Suk Jin...
- Suk Jin...

1556
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,990
and Se Chan.
Then there are four more zombies.

1557
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,880
There is 1 Parent Zombie,
so 3 people got infected.

1558
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,380
There is everyone
in the photo, right?

1559
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,950
Do Hyun, insert your photo.

1560
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:20,450
Insert your photo.

1561
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,400
- Insert your photo.
- My goodness.

1562
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,900
Those who became zombies...

1563
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,760
could pretend to be not infected.

1564
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,970
- That's right.
- This is insane.

1565
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,470
(There are 9 people in the photo.)

1566
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,700
I was expectant.

1567
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,010
Did I tell you about it?

1568
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,650
- Many people are in the photo.
- Is the result out?

1569
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,110
Is the result out?

1570
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,720
Did you get the number?

1571
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,340
- 5 zombies.
- 5 zombies?

1572
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,880
(There are 5 zombies in the photo!)

1573
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,820
- Hold on.
- Who aren't in this photo?

1574
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,190
- Let's see.
- Five zombies?

1575
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,650
Let's check.

1576
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,700
(The number of zombies: 5)

1577
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,700
Put an X.

1578
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,720
- Name those who aren't in here.
- Those who aren't in here.

1579
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,300
I am not in the photo.

1580
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,700
- I am not in the photo.
- I am not in it either.

1581
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,800
- Jae Suk isn't in it.
- I am not in it.

1582
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,030
- You are in it.
- Am I in it?

1583
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,300
You are in it.

1584
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,800
- You are barely visible.
- How about ZICO?

1585
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,900
- ZICO is in it.
- ZICO is in it.

1586
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,170
- Se Chan isn't in it.
- And Do Hyun is in there.

1587
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,300
Se Chan isn't in it.

1588
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,950
Se Chan is a zombie.

1589
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,800
- Hold on.
- If there are five zombies,

1590
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,380
those who aren't in the photo
are human.

1591
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,420
- That's right.
- What?

1592
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,570
Those who aren't in the photo
are human.

1593
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:16,610
Kwang Soo, you are human.

1594
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,610
- It's 100 percent.
- Se Chan isn't in this photo.

1595
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:20,860
If we include Se Chan,
we get six zombies.

1596
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,610
- You aren't in this photo.
- No.

1597
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,860
If we think about it...

1598
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,920
Kwang Soo isn't a zombie.
I am not a zombie.

1599
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,700
(If you exclude Se Chan
who is a zombie,)

1600
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,300
(Kwang Soo and Sae Ho are human.)

1601
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,900
This is bad.

1602
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,900
(The zombies are multiplying fast.)

1603
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,260
The Judgment Stand is open.

1604
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,400
Attendees of Reincarnation Camp,
please gather around.

1605
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,050
5 out of 8 people.

1606
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,780
I checked another photo.

1607
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,820
Really? Let's see.

1608
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,150
- But...
- The number is three.

1609
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,190
It's a photo of 6 people,
but there are only 3 zombies.

1610
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:52,450
(There are only 3 zombies!)

1611
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,880
(Among the 6 in the photo)

1612
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,690
There are Se Chan...

1613
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,030
- and Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1614
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,030
(Exclude Se Chan and Suk Jin
as they became zombies.)

1615
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,300
- I am human.
- Kwang Soo.

1616
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,530
- No way.
- Then Jae Suk...

1617
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,760
(Exclude Kwang Soo
since he was proved to be human.)

1618
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,760
There is a zombie
among Jae Suk, Jong Kook, and Haha.

1619
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,360
There is a zombie
among those three.

1620
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,670
- I am human.
- Kwang Soo.

1621
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:11,670
- No way.
- Then Jae Suk...

1622
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,300
- There is a zombie among them.
- It's Jae Suk!

1623
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,780
- I am not a zombie.
- Jae Suk and Haha...

1624
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,470
- Jae Suk.
- I told you earlier...

1625
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,300
that I am not a zombie.

1626
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,740
Haha and Jong Kook are suspicious.

1627
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,010
Haha and Jong Kook.

1628
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:23,550
I guess Jae Suk isn't a zombie.

1629
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,090
Let's have a vote.

1630
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,450
- You could be someone special.
- There are six humans.

1631
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,990
There are six humans.

1632
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,150
Where is SUNMI?

1633
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:31,450
SUNMI got infected.

1634
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:32,530
- She got infected.
- What?

1635
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,030
- SUNMI got infected.
- Jae Suk, she is walking around...

1636
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,820
- in the zombie makeup.
- She got infected.

1637
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,300
- SUNMI did?
- Yes.

1638
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,130
- When did that happen?
- She got infected.

1639
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,300
SUNMI got infected.

1640
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,260
- Really?
- SUNMI got infected.

1641
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,670
- Whom should we vote for?
- Jae Suk.

1642
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,740
Here is what I think.

1643
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,950
Pick one
among Jae Suk, Jong Kook, and me.

1644
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,820
- Okay.
- But I am not a zombie.

1645
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,380
Should I vote for Haha?

1646
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,240
(There is 1 zombie among
Jae Suk, Jong Kook, and Haha.)

1647
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,340
I honestly don't know
whom to vote for.

1648
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,380
- Me neither.
- I don't have a clue.

1649
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,190
We need to vote for someone
who has to be a zombie...

1650
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,820
and take him out.

1651
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,550
I really don't know.

1652
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,300
(Among the three of them,
who could be the zombie?)

1653
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,030
The result is out.
A member received five votes.

1654
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:14,840
(A member received 5 votes.)

1655
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,990
Jong Kook, please enter.

1656
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,940
- Is it me?
- Jong Kook,

1657
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,900
(Jong Kook received
5 out of 9 votes.)

1658
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,200
You received a lot of votes.

1659
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,470
Jong Kook...

1660
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:25,900
(Jong Kook went around by himself
away from the members.)

1661
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,050
(Did Jong Kook roam the place
as if it's an amusement park...)

1662
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,920
(because he is a zombie?)

1663
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,490
Jong Kook.

1664
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,490
(Could either Jae Suk or Haha
be a zombie?)

1665
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,920
If Jong Kook isn't a zombie...

1666
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,550
If Jong Kook isn't a zombie,
we can narrow down the candidates.

1667
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:38,630
(If Jong Kook isn't a zombie,
we can narrow down the candidates.)

1668
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,260
Let's check.

1669
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,800
Please.

1670
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,630
Jong Kook is...

1671
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:47,570
(Jong Kook is...)

1672
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:50,800
1, 2, 3.

1673
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,360
(Is Jong Kook a zombie or human?)

1674
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,380
Three.

1675
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,050
(Jong Kook is a high-class zombie!)

1676
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:00,820
We did it!

1677
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,090
- We almost made a big mistake.
- All right.

1678
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:05,280
(They can't believe
Jong Kook was a zombie.)

1679
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,590
(We almost made a big mistake.)

1680
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,090
We almost made a big mistake.

1681
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,880
It's no wonder he kept saying
he didn't get the blue potion.

1682
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,550
A high-class zombie.

1683
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,760
He kept saying
he didn't get the blue potion.

1684
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,800
(Jong Kook was looking for a hint.)

1685
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,030
No way. No way.

1686
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,030
(The band let him know
that he became infected.)

1687
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,010
Oh, no. I became infected.

1688
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:28,510
(Take the vaccine in 10 minutes
or become a high-class zombie.)

1689
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,700
(In the end,
he failed to get the vaccine.)

1690
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:35,150
(That way, Jong Kook became
a high-class zombie.)

1691
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,490
I told you I am not a zombie.

1692
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,740
- I am human.
- He became a low-class zombie.

1693
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,360
- Jong Kook.
- That's bad news.

1694
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,490
All right. Neither Haha...

1695
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:42,720
- nor Jae Suk is a zombie.
- Neither one of them is a zombie.

1696
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,880
- No.
- How do you know?

1697
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,380
- Neither one of them is a zombie.
- How do you know?

1698
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,400
There were three zombies
in Do Hyun's photo.

1699
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,670
- Suk Jin, Se Chan, Jong Kook.
- You are right!

1700
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,900
- He isn't a zombie.
- Right?

1701
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,170
- Haha and Jae Suk are human.
- All right.

1702
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,260
- Let's go.
- You are right.

1703
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,300
(ZICO is thinking hard.)

1704
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,570
Jae Suk, can you show me...

1705
00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,630
the photo?

1706
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:02,570
(He shines the UV flashlight
on the photo.)

1707
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,400
Let me see it.

1708
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,650
- Jae Suk.
- Hey.

1709
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,420
- There are words.
- What?

1710
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:09,780
- What does it say?
- Look.

1711
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,920
Thank goodness.

1712
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,450
(They shine the UV flashlight.)

1713
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,450
There we go. What does it say?

1714
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,530
(They find words that were invisible
to the naked eye.)

1715
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,760
(Instructions on the Photo Room)

1716
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,700
(The number of Human Antibody
and Parent Zombie...)

1717
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,700
(are written with a UV pen and
can be seen with a UV flashlight.)

1718
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,670
- What does it say?
- Two.

1719
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,990
The number of special beings, two.

1720
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,470
- That's number two, right?
- Are there words?

1721
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:28,590
I think it's number two.

1722
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:32,260
(The number of special beings: 2)

1723
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:35,110
- The number of special beings, 0.
- 0.

1724
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,110
(The number of special beings: 0)

1725
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,610
The special beings are
Parent Zombie and...

1726
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,570
They could also be Human Antibody.

1727
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:43,610
Then...

1728
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,090
Let's find the ones who overlap.

1729
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,190
There are no special beings
in this photo.

1730
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:47,650
We can exclude the ones
in this photo.

1731
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,630
Let's exclude them.

1732
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,530
(Zombie)

1733
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,820
The remaining ones are
Ji Hyo, ZICO, So Min...

1734
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,760
(The special being candidates are
Ji Hyo, ZICO, So Min, and Do Hyun!)

1735
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,400
(Human Antibody and Parent Zombie
are among them.)

1736
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,010
(Suk Jin, Se Chan, SUNMI, and
Jong Kook are low-class zombies.)

1737
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:06,110
(1 Parent Zombie and
1 high-class zombie are unknown.)

1738
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,280
The ambulance
will arrive in 30 minutes.

1739
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,900
(The ambulance
will arrive in 30 minutes.)

1740
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,070
(Jong Kook runs
to the makeup station.)

1741
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:18,110
Hey!

1742
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,490
(Jong Kook meets up
with Parent Zombie...)

1743
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:23,280
(and hands something over.)

1744
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:27,400
(Parent Zombie brings it back
to the container.)

1745
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,590
(Hidden from the others' eyes,)

1746
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:33,900
(Parent Zombie enters
the secret place.)

1747
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,360
(But...)

1748
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,670
(what is this place?)

1749
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,800
(There are 12 boxes
inside the room!)

1750
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:44,670
(Each box has a member's name tag.)

1751
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:49,070
(Parent Zombie can infect a member
by putting an object...)

1752
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:52,610
(he or she touched in a box
in the Infection Room.)

1753
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:57,360
(The object Jong Kook
handed over...)

1754
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,800
(goes into Kwang Soo's box.)

1755
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,740
- So Kwang Soo is definitely human.
- He is definitely human.

1756
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,800
(Kwang Soo is infected.)

1757
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,800
What?

1758
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:11,940
What? Did you get infected?

1759
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,030
(No way.)

1760
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:14,380
Did you?

1761
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,840
(Kwang Soo now needs to take
the vaccine in 10 minutes.)

1762
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,280
Did you get infected?

1763
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,510
(Haha distances himself right away.)

1764
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:20,820
(The zombies hear the sound
and approach them.)

1765
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,380
<i>Why would you leave me?</i>

1766
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,490
(Jae Suk quickly leaves.)

1767
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:25,740
There must be a way.

1768
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:26,820
Give me the vaccine.

1769
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,950
Go to the Vaccine Room.

1770
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,690
See if you can get it
at the Vaccine Room.

1771
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,200
I will wait here and give it to you
if you fail.

1772
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,650
- Where is it?
- It's right here.

1773
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,800
It's right there.

1774
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,940
Gosh, what did I do to get infected?

1775
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,990
(Good luck, Kwang Soo.)

1776
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,380
Here it is.

1777
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,800
(Take the steps from 1 to 5.)

1778
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,380
(You can retrieve the vaccine
if you pass without breaking them.)

1779
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,070
(This is bad.)

1780
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,780
Please. This is my last chance.

1781
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,650
It's nearly done.

1782
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,590
(He passes the 1st step.)

1783
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:12,530
(He moves his foot to the 2nd step.)

1784
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:13,990
(Breaking)

1785
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:18,400
(The dream of vaccine shatters
like the step beneath him.)

1786
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:21,030
(Pounding)

1787
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,800
(The zombies heard the sound
and came.)

1788
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,570
(This is a disaster.)

1789
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,690
You failed.

1790
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:35,280
Come on out.

1791
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,900
(Ji Hyo walks around
without making a sound.)

1792
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:44,570
(Hurray.)

1793
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:48,740
What is this?

1794
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,740
(She finds something.)

1795
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:54,900
(She finds the vaccine
that was hidden.)

1796
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:56,780
It's a potion.

1797
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,900
(She retrieves the vaccine.)

1798
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,320
How do you know if you are infected?

1799
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,010
(What is Ji Hyo's identity?)

1800
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:06,860
I am not Parent Zombie.

1801
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,760
- I really am not.
- I know you are.

1802
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,360
I know you are.

1803
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,650
- What if I'm Human Antibody?
- Forget it. You're Parent Zombie.

1804
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:21,590
(Could So Min be
Human Antibody?)

1805
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:27,900
(For the humans to win,
Human Antibody has to survive.)

1806
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,380
(So Min has been quiet.
Is she really Human Antibody?)

1807
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,550
- What if I'm Human Antibody?
- Forget it. You're Parent Zombie.

1808
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:35,570
Jae Suk.

1809
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:37,880
What if I'm Human Antibody?

1810
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:40,050
- I'm Human Antibody.
- What?

1811
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,380
- I'm Human Antibody.
- You are?

1812
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,550
(So Min tries to convince Sae Ho
that she is Human Antibody.)

1813
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,420
Then should I help So Min?

1814
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,150
You're Human Antibody?

1815
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,220
(Do you mean it?)

1816
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,320
Did the staff give you something
before we began?

1817
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,590
You can't ask that.

1818
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:54,360
- I'll be honest.
- I can't?

1819
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,440
To tell you the truth,
I came 30 minutes early.

1820
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,170
I was told to come by 9 a.m.

1821
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,030
You guys came at 9:30 a.m., right?
I came at 9 a.m.

1822
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,940
What does that have to do with this?

1823
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:04,400
You can't say that.
You'll hurt her feelings.

1824
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,880
Then what should I say?
I don't have much experience.

1825
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:10,240
(Right then,
Do Hyun and ZICO join them.)

1826
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:11,720
- You know...
- What is it?

1827
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,590
(ZICO approaches Sae Ho
out of nowhere.)

1828
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,360
Anyway, I'm not Parent Zombie.

1829
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,420
(Knowing ZICO's intention,
So Min disappears.)

1830
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,220
Okay. I'm not Parent Zombie anyway.

1831
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,030
- She's suspicious.
- She's the most suspicious.

1832
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:21,360
- I know. She's acting strange.
- She's suspicious.

1833
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,360
The thing is, there's no reason
why she'd be so upset about this.

1834
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,030
You don't watch our show
a lot, do you?

1835
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,800
I usually get even more upset
than this.

1836
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,670
I tell many petty lies,

1837
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:34,110
but this is big.
I don't lie about these things.

1838
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,300
- ZICO might be a zombie.
- Jae Suk.

1839
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:37,950
Stay away from So Min.

1840
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,780
Why me? Gosh, this is
driving me crazy.

1841
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,320
Why do you always suspect me?

1842
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,490
You guys always think it's me.

1843
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:46,590
This is frustrating.

1844
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,360
There she goes again.

1845
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,950
Gosh, not again.

1846
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:50,990
- I mean...
- Get up.

1847
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,590
Don't be lying on the ground.
Get up.

1848
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,490
- I know you're innocent, but...
- There she goes again.

1849
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,340
Zombies are getting aggressive.

1850
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,700
Be especially cautious.

1851
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,800
What? What's that sound?

1852
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:07,200
(I'd better be careful.)

1853
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,380
(Do Hyun is one of the people
suspected to have a special role.)

1854
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,670
(Before he even gets to
open his hand sanitizer,)

1855
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:17,840
(a swarm of zombies
starts coming at him.)

1856
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,880
(The zombies become
more and more aggressive.)

1857
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,720
(In the end, Do Hyun gets caught.)

1858
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:33,470
(Do Hyun's name tag is
ripped off by the zombies.)

1859
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:36,700
(He turns into a low-class zombie.)

1860
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,700
(The zombies are
filled with confidence.)

1861
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,470
What are you doing?
Why are you ripping it off?

1862
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,300
Hurray!

1863
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,200
What's going on?

1864
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,510
(Sae Ho turns into
a low-class zombie...)

1865
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,740
(because he didn't use
a hand sanitizer.)

1866
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:53,110
(Meanwhile, Haha is
surrounded by zombies.)

1867
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:57,590
(He is the meanest zombie
around here.)

1868
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:59,860
It's fine as long as the name tag
isn't ripped off, right?

1869
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,260
(Jong Kook slaps Haha.)

1870
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,700
I won't rip it off.

1871
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,070
(The mean zombies try to make Haha
make a sound.)

1872
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:05,220
(Haha makes a sound.)

1873
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,030
(As soon as he makes a sound,
his name tag is ripped off.)

1874
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:11,530
(After being teased the whole time,
Haha turns into a low-class zombie.)

1875
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:12,940
This is our chance.

1876
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,170
(Kwang Soo has become
a high-class zombie.)

1877
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:15,630
Surround him.

1878
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:17,740
Hey!

1879
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,740
- Guys, let go of him.
- Hey!

1880
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,280
Let go of him.

1881
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,240
(The zombies follow
Se Chan's order right away.)

1882
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,320
- What?
- I've been infected.

1883
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,220
Guys, get him. Squeeze him.

1884
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:33,900
(The high-class zombie, Kwang Soo,
turns into a low-class zombie.)

1885
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,090
But I was infected...

1886
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,420
It's almost over,
and I have to put on makeup?

1887
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,420
Come here.

1888
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,260
- Squeeze him.
- Who bit me for real?

1889
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,400
Who bit me for real? Darn it.

1890
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,630
I have four teeth marks.

1891
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,030
Do you want one more?

1892
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:51,400
- I'm infected too, right?
- Yes.

1893
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,880
(Se Chan is punished.)

1894
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,110
Guys, surround him!

1895
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:59,320
I'm already a zombie! I'm a zombie!

1896
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:01,610
I'm already a zombie!

1897
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,760
(They welcome him into the gang.)

1898
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,950
Leave him alone.

1899
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:06,720
Guys, leave him alone.

1900
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:08,420
(Kwang Soo kicks the zombies.)

1901
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:11,070
- You mean zombies.
- Good job, guys.

1902
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:14,030
- I'm already a zombie.
- Everyone, follow me.

1903
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,130
(They all follow Se Chan.)

1904
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,200
What is this?

1905
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:19,670
- Are you their leader or something?
- I'm their leader.

1906
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,010
Everyone, walk slowly.

1907
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,800
Slowly.

1908
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:28,820
(There are only 4 people left.)

1909
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,840
(Only 10 minutes remain.)

1910
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,550
(He has to hurry up and find
the Judgment Ticket.)

1911
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,550
(He enters the zombie container
to find the last Judgment Ticket.)

1912
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:44,570
(There are only 4 members left.)

1913
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,740
(He walks all the way in,
but he finds nothing.)

1914
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:04,090
(He finds a fake wall
at the end of the corridor.)

1915
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,510
I found something.

1916
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,280
What is this?

1917
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:14,220
There's something here.

1918
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:17,400
(He finds a mysterious door
and walks inside.)

1919
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,630
(He finds...)

1920
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,760
(the Infection Room.)

1921
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,440
(This is where Parent Zombie
produces zombies.)

1922
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,530
What is this?

1923
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,070
(Why are there boxes
for all the members?)

1924
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,170
This is a hand sanitizer.

1925
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:40,120
(There's something in the box for
the high-class zombie, Jong Kook.)

1926
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,050
(There are candies
in Se Chan's box.)

1927
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:46,050
(There is a bottle cap
in Kwang Soo's box.)

1928
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:52,220
Parent Zombie comes in here...

1929
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,160
and puts things in the boxes
to turn the members into zombies.

1930
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:01,780
(Now that he knows
how people get infected,)

1931
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:05,750
(he has to guess
who Parent Zombie is.)

1932
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:07,620
Ji Hyo has become a zombie.

1933
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,870
So has ZICO.

1934
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,290
(Ji Hyo's bottle cap
and ZICO's hand sanitizer are here.)

1935
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,660
(Inside So Min's box...)

1936
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:22,200
(A card?)

1937
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:24,960
So Min is suspicious.

1938
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,260
(The item in So Min's box
has nothing to do with the shoot.)

1939
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:31,040
This can't be from So Min.

1940
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,080
I'm not a zombie. I'm not.

1941
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:40,620
(ZICO and So Min wait
for the ambulance in the safe zone.)

1942
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,150
- Be honest. What are you?
- I'm human.

1943
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:46,450
You can't be human.

1944
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,990
The thing is...

1945
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:51,080
I'm Human Antibody.

1946
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:54,860
Busted.

1947
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,620
You're busted.

1948
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,590
You're busted. It was you.

1949
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,130
Busted. You're busted!

1950
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:05,610
You're Human Antibody,
not just human?

1951
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,830
If you'd said you were human,
I would have believed.

1952
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,540
But you said
you were Human Antibody.

1953
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,470
I know who the real
Human Antibody is.

1954
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,620
(This morning)

1955
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:20,750
(Before the shoot,
the staff met with ZICO.)

1956
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:23,210
(ZICO's identity)

1957
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,360
(He got eliminated three times
by Jong Kook...)

1958
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:30,830
(and became immune to fear.)

1959
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,530
(He was reborn
as Human Antibody.)

1960
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:34,700
- "Human Antibody"?
- Yes.

1961
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,240
(Humans' fate depends on
Human Antibody ZICO.)

1962
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:43,240
(Human Antibody ZICO
is safe from zombies.)

1963
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:46,080
(Still, he kept using
hand sanitizers...)

1964
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,120
(to pretend to be human.)

1965
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:51,210
(ZICO has been tracking down
Parent Zombie...)

1966
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,990
(without being suspected
by anyone.)

1967
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:54,690
(So Min, you're busted.)

1968
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:57,490
I mean... You think I'm a zombie?

1969
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:58,720
- What?
- I'm not a zombie.

1970
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,400
Are you saying I'm a zombie?

1971
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,860
I'm suspecting you're Parent Zombie.

1972
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,870
(So Min might be Parent Zombie.)

1973
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:06,400
I'm not a zombie.

1974
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,440
Anyway, I'm human.

1975
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,440
- So how...
- No one knows if you're human.

1976
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,240
How would I know? Only you know.

1977
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,370
- Prove it to me.
- I know who is Human Antibody.

1978
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,830
You even got hiccups.

1979
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,950
- It's a habit.
- Really?

1980
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:19,500
(So Min got caught telling a lie.)

1981
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,120
(What is her identity?)

1982
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:23,540
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo and Jae Suk...)

1983
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,490
Ji Hyo, what is that?

1984
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:26,790
(What is that?)

1985
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,580
- It's a vaccine.
- What?

1986
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:34,090
I'd been infected with the zombie
virus, but I got a vaccine.

1987
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,250
- Gosh, that startled me.
- You did?

1988
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,590
Yes, I just did.

1989
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:37,870
- You got a vaccine?
- I saw zombies.

1990
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:39,070
Yes, I just did.

1991
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,370
- This is it. It's blue.
- It's blue.

1992
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,940
I'd been infected
with the zombie virus.

1993
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:45,300
- You had?
- Yes.

1994
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,170
There was a zombie right there,

1995
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,830
so I just got a vaccine over there.

1996
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:49,970
That's a relief.

1997
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:52,040
(If Ji Hyo is telling the truth,
it means she is human.)

1998
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,750
- You're not a zombie, are you?
- Seriously.

1999
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:56,320
What's with you?

2000
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:02,120
(The ambulance
arrives at 4 p.m. sharp.)

2001
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,330
Oh, my. The ambulance is here.

2002
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:08,000
(Only the last 3 survivors
can get in the ambulance.)

2003
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,090
(The result is in the hands
of these four.)

2004
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:12,260
ZICO, come here.

2005
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,940
- Jae Suk.
- Now...

2006
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,200
I survived.

2007
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:17,540
(Groaning)

2008
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:19,610
(Sae Ho is going too far.)

2009
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:21,670
- Is this wrong?
- What's with you?

2010
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,300
- What are you doing?
- It's not easy.

2011
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:25,110
- That's a bit too much.
- I look like an ice witch.

2012
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:26,370
When did you all turn into zombies?

2013
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,370
Guys, the ambulance is here.

2014
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:31,190
Three of you can
get in the ambulance.

2015
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:34,820
If Parent Zombie gets in,
the zombies win.

2016
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:39,080
If Human Antibody
and two humans get in,

2017
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,000
the humans win.

2018
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,790
I was in the room and...

2019
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:45,500
Is Yoo Jae Suk human?

2020
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,130
- What is he?
- Is Yoo Jae Suk human?

2021
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:51,070
For some reason,
you feel very familiar.

2022
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:53,540
- I'm not in the mood.
- He sounds creepy.

2023
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:57,040
- You've been a zombie too long.
- This is driving me crazy.

2024
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,170
- Even when he goes home,
- He's become a mummy.

2025
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:01,450
he'll be like,
"Hyun Woo, Daddy's home."

2026
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:03,280
- You're busted.
- After enjoying his lunch,

2027
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,690
he turned into a zombie right away.

2028
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:06,120
(Hyun Woo's dad, Suk Jin, was
a zombie 80 percent of the time.)

2029
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,320
I know how we should decide.

2030
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,490
(The last 4 survivors
have to make a decision.)

2031
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:12,860
It's likely that Jae Suk and I
aren't zombies.

2032
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:15,200
We can't let Parent Zombie
get on the ambulance.

2033
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,550
We can let either one of them
get on,

2034
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,370
- So I...
- but not Parent Zombie.

2035
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:19,920
I went into that room,

2036
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,660
and the way you make a zombie...

2037
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,610
is...
Why are you listening so intently?

2038
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:28,330
(Focused)

2039
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:32,000
I'm sorry, but we're in the middle
of a shoot. Please step back.

2040
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,340
- It must be because you're new.
- Please step back.

2041
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,690
The zombie is listening
very intently.

2042
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:39,540
You can't listen to everything
that humans say.

2043
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,750
What was useless?

2044
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,660
Do I need to step back?
I thought I had to continue acting.

2045
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,250
- You thought you needed to act.
- I'm sorry about that.

2046
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,190
ZICO, you transformed into a zombie.

2047
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:47,660
I never did.
I never transformed into one.

2048
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:48,920
- Really?
- Because I'm Human Antibody.

2049
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,620
- That's strange.
- I'm Human Antibody.

2050
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:53,570
- You're Human Antibody?
- I never transformed into a zombie.

2051
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:55,370
I've never been bitten,
and I don't need the vaccine.

2052
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:57,300
- Because I'm Human Antibody.
- But it's not from getting bitten.

2053
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,760
- That's why ZICO never transformed.
- Yes.

2054
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,040
- Come here.
- But it's not...

2055
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,300
- It's not from getting bitten.
- I'm telling you.

2056
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,950
That's why I was telling you that
we have to let one of them get on.

2057
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:05,500
- Hold on. That's what you meant.
- But...

2058
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,820
That's why I'm saying one of them
is Parent Zombie.

2059
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,280
Yes. I'm Human Antibody.

2060
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,410
(Looking around)

2061
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:12,290
Let me tell you one more thing.

2062
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,120
Are we just supposed to stand here
like this?

2063
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:17,960
Are we not supposed to do anything
but stand here?

2064
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,660
I'd rather be back there
with the other zombies.

2065
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:23,400
At least let us act like zombies.

2066
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,420
Let's act like we're burning
in front of this.

2067
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,740
- Pardon? Why don't you show us?
- They can put in CGI.

2068
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:29,760
- Go forward.
- Isn't it weird to just stand here?

2069
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,040
If you do it first, we'll follow.

2070
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,410
You shouldn't have anything.

2071
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:34,940
Can you give me the photo
that the zombies took?

2072
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:38,110
Don't give it to him.

2073
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:40,580
- Don't give it to him.
- You're so obedient.

2074
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:43,250
It's the first time
someone asked me for something.

2075
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,290
It's on the basis that you believe
in what I'm saying.

2076
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:48,750
- But...
- Do you want it or not?

2077
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,290
Hold on. I don't need it.

2078
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:52,660
Not right now.

2079
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,160
You punk.

2080
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,250
You punk.

2081
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,530
(His wish is fulfilled.)

2082
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:59,000
- There's a barrier here.
- What was that?

2083
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,630
- There's a barrier.
- What did you do just now?

2084
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,870
(The veteran zombie gets air time
by making a non-existing situation.)

2085
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:05,870
- There's a barrier.
- That was funny.

2086
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:06,870
Okay, everyone.

2087
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:07,870
(Final decision
on which 3 will get on)

2088
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:11,580
Jae Suk, who has been confirmed as
human, will choose two people...

2089
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,080
to get on the ambulance.

2090
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:15,450
If fireworks go off over there,
then the humans win.

2091
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:17,580
If carbon dioxide gas comes out,
the zombies win.

2092
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:20,080
Did you really take it?

2093
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,750
I really took it earlier.

2094
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:23,160
Do you see this?

2095
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:25,160
I sucked it out.

2096
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,360
Jae Suk.

2097
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,550
Do you see it?

2098
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:30,290
(Ji Hyo's mouth proves...)

2099
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:31,760
(that she took the vaccine.)

2100
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,760
- You.
- It's red, right?

2101
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,200
- Your tongue is blue. Let me see.
- Yes.

2102
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,500
I took it.

2103
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,740
Hey. You're human.

2104
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,040
I told you I took it.
I was carrying it with me before.

2105
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,080
Your tongue is blue.

2106
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,630
A zombie can take it too.

2107
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:45,650
I'm Human Antibody.
I'm not trying to defend myself.

2108
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:47,110
- Are you really Human Antibody?
- I am.

2109
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:48,470
(So Min lied that she was
Human Antibody and got caught.)

2110
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:52,290
It's highly likely that we'll lose
if we take either one of them.

2111
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:55,550
If I'm Parent Zombie,
there's no reason for me to take it.

2112
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,960
It could be for show.

2113
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,030
We just took it.

2114
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:00,830
So Min's box had a card.

2115
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:02,830
- I don't know what it is though.
- What are you?

2116
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:05,660
I'll get on the ambulance with
Song Ji Hyo and ZICO.

2117
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:08,540
(Ji Hyo, ZICO, and Jae Suk
will get on the ambulance.)

2118
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,700
- Is this final?
- Yes, it is.

2119
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,260
(If Ji Hyo is Parent Zombie,
all the zombies win.)

2120
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,830
You'll leave
when you get in the car.

2121
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:15,670
- Why aren't you taking me?
- You...

2122
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:17,650
I'm confused between you two,

2123
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:20,170
but Ji Hyo's tongue is blue.

2124
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:22,370
- I was telling you the truth.
- Who is it?

2125
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:24,790
Get in. Ji Hyo, get in.

2126
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,540
- It's not ZICO.
- Ji Hyo, get in.

2127
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:27,820
Ji Hyo, get in the car.

2128
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:29,460
Let's get in.

2129
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:32,920
- Get over here, So Min.
- So Min.

2130
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,530
Shut the door on So Min.

2131
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:36,860
(So Min, who claims to be
Human Antibody, couldn't get on,)

2132
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,200
(and Ji Hyo, who claims
to be human, gets on.)

2133
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,960
- If it wasn't for...
- This is driving me crazy.

2134
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,540
If it wasn't for Ji Hyo's last
appeal, I would've been confused.

2135
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,000
I wonder what was in it.

2136
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
There were hand sanitizers
and such inside.

2137
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,740
Yours was a bottle cap.

2138
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:49,870
(The ambulance leaves.)

2139
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,370
I wonder what the outcome is.
Let's go.

2140
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:53,670
(The zombies already know who won.)

2141
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:54,870
(If So Min is Parent Zombie,)

2142
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:55,950
(the zombies lose.)

2143
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,540
If there are fireworks, we survive.

2144
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,250
If it's carbon dioxide gas, we lose.

2145
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,710
(If Ji Hyo is Parent Zombie,
carbon dioxide gas will come out,)

2146
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:02,160
(and the humans will lose.)

2147
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:05,380
(What are the results?)

2148
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,830
Nice.

2149
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:10,290
(The humans lost.)

2150
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:13,960
(Parent Zombie is in the ambulance,
so the zombies win.)

2151
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,290
Penalty.

2152
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,090
(It's carbon dioxide gas?)

2153
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:19,370
(Smiling)

2154
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,440
It's Song Ji Hyo.

2155
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,840
(Frozen)

2156
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,620
(Parent Zombie is...)

2157
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:30,470
(Song Ji Hyo.)

2158
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:32,510
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

2159
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:37,660
Today, you are Parent Zombie,
who reincarnated with...

2160
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:41,660
the zombie virus
from episode 277, Zombie Wars.

2161
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,900
(Ji Hyo's identity
is Parent Zombie.)

2162
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:48,130
(Ji Hyo was infected with the virus
in episode 277, Zombie Wars.)

2163
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:51,740
(She then reincarnated
as Parent Zombie.)

2164
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:54,300
And the other members
will reincarnate...

2165
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,670
from the episodes
where they hurt you.

2166
01:17:56,670 --> 01:18:00,650
You will get a chance
to get revenge on them,

2167
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:02,080
so please succeed.

2168
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,450
(For example, in the episode that
Jong Kook reincarnated from,)

2169
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:09,660
(Hades Jong Kook eliminated Poseidon
Ji Hyo in the shortest time.)

2170
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,960
(In the episode Jae Suk
reincarnated from,)

2171
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,050
(Jae Suk coldly pushed Ji Hyo away
when she said she wasn't it.)

2172
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:20,530
(They are all episodes where Ji Hyo
was left with a grudge.)

2173
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:24,410
(This is the special where Ji Hyo
gets revenge for her grudges.)

2174
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,870
- It's time to meet your assistant.
- Okay.

2175
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,250
You have to bite the one person
who has never been...

2176
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:35,170
a zombie before and turn them
into a high-class zombie.

2177
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,040
Let's go meet them.

2178
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,080
(Bite that member and turn them
into a high-class zombie.)

2179
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:42,010
(The member who will assist
the half-asleep Parent Zombie is...)

2180
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:43,750
- So Min.
- Hi, Ji Hyo!

2181
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:46,530
- Why are we the only ones here?
- What are we doing?

2182
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:49,460
What's going on?

2183
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:50,830
Is it true?

2184
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:52,200
(Biting)

2185
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:53,420
Why did you bite me?

2186
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,500
(The 1st high-class zombie to help
Parent Zombie is Jeon So Min.)

2187
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,960
What is this? What just happened?

2188
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:58,160
Are you a zombie? You're a zombie?

2189
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:59,460
Yes, I'm a zombie.

2190
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,080
(This is how
their chemistry started.)

2191
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,580
- I'm a zombie.
- You're a zombie?

2192
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,750
- You're a zombie too, So Min.
- Ji Hyo.

2193
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:07,080
Can you give me something else?
This one.

2194
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,170
- This one?
- Yes.

2195
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:09,910
(So Min wanted Se Chan's thing
as soon as they got on the bus.)

2196
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:11,990
(Acting calm)

2197
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,380
(Here, Ji Hyo.)

2198
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:15,660
(These two don't walk
when they are nervous.)

2199
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,620
(They quietly began to steal.)

2200
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:21,920
(When the swarm
of zombies appeared,)

2201
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:25,500
(Ji Hyo pretended to be abandoned.)

2202
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,740
Zombie 31, thanks for your efforts.

2203
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,440
I'll see you later.

2204
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:32,710
I'm the leader.

2205
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,370
Thanks for your hard work,
Zombie 28.

2206
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:38,950
(She pretended to be abandoned
and went into the Infection Room.)

2207
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,410
So this is where these were.

2208
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:45,950
Yang Se Chan.

2209
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:48,010
(She took the jelly candy
that So Min stole...)

2210
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:49,120
Jelly.

2211
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,510
(and put it in.)

2212
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:51,620
Thanks, Se Chan.

2213
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:55,620
(And So Min, who gambled and said
she was Human Antibody,)

2214
01:19:57,870 --> 01:20:01,000
(continued to steal and give Ji Hyo
infectious agents.)

2215
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,570
I hid wet wipes in the grass on
the right side of the first tree...

2216
01:20:03,570 --> 01:20:05,210
- near the camera.
- Got it.

2217
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,240
Look for it on the right
as you go up.

2218
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,330
Okay.

2219
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:11,300
The water bottle cap.
And another one.

2220
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,000
There you go.

2221
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:19,080
I brought a picture card of So Min.

2222
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,050
(She prepared for suspicions by
putting something in So Min's box.)

2223
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,580
(Then she put a bottle cap
in her box as an alibi.)

2224
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:25,750
This will go in my box.

2225
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,030
I'm done.

2226
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,660
(To be completely undercover,
she even lied about her episode.)

2227
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:35,630
(She cunningly made up
a new episode,)

2228
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,400
- I found something.
- Did you?

2229
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,440
(but in the tablet found by SUNMI,)

2230
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,910
There are zombies.

2231
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:43,110
(there was a video of the real
episode Ji Hyo reincarnated from.)

2232
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,450
Ji Hyo.

2233
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:47,040
Are you sure you didn't reincarnate
from this episode?

2234
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:49,340
(SUNMI...)

2235
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,150
(The low-class zombies
have arrived.)

2236
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:53,410
(Ji Hyo's secret was revealed,)

2237
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:54,510
I was right, wasn't I?

2238
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,880
(so she had the low-class zombies
eliminate her.)

2239
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,990
My gosh.

2240
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,250
(It was Ji Hyo?)

2241
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,660
It was you all along!

2242
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:07,660
(She even took the vaccine
to perfect her act.)

2243
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,740
She's Parent Zombie.

2244
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,040
Why is it her?

2245
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,630
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Song Ji Hyo.

2246
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,000
- Song Ji Hyo.
- What?

2247
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Louder!

2248
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,950
- Song Ji Hyo.
- What?

2249
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:22,870
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Song Ji Hyo.

2250
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:26,250
- Song Ji Hyo.
- The era of zombies is here!

2251
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:30,580
The zombies won because
Parent Zombie, Ji Hyo,

2252
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:32,080
got on the ambulance.

2253
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:36,160
And ZICO and Jae Suk,
who are on Team Human, lost.

2254
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,370
(Jae Suk will get the penalty of
dressing up for a live broadcast.)

2255
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:40,940
He will take the penalty
for his team.

2256
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:42,830
How cool! He's so cool!

2257
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,040
My goodness.

2258
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,570
- Good job, everyone!
- Thank you!

2259
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:47,740
Good job!

2260
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:50,950
(10th anniversary live broadcast
with the viewers)

2261
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:52,780
(The 7 members were invited to
CEO Big Nose's home.)

2262
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:53,800
(CEO Big Nose, Ji Suk Jin)

2263
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,840
(Butler, Yoo Jae Suk)

2264
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,580
(Analyst, Kim Jong Kook,
Insurance salesman, Haha)

2265
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,650
(Lawyer, Song Ji Hyo)

2266
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:58,650
(Judge, Lee Kwang Soo)

2267
01:21:58,650 --> 01:21:59,690
(Detective, Yang Se Chan)

2268
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:00,690
(Gambler, Jeon So Min)

2269
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:05,050
(2 of them are mysterious thieves
who are after the CEO's gold.)

2270
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:07,900
(In this place where everything gets
recorded for 50 seconds,)

2271
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,960
(Even the smallest action
can become a hint.)

2272
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:13,120
(If you fail,
your video will be revealed.)

2273
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,260
I got it!

2274
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:15,460
(It's the site for the trial
regarding the thieves' evidence,)

2275
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,070
(and it's filled with suspicion
and deduction.)

2276
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,940
(Also)

2277
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,500
(At the final trial
which will be broadcasted live,)

2278
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,910
(the viewers will catch
the mysterious thieves.)

2279
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:26,750
(A special live broadcast joined
by the viewers will come to you.)

2280
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:30,080
(The Provocation of Running Man)
