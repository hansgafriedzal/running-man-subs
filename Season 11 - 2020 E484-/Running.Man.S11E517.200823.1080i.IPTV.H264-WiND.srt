1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,260
(This episode was shot on August 4
after checking the temperature...)

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,590
(of all the staff members
and disinfecting the whole area.)

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,190
Hello.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,330
(So Min is the first to arrive
as always.)

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,520
Hello.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,520
What are you
doing in here, So Min?

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,360
I don't know.
I was told to stay here.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,000
- This way.
- Where?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,330
- Hey.
- Hello.

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,510
- Hello.
- Hi.

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,010
The opening is rather simple today.

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,240
I know. No one's here.

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,470
What are you doing?
What are you waiting for?

14
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,540
(Everyone's here
including Suk Jin.)

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,920
Are you wearing cologne?

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,740
I just put it on. Do you smell it?

17
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,020
Yes. It stinks.

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,280
- A little later...
- "It stinks"?

19
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,880
Suk Jin, I said I would...

20
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,880
It really stinks.

21
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,090
- Suk Jin.
- Nice.

22
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,990
That was a good one.

23
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,660
That's because I just put it on.
When you wear cologne...

24
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,420
- Gosh, Suk Jin. Seriously.
- It's bad.

25
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,560
- It really stinks.
- It's bad.

26
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,890
- They don't like it.
- The thing is...

27
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,060
I should wait a while
after spraying it.

28
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,240
Gosh, I don't like the smell.

29
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,500
Suk Jin, your pants are ripped.

30
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,600
You know it's part of the design.

31
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,100
You need to stitch it.

32
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,910
- It's part of the design.
- It's too big though.

33
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,450
That's how it is.
Do you not know about fashion?

34
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,210
- This is what New Yorkers wear.
- You need to be bold.

35
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,910
You've never been
to New York though.

36
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,410
I'd like to go there.

37
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,410
(I'd like to go there.)

38
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,450
(He follows the fashion of New York
that he's never been to.)

39
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,630
- You didn't even go there?
- I will.

40
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,920
You've been to Las Vegas, right?

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,130
I have. I drove from LA
to Las Vegas.

42
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,160
I've never been there before.

43
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,610
It was really fun. I think
Ji Hyo and So Min will be...

44
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,110
really popular in Vegas.

45
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,530
- Why?
- They like Asian girls.

46
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,200
They do. They wink a lot.

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,830
- Really?
- When I went to Europe,

48
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,170
a lot of guys winked at me
at a market.

49
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,520
And they'd think you're young.

50
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,350
"Oh no. Thank you." I said.

51
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,720
- Oh, dear.
- And what did they say?

52
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,550
"Thank you so much.
Hello. Come here."

53
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,390
- Really?
- I did this.

54
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,720
I'm sure she showed some responses.

55
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,890
- I know.
- That's why they winked.

56
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,220
I almost shut my eyes as I smile.

57
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,420
How?

58
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,160
(Smiling)

59
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,600
(She smiles in her eyes
until she gets a tic.)

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,800
You're unbelievable.

61
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,300
They must've been tired.

62
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,800
And you fall and bump all the time.

63
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,350
- Because you keep your eyes shut.
- That's funny.

64
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,310
(She's Love Frog
who's blinded by love.)

65
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,620
He's back with a drawn face.

66
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,250
You look handsome.

67
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,980
He looks better
after losing some weight.

68
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
- Gosh, no.
- So Min, what's...

69
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,320
with the makeup on your cheeks?

70
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,130
Did you do that for Se Chan?

71
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,000
She's been like that
since yesterday.

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,260
So Min said she'd go
take care of you.

73
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,030
She said she'd be his caregiver.

74
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,500
- No way.
- But he told me not to come.

75
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,900
Why is that?

76
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,340
I didn't want her to see me.

77
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,500
Why? Did you get a foley catheter?

78
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,280
- Gosh, it's not like that.
- Did you get a foley catheter?

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,600
(He feels dizzy
hearing about foley catheter.)

80
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,250
Why would you say that?

81
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,600
- Stop it.
- That's uncalled for.

82
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,720
- You're mean.
- That's ridiculous.

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,810
- It wasn't like that?
- Why would he get foley catheter?

84
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,120
- That's not it.
- My gosh.

85
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,590
Your legs are getting
darker and darker, Kwang Soo.

86
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,630
- Did you get tanned?
- He's shooting "Sea God" now.

87
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,750
- "Sea God"?
- It's "The Pirates".

88
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,130
- "Sea God"?
- "Sea God"?

89
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,000
- Did you say "Sea God"?
- What's "Sea God"?

90
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,660
It's a drama about Jang Bo Go.

91
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,760
Isn't it "Sea God"?

92
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,060
Why do you keep saying that?

93
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,190
Why would you do that?

94
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,230
Wasn't the title "Sea God"?

95
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,470
Are you a pirate in "The Pirates"?

96
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,440
- I am a pirate.
- I see.

97
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,030
Then you should pull out some teeth.

98
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,070
Why would I pull out my teeth?

99
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,250
That's what pirates do.

100
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,650
Like Jack Sparrow.

101
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,810
If you're a pirate,
you should pull out a few teeth.

102
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,010
You should have one eye
if you're pirate.

103
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,310
Why would I lose
my eye and teeth?

104
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,350
I think it would work...

105
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,960
if he colored his teeth black.

106
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,290
Just paint them black
like a comedy show.

107
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,320
- Give it a try.
- Gosh, no.

108
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,790
- That's what comedians do.
- It's nothing like that.

109
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,900
Who is the lead actor?

110
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,000
Well... It features Kang Ha Neul.

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,400
- Oh, right.
- Ha Neul?

112
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,100
- It will be successful.
- That sounds fun.

113
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,760
I know. It must be fun.

114
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,710
And it also features me.

115
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,410
- Do you play a lead role?
- Is Ha Neul the lead actor?

116
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,880
Are you Ha Neul's friend?

117
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Ha Neul...

118
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,970
That jerk...

119
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,620
(He explodes with anger.)

120
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,350
He says that
every time I start a movie.

121
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,410
(The best supporting actor
loses his temper.)

122
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,410
He asks if you're the lead's friend.

123
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,660
You must be the best friend
of Ha Neul's girlfriend.

124
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,220
You have a secret crush
on Ha Neul's girlfriend.

125
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,500
And you die for her, right?

126
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,030
And you like her.

127
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,500
Actually that's true.
So I can't yell at him.

128
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,970
- It's true.
- I'm his friend...

129
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,440
- and underling.
- It's all correct.

130
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,500
- His underling?
- Underling.

131
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,070
- His friend and underling.
- Now we know the full story.

132
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,280
Let me tell you
about the rules then.

133
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,350
- Okay. Tell us.
- All right.

134
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,910
Once you get into the studio,

135
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,610
there will be rooms
numbered from 1 to 8.

136
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,680
- Is that so?
- Okay.

137
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,850
Among 8 rooms, pick 1...

138
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,050
and go inside.

139
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,550
- Really?
- Do we go in?

140
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,460
Suk Jin, you're closest
to the door, so go ahead first.

141
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,600
I don't want to go first.

142
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,720
- Really? Then I'll go.
- Yes.

143
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,100
Now I want to go first.

144
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,160
(He changes his mind suddenly.)

145
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,640
Why do you keep changing your mind?

146
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,510
What's with you?

147
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,640
- It's because he gets jealous.
- I know.

148
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,210
- So Min, go first.
- Okay.

149
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,970
Don't come into my room.
I like number three.

150
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,870
Hello.

151
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,370
(What will be inside the studio?)

152
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,740
What's going on today?
Are these rooms?

153
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,390
(Connected by 8 rooms)

154
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,610
Does everyone get a room?

155
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,410
(It's a huge octagonal set.)

156
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,720
(Each room has a karaoke machine...)

157
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,030
(and various karaoke items.)

158
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,120
Can no one else come
into the same room?

159
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,730
Can no one else come in
if I say that it's occupied?

160
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,900
Do I get to use it alone?

161
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,210
I'll pick number four.

162
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,300
- Turn over the sign and go inside.
- Okay.

163
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,410
(She picks number 4
without thinking hard.)

164
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,650
What's this?

165
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,850
(What? It's a karaoke room.)

166
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,610
This is amazing.

167
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,760
Let's see. Which one shall I go in?

168
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,850
Come inside the one next to mine.

169
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,700
All right.

170
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,460
I pick this one.

171
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,070
(Jae Suk picks room number 1.)

172
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,600
What's this?

173
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,860
This one.

174
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,470
(Haha picks number 3
next to So Min's.)

175
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,430
Next in line, please go.

176
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,730
(The remaining 5 members
pick their rooms.)

177
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,670
(1. Jae Suk, 2. Se Chan, 3. Haha,
4. So Min, 5. Ji Hyo, 6. Suk Jin)

178
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,210
(7. Jong Kook, 8. Kwang Soo)

179
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,350
Everyone.

180
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,470
Everyone.

181
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,590
(The rules are given
as soon as everyone enters a room.)

182
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,980
After singing a song of your choice
entirely,

183
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,760
check your score.

184
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,680
Saying your true score
may be disadvantageous,

185
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,160
so be careful
when you report your score.

186
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,330
What do you mean?

187
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,620
We shouldn't say it?

188
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,720
First, sing a song of your choice
up to the second verse...

189
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,270
and check your score.

190
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,030
(Singing)

191
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,140
(A creepy intro of "Aloha" by Cool)

192
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,580
(A candle under a dark light)

193
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,350
(He starts the song offbeat.)

194
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,350
(What song did So Min choose?)

195
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,720
(Like Jae Suk, she picks a song
by Cool named "Sending My Love".)

196
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,220
(Bouncing of the 90's)

197
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,160
(She gets emotional
on an empty stomach at 9 a.m.)

198
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,430
(Another person
who's getting too emotional)

199
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,340
This is my favorite song.

200
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,510
(Jong Kook picks
"The More I Love" by Boohwal.)

201
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,540
(Suk Jin also picks a slow song.)

202
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,610
(Haha picks a hip-hop song
like a hip-hop artist.)

203
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,460
(Ji Hyo picks a fast trot song.)

204
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,850
(Se Chan picks Haha's song.)

205
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
(All members finish picking a song.)

206
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,270
(Running Man's
solo coin karaoke is open.)

207
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,860
(Yes)

208
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,030
(Rowdy Haha gets excited
from the start.)

209
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,010
(He raps like the old days.)

210
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,600
(He sings
after rapping passionately.)

211
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,170
(He's out of tune.)

212
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,540
(I'm a rapper.)

213
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,110
(Se Chan's homage to Haha's song)

214
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,220
(Shouting)

215
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,850
(His priority is showing off his
personal charm instead of singing.)

216
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,160
(Jae Suk concentrates on singing
with composure.)

217
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,620
(Banging)

218
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,970
(Loud sounds)

219
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,200
What? What is it?

220
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,710
Stop it.

221
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,860
Stop what?

222
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,010
(Jae Suk interrupts.)

223
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,140
I'm getting emotional.

224
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,910
(He reimmerses in it right away.)

225
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,040
(So Min is also immersed
in singing.)

226
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,720
(I'm afraid)

227
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,390
(Of having to meet someone)

228
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,220
(She makes exaggerated gestures
irrelevant to the score.)

229
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
(Sorrowful)

230
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,230
(Instead of singing well, emotional
So Min makes a music video.)

231
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,310
(Lifting her head)

232
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,860
(I want to be alone.)

233
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,210
(Sometimes, I cry.)

234
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,600
(Despite other members'
low-quality performance,)

235
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,680
(Jong Kook's sweet voice is
pleasant to our ears.)

236
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,960
(Only his expression of emotions
is high-quality.)

237
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,220
(Banging)

238
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,830
What's wrong with him?

239
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,620
Be quiet.

240
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,060
(He finishes singing in anger.)

241
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,020
"Wow, that's surprising."

242
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,970
I got 100 points.

243
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
"You're a singer."

244
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,000
Wow.

245
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,230
(As no one knows
what the mission is,)

246
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,400
I got 100 points.

247
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,080
(everyone is boasting
about their high scores.)

248
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,970
Everyone, the score
on the karaoke machine is...

249
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,920
your current score.

250
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,320
However, one person pressed cancel
by mistake,

251
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,320
who will get zero points.

252
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,420
Who was it?

253
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,250
Who was it?

254
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,560
Is it okay as long as
you saw your score?

255
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,800
Within 10 minutes,

256
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,570
choose whether or not to open
the door locked on both sides.

257
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,100
Based on which doors open,
members who meet make a team.

258
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,310
You're better off
the higher your average score is.

259
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,580
If you think the one next to you
has a higher score, you'd better...

260
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,940
open and be on the same team.

261
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,180
About 3 to 4 rooms
can come together.

262
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,680
Kwang Soo picked a song
that's easy to get a high score.

263
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,090
I got a high score, Jong Kook.

264
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,450
- Right?
- Yes.

265
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,560
- Jae Suk.
- Hey, Se Chan.

266
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,690
- I sang very well.
- Se Chan.

267
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,520
- I got a high score.
- You know...

268
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,960
- I got a high score.
- Right.

269
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,120
- Se Chan.
- Wait.

270
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,200
Open up.

271
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,760
Okay.

272
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,760
- It's open. Is your score high?
- Okay.

273
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,840
- And you? What's the score?
- It's high.

274
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,840
It's quite high,
but I can't tell you.

275
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,230
- First...
- You didn't cancel, did you?

276
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,710
- No, mine is over 90 points.
- Right?

277
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,000
- Kwang Soo?
- Yes?

278
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,450
Let's do it.

279
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,850
- Open up.
- Open it. I'm willing to...

280
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,690
It's impossible...

281
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,290
- that you got a low score.
- Yours is definitely high.

282
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,150
I heard your singing.

283
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,150
Okay, I definitely think
you got a high score.

284
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,250
Let's do it, you punk.

285
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,590
- Okay!
- Okay!

286
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,650
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook
become a team.)

287
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,720
Did you get a high score?

288
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,350
- I did.
- Really?

289
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,470
It worked.

290
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,970
(While the members make teams)

291
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,390
- Mine is high.
- It wasn't you, right?

292
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,390
I got a high score.

293
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,800
- Who's next to you?
- Suk Jin.

294
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,860
No.

295
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,570
(She stops right away.)

296
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,340
- You don't think so?
- No.

297
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,710
No way.

298
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,500
I didn't press cancel.

299
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,010
- Did you hear him sing?
- I did.

300
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,240
Jong Kook, who's next to you?

301
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,980
I think it's Suk Jin.

302
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,610
- I bet he pressed cancel.
- Him?

303
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,960
I didn't press cancel.

304
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,720
- Honestly,
- I promise.

305
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,060
now that I'm on Jong Kook's team,

306
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,220
I won't be last.

307
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,460
- We'll definitely place first.
- The question is...

308
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,260
- whether to take on baggage or not.
- Right.

309
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,700
What baggage?

310
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,390
- Suk Jin.
- I just can't tell you... Gosh.

311
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,360
Isn't that how he acts
when he's lying?

312
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,810
- Haha.
- What song did you sing, So Min?

313
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,400
- Haha.
- I teamed up with Ji Hyo. Come on.

314
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,450
Ji Hyo got a high score
by singing...

315
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,600
"Love Battery".

316
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,370
- Did she score high?
- Yes.

317
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,550
Yes, I did.

318
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,050
(After hearing
about Ji Hyo's score...)

319
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,420
Let's go.

320
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,190
Hey, Se Chan.

321
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,460
We got high scores.

322
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,930
- We did.
- Really?

323
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,060
- Open up.
- Let's open it.

324
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,460
- Okay.
- Neither of us pressed cancel.

325
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,460
- No, right?
- No.

326
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,830
Ji Hyo sang "Love Battery".

327
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,890
Time is up.

328
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,970
The ones who opened the door
and shared...

329
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,470
will average their scores.

330
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,570
Please come out.

331
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,710
The teams are
made of 2, 1, and 5 members.

332
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,970
Five members?

333
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,180
Did all of them team up?

334
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,900
- We're all a team.
- Really?

335
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,080
I'll announce the individual scores.

336
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,240
Haha scored...

337
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,770
72 points.

338
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,420
- That's low.
- That's low.

339
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,420
I told you that
we shouldn't open the door.

340
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,190
Next, So Min scored...

341
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,650
86 points.

342
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,480
- What?
- It isn't so bad.

343
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,020
- She didn't score high.
- It's Ji Hyo.

344
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,020
Since they trained to be singers,
they should sing well.

345
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,430
Next, Ji Hyo scored 80 points.

346
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,260
- What?
- But you sang "Love Battery".

347
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,600
Why did you say that it was high?

348
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,100
Since it was 80 points.

349
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,540
(Other members got fooled.)

350
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,810
Jae Suk scored...

351
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,600
- 87 points.
- That's right.

352
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,810
- It's not bad.
- Really? I heard you sing.

353
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,500
I sang effortlessly.

354
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,900
You should've had scored over 90.

355
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,640
Se Chan scored...

356
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,180
- zero.
- Darn it.

357
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,590
Se Chan scored zero.

358
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,690
Darn it.

359
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,880
I pressed it by mistake.

360
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,610
Was it you?

361
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,880
My score didn't come up.

362
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,590
I pressed the wrong key. I'm sorry.

363
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,560
That's huge. We got fooled.

364
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,490
I sang passionately,
but I didn't get a score.

365
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,120
Jong Kook scored 75 points.

366
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,970
- That's not high.
- It's low.

367
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,470
- I couldn't hear the accompaniment.
- It's lower than I thought.

368
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,600
- What about Kwang Soo?
- Kwang Soo scored...

369
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,760
44 points.

370
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,340
- I was...
- What?

371
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,470
(What?)

372
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,580
There's something wrong
with the machine.

373
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,080
- There's no way.
- It was my favorite song.

374
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,110
(Sad truth behind Kwang Soo's score)

375
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,380
(He sang his favorite song
with emotions.)

376
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,380
(It was a solo concert
full of emotions.)

377
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,060
(However, the result was a failure.)

378
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,390
(He's lying.)

379
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,390
(He got stabbed
by his favorite song.)

380
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,100
Why didn't you sing...

381
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,170
It's because Jae Suk kept knocking
and told me to be quiet.

382
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,070
He kept interrupting my singing.

383
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,500
- What's the average?
- That's why I got 44.

384
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,310
Suk Jin is the only one
on his team.

385
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,770
His score is 88 points.

386
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,270
- It's the highest.
- He placed first.

387
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,370
- You placed first.
- I know.

388
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,180
Petty Gang is doing so well
these days.

389
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,640
- It's Petty Gang.
- Petty Gang?

390
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,420
I want to join Petty Gang.

391
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,690
You're already part of it.

392
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,460
The team's average score is
important in today's race.

393
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,930
It's Cut Off to Survive.

394
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,560
Team members will be connected
in a few minutes,

395
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,620
and you'll proceed
with the missions.

396
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,620
The team with the highest
average score in the mission...

397
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,990
- will get a benefit.
- Really?

398
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,130
The one with the highest score
on that team gets to choose.

399
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,840
The winner of the winning team
gets a benefit.

400
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,500
You can get the lock's passcode,

401
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,770
add a lock to a team member,

402
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,870
or make someone in another team
join your team.

403
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,920
(The 1st place in the winning team
chooses 1 of the 3 benefits.)

404
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,880
For example, if the keyword for
the next mission is "flexibility",

405
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,720
you should recruit someone
who seems to be flexible.

406
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,330
- You'll tell us the keyword?
- Yes.

407
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,390
And you should remove a person
who isn't flexible from your team.

408
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,600
The team with the highest average
score at the end wins the race...

409
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,990
and receives the prize.

410
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,360
We just have to choose
the right members.

411
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,440
However, the team with the lowest
average score at each mission...

412
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,970
receives penalty balls with the team
members' names on them.

413
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,870
At the end, two members will be
randomly chosen to get penalties.

414
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,000
That means each of you
just got a penalty ball.

415
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,640
- What?
- You two...

416
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,010
- Already?
- You two came in last.

417
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,550
(Glaring)

418
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,320
We can do well from now on.

419
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,610
- I'm glad I teamed up with you.
- Me too.

420
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,060
How we'll do next is what matters.

421
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,820
I've never seen anyone get
under 50 points at karaoke...

422
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,190
- in my whole life.
- It was my first time too.

423
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,620
- Wasn't it because of his face?
- Exactly.

424
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,560
- What's wrong with my face?
- Because he has long hair, I think.

425
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,700
Could it be because he's too tall?

426
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,120
You got something on me
after a long time.

427
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,120
- No.
- You look so happy now.

428
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,570
Karaoke machines these days
have facial recognition.

429
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,600
- The machine didn't like him.
- Facial recognition, my foot.

430
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,900
- Your appearance and gestures...
- What are you talking about?

431
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,040
- are included in the criteria.
- The machine didn't like him.

432
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,810
We'll let the only member
of the winning team Suk Jin...

433
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,640
- choose the benefit right now.
- Okay.

434
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,420
- Awesome, Petty.
- Petty Gang.

435
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,640
- That's incredible.
- You're awesome, Petty.

436
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,290
- Petty Gang is the best.
- Petty is awesome.

437
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,950
- I want to join Petty Gang.
- The time has come.

438
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,960
- The next mission's keyword is...
- Yes.

439
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,290
"Courage".

440
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,150
It won't be me.

441
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,100
Suk Jin, you can either
tie yourself to someone...

442
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,220
- or remove someone from a team.
- I see.

443
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,830
- I should be the one...
- When I think about courage,

444
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,970
- these two are the worst.
- They're the worst.

445
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,570
You can't have someone in your team
just because you break a tie.

446
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,170
- I know. It doesn't work that way.
- Hey, be quiet.

447
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,170
We need to explain the rules to him.

448
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,270
- Suk Jin is talking right now.
- He doesn't understand the rules...

449
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,870
- He knows the rules.
- Okay.

450
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,710
- It'd be great to make him...
- Exactly.

451
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,470
- come in last.
- Good. But Kwang Soo...

452
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,180
- Okay. I'll break them up.
- Are you serious?

453
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,180
- Okay.
- Nice.

454
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,640
Nice, Suk Jin.

455
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,220
Okay. I'll break them up.

456
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,290
- Are you serious?
- Okay.

457
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,980
- Nice, Suk Jin.
- Now, they have to make a choice.

458
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,350
- No, it's over.
- It's over?

459
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,190
The three of you will
play the game individually.

460
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,720
- That's right.
- Really?

461
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,390
- My goodness.
- Thank you for breaking us up.

462
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,800
- I won't forget this.
- Why did you...

463
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,890
break us up when you didn't even
understand the rules?

464
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,200
- I won't forget this.
- Wait.

465
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,760
He didn't even understand the rules.

466
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,130
Won't they choose a team...

467
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,170
- after they break up?
- Jae Suk wouldn't let me tell him.

468
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,970
- I won't forget this.
- Why would you do that?

469
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,580
- We'll tether you to each other.
- I said, that's not how it works.

470
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,240
What's going on?
They're tying me up.

471
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,370
Jae Suk, I think
we'll go up in the air.

472
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,770
- Why...
- I think we'll go up in the air.

473
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,980
- I don't want to do that.
- I think they're tethering us.

474
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,010
- They're tethering you together.
- Oh, I see.

475
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,590
Haha and Jae Suk
are already scared.

476
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,060
Please wait in the waiting room
while we're preparing...

477
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,220
- for the next mission.
- Okay.

478
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,990
I ended up being tethered
to them. Gosh.

479
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,560
- I'll go to the bathroom.
- It's uncomfortable.

480
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,890
(They moved to another place
for their first courage test.)

481
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,260
(What could be the courage test?)

482
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,730
- What's that?
- It's tall.

483
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,180
- What is this?
- That's so tall.

484
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,870
- I can't do this.
- What is this?

485
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,370
(It's large enough
to fill the studio.)

486
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,050
The stairs are so steep.

487
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,750
- Are we going to go up there?
- What is this anyway?

488
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,990
(If you go up the stairs
as tall as a two-story building,)

489
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,180
Oh, my gosh.

490
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,680
(you'll see a long
polystyrene foam diving board.)

491
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,830
(What kind of test will be held
in this place?)

492
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,620
- Is this a courage test?
- It's made of polystyrene foam.

493
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,830
Come over here. Come up here.

494
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,920
(What could this be?)

495
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,030
This is amazing.

496
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,570
So, we walk on it as far as we can
without breaking it?

497
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,600
Let's sit here.

498
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,740
- Is it edible?
- Se Chan.

499
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,960
- Haha, come here.
- Hey, So Min.

500
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,310
- So Min.
- It's too high.

501
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,600
- So Min, come here already.
- It's not edible.

502
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,980
- It's shallower than I thought.
- Come and sit here.

503
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,350
Just come here.

504
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,700
That would break if I stand on it.

505
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,140
But it's quite shallow.

506
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,350
Jae Suk, it's shallow.

507
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,320
Everyone, the first mission
that requires courage is...

508
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,950
Put a Sticker
on the Edge of a Cliff.

509
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,990
We'll have to put a sticker on it.

510
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,110
It looks so scary.

511
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,490
You will decide the order
and try it one by one.

512
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,390
What you have to do is to go up
on that diving tower...

513
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,330
and put a sticker at the farthest
spot you can reach on the platform.

514
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,460
The location of your sticker
decides your individual score.

515
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,540
If the platform breaks
before you put the sticker on it,

516
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,930
you get no point.

517
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,430
We'll calculate the average score
of each team,

518
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,480
and the team with the highest score
will get a benefit,

519
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,840
and the last place team
will get penalty balls.

520
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,510
So, they'll calculate
the average score?

521
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,210
Yes, and for us, the individual
scores will be our team scores.

522
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,610
Is it okay if it breaks
after I put my sticker on it?

523
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,140
It's okay as long as you put
a sticker on it.

524
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,250
(They get a score if their stickers
are on the platform.)

525
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,650
Many of our staff members
tried the game.

526
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,450
It's perfectly safe, and some of us
reached to the edge.

527
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,450
- To the edge?
- Yes.

528
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,450
Okay. I got it.

529
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,950
Hey, you guys should watch me
do that. I'm telling you...

530
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,360
- Hey.
- Calm down.

531
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,690
- What's there to watch?
- Just don't pee your pants.

532
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,540
- Just don't pee your pants.
- Exactly.

533
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,000
- Do you need a chamber pot?
- Please give him a diaper.

534
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,360
I'll make sure to watch you.

535
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,070
Gosh, this is driving me insane.

536
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,930
As for the order, we calculated
the average age of each team.

537
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,350
You'll try in the order of age
from the youngest.

538
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,480
- From the youngest?
- First up is Kwang Soo.

539
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,580
Why? I...

540
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,410
- Is he younger than me?
- What about Se Chan and So Min?

541
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,590
The average age of their team
is 40.2.

542
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,250
You shouldn't be rude to me
as I'm older than you.

543
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,710
- We're all older than you.
- We're older than you.

544
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,020
- They're all older than you.
- Stop acting up.

545
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,290
- How dare you?
- Be polite to us.

546
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,590
- What are you looking at?
- How dare you act up?

547
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,260
- I wanted to see others first.
- Go on.

548
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,920
- Go now.
- Don't part your hair like that!

549
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,690
- Shave the back of your head.
- Kwang Soo.

550
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,890
- Yes?
- You forgot the helmet.

551
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,600
- Do we need a helmet too?
- Just in case.

552
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,270
It might break even if you want to
go farther.

553
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,360
Exactly. That's why.

554
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,040
- If it breaks...
- Put it on once you hear a crack.

555
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,130
Right.

556
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,050
I will pull this off no matter what.

557
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,050
(This mission is important to him
as he already got a penalty ball.)

558
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,170
So I can team up with him again.

559
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,210
(He seems highly motivated.)

560
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,950
It feels higher than I expected.

561
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,090
(Unlike how it felt on the floor,
4m feel so scary.)

562
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,800
(All he can do is sigh
as he looks down.)

563
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,060
Hey, it's high, right?

564
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,300
- It's too high.
- Right? It's high.

565
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,500
Of course, it feels higher up there.

566
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,070
- As you can see,
- It's very tall.

567
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,300
- it's as tall as the lighting.
- Exactly.

568
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,130
- He's tall, so it must feel higher.
- Exactly.

569
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,600
Kwang Soo, try to take a step on it.

570
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,840
(Kwang Soo froze
and won't even budge.)

571
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,580
- I don't think I can do this.
- Try standing on it.

572
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,750
- Give it a try.
- Put your feet on it.

573
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,200
Try stepping on it for now.

574
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,850
Right. Put your feet on it.

575
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,520
Try stepping on it.

576
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,640
Go on.

577
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,820
Why are you being so scared?

578
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,610
- Move. Come on.
- Show us. You're the youngest.

579
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,420
- It won't break. Trust me.
- Oh, my.

580
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,530
- Gosh, seriously.
- It'll break.

581
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,560
- It'll break. Oh, no.
- If it breaks, it's over.

582
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,390
- It's shaking.
- Hey, hey, stop.

583
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,530
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

584
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,120
- It's shaking.
- Hey, hey, stop.

585
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,770
- Gosh.
- That must be scary.

586
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,800
(As the diving platform shakes,
Kwang Soo is shaking too.)

587
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,430
- I don't think we can do this.
- Go, Kwang Soo.

588
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,130
- Let's go!
- You can do it!

589
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,430
- I can do this.
- Hey, hey.

590
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,280
You put only your right foot,
and it wobbled.

591
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,240
You don't drag it on like that
these days.

592
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,440
You can just roll over, put your
sticker on it, and come down.

593
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,640
- It's bending.
- Gosh. It's wobbling.

594
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,850
(It's wobbling even more.)

595
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,140
- It's wobbling.
- My gosh.

596
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,090
(Gosh, It's wobbling.)

597
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,210
- I only put one foot on it.
- Is it okay?

598
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,380
- I didn't even stand on it.
- This is crazy.

599
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,730
- Exactly.
- It wobbles too much.

600
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,450
- It's scary.
- Flex your lower body.

601
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,920
Wait. Lie down on the platform.

602
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,230
- Lie down on your belly.
- Yes.

603
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,600
- That's good.
- Try crawling.

604
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,540
- That's good.
- You shouldn't... Hey, hey.

605
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,930
You should move forward.

606
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,540
What's wrong with you?
You're a pirate.

607
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,780
That has nothing to do with this.

608
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,240
- You're a pirate.
- "Sea God".

609
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,870
- It's not "Sea God".
- Come on, Jang Bo Go.

610
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,850
- He can't seem to move.
- Sea otter.

611
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,080
- Kwang Soo, give it a try.
- The staff say...

612
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,110
it's safe up to 1m.

613
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,590
- Come down if you'll be like that.
- Just give up.

614
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,140
(Booing)

615
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,180
I'm bored.

616
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,410
It's really boring.

617
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,420
Kwang Soo, the viewers will switch
the channel. You can't be like this.

618
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,920
"I'll watch another show."

619
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,450
- He's really scared.
- Please.

620
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,420
- Please don't switch the channel.
- It must feel different...

621
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,160
- I really want to do this.
- if you go up there.

622
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,960
- Go up there.
- You should try this.

623
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,390
Please don't switch the channel.

624
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,540
Please give me a second.
I want to do this. I really do.

625
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,480
- This isn't what I expected.
- They're switching the channel.

626
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,250
This is what makes people
want to switch the channel.

627
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,810
Take your hand off
and see what happens.

628
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,520
Put your elbow on it
to see if it's safe.

629
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,080
- It's safe.
- Hey, Kwang Soo.

630
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,590
Keep moving.

631
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,680
You'll be okay up to that point.
It's safe.

632
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,150
(Coughing)

633
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,350
They're laughing hard.

634
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,150
- He's going to throw up.
- He's about to throw up.

635
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,560
Shall I bring you a bucket?

636
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,620
Exactly. He's going to throw up.
He's drooling.

637
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,420
Kwang Soo, the cranes are moving
around so busily because of you.

638
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,800
- Look at them. Come on.
- The writers are dozing off.

639
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,660
They're even moving the cranes
because you won't move.

640
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,040
The cameraman who's controlling
the crane is working hard for you.

641
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,980
Hey, wink at the crane camera.

642
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,440
- Wink at the camera.
- Move already.

643
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,600
You're running out of time...

644
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,940
(The camera froze.)

645
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,750
That was funny.

646
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,290
Hey, you have 30 seconds left.

647
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,410
- He's moving.
- Lie on the platform.

648
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,060
- Lie down. Good.
- Lie down.

649
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,850
- Lie down slowly.
- Lie on your belly.

650
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,120
(He's moving slowly.)

651
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
He's lying down.

652
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,500
(Snapping)

653
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,600
(Everyone got surprised.)

654
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
What was that? What happened?

655
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,690
He's lying down.

656
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,700
(Screaming)

657
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,900
- He went back.
- What was that?

658
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,900
We were all nervous.

659
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,670
Hey, it broke right away.

660
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,870
We were nervous too.

661
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,480
- What happened?
- It broke.

662
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,410
- My gosh.
- My hands are sweating.

663
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,750
- It broke right away.
- We were nervous too.

664
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,760
It broke...

665
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,620
The longer time you take,
the more likely you are to fall off.

666
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,030
- Get it over with.
- Exactly.

667
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,890
Run to the 3m point
without stopping.

668
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,030
- Here he goes.
- Okay.

669
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,330
I know how I should do it.

670
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,420
I doubt it.

671
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,690
(Is this the plan he came up with?)

672
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,460
You'll fall head-first
if you crawl like that.

673
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,540
- That's right.
- Oh, no.

674
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,690
- Gosh, seriously.
- Kwang Soo, come on.

675
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,510
You're quite close to the 2m point.

676
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,930
- He can do that because he's tall.
- Exactly.

677
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,400
Go a little farther.

678
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,440
Your thighs will be scraped
because you're wearing shorts.

679
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,850
You shouldn't have put on shorts.

680
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,980
- Wear long pants on variety shows.
- What is he doing?

681
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,990
- Your thighs will be scraped
- Shut your mouths, you jerks.

682
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
- Your thighs will be scraped
- Shut your mouths, you jerks.

683
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,110
(He burst out in anger in the end.)

684
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,350
Shut it!

685
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,950
Just shut it, please.

686
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,300
- Wear long pants on variety shows.
- He's wearing shorts...

687
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,890
- Gosh. I'm so stressed out.
- that look like underwear.

688
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,100
- They're too short.
- Why did you put on shorts?

689
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,690
Are you going cycling or something?

690
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,960
Are they knickers or what?

691
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,740
You wear shorts like that
only when you ride a bicycle.

692
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,580
He's about to start drooling.

693
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,600
Look at his face.

694
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,810
There he goes. He's panicking.

695
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,440
- Good.
- You should move forward now.

696
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,670
- Good.
- Move already.

697
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,020
Move forward no matter what.

698
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,590
- His face like a fool is the best.
- Indeed.

699
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,990
- It's wobbling.
- Look at his face.

700
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,380
He's the best in Korea.

701
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,450
(He's the best in Korea when it
comes to a face like a fool.)

702
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,520
- He should move forward.
- Yes.

703
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,490
- You should go farther than that.
- You've been up there too long.

704
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,300
Can you count to three for me?

705
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,730
- Shall we count to 3 for you?
- Count to 3 for me.

706
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,100
- Please do it for me.
- Okay. Get ready.

707
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,270
- 1.
- 1.

708
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,770
(The platform has already
become weak.)

709
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,840
- 2.
- 2.

710
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,070
(It's important for him
to move quickly.)

711
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,070
Three.

712
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,770
(Could Kwang Soo pull it off?)

713
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,840
(Snapping)

714
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,080
He fell off.

715
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,350
(He seemed to move quickly.)

716
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,200
(But he fell off right away.)

717
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,580
(The pirate met his fate
in the air.)

718
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,780
No, it fell.

719
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,490
- He couldn't put it.
- He couldn't do it.

720
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,180
He couldn't do it.

721
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,380
He's gone.

722
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,110
- He's gone.
- Where did he go?

723
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,830
- Hey.
- Kwang Soo. Crawl out.

724
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
Kwang Soo.

725
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,260
He couldn't do it.

726
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,390
- What's that, by the way?
- He couldn't do it.

727
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,390
He flew away.

728
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,360
- He sweated too much.
- It's not sticky.

729
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,700
See? I told you to hurry up.

730
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,160
Kwang Soo failed.

731
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,980
Kwang Soo went pretty far though.

732
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,640
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

733
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,250
- Let's get it over with.
- Go up.

734
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,050
This is crazy.

735
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,140
It's way too high. Gosh.

736
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,380
- Isn't it high?
- The cracking sound drove me crazy.

737
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,060
- It's high.
- It's high, Kwang Soo.

738
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,150
- Oh, my.
- It's different.

739
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,490
I told you. It's different
from looking down here.

740
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,190
- Can I try any method?
- It's too high.

741
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,650
- It feels different.
- It's too scary.

742
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,390
- You shouldn't hesitate.
- You said you'll show us.

743
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,890
I'm not even kidding.
I'm not confident.

744
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,430
Hey. Move aside.

745
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,130
What if I get scared
and pull you down with me?

746
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,080
- Okay?
- You're thinking that far?

747
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Is it that bad?

748
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,480
You were so confident before.

749
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,850
Take his glasses.

750
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,280
Where did your confidence go?

751
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,870
This is crazy.

752
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,490
Is it over if it breaks?

753
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,290
We'll replace it.

754
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,590
But we won't place it
if it's only a crack.

755
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,490
- You won't?
- No?

756
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,030
If it cracks,
you should kill yourself.

757
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,890
But that sound might be from me.

758
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,770
- That's what I mean.
- I'll check.

759
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,300
- You should listen to it carefully.
- Okay.

760
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,130
If it's from me, pull me out.

761
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,240
Of course.
I'll get into action right away.

762
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,810
He's the national coward.

763
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,870
- It's...
- Move slowly.

764
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,170
It's all right. You're light.

765
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,510
It wouldn't support me.

766
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,640
He's scared for real.

767
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,480
- He's going like this.
- Jae Suk.

768
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,870
(His body is trembling.)

769
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,490
I've never seen that face before.

770
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,350
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

771
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,210
(I'm a coward.)

772
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,260
I don't feel good up here.

773
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,150
This is like Nevis Swing.

774
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,600
It's no joke.

775
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,100
Hey. Don't be ridiculous.

776
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,420
Jae Suk. It's okay up to here.

777
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,770
Hey. Slap me in the face.

778
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,360
Hey. Slap me in the face.

779
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,840
(They react immediately
to his request.)

780
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,630
- Seriously.
- Pull yourself together.

781
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,480
- You can do it.
- Hey.

782
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,200
Who was that?

783
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,580
Who hit me?

784
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,480
Because I'm scared.

785
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,080
- I'm sweating so much.
- Hey.

786
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,210
They're spending more time
than Kwang Soo.

787
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,950
Who said something about
changing the channel?

788
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,030
I'm sorry.

789
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,120
(Dear viewers)

790
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,060
- Where are you looking at?
- I'm sorry.

791
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,860
I can't do it. It's too scary.

792
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,890
- Give up then.
- It feels different from up there.

793
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,890
It works better for us.

794
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,930
Jae Suk. I weigh 82kg.

795
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,630
Who are you?

796
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,740
(Who are you?)

797
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,930
I'm your brother.

798
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,240
I'm sorry. I can't see.

799
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,170
I'm quite sensitive right now.

800
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,780
I should hurry up.
I can't spend too much time.

801
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,280
What's he doing?

802
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,320
You've already spent too much time.

803
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,590
Hey. Who are you?

804
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,790
I'm your brother!

805
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,950
I'm sorry. I can't see.

806
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,950
Gosh.

807
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,680
It's funny
how he's talking to himself.

808
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,950
"I shouldn't spend too much time."
He keeps saying that.

809
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,390
This is really scary.

810
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,960
When we tried it,
it's best to crawl.

811
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,360
Who are you?

812
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,860
I'm the producer.

813
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,660
(Who are you?)

814
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,360
(I'm the producer.)

815
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,540
I'm sorry. My apologies.

816
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,980
I can't see.
Don't take it personally.

817
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,510
- "I'm the producer."
- I'm quite sensitive right now.

818
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,870
- That was funny.
- It's because I can't see.

819
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,580
- That was funny.
- I'm sorry.

820
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,410
- Well said!
- I can't see anything.

821
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,410
If you stay here, it won't stick.

822
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,020
It's driving me crazy. Jae Suk...

823
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,650
- You got it.
- It's not breaking.

824
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,260
You got it, Jae Suk.

825
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,650
Just stretch your arm.

826
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,060
- You can get to 2m.
- It's 2m.

827
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,660
- Put it there.
- That's right. Nice posture.

828
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,390
- That's good.
- Go.

829
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,600
- That's perfect.
- It's "Gang".

830
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,270
- Play "Gang".
- Play it.

831
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,390
Play "Gang".

832
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,100
(Unlike the flashy beat of "Gang",)

833
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,780
(he's moving only his fingers.)

834
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,840
Run. Now is the time.

835
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,200
- Gosh.
- Put the sticker first.

836
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,250
Put it there first.

837
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,410
Gosh, wait!

838
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,140
(Making him brave forcibly)

839
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,680
- Put the sticker, Jae Suk.
- Gosh.

840
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,110
- Get the sticker ready.
- Put the sticker. Move forward.

841
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,790
- Hey.
- Put the sticker.

842
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,060
- I can't.
- Put the sticker.

843
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,890
- Put the sticker.
- Stretch your arm.

844
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,000
- Put the sticker. That's all.
- That's all you need to do.

845
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,800
- It's hard to put the sticker.
- Do it.

846
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,130
(He's sublimating his fear
with a scream.)

847
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,660
- You got it. Just stretch your arm.
- That's making me nervous.

848
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,630
Stretch your arm.

849
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,100
You're almost there.

850
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,010
- It's breaking.
- Don't push me.

851
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,010
(Cracking)

852
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,850
(The styrofoam is about to break.)

853
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,080
- Push him.
- Don't push me.

854
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,640
(Meltdown)

855
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,080
- A little more.
- Put the sticker on!

856
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,250
- Just a little more.
- Little more.

857
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,710
Just a little more.

858
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,680
Put the sticker. A little more.

859
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,880
(Supporting Jae Suk from the back)

860
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,060
- Are you insane?
- Move forward.

861
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,260
Just put it.

862
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,000
(He's moving forward
regardless of his will.)

863
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,300
- Put it.
- It's 3m.

864
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,960
- Put the sticker.
- Put it.

865
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,130
Put the sticker and come back.

866
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,770
(Put the sticker and come back.)

867
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,270
- Jae Suk. Come back.
- How can I go back?

868
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,540
Put the sticker and come back.

869
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,040
- He did it.
- Break it.

870
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,400
- Come back.
- Come back here.

871
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,140
- Come back.
- Put the sticker.

872
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,850
(He put the sticker successfully.)

873
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,610
- He did it.
- Come back now.

874
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,590
Why doesn't it break?

875
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,650
- I'll help you.
- Wait. Jae Suk. Is it scary?

876
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,650
I'm dead here.

877
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,530
(Goodbye then.)

878
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,270
(He dies
after completing the mission.)

879
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,300
Jae Suk.

880
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,690
- He put the sticker.
- It's 3m.

881
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,070
(I did my best.)

882
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,400
Haha, that was so funny.

883
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,540
Jae Suk. Rest in peace.

884
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,980
Rest in peace.

885
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,580
Did you see that?

886
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,510
- See what?
- See what?

887
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,320
Goodness.

888
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,350
- That was very scary.
- It's approved.

889
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,680
Since you put the sticker,
we'll put up a new board.

890
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,290
Jae Suk's record is 2.94m.

891
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,880
That's close to 3m. I should've
put the sticker before falling.

892
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,590
Ji Hyo. Did you see how I did it?

893
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,120
- Isn't it scary?
- It's okay. It's safe.

894
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,150
Are you going? Okay.

895
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,530
It was all for the show.

896
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,100
Come on.

897
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,500
He's acting proud.

898
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,070
That was very elaborate acting.

899
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,190
Let's go.

900
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,510
- It was okay up to 1m.
- Ji Hyo. Crawl like me.

901
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,100
It feels different.

902
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,250
- Ji Hyo is the ace.
- She's really brave.

903
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,850
I think she's the coolest.

904
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,110
She even jumped in Macao.

905
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,280
Bungee jumping in Macao...

906
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,410
- 3, 2...
- 3, 2...

907
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,790
(It was Episode 133.)

908
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,410
(Ji Hyo jumped from 338m high
Macao Tower without hesitation.)

909
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,530
(In fact, she was smiling.)

910
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,600
(This is way too easy for her.)

911
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,620
She's not wasting any time.

912
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,500
She's moving by herself.
You should stretch your arm.

913
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,270
Put the sticker
when you're about to fall.

914
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,570
- What's gotten into you?
- Look at her.

915
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,660
You can go further.

916
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,200
(Relaxed)

917
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,350
- She got pretty far.
- She can go further.

918
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,510
(She passes Jae Suk's record.)

919
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,750
You got it.

920
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,410
- Don't go further.
- You got it.

921
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,410
(The diving board broke
when she put the sticker.)

922
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,260
(Did the sticker stay?)

923
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,760
She did it, but that must've been
very scary.

924
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,680
- Ji Hyo.
- You scared me, Ji Hyo.

925
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,790
Are you okay?

926
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,260
- She...
- I mean...

927
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,690
(He's helping Ji Hyo.)

928
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,500
- Are you okay?
- I mean...

929
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,840
Are you okay?

930
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,930
(Dragging)

931
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,660
- Ji Hyo.
- Hey.

932
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,160
(Towing service by kind Kwang Soo)

933
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,980
Are you all right?

934
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,370
I said I'm okay.

935
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,370
She's okay.

936
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,670
(Luckily, Ji Hyo is okay.)

937
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,480
What a relief. She's okay.

938
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,850
- Did it hurt when you fell?
- It was okay.

939
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,990
It doesn't hurt.

940
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,940
Hey. You saw me.

941
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,850
You cried.

942
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,590
- Hey.
- You were sobbing.

943
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,590
You saw how I did it.

944
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,530
Se Chan's pretty brave.

945
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,850
I know. He's good at
something like this.

946
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,800
- See? He's sitting down.
- That's amazing.

947
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,360
Se Chan. Just look forward.

948
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,540
I'll move with courage.

949
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,070
(He catches his breath.)

950
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,360
(Glancing)

951
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
(He moves without hesitation.)

952
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,850
- Put the sticker.
- You have to do it now.

953
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,980
(He walked to the end at once
and put the sticker.)

954
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,170
- Put the sticker.
- You have to do it now.

955
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,320
- He couldn't do it.
- He couldn't do it.

956
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,020
(He dropped the sticker.)

957
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,060
(Spinning)

958
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,950
- He couldn't do it.
- No?

959
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,100
- He couldn't do it.
- He couldn't put the sticker.

960
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,100
(Devastated)

961
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,530
- I was almost there.
- Why did you...

962
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,270
If you fall
when you're about to put it,

963
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,540
- you can't put the sticker.
- No.

964
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,660
- You have to hurry up.
- Se Chan.

965
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,630
You keep bringing the average down.

966
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,240
I'm sorry.

967
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,370
That was so close.

968
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,100
I don't think I can do it.

969
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,910
Honestly, I think I'm going to
wet my pants.

970
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,670
If I wet my pants,
it can't be on air, right?

971
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,410
They can blur it.

972
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,850
If I wet my pants, will it be aired?

973
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,060
That part will be edited out.

974
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,590
Only that part? I'm not even joking.
I think I'm going to wet my pants.

975
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,650
- Go to the restroom.
- That's not it.

976
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,500
I think I'm going to wet my pants
because I'm too scared.

977
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,730
So Min. Put the sticker
from here then.

978
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,270
- Right. You could do that.
- You could try that.

979
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
- Then...
- That's what I'm going to do.

980
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,010
I don't want to look like a coward.

981
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,130
I'm going to look like a coward.

982
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,870
So Min. Do it.

983
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,980
Go.

984
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,780
If you put the sticker at 1m...

985
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,140
If you're not going to do it,
let us know in advance.

986
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,940
Just try to the point
you can pull off.

987
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,210
- She can do it.
- I'm light.

988
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,850
I'm light. See? I'm light.

989
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,680
- Now, go.
- Just move one foot. You can do it.

990
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,060
You can lie down. It was okay
when I lied down up to 2m.

991
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,490
My heart is racing so fast.

992
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,060
So Min. If your heart is
running fast,

993
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,890
that means a good blood circulation.

994
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,690
- It means you're healthy.
- Right.

995
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,600
Lie down. That's right.

996
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,100
My heart is racing so fast.

997
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,770
It's not even slanted.

998
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,010
- It's fine because you're light.
- Because I'm light.

999
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,740
I went all the way to the end.
Lie down. That's right.

1000
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,930
- You have to increase the average.
- You can move. You won't break it.

1001
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,640
- It won't break.
- That's good.

1002
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,510
You're moving like water.

1003
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,080
Stretch your arm first, So Min.

1004
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,870
Stretch your arm and...

1005
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,290
- Get ready to put the sticker.
- You should get ready.

1006
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,990
Haha. You should push her.

1007
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,990
No. Don't.

1008
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,110
- I won't. I shouldn't do it on her.
- He won't do it.

1009
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,680
- She's crying!
- No.

1010
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,490
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.

1011
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,730
I'm not crying.
Do I look like I'm crying?

1012
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,890
Look at me. I'm not crying.

1013
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,500
- You're about to cry.
- But...

1014
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,690
I'm smiling.

1015
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,690
(She's between a smile and tears.)

1016
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,400
Don't push me. Haha. Don't push me.

1017
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,770
- I'm not.
- There's no one behind you.

1018
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,230
If you push me, I won't ever
see you again. I'll unfollow you.

1019
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,210
(Taking over a new leaf)

1020
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,380
(Cracking)

1021
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,110
- Hey.
- Wait.

1022
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,920
- It just cracked.
- Hold on.

1023
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,170
- Hang on.
- Moving backward is more dangerous.

1024
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,790
- You should move forward.
- Keep going.

1025
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,980
Hang on.

1026
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,190
Wait. Wait a second.

1027
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,610
My goal is...

1028
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,020
about 2m. I'll put this on over 2m.

1029
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,650
- Just stretch out your arm.
- You're nearly there.

1030
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,790
Move a little more.

1031
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,020
It's 2m 40cm.

1032
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,150
So Min, come a little more.

1033
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,230
(She reaches out her arm.)

1034
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,730
She should make it
as long as possible.

1035
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,560
Imagine that Dong Jun
is at the edge.

1036
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,310
(Come over here, So Min.)

1037
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,610
(Moving forward)

1038
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,500
- Stretch your arm.
- Dong Jun!

1039
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,980
I'm coming.

1040
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,670
- Dong Jun.
- It's 3m.

1041
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,670
It's 3m now.

1042
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,210
- Good.
- Dong Jun.

1043
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,310
How could she be so brave?

1044
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,110
So Min, come back.

1045
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,540
- Good.
- Dong Jun.

1046
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,380
- All right. A little more.
- Dong Jun.

1047
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,580
That's very good.

1048
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,560
- Good.
- You have 1m left.

1049
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,730
Dong Jun, I'm coming.

1050
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,190
Dong Jun, I'm coming.

1051
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,290
(The second cracking)

1052
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,460
- Dong Jun.
- Oh, no.

1053
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,900
- It cracked again. Put it on.
- Go ahead and put it on.

1054
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,270
- Put it on and come back.
- Just do it now.

1055
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,040
So Min, just put it on there.

1056
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,610
- Go ahead and stick it.
- Stick it there.

1057
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,400
- I think you can come back.
- It's not breaking.

1058
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,770
You can still come back.

1059
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,750
That's good. You can
put it on there, So Min.

1060
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,000
Yours is the furthest, So Min.

1061
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,350
(How is it possible?)

1062
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,480
Once you stick it,
yours will be the furthest.

1063
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,850
Be careful.

1064
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,110
(She puts her sticker
past Ji Hyo's.)

1065
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,520
You should come back.

1066
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,650
How can I go back?

1067
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,460
- Do you need help?
- Just push me off.

1068
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,690
- So Min, do you want my help?
- Just...

1069
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,860
push me off.

1070
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,150
Just kill me.

1071
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,600
(Just kill me.)

1072
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,230
Just kill me.

1073
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,600
- Why would they kill you?
- Kill me.

1074
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,170
- Se Chan.
- What?

1075
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,830
Go ahead and kill me. Hurry.

1076
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,100
(She asks her friend Se Chan
the last favor.)

1077
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,940
- It will be over soon.
- Push the edge.

1078
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,330
- Take care.
- I'll pull you from here.

1079
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,110
We can pull you from here.

1080
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,500
- Be happy.
- My gosh.

1081
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,380
(She wishes her friend happiness
like a scene from a movie.)

1082
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,210
Oh, no.

1083
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,610
(She falls down bravely.)

1084
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:15,150
(She overcame her fear
with the power of love.)

1085
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,480
You fell down safely.

1086
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,150
- So Min, you're in first place.
- Am I?

1087
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,330
She's unbelievable.

1088
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,630
I could do it thanks to Dong Jun.

1089
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,790
I owe it to Dong Jun.

1090
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,360
So Min's record is 330cm.

1091
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,540
- That's great.
- Thank you.

1092
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,360
Next up is Haha.

1093
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,440
Haha.

1094
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,500
Haha, hurry.

1095
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,350
Haha, it's no big deal.

1096
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,580
Seriously, it's nothing.

1097
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,580
This is what I'm going to do.

1098
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,880
- I'll jump high...
- There you go.

1099
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,080
and put on the sticker
before falling down.

1100
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,710
- Okay. That's cool.
- But this will be...

1101
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,210
- It's a good idea.
- just fine.

1102
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,330
- Okay.
- Exactly.

1103
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,630
- That would be really cool.
- Go ahead and do it.

1104
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,690
Just do it.

1105
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,290
- If you make it...
- It'll be so cool.

1106
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,560
I guess my record would be about 3m.

1107
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,830
Who are you talking to?

1108
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,310
- My hands are sweating.
- Who is he talking to now?

1109
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,400
Is someone up there?

1110
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,500
Are you seeing things?

1111
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,900
And this will be fine.

1112
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,610
It will be fine.

1113
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,810
(But I don't think I'll be fine.)

1114
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,980
It's his wish.

1115
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,810
I will save time to replace it.

1116
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,810
- He's hypnotizing himself.
- What is he saying?

1117
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,980
Who is he talking to?

1118
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,880
So you will jump to the edge
and put on the sticker.

1119
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,960
- Give me 10 seconds.
- Look at his face.

1120
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,690
Who is he talking to?

1121
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,960
- Is someone up there?
- You have five seconds left.

1122
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,520
- There he goes.
- Four.

1123
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,130
- Three.
- Don't. I'll count down myself.

1124
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,290
(Deadly pale)

1125
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,860
- I'm sorry.
- Or I'd run up there.

1126
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,040
I'll jump as you get here.
Come running now.

1127
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,830
Is that so?

1128
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,040
He needs someone to follow him.

1129
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,770
That will work.

1130
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,040
- Someone's following you.
- Look back.

1131
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,940
- Someone's following you.
- It's a murderer.

1132
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,110
You have to jump!

1133
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,880
- Haha!
- There he is.

1134
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,980
- Haha.
- He's almost there.

1135
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,150
He's coming.

1136
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,920
Haha.

1137
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,810
- He will push you from the back.
- He's a murderer.

1138
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,250
(He jumped.)

1139
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,560
(The coward soars up
in a fierce chase.)

1140
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,770
(Did Haha put on the sticker
before falling off like he said?)

1141
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,020
- What was that?
- What?

1142
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,670
- Did he put it on?
- Did it stick?

1143
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,730
It did.

1144
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,810
(Unbelievable)

1145
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,710
(He managed to put
the sticker on the board.)

1146
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,130
(He flew up like a butterfly
and stung like a bee.)

1147
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,940
(It is almost 3m.)

1148
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,250
- Really?
- What did he do?

1149
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,980
- It worked.
- That was unique.

1150
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,920
Haha, well done.

1151
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,250
- You did it.
- It's fine.

1152
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,690
I saved you some time to replace it.

1153
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,860
- That was really cool.
- You did it, Haha.

1154
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,690
That was amazing.

1155
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,920
Was it cool?

1156
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,190
(Haha's record is 280cm.)

1157
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,020
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

1158
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,630
He seems so relaxed.

1159
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,770
I think he will just smash it.

1160
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,330
He doesn't seem nervous at all.

1161
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,540
- Do I stick it?
- Are you going to jump?

1162
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,730
Will you jump just like that?

1163
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,480
- What?
- What's with him?

1164
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,540
I'll jump from here.

1165
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,110
I'll jump to the side like Haha did.

1166
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,540
Jong Kook, I think...

1167
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,750
it will be really cool...

1168
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,270
if you jump
and turn around like this.

1169
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,040
Will you stay quiet?

1170
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,850
- Jump and...
- That's ridiculous.

1171
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,560
You turn around
and put the sticker on 3m.

1172
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,650
That doesn't make sense.

1173
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,830
Are you a stunt man or something?

1174
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,360
Let me start.

1175
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,100
(He checks the landing spot.)

1176
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,860
- He's unbelievable.
- He doesn't seem afraid at all.

1177
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,190
Here I go.

1178
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,690
1, 2,

1179
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,900
- He's not afraid.
- and 3.

1180
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,960
(He jumps right away.)

1181
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,880
(He jumps lightly and puts
the sticker on the exact spot.)

1182
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,210
- It didn't even break.
- He didn't break it.

1183
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,310
What's his record?

1184
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,580
Did it stick?

1185
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,770
It's 320cm.

1186
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,520
Suk Jin will use this
as it is, right?

1187
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,920
- I heard it crack.
- It snapped.

1188
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,110
- Aren't you replacing it?
- It stuck.

1189
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,210
He should use it as it is.

1190
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,610
It snapped.
Two people used it already.

1191
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,520
- No.
- I made that sound.

1192
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,420
Snap. Snap. I made that sound.

1193
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,900
- Two people used it already.
- Petty Gang!

1194
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,630
- Two people jumped off the board.
- Petty Gang.

1195
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,830
They're out of boards now.

1196
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,000
Darn it.

1197
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,400
Petty is coming.

1198
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,670
Do you have a saw?
I should saw it a little.

1199
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,080
It's slanted. Two people used it.

1200
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,270
- It's always like that.
- No.

1201
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,540
This isn't right.

1202
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,710
It's not that bad.

1203
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,900
That's how it always looks.

1204
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,940
Gosh, this is too high.

1205
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,670
Wouldn't I get hurt as I fall down?

1206
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,580
- It's okay. It doesn't hurt.
- No. No one got hurt.

1207
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,020
- Gosh, it snapped.
- It's soft down here.

1208
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,960
- There's something no one tried.
- What?

1209
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,080
Rolling.

1210
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,460
That's ridiculous.

1211
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,730
(He sets up his bristles.)

1212
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,230
Why are you swearing at me?

1213
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,860
- I'm sorry.
- It was just an idea.

1214
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,190
I'm sorry. I get it.

1215
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,690
I love you.

1216
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,810
- What?
- What's going on?

1217
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,060
He will use his foot.

1218
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,380
(Why is he taking off his shoes?)

1219
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,630
All right. You should do that.

1220
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,980
(He will stretch out his leg
and puts the sticker.)

1221
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,540
I'm sure he will get a cramp
in his toes.

1222
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,900
(The boss of Petty Gang
came up with a brilliant idea.)

1223
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,310
- I agree.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

1224
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,920
Suk Jin is...

1225
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,520
I can tell he studied business
administration at Ajou University.

1226
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,290
He's really different.

1227
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,330
- He's something else.
- Like how?

1228
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,230
He's a genius
in business administration.

1229
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,560
He plays games
in a whole different way.

1230
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,790
We will play H.O.T's song.

1231
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,170
And you can move forward
jumping on your buttocks.

1232
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,860
(Jumping)

1233
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,230
- To H.O.T's song.
- Good.

1234
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,000
You can dance like Moon Hee Joon.

1235
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,330
It's creaking already.

1236
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,110
Suk Jin, raise your arms.

1237
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,250
- There you go.
- It's done.

1238
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,480
Jump on your buttocks.

1239
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,040
(As the music starts...)

1240
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,810
(Dancing)

1241
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,980
He's dancing to the rhythm.

1242
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,540
- He's getting into the rhythm.
- Hey.

1243
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,960
I'm not in the mood for that.

1244
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,060
Isn't this it?

1245
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,860
- I'm not in the mood for that.
- I'll play something else.

1246
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,460
I don't think I can do this
with my foot.

1247
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,860
It won't work.

1248
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,960
- All right. It's done.
- It's "Gang".

1249
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,130
- You can do this.
- There you go.

1250
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,130
- This is it.
- He's clenching his teeth.

1251
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,830
- He's coming.
- You're cool.

1252
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,670
Just do it at one go.

1253
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,810
- Go.
- He's moving.

1254
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,980
(He crawls forward
and puts the sticker.)

1255
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,150
He did it.

1256
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,850
- He did it.
- It stuck.

1257
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,250
You were like Kwang Soo.

1258
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,650
It's 290cm.

1259
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,860
I did it anyway.

1260
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,650
Petty Gang is impressive.

1261
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,560
(It's the dignity
of the boss of Petty Gang.)

1262
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,020
I want to join Petty Gang.

1263
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,420
(He doesn't really mean it.)

1264
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,460
- You're lying, right?
- Yes.

1265
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,040
(Asking quietly)

1266
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,730
Guys, the first mission is over.

1267
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,360
- The first place is...
- We don't know it yet.

1268
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,810
Jong Kook with the record of 315cm.

1269
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,210
- Okay.
- Where did I put it?

1270
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,400
- It's your fault.
- It's his personal record.

1271
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:16,110
The second place is Suk Jin
with the record of 280cm.

1272
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,540
Oh, dear.

1273
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,690
Petty Gang is really cool.

1274
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:22,020
The third place is the five members
with the record of 244.8cm.

1275
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,190
- Oh, no.
- I'm really sorry.

1276
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,960
My sticker didn't stick.

1277
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,000
And Kwang Soo is the last.

1278
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,190
What do they do with the last?

1279
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,860
Are you the last?
You failed to stick it, right?

1280
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,690
Kwang Soo has just
got one more penalty ball.

1281
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,560
Jong Kook will hear the keyword
and decide what to do.

1282
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,040
Whether you will cut it or not.

1283
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,380
The next keyword is...

1284
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,480
- a car game.
- What?

1285
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
- A car?
- It's a game played in a car.

1286
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,080
In a car?

1287
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,440
A car game wouldn't be easy.

1288
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,580
It won't be easy.
It must be difficult.

1289
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,210
It's better to do it alone.

1290
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,040
- I think playing alone is better.
- That's better.

1291
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,310
Cut it like this.

1292
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,750
- Split us.
- You can split us like this.

1293
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,360
- Split us here.
- Okay.

1294
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,020
I'll split them like this.

1295
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,630
- Thank you.
- Kwang Soo will lose anyway.

1296
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,670
Let's move to the next
destination to eat then.

1297
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,790
Playing alone is better.

1298
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,900
(They will play a game in the car
heading to the restaurant.)

1299
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,170
Are you hungry, guys?

1300
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,360
- Yes.
- I'm starving.

1301
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,940
You're eating grilled beef patties.

1302
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,580
What's grilled beef patties?

1303
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,540
It's like tteok galbi
made with beef.

1304
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,480
- Tteok galbi?
- That sounds great.

1305
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,310
But it's not that you all
will get to eat it.

1306
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,710
You will play games
and get the food accordingly.

1307
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,610
Does it have something to do
with cutting off again?

1308
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,690
- Sure.
- It's the same.

1309
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,920
- With the average?
- Yes.

1310
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,520
- We have to do this well.
- We have to eat.

1311
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,860
Here's the second mission.

1312
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,560
It's Losing Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1313
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,400
You will take turns
to play the game.

1314
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,500
It's worth a try.

1315
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,690
- I'm good at losing.
- The rules are simple.

1316
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,770
I'll say rock-paper-scissors, go.

1317
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,940
I'll say "go".

1318
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,230
And I will play first.

1319
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,110
And you will play to lose
as I say "go".

1320
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,500
(The members should see what
the PD shows and lose the game.)

1321
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,250
- It's simple.
- I think I'm good at this.

1322
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,150
- That's easy.
- I've done it before.

1323
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,350
You want us to eat.

1324
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,150
You will get points
as many times as you lose.

1325
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,860
- Okay.
- That's not difficult.

1326
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,580
- It's easy.
- So I should show paper?

1327
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,080
You should lose.

1328
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,860
Should I show rock
as he says "go"?

1329
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,690
- Jae Suk, you go first.
- Okay.

1330
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,360
You have to lose to the director.

1331
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,360
- This is so easy.
- As you say "go"?

1332
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,940
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1333
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,860
- There you go.
- I see.

1334
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,460
Kwang Soo, stay quiet.

1335
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,000
- I'm playing a game here.
- Seriously.

1336
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,440
Kwang Soo, can't you see
that I'm playing a game here?

1337
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,850
You'll fail anyway.

1338
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,940
You'll see. I'm good at this.

1339
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,040
- I'm good at losing.
- But I bet you'll win.

1340
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,580
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1341
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,940
(Jae Suk proudly wins
when he should lose.)

1342
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,810
It should've been scissors.

1343
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,420
- He's out, right?
- Right.

1344
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,730
- You need to lose.
- Let me try again.

1345
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,980
- I'll play again.
- What do you mean?

1346
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,330
- Let me go again.
- You're out.

1347
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:43,400
- We'll all get another chance then.
- I'll go again.

1348
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,630
You can't do that.

1349
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,000
- Unbelievable.
- Okay, let's do this.

1350
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,690
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Go.

1351
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,400
(Se Chan succeeds.)

1352
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,810
- Okay.
- Good.

1353
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,830
- Nice one.
- That's one point.

1354
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,230
- One point.
- We need to lose.

1355
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,500
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Go.

1356
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,270
(He wins.)

1357
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,440
- Seriously?
- It's not as easy as it seems.

1358
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,670
- Are you kidding me?
- It's not easy.

1359
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,310
- It's not that easy.
- Exactly.

1360
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,170
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Are you kidding me?

1361
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,210
- It's not easy.
- Not at all.

1362
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,580
Why would they have made
a game out of this?

1363
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,790
- You only have a split second.
- It's not easy.

1364
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,110
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1365
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,750
- See?
- You failed.

1366
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,480
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1367
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:13,920
See?

1368
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,000
Is it that hard?

1369
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,060
It's not that easy.

1370
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,460
- Jong Kook, you're next.
- Got it.

1371
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,670
Watch and learn.

1372
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:22,940
"Losing is winning"
has always been my motto.

1373
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,610
(How many rounds
will Jong Kook be able to win?)

1374
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,060
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Go.

1375
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,110
(Paper!)

1376
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,580
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Go.

1377
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:34,210
(He wins the match
after shouting "go.")

1378
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,670
(How adorable.)

1379
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,380
- He was slightly late too.
- It's not easy.

1380
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,750
- He was late.
- I lost all our practice rounds.

1381
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,080
I'm just wired to win.

1382
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:42,920
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1383
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,560
(Kwang Soo loses with paper.)

1384
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,650
- Okay!
- But you won.

1385
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,250
- What?
- I had rock.

1386
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,000
- He wasn't playing you.
- What are you talking about?

1387
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,170
Unbelievable.

1388
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:54,830
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1389
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,000
Okay!

1390
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,670
- He's good at this.
- He's quite good.

1391
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,710
It needs to be played faster.

1392
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,810
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1393
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:01,880
Okay!

1394
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:03,730
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1395
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,770
Okay!

1396
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:05,880
- Gosh.
- He's really good at this.

1397
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,610
- He's good at losing.
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1398
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,770
- He already has four points.
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1399
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,880
(He finally finds a game
he's good at.)

1400
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,980
I won four points.

1401
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,190
I don't want to win. I want to lose.

1402
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,520
I've set everything aside.

1403
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
- I want to lose.
- Hold on.

1404
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,460
Your eyes are full of greed.

1405
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,130
Your eyes are full of greed.

1406
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,500
- You'll win in the first round.
- Your eyes are full of greed.

1407
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,460
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Go.

1408
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,900
(So Min: scissors, Director: rock)

1409
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,060
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Go.

1410
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,230
(She loses the first round
with scissors.)

1411
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,830
- You were a bit slow.
- Exactly.

1412
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,710
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1413
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,770
(She succeeds
in the next round too.)

1414
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:40,900
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1415
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,940
(She succeeds in the 3rd round too.)

1416
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,580
- Get one more point for us.
- My gosh.

1417
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,290
- I've let it all down.
- We only need a point to lead.

1418
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,710
I've set a lot of my greed aside.

1419
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,080
- I can't believe I couldn't lose.
- I'm just a loser.

1420
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,130
I'm a complete loser.

1421
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,790
Play or lose.

1422
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,520
It should be
"Rock-paper-scissors, go."

1423
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,520
Go ahead.

1424
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,960
- Don't change it up.
- Pick up the speed though.

1425
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,230
Teach him a lesson.

1426
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,230
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Rock!

1427
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,560
(Rock!)

1428
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,770
(She fails to lose another round.)

1429
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,860
Nice!

1430
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,960
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Rock!

1431
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,610
(Smack!)

1432
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,610
- What...
- It's your fault!

1433
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,770
- He was helping you.
- I told you what to put out.

1434
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:09,940
He told you the right answer.

1435
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,270
The right one was rock.

1436
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,210
- Is this allowed?
- Why do it anyway?

1437
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,940
She should've been able to focus.

1438
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,980
He made me lose my focus.

1439
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,080
Still, she scored three points.
We're in the lead, right?

1440
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,690
- Just memorize it, okay?
- Ji Hyo will fail for sure.

1441
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:21,880
Don't you dare win.

1442
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,210
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1443
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,690
(She easily manages
to lose the first round.)

1444
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,860
- Okay.
- She's good at this.

1445
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,080
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1446
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,600
- That's 1 point.
- She got 1 point.

1447
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,730
It's our turn now.

1448
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,170
- Can we get another turn?
- Let's try that again.

1449
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,400
- Exactly.
- We now know how it's done.

1450
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,460
We've got the hang of it now.

1451
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,540
- Sure.
- All right.

1452
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,360
- We know how to play it now.
- The points will be added.

1453
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,770
- Okay.
- We have to lose.

1454
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,630
Just watch. I'm done playing nice.

1455
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,880
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1456
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,800
You failed.

1457
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,200
- Seriously?
- What was that?

1458
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,370
You're superb at playing games.

1459
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,570
- Hold on.
- You're superb at playing games.

1460
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,470
- Give me another chance.
- We didn't expect you to win.

1461
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:59,780
- Another chance?
- Come on.

1462
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,070
- Give me another chance.
- No way.

1463
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,070
Let me try again.

1464
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,140
- We should move on.
- Hold on.

1465
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,550
Are you being this way now that
"Infinite Challenge" is over?

1466
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,360
- Hold on.
- What?

1467
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,890
- That's out of the blue.
- What was that?

1468
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:10,890
Why would you suddenly
mention "Infinite Challenge"?

1469
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,050
What's wrong with you?

1470
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,160
- Why would you mention that show?
- All I want is another chance.

1471
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,930
Hold on!

1472
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,160
What did you mean by that?

1473
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,260
Will the show be revived?

1474
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,370
No, that's not it.

1475
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,370
Jong Kook, you're next.

1476
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,370
Hold on second. Let me focus!

1477
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,840
I've got this! I'm ready.

1478
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,970
- You only have to lose.
- Got it.

1479
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,680
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1480
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,280
You failed.

1481
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,470
Rock-paper-scissors, go

1482
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,820
You failed.

1483
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,390
- He can't lose.
- He can't.

1484
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,620
- He's wired to win.
- Losing is not in his DNA.

1485
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,220
- Exactly.
- All right, guys.

1486
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,450
In first place is Kwang Soo
with four points.

1487
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:45,530
Okay!

1488
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,360
In second place
with only 0.5 points behind are...

1489
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,530
(Kwang Soo: 4 points)

1490
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,720
Haha, So Min, and Ji Hyo.

1491
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,890
Wait, don't we have a point?

1492
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,570
- No, you have 0.5 points.
- Right, we have to divide it.

1493
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,970
That puts you in third place.

1494
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,640
The remaining two
both have zero points,

1495
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,370
but Suk Jin is last.

1496
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,240
Let's grab some lunch then.

1497
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:03,840
(What will they receive
for today's lunch?)

1498
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,910
- It's not for me though.
- What's this?

1499
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,570
Check this out!

1500
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:08,300
Was this for today's lunch?

1501
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,680
(Juicy grilled beef patties)

1502
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,720
No way.

1503
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,910
Look.

1504
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,050
What is all this?

1505
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,220
Must 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place share?

1506
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,550
(The team in 5th place
doesn't get any patties.)

1507
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,990
The ranking hasn't been fixed
just yet though.

1508
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,990
- What?
- Why not?

1509
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,200
The one in first place
can shift things around.

1510
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,160
That's right!

1511
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,700
If I choose a team,
will that team...

1512
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,390
be able to eat with me?

1513
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,840
We'll calculate the average.

1514
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,070
Kwang Soo.

1515
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,870
- Kwang Soo...
- Come on.

1516
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:37,800
You're better off with us since
they already have three people.

1517
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,300
Join me,
and you'll still be in first place.

1518
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,410
Can he choose to be his own team?

1519
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,470
- You'll still be in first place.
- Kwang Soo.

1520
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,510
- I...
- Cut this tie.

1521
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,550
I'll team up Jong Kook and Suk Jin.

1522
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,620
- Those two?
- Us two?

1523
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,090
I'll team up Jong Kook and Suk Jin.

1524
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,720
- Those two?
- Us two?

1525
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,550
You'll be the team
in last place and eat that.

1526
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:53,760
- Okay.
- What did you say?

1527
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,990
(What did you say?)

1528
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,820
- Consider the next game too.
- That's why I teamed them up.

1529
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,200
- Okay.
- Am I getting a penalty ball?

1530
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,090
- Nice!
- And Suk Jin too.

1531
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:03,390
- Good one.
- We should end Kwang Soo.

1532
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,260
Jong Kook, we should end him.

1533
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,470
Today, my target is Kwang Soo.

1534
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:08,680
Kwang Soo...

1535
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,640
I'll make sure he suffers
a physical injury today.

1536
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,410
May I change my mind?

1537
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,280
You made up your mind...

1538
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,550
without listening to
what the next game is.

1539
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,390
Just you wait and see.

1540
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,550
What you'll need is
a survival skill.

1541
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,620
(Requirements for the next game:
Survival skill)

1542
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,720
It's not bad for me.

1543
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,160
I lucked out in a way.

1544
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,820
(His life is under threat.)

1545
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,160
Here it comes.

1546
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,620
(Lunch time)

1547
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,990
- Kwang Soo, enjoy.
- Right.

1548
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,370
- I'm only playing by the rules.
- There's more than one.

1549
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,840
- It must've been just cooked.
- It's really good.

1550
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:43,610
This is just the story of my life.

1551
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,110
Even here, I've been given fish.

1552
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:48,280
(Only Suk Jin and Jong Kook
miss out on the patties.)

1553
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,720
(Kwang Soo gets up.)

1554
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,010
It's really good though.

1555
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,780
This...

1556
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,180
This...

1557
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,760
It's quite good.

1558
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:02,360
(He realizes the danger he's in
and delivers patties to Jong Kook.)

1559
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:06,570
(You know how I feel, right?)

1560
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,930
He got some on your arm.

1561
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:09,740
(Kwang Soo got sauce
on Jong Kook's arm?)

1562
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,070
You should wipe it off.

1563
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,570
(Kwang Soo goes back
without realizing it.)

1564
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,160
He got sauce on my arm.

1565
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:18,570
Why are you eating my patties?

1566
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,180
Why...

1567
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,300
(During that time,
the two sisters stole his food.)

1568
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:25,340
(He gets sauce on Jong Kook
and has his food stolen by the two.)

1569
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,510
(What will happen to Kwang Soo
in the final round?)

1570
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,280
(After lunch...)

1571
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,090
I think I see water guns.

1572
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,930
No way. Wait, what's this?

1573
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,800
That's my son's favorite.

1574
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,450
Hold on. Those are water guns.

1575
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:38,590
This must be it.

1576
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,590
It's better to be
a one-man team then.

1577
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,820
Being in a group is worse.

1578
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,370
It'll be uncomfortable
to be tethered to each other.

1579
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,430
Here's the last game of the day.

1580
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:49,530
The last game is all about
being the last man standing.

1581
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,180
This is the Survival Balloon War.

1582
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,740
(Final game: Survival Balloon War)

1583
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,910
The game will consist
of two 20-minute halves.

1584
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,010
- Each team will have 30 bullets.
- Good.

1585
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,320
And you'll wear a vest
with five balloon attached to it.

1586
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:05,360
If all of your balloons are popped,
you'll be eliminated.

1587
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,950
The one eliminated
must give up his or her gun...

1588
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,300
but still run around with the team.

1589
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,800
(Once eliminated,
the gun must be given back.)

1590
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,370
Even if all of your balloons
get popped,

1591
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,490
you'll have to stay tethered
to your team but without a gun.

1592
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,870
- Must I drag him along with me?
- Yes.

1593
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,740
What do you mean
you'll drag him along?

1594
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,280
- Hold on.
- Drag him along?

1595
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,410
- Must you say it like that?
- That's how it'll be.

1596
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,200
Don't be like that.
I can shoot at first, you know.

1597
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,840
- But still...
- "I can shoot you!"

1598
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,280
(He expresses his enthusiasm
with a line from "Tazza".)

1599
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,720
I'm talking about after
you're eliminated.

1600
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,860
- "I can shoot you!"
- I can!

1601
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,820
- Unbelievable.
- Each team will get 30 bullets,

1602
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,280
so how you divide them
is important.

1603
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,090
We shouldn't waste them.

1604
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:45,470
You can pick up the bullets
shot by an opponent.

1605
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,870
That's not bad.

1606
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:49,240
And during the race,
you should also...

1607
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,240
There are 100 table tennis balls
hidden in the building.

1608
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,530
The more balls you find,
the more points you get.

1609
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,070
- My goodness.
- I see.

1610
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:58,300
When only one team is left,
the round ends.

1611
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:01,570
And each member of the winning team
will receive 10 table tennis balls.

1612
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,140
- 100 in total?
- Playing individually won't matter.

1613
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,820
- Kwang Soo is alone.
- At the end of the race,

1614
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,010
the number of the balls...

1615
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,450
There are three people on my team.
Will the number of the balls...

1616
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:10,760
we found be tallied?

1617
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,120
No, we'll calculate
the average number.

1618
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,320
But the winner in the winning team
will choose a benefit.

1619
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,490
- If you find the most balls...
- That's right.

1620
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:18,390
- We should find a lot of balls.
- Correct.

1621
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:20,590
Now, please move to
your starting place.

1622
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:21,620
Okay.

1623
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,240
(Each team will move to
their starting place.)

1624
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,530
The more we find, the better for us
because we have many members.

1625
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,070
(They have many balloons
as they're a team of many people.)

1626
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,510
I'm counting on you two.

1627
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:34,550
I played with this toy
with Dream so many times.

1628
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,340
- You must be good at using it.
- Haha, but this...

1629
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,820
We shouldn't pop
each other's balloons.

1630
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,620
Of course. We should keep
as many of them as possible.

1631
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,280
- As many as possible.
- Yes.

1632
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,860
You got a penalty ball, right?

1633
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,390
- You got one too, right?
- Yes, I did.

1634
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,120
- So did Kwang Soo, right?
- Who didn't?

1635
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,260
We should eliminate
those who didn't get any.

1636
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,160
- That'd be So Min's team.
- Exactly.

1637
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,530
We should eliminate them all first.

1638
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,530
I think we should shoot the target
together.

1639
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,530
So that at least one of us
gets the target.

1640
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,490
- If I go this way, you go that way.
- Exactly.

1641
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,070
It'll be most advantageous
for Kwang Soo.

1642
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,160
He's playing individually.

1643
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,140
It was a good strategy.

1644
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,410
It was good that I made those two
into one team.

1645
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,450
(The one-man team is
fully satisfied.)

1646
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,970
Gosh. This won't work.

1647
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,720
(He has fewer balloons,
but better mobility.)

1648
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,140
Okay. Good. I'm ready.

1649
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,010
I know it doesn't hurt.

1650
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,050
(He's showing off his skill
by shooting the staff.)

1651
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,680
Just wait and see
who will survive to the end.

1652
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,680
(The lonely killer Kwang Soo
is ready for the battle.)

1653
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,320
I'll show you what I can do.
I'm serious.

1654
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,890
The race begins in five seconds.

1655
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:29,390
5, 4, 3...

1656
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:30,430
(They must survive long
and find many balls.)

1657
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:31,530
Two.

1658
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,700
One. The race begins now.

1659
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,800
The race starts.

1660
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,410
(The race starts.)

1661
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,840
I should find
table tennis balls too.

1662
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,700
(The team that finds the most balls
before losing the balloons wins.)

1663
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,010
- I get more points if I find balls.
- Correct.

1664
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,970
I'm going to find
some table tennis balls.

1665
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:46,140
At the store... Oh, there it is.

1666
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,280
(Oh, there it is.)

1667
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,780
(He found the first table tennis
ball behind the bulletin board.)

1668
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,390
Put it in the bag.

1669
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,990
I have this weird feeling.

1670
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,120
I have a feeling that I'm going to
surprise everyone.

1671
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,840
(He only found 1 out of 100 balls.)

1672
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,640
(But he seems so confident.)

1673
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,910
(He pressed the top floor
with confidence.)

1674
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,610
Hiding yourself from your enemies
is important in a battle like this.

1675
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,620
And always take over
the highest ground.

1676
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,240
(Lee Kwang Soo,
100 percent confident)

1677
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,180
It's hard to shoot from below.
However...

1678
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,180
You can see the back of your enemies
from above.

1679
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,120
(Winking)

1680
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,860
(He arrived on the top floor
while talking big.)

1681
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,320
What is this place?

1682
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,260
- It's locked.
- What?

1683
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,530
(The door is locked.)

1684
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,840
Everyone, what I said earlier
was a joke.

1685
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,510
(Everyone, what I said earlier
was a joke.)

1686
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,510
- It already left.
- Darn it.

1687
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:43,740
(He was going to go back down,
but it was too late.)

1688
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,870
(While Kwang Soo failed
to use his mobility...)

1689
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,840
I can't even walk fast because
I'm afraid I might pop a balloon.

1690
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,840
I know.

1691
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,240
100 balls are a lot.

1692
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,840
- Look closely.
- Okay.

1693
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,990
I found a table tennis ball.

1694
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:56,280
- Where is it?
- Okay.

1695
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,220
It's on the camera holder. Okay.

1696
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,390
Okay.

1697
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:00,890
Things are going smoothly.

1698
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:02,800
It's good.

1699
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,950
How about we share
the balls evenly?

1700
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:05,990
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

1701
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,220
Let's share them.

1702
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,220
(Haha's team members are searching
for table tennis balls.)

1703
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,760
- Okay.
- We can't steal balls, right?

1704
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,530
Correct.

1705
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,140
- There's another one.
- Hey, there... Good.

1706
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,800
- You're good at finding it.
- I want one too.

1707
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,410
- There it is.
- I want one too.

1708
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,740
(There it is.)

1709
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,910
I want one too. It's mine.
It's my turn, Haha.

1710
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,010
- Stop it.
- It's mine.

1711
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,340
- It's all about trust.
- It's my turn.

1712
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,720
- My gosh.
- All right. Wait.

1713
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,410
I'm supposed to have it.

1714
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,820
Okay, So Min. All right.

1715
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,010
I'll compete against you
if you keep going like this.

1716
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,390
You two are being too sensitive.

1717
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:33,590
Why would you say such a thing?

1718
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,390
- We're a team.
- We can take turns to have a ball.

1719
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,590
- Is there another one?
- We agreed to share them.

1720
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,970
- Aren't you going to share them?
- Of course, I'll share them.

1721
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,640
(Ji Hyo is betraying them.)

1722
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,260
Hey, stop. Wait.

1723
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:47,640
(Ji Hyo who has no intention of
sharing balls is walking forward.)

1724
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,280
She's dragging us both.

1725
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,180
- I found one.
- Gosh, seriously.

1726
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,550
(They're trying to stop her,
but she's monstrously strong.)

1727
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,720
A table tennis ball.

1728
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,740
(The monstrous strength
created for a table tennis ball)

1729
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,180
- Hey. We can share...
- You might pop the balloons.

1730
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,240
(She fell behind
while showing off her strength.)

1731
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,220
(She could've lost balloons
while getting a ball.)

1732
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,220
Let's find them first
and share them later.

1733
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,620
(Unlike what she said, she doesn't
seem to want to share them.)

1734
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,070
There must be
a few around here, right?

1735
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:14,490
I thought so too,
but I couldn't find any.

1736
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:15,590
Let's keep searching.

1737
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,030
Left or right?

1738
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:20,030
Left. Let's go to the left.

1739
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,610
- Here it is. What did I tell you?
- Come over here.

1740
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,530
(They walked
in the opposite directions.)

1741
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,450
(While Jong Kook found a ball...)

1742
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,950
- He never listens to me.
- I can't pull him toward me.

1743
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,320
- Hey!
- Come here, Suk Jin.

1744
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,840
Come on.

1745
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,340
- Hey, but I want to...
- Suk Jin.

1746
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,260
- Search places like this.
- There...

1747
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,510
- There's another one here.
- Gosh.

1748
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,820
- He's driving me insane.
- Look.

1749
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,390
- Why won't you look in there?
- Wait.

1750
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,260
Why are you taking all the balls?
Come here.

1751
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,950
- Suk Jin, come this way first.
- Why that little...

1752
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,530
If we go that way,
you'll take another ball.

1753
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,320
- Let's search there first.
- You'll take it again.

1754
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,430
Come here. There's more here.

1755
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:49,640
I want to...

1756
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,740
Let's keep going this way.

1757
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:53,510
Fine. I'm coming.

1758
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,030
- Hey. Wait.
- Let's go.

1759
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:56,700
- Let's shoot them together.
- Let's go.

1760
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,010
(While they're distracted,
Team White starts the attack.)

1761
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,050
Wait up.

1762
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,280
Suk Jin, someone is coming.
They're coming.

1763
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:06,910
Behind us.

1764
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,950
Jae Suk is coming towards us.
Get ready.

1765
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:11,550
(The ambush failed.
They should fight head-on.)

1766
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,820
Get ready.

1767
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,780
You want a fight?

1768
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:17,620
Jae Suk, let's find
table tennis balls first.

1769
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,220
Once any one of us shoots,
it will be a total chaos.

1770
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,340
- Exactly.
- Hey.

1771
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,430
- We won't just die for nothing.
- Don't shoot.

1772
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,760
- I'm just saying...
- Don't shoot.

1773
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,760
We don't have to do this.

1774
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,510
If you start shooting,
we will shoot you too.

1775
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:31,340
What? Are you going to shoot us?

1776
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,450
- We'll shoot back.
- What?

1777
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,740
(At that moment,
a bullet was shot!)

1778
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,740
- What happened?
- Gosh.

1779
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,910
- Look at that.
- Are you going to shoot us?

1780
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,620
(The lonely killer showed up!)

1781
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,450
(Kwang Soo ambushed them
using his mobility.)

1782
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,320
(He's actually taken aback.)

1783
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,680
He's going to use up his bullets.

1784
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:54,430
(He only wasted his bullets
and retreated.)

1785
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:57,340
- Stop.
- We won't shoot at each other.

1786
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,010
- Why not?
- Let's pick up those bullets.

1787
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,030
Let's go.

1788
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:02,610
(They picked up the bullets
keeping an eye on each other.)

1789
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,070
(The toy gun war is
about to break out.)

1790
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,700
(Peace didn't last long.)

1791
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,820
(The two teams started
shooting at each other.)

1792
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,840
You're shooting us?

1793
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,010
(While Suk Jin was moving around
being flustered...)

1794
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,050
- I'm going to shoot.
- What?

1795
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,090
(Pop)

1796
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:21,390
(Jong Kook's balloon popped
because of the bullet in his hand.)

1797
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:26,220
(He became more aggressive without
knowing he popped it himself.)

1798
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,340
(Nothing can stop them now.)

1799
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,030
- I'm going to shoot.
- What?

1800
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,030
(Jae Suk hit
one of Suk Jin's balloons.)

1801
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,140
Why would they pop so easily?

1802
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,140
(The protruding mouth brothers
are on a roll.)

1803
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,240
Suk Jin, I'll be in the front.

1804
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,550
(Another balloon on Jong Kook's back
popped.)

1805
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:47,820
(He's at the highest anger level.)

1806
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,050
They won't pop.

1807
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,820
(He moved forward while attacking
without looking behind.)

1808
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,950
(While he was attacking them,)

1809
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:59,490
(he lost two more balloons.)

1810
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,260
- Take this.
- Hey.

1811
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,570
Jong Kook, you have
only one balloon left. Stop.

1812
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,340
You have only one balloon left.

1813
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,200
You'll be eliminated
if you lose all. Wait.

1814
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:08,970
- Let's step backwards.
- Okay.

1815
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,010
(Team White is making
a strategic retreat.)

1816
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:11,740
(While the two teams repeat
attack and retreat...)

1817
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,140
- Let's step backwards.
- Okay.

1818
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,240
(While the two teams repeat
attack and retreat...)

1819
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,550
(The lonely killer Kwang Soo is
approaching them from behind.)

1820
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:20,010
(Kwang Soo came to attack them!)

1821
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,090
(Kwang Soo is here!)

1822
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,390
- Jae Suk, Kwang Soo is coming.
- Attack!

1823
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,120
(Pop)

1824
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,950
(Unlike his confidence
and high spirit,)

1825
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:32,390
(he lost three balloons
in an instant.)

1826
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:36,260
Gosh. What is this? Darn it.

1827
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:40,160
(He achieved nothing
from his second ambush either.)

1828
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,970
(He's trying to run away.)

1829
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:46,180
(He failed to run away as well
as he got caught in the tether.)

1830
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:50,620
(And he lost 1 of the 2 balloons
he has left.)

1831
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,820
What was that?

1832
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,450
- Wait.
- He has one balloon left.

1833
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,820
I won't shoot.

1834
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,320
- Almost all balloons popped.
- What is this?

1835
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:57,450
What was that?

1836
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,860
(I surrender unconditionally.)

1837
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,530
- Okay. You have only one left.
- Don't shoot.

1838
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:01,930
Give us a few bullets in return.

1839
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:03,430
- I'll give you my bullets.
- How many will you give us?

1840
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,820
- I'll give you my bullets.
- Give me your bullets. Go now.

1841
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:06,820
Share with him.

1842
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,530
We'll keep you alive
to make the show interesting.

1843
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,530
(The killer became pitiful.)

1844
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,030
(He has only one balloon left.)

1845
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:12,530
- He has just one left.
- I...

1846
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:13,930
It's over when it pops.

1847
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:15,530
- All right.
- I'll be sent to the jail.

1848
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,410
- Okay.
- I won't shoot.

1849
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,010
I'll go to that team.

1850
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,550
- Good.
- I'll attack them instead.

1851
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:21,800
Darn it.

1852
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,050
(As a result of his 2nd ambush,
he lost 4 while they lost 0.)

1853
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,050
(He surprised everyone
just as he said earlier.)

1854
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,450
This is driving me insane.

1855
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,050
Shall we go to the bridge?

1856
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,260
How many balls did you find?

1857
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,390
(How many balls did you find?)

1858
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,410
Your bag is full.

1859
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,530
I don't have many.

1860
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:35,590
(Their comradeship is long gone.)

1861
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1862
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,620
(Startled)

1863
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,120
- I'm sorry.
- Why...

1864
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,640
Why did you aim at her
when she just works in the building?

1865
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,090
- It's because I was nervous.
- Haha.

1866
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:46,760
Gosh. No, no.

1867
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,160
(They almost got into big trouble.)

1868
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,930
- I saved your balloons.
- Thank goodness.

1869
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,430
That startled me.

1870
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,050
The doors close so quickly.
Hurry up. Come on.

1871
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,180
We must be their target.

1872
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,140
I have a feeling that someone
will be there.

1873
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,240
(Will they be able to
fight properly?)

1874
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,890
- That was intense.
- Indeed.

1875
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:05,220
However, our fight
against Jong Kook's team...

1876
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,780
will be beneficial to Haha's team.

1877
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,160
(Someone showed up
in front of them.)

1878
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,160
(It's Kwang Soo
who has only one balloon.)

1879
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,390
I have only one balloon left.

1880
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,160
If you have only one left...

1881
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,530
Come with us
to destroy So Min's team.

1882
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:15,990
- Jae Suk, please.
- What?

1883
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:17,430
Don't shoot. I have only one left.

1884
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:18,430
Okay.

1885
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:21,030
Give us one ball for letting you go.

1886
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:25,530
I could've just run, but I'll
trust you and give you this.

1887
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,410
- Okay. I promise.
- You have to shoot them.

1888
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,180
- That's why I'm giving you.
- Go now.

1889
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,240
Just go. Go away
before I change my mind.

1890
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,640
I was just checking my gun.
I'm sorry.

1891
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,090
(I was just checking my gun.
I'm sorry.)

1892
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,890
I was checking if it works well.

1893
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,590
- It works well. You can go now.
- Go. Go now.

1894
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,890
Go on.

1895
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,030
I only lost my table tennis ball.

1896
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,030
(How did I end up like this?)

1897
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,990
Let's stay inside the building.
It's too hot outside.

1898
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:49,260
(Team Orange is also looking
for the three siblings.)

1899
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,200
- My goodness, hello.
- I am sorry.

1900
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,970
(Awkward)

1901
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:57,030
(They suddenly feel embarrassed.)

1902
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:59,470
I am carrying around a toy gun
at the age of 45.

1903
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,050
(They look back upon themselves
with a toy gun in their hands.)

1904
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,280
This is embarrassing.

1905
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:04,280
- Combined, our ages make 100 years.
- 100 years.

1906
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,740
If kids run around like this,
I should go, "Hey."

1907
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:08,140
- "What are you punks doing?"
- "You punks."

1908
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,910
- "Don't get hurt."
- I am at the age to say that.

1909
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,890
I am carrying a toy gun and yelling,

1910
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:14,220
"Shoot! Don't shoot!"

1911
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,760
(The duo became absorbed in the game
like the actors in an action movie.)

1912
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,220
- "Don't shoot!"
- Seriously.

1913
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,320
- Despite my age, this is fun.
- This is fun.

1914
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,370
- Don't you agree?
- Yes.

1915
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:24,430
- Kids must love it so much more.
- Seriously.

1916
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:26,030
It's just hard to do this
someplace else.

1917
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,530
Where are the others?
I don't see anyone.

1918
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:29,680
(Meanwhile, the trio)

1919
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:31,680
I see someone! It's Kwang Soo!

1920
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,870
Kwang Soo is telling the others
about us.

1921
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,970
We will lose.

1922
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,410
Hold on. Kwang Soo doesn't have
any balloons.

1923
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,340
- He doesn't have any balloons.
- We can take him out.

1924
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,590
- He has 1 balloon.
- He has 1 balloon.

1925
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,120
We can pop it.

1926
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,120
- We can pop it.
- Come here.

1927
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,930
- Let's hide for now.
- Come here.

1928
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,030
Here come the gunmen!

1929
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,300
Here come the gunmen!

1930
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,120
Make way!

1931
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,760
- Bang, bang, bang!
- Bang!

1932
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:58,430
Why don't we take out Jong Kook
first?

1933
01:03:58,430 --> 01:03:59,840
(They lose their fighting spirit.)

1934
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,260
There is no need for us to fight.

1935
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,510
We...

1936
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,300
Be careful.

1937
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:05,570
We...

1938
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:07,570
(Jae Suk's accuracy rate
is at 100 percent.)

1939
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:09,910
(The 3 cowards become startled.)

1940
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,320
Be careful.

1941
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,280
(Their combat style is as forward
as their mouths are protruding.)

1942
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:17,660
Hey. Hey.

1943
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,430
(Se Chan sets out to take out
Kwang Soo with 1 balloon.)

1944
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,450
Come here!

1945
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:21,530
Kwang Soo, watch out.

1946
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:24,360
(He strikes back!)

1947
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:25,530
Kwang Soo, watch out.

1948
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,490
(The gunmen with protruding mouths
are surrounded.)

1949
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,620
Pick them up.

1950
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,970
They are running away.

1951
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,430
Pick them up.

1952
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:32,840
They are running away.

1953
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,930
- Pick them up.
- They are running away.

1954
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:35,240
- Let's fall back for now.
- Let's go.

1955
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,610
(Let's fall back for now!)

1956
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:37,700
Okay. Okay.

1957
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,510
- The bullets.
- Pick them up.

1958
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:40,910
I have one left.

1959
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,840
- Do you have one left? This is bad.
- Yes.

1960
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:45,510
The first half came to an end.

1961
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,390
Please wait for the second half.

1962
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,090
The first half came to an end.

1963
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:50,510
- Okay.
- The first half ended.

1964
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:51,720
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1965
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:53,030
Let's go downstairs.

1966
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:54,550
(They start over with 5 balloons
in the 2nd half.)

1967
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:55,780
For the second half,

1968
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:57,760
please move to your spot.

1969
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,930
Do you have tape?

1970
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,220
It's not advantageous to be alone.

1971
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,660
(Kwang Soo looks for tape
as soon as the second half begins.)

1972
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:07,800
(He is wrapping up his balloon.)

1973
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,140
As insurance, I will make a balloon
that doesn't pop.

1974
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:13,780
(Popping)

1975
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,370
(What?)

1976
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,780
(What was that sound?)

1977
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,140
It didn't pop.
This balloon is simply a bit small.

1978
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:22,890
It's a small balloon.

1979
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,220
(Wrinkly)

1980
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:27,680
Kwang Soo, one of your balloons
popped.

1981
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,200
You have four balloons left.

1982
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,760
(He ends up starting
with 4 balloons.)

1983
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,870
The race starts.

1984
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:36,260
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1985
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,660
- Let's go.
- The second half starts.

1986
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,930
I am sure they are talking about us.

1987
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:43,300
- We are...
- The legendary gunmen.

1988
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,930
We are the legendary gunmen.

1989
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:47,450
You have the least number
of table tennis balls.

1990
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,700
- Really?
- For goodness' sake.

1991
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,140
Don't be an amateur.

1992
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,740
- We can turn the tables.
- That's right.

1993
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,180
We can wipe everyone out.

1994
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,340
Don't be a coward.

1995
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,120
I don't think they are here.

1996
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,890
No, they must be here somewhere.
Let's search again.

1997
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,660
Are table tennis balls important?

1998
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,430
- They are like points, right?
- They are like points.

1999
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:04,550
They are very important.

2000
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:06,970
After the race, they determine
the rankings with them.

2001
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,660
- You either take out an opponent...
- Okay.

2002
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,640
(He gets 1 table tennis ball.)

2003
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,640
You either take out an opponent...

2004
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:15,640
I don't calculate those things.

2005
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,510
(A good thing
about teaming up with Suk Jin)

2006
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:18,680
These punks.

2007
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,640
How are you so good at finding them?

2008
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:22,140
You should tell me.

2009
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,510
What was I supposed to do?

2010
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:25,450
- It wasn't there before.
- It was right in front of my eyes.

2011
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:26,640
How did it suddenly pop up?

2012
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:29,410
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo)

2013
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:32,160
(He hasn't learned his lesson
even after popping one balloon.)

2014
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:36,320
(In the end, he makes
a bulletproof balloon.)

2015
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,320
It's done.

2016
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:39,620
I did it. Okay.

2017
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,720
(I will win today.)

2018
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,800
It's Kwang Soo.

2019
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,870
(Haha and the others appear.)

2020
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,740
- You have no table tennis balls.
- I am alone.

2021
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,370
(I am alone.)

2022
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:50,610
I am alone.

2023
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,740
Are you going to shoot at me?

2024
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:54,070
(The two teams confront each other.)

2025
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:56,370
- Jae Suk, Kwang Soo is here.
- Jae Suk.

2026
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,910
(The ineffective gunmen appear.)

2027
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:00,120
Let's attack together.

2028
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,120
There we go.

2029
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,120
- Jae Suk.
- Let's join forces.

2030
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,390
It would be better
to take Kwang Soo out first.

2031
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,620
- He is at an advantage.
- I am not at an advantage!

2032
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,320
You saw it earlier!
I am not at an advantage!

2033
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,320
We will be your ally
if you give us a table tennis ball.

2034
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,200
(A small reward can move
these two gunmen.)

2035
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,300
Jae Suk.

2036
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,300
(Popping)

2037
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,030
(1 shot, 1 balloon)

2038
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,840
(Everyone becomes excited
while holding a toy gun.)

2039
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,870
Move to the back.

2040
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:22,410
(Kwang Soo becomes annoyed
and attacks So Min.)

2041
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:24,640
(At that moment,)

2042
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,470
(there is one man on Running Man
who is good with toy guns,)

2043
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:29,910
(Yoo Jae Suk.)

2044
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,050
(Popping)

2045
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,740
What are you doing?
Who are you shooting?

2046
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:39,260
(Jae Suk's next target)

2047
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,160
- What?
- I got two balloons.

2048
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,950
(He shot Haha's balloon
from a distance.)

2049
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:47,760
- What?
- I got two balloons.

2050
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:50,370
(He popped 2 balloons
with 1 bullet.)

2051
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:51,660
You got that on the camera, right?

2052
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,870
(You got that on the camera, right?)

2053
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,930
We are the legendary gunmen.

2054
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:57,070
(Dream's father
becomes intimidated.)

2055
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,280
(Thinking)

2056
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,370
- I will go to you.
- Okay.

2057
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,370
(At that moment,)

2058
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:10,280
(So Min comes forward
with a barricade.)

2059
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,680
(Se Chan becomes flustered.)

2060
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,120
(He fires multiple bullets,)

2061
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,120
(but her barricade is 100 percent
effective in blocking the bullets.)

2062
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,570
(Kwang Soo fires off bullets
as well.)

2063
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,430
Jae Suk, I am out of bullets.

2064
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,130
I am leaving.

2065
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:30,330
Jae Suk, finish him off.

2066
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:31,580
I am leaving.

2067
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:33,450
Hold on.

2068
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:34,950
(I will spare Kwang Soo
since he is an ally.)

2069
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:38,170
Now is the time! Shoot!

2070
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,790
Shoot! He is out of bullets!

2071
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:43,050
(Jae Suk is out of bullets,
so the trio attacks in full force.)

2072
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:44,710
(Popping)

2073
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,210
- What?
- I didn't shoot.

2074
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,680
I am out of bullets.

2075
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,790
(But too many of their balloons
are getting popped.)

2076
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:55,170
What is going on?

2077
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:59,610
(They forgot...)

2078
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:01,500
(that Kwang Soo never changes.)

2079
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,300
- That little...
- That little...

2080
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,710
(You can imagine what he did
from his satisfied face.)

2081
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,840
(Creeping up)

2082
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:10,510
- What?
- I didn't shoot.

2083
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:12,040
I am out of bullets.

2084
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,510
(After saying that,
he began to shoot.)

2085
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:19,160
(He popped three balloons.)

2086
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:22,880
(After an act of betrayal,
he runs away with a smile.)

2087
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,890
(He causes a major accident
and becomes a public enemy.)

2088
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,570
Let's wait
until their bullets run out.

2089
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,670
It's a face-off.

2090
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,830
(He became interested
in a toy gunfight in his 50s.)

2091
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:34,960
Corner them!

2092
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,130
- All right.
- This is good.

2093
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:40,500
(Trio versus The 100-year-old duo)

2094
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,610
Corner them.

2095
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:43,280
We were sneaking up on them.

2096
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,820
We need to finish them off first.

2097
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,140
- Corner them.
- We need to finish them off first.

2098
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,140
Corner them.

2099
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:51,080
(However)

2100
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,290
- Out.
- Out.

2101
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:53,960
(Se Chan is out.)

2102
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:56,050
(Haha changes the target
and takes out Se Chan.)

2103
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,160
What?

2104
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,630
(He becomes the first person
to be eliminated.)

2105
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,720
Se Chan.

2106
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,790
If all of your balloons are popped,
you'll be eliminated.

2107
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,040
You won't be able to shoot anymore.

2108
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:08,800
(He resorts to picking up bullets.)

2109
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,540
(Jae Suk becomes angry
that Se Chan is out.)

2110
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:12,830
(He succeeds to avenge Se Chan.)

2111
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:13,970
Haha is out.

2112
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:15,970
- I am out.
- Haha is out.

2113
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:17,780
- Haha, put your gun down.
- Okay.

2114
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:21,320
(He shoots Ji Hyo's balloon too.)

2115
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,380
Ji Hyo is out.

2116
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:24,920
We are the legendary gunmen.

2117
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,830
- What should I do?
- Pick up the bullets.

2118
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:29,580
- Shoot. Shoot.
- Haha, give me an umbrella.

2119
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,830
Is this "Kingsman"?

2120
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:34,090
(Jong Kook jumps in.)

2121
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,260
Hurry up.

2122
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:38,890
Okay. I got it.

2123
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:41,000
(So Min is out.)

2124
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,170
So Min is out.

2125
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,670
(All the members of the trio
are out.)

2126
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,450
You nasty...

2127
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:49,140
(Jong Kook, the nasty man)

2128
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,120
(They become the first team
to enter the prison.)

2129
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,320
- Let's go.
- It was fun.

2130
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:53,620
We were cool.

2131
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,710
Kwang Soo shot at us from the back.

2132
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,050
Is it allowed to wrap the balloon
with tape?

2133
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,530
- For goodness' sake.
- That's cheating.

2134
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,960
- Did Kwang Soo tape his balloon?
- Yes.

2135
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,870
- Why does he do that?
- He is so strange.

2136
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,260
It's just wrong
to tape your balloon.

2137
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,610
(Kwang Soo was on a stakeout.)

2138
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,830
(Kwang Soo ambushes them
because he never fights fair.)

2139
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,330
He was hiding here.

2140
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:18,580
Kwang Soo!

2141
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,840
(He shoots freely.)

2142
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,670
(The man with a bulletproof balloon)

2143
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:25,880
It won't pop.

2144
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,950
(He runs away
after firing off bullets.)

2145
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,580
(Team White hears them belatedly.)

2146
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,960
- What?
- It won't pop.

2147
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,420
He was hiding here.

2148
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,290
- Should I kill him?
- This won't do.

2149
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,380
He was hiding here.

2150
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,590
- I can go to him and...
- I have an idea.

2151
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:41,790
If you go this way,
we will corner him downstairs.

2152
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,540
Since his balloon is taped,

2153
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,370
we need to overpower him.

2154
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,910
We can't pop it with our hands.

2155
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:48,570
- Find a spot that isn't taped...
- Okay.

2156
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,130
- and press the gun against it.
- We will go this way.

2157
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,300
- Okay?
- Okay. I got it.

2158
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,710
We need to get him.

2159
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:56,620
(Kwang Soo became
everyone's target.)

2160
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:57,950
(Crashing)

2161
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:01,540
(He crashes into a locked door.)

2162
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:04,620
(Groaning)

2163
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:07,880
I am injured.

2164
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:09,830
Kwang Soo is over there.

2165
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:11,420
- Where?
- Over there. He's over there.

2166
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:13,960
- Kwang Soo is over there.
- I see him.

2167
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:15,530
- Hold on.
- He is crawling.

2168
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:18,170
(It's Jong Kook.)

2169
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,930
(Kwang Soo runs upstairs.)

2170
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:23,000
Kwang Soo is on the second floor.

2171
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,210
- The 2nd floor?
- He is on the 2nd floor.

2172
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:26,040
- We will hide here.
- Kwang Soo is on the second floor.

2173
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,110
Go to the staircase.

2174
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,710
Suk Jin, come behind me.

2175
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,140
- He saw me.
- Come behind me.

2176
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,640
- Come behind me.
- Why?

2177
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:33,450
Hey.

2178
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,250
Why are you taking
all the table tennis balls?

2179
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,820
I told you to come behind me.
Why won't you listen?

2180
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,250
(What?)

2181
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:41,720
(Did he pop Jong Kook's balloon?)

2182
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,250
(He attacks his team member
with unfocused eyes.)

2183
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:47,200
- Are you crazy?
- I was angry.

2184
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:49,170
- I am sorry.
- Come here.

2185
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,760
I am sorry.

2186
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,700
I was out of my mind.

2187
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,000
He shot me!

2188
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,540
You should have given me one.

2189
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,000
He should have given me 1 ball
after taking 3 balls, right?

2190
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,040
You still shouldn't shoot Jong Kook.

2191
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,780
I exploded.

2192
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:04,820
(Suk Jin's attack buys Kwang Soo
some time.)

2193
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:08,490
(Panting, he heads somewhere.)

2194
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:12,420
(The rooftop?)

2195
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,030
- All right.
- Jong Kook.

2196
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:15,380
- Yes?
- Here.

2197
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:16,380
- Where?
- Come here.

2198
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:17,960
- Where?
- The door is open.

2199
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,630
- Where?
- Here.

2200
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:21,420
Let's go.

2201
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,500
Drive him downstairs.

2202
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,760
(The man they have been looking for,
Kwang Soo is there.)

2203
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,130
You aren't luring us, are you?

2204
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:26,610
- Where is he?
- I think he is at the rooftop.

2205
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:27,630
Is he at the rooftop?

2206
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:29,210
Gosh, Suk Jin!

2207
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:32,110
(Why was he aiming at Jae Suk?)

2208
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,840
What's wrong with you?

2209
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,210
(Jae Suk is so surprised...)

2210
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,170
(that he attacks Suk Jin.)

2211
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,640
- What's wrong with you?
- Why did you shoot me?

2212
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,380
- I didn't shoot you.
- You were about to.

2213
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,920
I wasn't going to shoot you.

2214
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,580
I simply aimed my gun at you.

2215
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:46,010
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I simply aimed like this.

2216
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:47,790
- Hey.
- Suk Jin!

2217
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,080
- It popped. You are out!
- What are you doing?

2218
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,220
Hey.

2219
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:51,590
(Jae Suk is out.)

2220
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:53,630
- You are out.
- Jae Suk and Se Chan are out.

2221
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,590
- What was that?
- What was that?

2222
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,630
- I mean...
- We were going to get Kwang Soo.

2223
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:00,370
I simply aimed at you,
but you popped my balloon.

2224
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:01,630
Why did you...

2225
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,930
I simply aimed at you,
but you popped my balloon.

2226
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,280
You are out.

2227
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,710
Suk Jin is a bit strange.

2228
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,410
He is absolutely insane.

2229
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,470
I mean...

2230
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,250
(Meanwhile,
Kwang Soo, the wanted man,)

2231
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:17,460
(is going
where he hasn't gone before.)

2232
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:22,490
(Hurry over here, Jong Kook.)

2233
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:26,550
(Now, it's 2 against 1.)

2234
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:27,830
- He is here.
- Up here?

2235
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,290
- He is here.
- Where?

2236
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:31,760
- No, he isn't here.
- Where is he? He must be up there.

2237
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,670
Where is he? He must be up there.

2238
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Come on down so that we can fight.

2239
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,540
It's over, Kwang Soo.

2240
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:42,910
Let's end this.

2241
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,170
Suk Jin, your balloons are showing.

2242
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:46,280
You fool!

2243
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:49,820
(Suk Jin is so absorbed
that he gets ahead of himself.)

2244
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:52,510
(His strategy...)

2245
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:56,890
(of taking the high ground
finally shines.)

2246
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:00,630
(Why aren't they coming out?)

2247
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,670
(He throws a table tennis ball
as bait.)

2248
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,970
(It's aimed at Suk Jin
since he never picked one up.)

2249
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:11,170
- It's a table tennis ball.
- Don't do it.

2250
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,780
- Don't do it.
- He wants us to pick it up.

2251
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,170
- My goodness.
- Did you only figure it out now?

2252
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,080
He wants us to pick it up.

2253
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:17,420
That weasel.

2254
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,180
You are the only one
who didn't know that he is a weasel.

2255
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,790
(This won't do.)

2256
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,160
(Screaming)

2257
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:29,530
(Jong Kook is a perfect shooter
even from the bottom.)

2258
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,200
(He is blocking the bullets
with his face.)

2259
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,420
For goodness' sake.

2260
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:36,570
(His strategy
of taking the high ground fails.)

2261
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:40,870
(Kwang Soo took a heavy blow.)

2262
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:44,110
(He begins to think of a trick.)

2263
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,000
Let's do this.

2264
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:48,640
Let's do this today.

2265
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:50,920
I will win for sure.

2266
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:53,680
(Panting)

2267
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,840
What a long fight.

2268
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:57,290
It's lonely to be by myself,

2269
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:59,550
(It's lonely to be by myself.)

2270
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:01,330
but it does give me
a certain advantage.

2271
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:07,220
(From the start,
Kwang Soo was overly absorbed.)

2272
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,330
(He said many ridiculous things.)

2273
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:13,070
(Becoming cowardly
is the only way to survive alone.)

2274
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,460
(That way, he managed to survive
for 40 minutes.)

2275
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:20,640
(Now, I will put an end to this.)

2276
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,500
- There he is.
- Where?

2277
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:25,340
- What does he want to do?
- He is over there.

2278
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:26,420
(Why does he have to be
the last one remaining?)

2279
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,620
(Breathing hard)

2280
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,160
Okay. This is the only way.

2281
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:33,360
- Come here.
- Now that we are here...

2282
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,830
Look at that taped balloon.

2283
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,550
Is that bulletproof or something?

2284
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:39,360
I have a lot of bullets.

2285
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,200
(I have a lot of bullets.)

2286
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,760
My balloon is covered.

2287
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,760
(The only way
of popping that balloon is...)

2288
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,740
(physical force.)

2289
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,410
(Confrontation)

2290
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:58,040
(The two of them run forward
to pop Kwang Soo's balloon.)

2291
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,210
(Kwang Soo awaits them.)

2292
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:05,010
(Who will be the winner
of this match?)

2293
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,710
The race has ended.

2294
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:10,200
The final result is out.

2295
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,660
The first place holder
of the winning team...

2296
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,760
can either remove
all of his penalty balls...

2297
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,670
or share a small prize...

2298
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:20,040
with the team members.

2299
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,830
For your information,
the winning team...

2300
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:23,170
(The winning team...)

2301
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:27,300
(can either remove the penalty balls
or share the prize.)

2302
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:29,910
has members with an average
of 14 table tennis balls,

2303
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:31,250
Jong Kook and Suk Jin.

2304
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,250
- We have a lot.
- Yes!

2305
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,880
(The 100-year-old duo has an average
of 14 table tennis balls.)

2306
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:35,380
- 14?
- 14?

2307
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:37,250
(There is a reason why
Kwang Soo lost.)

2308
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,420
(During the last confrontation
a moment ago)

2309
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,490
This is the only way.

2310
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:41,530
(During the last confrontation
a moment ago)

2311
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,890
(What?)

2312
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,660
He can't shoot.

2313
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:48,070
- He can't shoot.
- Hold on.

2314
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:49,390
- Hurry up.
- Hold on.

2315
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,700
(Thus, Kwang Soo's day ended
as comedy.)

2316
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:54,040
Hold on. Hold on.

2317
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,540
- Here.
- Shoot, you jerks!

2318
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,740
- Step on it!
- Which part isn't taped?

2319
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,110
Do you want me to use a real gun?

2320
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:00,880
It's impossible to pop this balloon.

2321
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,140
(In the end,)

2322
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,920
(he breaks the rules again.)

2323
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,620
You need to use your gun.

2324
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,750
- It came off.
- You are out.

2325
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,320
(He pops the balloon
in a relaxed way.)

2326
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,120
I popped it. I popped it.

2327
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,750
- He is absolutely ridiculous.
- Seriously.

2328
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:17,790
(After a prolonged confrontation)

2329
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:20,200
I circled the rooftop three times.

2330
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:22,200
(The duo receives 10 tennis balls
each and takes the 1st place.)

2331
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,740
I picked up many balls
and raised the average.

2332
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,460
- I picked up many balls.
- He picked up many balls.

2333
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:29,170
In the team, Jong Kook takes
1st place with 18 balls.

2334
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:30,300
(In the team, Jong Kook takes
1st place with 18 balls.)

2335
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,300
Is that so?

2336
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:33,580
You can take out
all of your penalty balls...

2337
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,170
- or share a prize.
- But both of us won.

2338
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:36,880
- No.
- He has more table tennis balls.

2339
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,750
- He has more table tennis balls.
- I will take out my penalty balls.

2340
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:39,820
No.

2341
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,540
(I will take out my penalty balls.)

2342
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,140
- Of course.
- Don't do that.

2343
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,180
I will take them out.

2344
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,120
- He didn't even think about it.
- That was neat.

2345
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,460
I will take them out. Thank you.

2346
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:50,390
The member at the bottom place is...

2347
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,160
- Kwang Soo.
- What?

2348
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,360
(Kwang Soo has the least number
of table tennis balls.)

2349
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,570
Am I at the bottom place?

2350
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:57,390
What is wrong with you?

2351
01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:00,460
I will pick two members.

2352
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:01,800
(2 selected members will receive
the penalty.)

2353
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,830
(Which 2 members...)

2354
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:04,880
I will pick two balls.

2355
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,670
(will receive the penalty
at the end of a long day?)

2356
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,140
I got Kwang Soo and Kwang Soo.

2357
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,250
(Kwang Soo gets selected twice.)

2358
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,620
(Kwang Soo is one of them.)

2359
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:14,680
Okay.

2360
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,380
- He should get the penalty twice.
- Shouldn't you pick one more?

2361
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,120
- In that case...
- You should pick one more.

2362
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,330
You should pick one more.

2363
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:23,360
(The next penalty ball)

2364
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,630
- Kwang Soo.
- Pick one more.

2365
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:25,630
Then it's over.

2366
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,260
- Suk Jin remains.
- Suk Jin remains.

2367
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,420
Why?

2368
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,530
Suk Jin remains.

2369
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,430
(Suk Jin's penalty ball
gets chosen.)

2370
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:34,670
(Despite winning,
he gets the penalty.)

2371
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,910
How did this happen?

2372
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:37,130
Two people need to receive
the penalty.

2373
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,170
(Suk Jin and Jong Kook
were the only ones.)

2374
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,880
You received a penalty ball earlier
for taking the fifth place.

2375
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Gosh, Kwang Soo.

2376
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,920
Why didn't you say from the start
that it will be the two of us?

2377
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,540
Why did you pick the balls?

2378
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,010
Are there no more balls?

2379
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:49,880
- It was meaningless.
- 3 for me and 1 for Suk Jin?

2380
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,380
I will tell you what the penalty is.

2381
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:54,160
- Today, the penalty is...
- Salt?

2382
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,030
retrieving all the bullets...

2383
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:58,920
while wearing the tether
before you go home.

2384
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,390
- Okay.
- Oh, my goodness.

2385
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,430
- Okay.
- We won't even get screen time.

2386
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:08,260
As we do it,
the ending credits will roll up.

2387
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,300
I even climbed up the ladder
at the rooftop and shot.

2388
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,640
As for the rest of you,
thank you for your hard work.

2389
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,710
Let's go!

2390
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,250
- Bye.
- Let's go.

2391
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,970
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Bye.

2392
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,750
Thank goodness
I didn't get a penalty ball.

2393
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,250
- There is 1.
- There is 1. Let's pick it up.

2394
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,640
- Thank you for your hard work.
- One.

2395
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:24,320
Here.

2396
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,380
There are many here.

2397
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,550
Had I won...

2398
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:28,580
(He wishes he hadn't fallen down.)

2399
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,000
Didn't you shoot over there?

2400
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,660
(While the task takes long,
they don't get much screen time.)

2401
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,090
- There it is. Down there.
- Where?

2402
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:35,260
- There it is.
- Good.

2403
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:36,920
There it is.

2404
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:40,260
- Okay.
- 28 bullets.

2405
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,910
- We succeeded.
- You are done.

2406
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,240
(The worst penalty ends.)

2407
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:45,630
- We succeeded. Feeling!
- Intuition! Cross!

2408
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:48,540
(Feeling! Intuition! Cross!)

2409
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,920
(We introduce the students
of the Brahms Music School.)

2410
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,280
(Park Eun Bin, Kim Min Jae,
Park Ji Hyun, and Kim Sung Cheol)

2411
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:56,620
(For musical knowledge,
all of them take a test on music.)

2412
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,660
(The peaceful atmosphere changes.)

2413
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,530
(Everything was a competition.)

2414
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:03,830
(Everyone who took the test...)

2415
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:06,160
(is your rival!)

2416
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,390
You are less than human.

2417
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,790
(Behind the school building,)

2418
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:10,760
(the music students fight by grade!)

2419
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:13,260
(Figure out the changing grades...)

2420
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,830
(and survive alone!)

2421
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:19,410
(It's not easy to move up a grade.)

2422
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:21,780
(To join forces,)

2423
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,250
(find an upperclassman
and form an alliance.)

2424
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,280
(Don't trust anyone!)

2425
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:29,620
(What will become
of the fierce competition?)

2426
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:32,750
(Do You Like Being Number 1?)
