1
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,680
(This episode is a skit about
a patriarchal family, the Yu's.)

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,640
(Family Tree of the Yu's)

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,980
(Father: Jae Suk,
Sons: Haha, Kwang Soo)

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,310
(Father: Jong Kook,
Sons: Suk Jin, Se Chan)

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,550
(Daughters-in-law: Ji Hyo, So Min)

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,550
(Chuseok full of happiness
like the full moon)

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,990
(To celebrate the national holiday,)

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,530
(the Yoo family is
gathered together.)

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,600
It's Chuseok.

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,220
It's Chuseok.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,060
(The first three people
to arrive are...)

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,400
Gosh.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
(Chairman Yu's second son,
Jong Kook and his family.)

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,600
(Yu's second son Jong Kook)

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,640
(Jong Kook's son Suk Jin,
Suk Jin's wife, Ji Hyo)

16
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,840
What's this?

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,980
(Jong Kook, Suk Jin, and Ji Hyo
came to hold the ancestral rite.)

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,600
- My goodness. Grandpa...
- Come in.

19
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,170
Come on in.

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,070
It's quite large.

21
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,040
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,660
(Suk Jin's answer ruined the mood.)

23
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,130
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

24
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,160
(Suk Jin is playing
Jong Kook's eldest son.)

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,160
(That makes it too hard for everyone
to get immersed in the situation.)

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,420
Why? What is it?

27
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,560
(Yoo Suk Jin, Jong Kook's eldest
son, Song Ji Hyo, Suk Jin's wife)

28
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Suk Jin.

29
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
(Suk Jin's appearance makes it hard
for Jong Kook to act.)

30
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Suk Jin.

31
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,600
You brat, take better care
of your appearance.

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,670
(He looks as if he went through
a painful ordeal.)

33
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,270
- Why do you look so old?
- Dad.

34
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,070
Look at me. You see?

35
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,600
I still look so young and healthy.

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,180
- Dad.
- What's with you?

37
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,340
You made soup with a snake for me,

38
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,820
but it turned out to be
a venomous one.

39
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,740
Remember? You said
it wasn't venomous.

40
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,920
- Gosh, seriously.
- It's a family tradition.

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,350
Everyone in this family ate
a venomous snake.

42
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,980
Seriously, what happened to you?

43
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,030
(Jong Kook chokes up
whenever he sees his son Suk Jin.)

44
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,490
- Honey.
- Honey.

45
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,560
- Honey.
- Why...

46
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,430
Strangely, you look better with Dad
than with me.

47
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,790
(It feels sad for some reason.)

48
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,040
This is so...

49
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,010
- It doesn't make sense.
- What is going on?

50
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,400
I've done a lot of role plays,

51
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,340
but this is too unreasonable.

52
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,620
This is what comedy is about, Dad.

53
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,090
- Right.
- But how can you...

54
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,090
have so many kids
without even getting married?

55
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,390
(How can you have so many kids
without getting married?)

56
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,180
(He's a child that Jong Kook had
without getting married.)

57
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,060
- It's weird...
- I mean...

58
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,760
that they all ran away
right after giving birth.

59
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,150
I don't know why they ran away.

60
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,370
Honey, what if Father doesn't
like me?

61
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,760
- I told him about you.
- What did you say?

62
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,040
I told him good things about you.
I said you are pretty.

63
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,140
(Jeon So Min, Se Chan's wife,
Yoo Se Chan, Jong Kook's second son)

64
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,700
(Oh, my. He said I am pretty.)

65
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,600
I told him that he'll meet
such a pretty woman.

66
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,110
Honey, must I carry this?

67
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,510
My gosh. You look so pretty today.

68
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,510
(He suddenly compliments her.)

69
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,980
- Do I look pretty?
- Yes, you dressed up prettily.

70
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,390
Honey, you look great as well.

71
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,980
We're here.

72
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,020
- Hi.
- Come on in.

73
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,390
Father, hello.

74
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,760
- Come on in.
- I'm sorry we're late.

75
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,070
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, Father.

76
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,730
- Oh, my. Hello.
- Come on in to give him a bow.

77
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,070
- Suk Jin, hello.
- Hello.

78
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,330
- Come on in.
- You didn't come empty-handed.

79
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,070
- Se Chan, you should carry it.
- That's so thoughtful of you.

80
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,070
My second son and his wife
are so attentive.

81
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,140
- Dad, I'll give you a bow first.
- It's not me.

82
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,850
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- My gosh.

83
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,320
(Dad, I'll give you a bow first.)

84
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,080
(I'm not your dad.)

85
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,010
- You brat.
- Wait. I'm sorry.

86
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,350
- How could you...
- I thought you were my dad.

87
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,190
- Don't do that.
- I already told Suk Jin...

88
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,850
to take better care
of his appearance.

89
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,130
- Right.
- So, he's my elder brother.

90
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,390
- Give Dad a bow now.
- Let's do that.

91
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,500
- Dad, I'll give you a bow.
- Hello, Father.

92
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,860
- Welcome.
- That's great.

93
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,200
I wish you good health.

94
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,470
Thank you.

95
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,940
- See? Se Chan looks his age.
- Yes.

96
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,440
- We should give him a bow too.
- Yes, we should.

97
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,910
All right.

98
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,170
(Hesitating)

99
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,640
Dad, you must be
feeling uncomfortable.

100
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,950
Exactly. Go ahead, you brat.

101
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,350
Must I give you a bow?

102
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,450
Of course. That's what you should do
as my son.

103
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,640
- We can just skip it.
- You should do it.

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,720
- I wish you a long, healthy life.
- Thank you.

105
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,920
(He's being playful.)

106
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,980
You punk!

107
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,790
(He didn't bow properly.)

108
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,980
- You always...
- How rude.

109
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,290
- Hey, why did you bring this?
- Why did you do that, Suk Jin?

110
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,420
- Why did you bring that stick?
- Come over here, you punk.

111
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,790
- Why did you bring it here?
- Come here.

112
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,630
- Come here.
- Yes, Dad. I just...

113
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,200
- You always...
- Did I raise you like that?

114
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,760
You always wanted me to be manly.

115
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,170
- I didn't raise you this way.
- But...

116
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,230
Cham, cham, cham.

117
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,830
Come here.

118
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,040
Cham, cham, cham.

119
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,770
(My poor husband.)

120
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,910
- He's playing that game again.
- I didn't raise you this way.

121
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,920
- I understand, Dad.
- I didn't raise you like this.

122
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,850
Do it properly this time.

123
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,890
(The eldest son got a second chance
to give him a bow.)

124
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,920
Come on.

125
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,160
(He's being playful again.)

126
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,420
(He bowed
halfheartedly and quickly.)

127
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,820
That was a good push-up.

128
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,820
(He's too proud to bow
to Jong Kook.)

129
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,700
- What was that?
- It was a nice push-up.

130
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,160
- Wasn't it cool?
- Dad, shall I help Suk Jin?

131
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,570
- Yes. You help him.
- Here we go.

132
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,660
(Here we go.)

133
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,740
- That's great. You did well.
- He did properly this time, Dad.

134
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,030
- That's good.
- It wasn't hard.

135
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,680
- I wish you a long, healthy life.
- I always told you...

136
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,340
Why did you bring that stick?

137
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,570
That's mine.

138
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,340
- Jae Suk will be here shortly.
- Oh, he's coming.

139
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,410
- Gosh. He's coming.
- My goodness.

140
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,120
I feel like I'm home here
whenever I come.

141
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,060
(Jae Suk, the eldest son
of the Yoo family)

142
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,630
(Haha, Jae Suk's eldest son,
Kwang Soo, Jae Suk's second son)

143
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,430
- We haven't seen them in a while...
- Be quiet.

144
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,260
Don't be so loud.
Let's walk quietly.

145
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,720
We haven't visited them in a while.

146
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,960
- How nice.
- Indeed.

147
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,160
Someone's here.

148
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,370
- Is it you?
- They must be here.

149
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,640
They can just come in.
Why would they press the doorbell?

150
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,330
- Uncle Jong Kook, we're here.
- Who is it?

151
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,050
- Welcome.
- Hello.

152
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,900
- Uncle Jae Suk is here.
- Hello.

153
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,570
- Hello, Uncle Jae Suk.
- Hi.

154
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,210
- How have you been?
- Hello.

155
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,320
- My big brother is here.
- Hi.

156
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,490
- Welcome.
- Hi.

157
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,580
- Have you been well?
- Is he...

158
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,780
(They're facing a crisis.)

159
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,820
He's my eldest son.

160
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,390
- He didn't take care of himself.
- Is he your eldest son?

161
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,020
- That's why...
- It's been a while.

162
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,570
You should take better care
of your appearance.

163
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,500
Jong Kook, have you been
practicing martial arts?

164
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,440
No, that's not it.
You know I work out every day.

165
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,530
- I know.
- Why...

166
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,940
did you all come alone?

167
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,240
Why didn't you bring your wives?

168
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,030
- So Min, you're barefoot.
- Hold on.

169
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,380
- I'm sorry.
- Are you going somewhere?

170
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,180
I'm sorry. I should've
paid more attention.

171
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,450
- I forgot to wear socks.
- Are you a spa owner?

172
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,380
No, I'm not. I'm her husband.

173
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,410
- You're her husband?
- Yes.

174
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,410
- Yes.
- I see.

175
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,510
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

176
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,620
Why did he get eyebrow tattoos?

177
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,150
Don't say such a thing.

178
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,930
- Don't take this seriously.
- It's not like that.

179
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,580
- Actually...
- This is just a role play.

180
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,860
I got the tattoos
at the spa I work at.

181
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,890
- Let's sit down.
- Please sit down.

182
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,370
Was Uncle Jong Kook married?

183
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,090
- He must be married seeing that...
- Of course, I'm married.

184
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,330
This is my sister-in-law.

185
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,030
- Who?
- She's my sister-in-law.

186
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,330
Is she Jong Kook's wife?

187
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,200
- No.
- No, not him.

188
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,400
- She's Suk Jin's wife.
- Suk Jin is my husband.

189
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,970
- I'm sorry.
- I'm her husband.

190
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,010
- She's his daughter-in-law.
- He's my father-in-law.

191
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,210
- I'll explain, Uncle Jae Suk.
- I was born in 1988.

192
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,690
- I was born in 1988.
- I can't believe...

193
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,820
- It's a mess.
- She's my daughter-in-law.

194
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,560
Wasn't Ji Hyo married before?

195
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,320
- What are you talking about?
- Why would you bring that up?

196
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,360
- You know she had...
- Don't talk about her past now.

197
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,300
- What are you talking about?
- We met after a long time.

198
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,320
Hang on a second. You...

199
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,890
- talk as if you're older than me.
- That's not true.

200
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,260
- You should be careful.
- You brat, I warned you earlier.

201
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,370
- Dad, please don't be mad.
- You little...

202
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,470
You brat.

203
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,330
- You're younger than me.
- I'm sorry.

204
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,440
You brat.

205
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,640
- You're younger than me.
- I'm sorry.

206
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,510
- You're younger than me.
- Hey, stop.

207
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,050
What's our relationship?
Is he my cousin?

208
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,550
Don't we have seniority over him?

209
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,320
- It's decided on the basis of age.
- I'm really sorry.

210
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,360
- I didn't know that.
- Between cousins.

211
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,120
- Jae Suk, teach your kids well.
- I'll do that.

212
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,190
- I'm sorry.
- We didn't know.

213
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,390
Listen, you two. If you do something
wrong, your dad will get hit.

214
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,450
Why would I get hit?

215
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,860
- Understood.
- Got it?

216
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,220
- Oh, gosh.
- Discipline your kids properly.

217
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,500
(Peace came for a moment
as Jong Kook held the stick.)

218
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,030
How dare you act like that
when you don't even have a job?

219
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,830
What? I run my own business.

220
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,260
That's a lie. You're jobless.

221
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,740
My business is about to take off.

222
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,310
- I don't believe you.
- What have you been up to?

223
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,770
I sell pork cutlets.

224
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,680
I enjoyed your pork cutlet.

225
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,140
(I enjoyed your pork cutlet.)

226
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,210
It was so good.

227
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,010
- I really enjoyed it.
- What are you doing?

228
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,050
- They never forget to mention it.
- Right.

229
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,990
- It's going to become a hit.
- He's doing so well.

230
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,210
Let's sit down.

231
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,220
- Someone's here.
- Who could that be?

232
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,280
- Who could that be?
- Who is it?

233
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,320
(The doorbell is ringing.)

234
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,360
(Someone else is here?)

235
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
- Someone's here?
- Someone's here?

236
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,590
Who is it?

237
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,930
Could that be someone's girlfriend?

238
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,800
- Hello?
- What?

239
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,030
My goodness. He's...

240
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,530
What? What's going on?

241
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,640
- But...
- Is someone here?

242
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,680
Who is it? What's going on?

243
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,070
Isn't he the customs agent we met?

244
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
- Someone's here. Oh, my.
- Who is it?

245
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,770
- His name has "Gu", right?
- Hello.

246
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,140
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Hello.

247
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,640
(Kwon Hyeong Gu, assistant director,
plays cameo roles)

248
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,250
His name is Hyeong Gu.
What's wrong with you?

249
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,210
He failed last time.
Did he get a second chance?

250
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,210
I'm a lawyer.

251
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,780
- You're a lawyer?
- I see.

252
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,560
What kind of lawyer
would be shaking like that?

253
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,520
- I guess he drank a lot last night.
- Why...

254
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,760
- is your voice so shaky?
- No, it isn't.

255
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,130
I've seen a lot of lawyers
like him...

256
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,590
You're Chairman Yu's family, right?

257
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,160
- Yes, we are.
- All right.

258
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,330
He looks a little like
Lee Hong Ryeol.

259
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,870
- Hyeong Gu.
- He looks like Lee Hong Ryeol.

260
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,070
I can't help myself when I see it.

261
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,010
(Slapping)

262
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,200
I can't help myself when I see it.

263
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,550
He has such a big forehead.

264
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,550
- He has such a big forehead.
- I know what you mean.

265
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,690
- I can't help myself.
- I know.

266
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,280
- Please understand him.
- It's like flipping a pancake.

267
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,990
- It's a habit.
- He likes to play jokes.

268
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,260
- I have this habit.
- I know.

269
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,420
- Yes.
- All right, Hyeong Gu.

270
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,020
Oh, right. Grandpa was rich.
It must be about his inheritance.

271
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,330
- Oh, right.
- He had a lot of money.

272
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,190
Unlike our appearances,
our family is rich.

273
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,500
Exactly. Our family owns
a lot of properties.

274
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,160
That's why I married you, honey.

275
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,740
You didn't marry me for money.

276
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,530
You chose me because I'm handsome.

277
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,400
They got immersed in their
characters too much.

278
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,640
- They're doing method acting.
- Above all...

279
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,510
- I can't even breathe.
- They're...

280
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,400
- like method actors.
- They're like method actors.

281
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,120
- It feels like it's real.
- You look so happy.

282
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,940
It'll be hard for them
to get out of their characters.

283
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,040
Chairman Yoo made
his last will and testament.

284
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm here to deliver it to you.

285
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,920
I guess Grandpa kept up
with trends.

286
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,630
It looks like a mission envelope
we use.

287
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,190
(What could be written in his will?)

288
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,330
- It's quite long.
- It's long.

289
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,520
"Dear my children
and grandchildren."

290
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,100
I have decided to select the heir
in a fair and just manner...

291
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,930
after I leave this world.

292
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,740
Make three types of jeon
using eggs that I like...

293
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,300
and serve them
at the ancestral rite.

294
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,380
The family who finish preparing
the ritual table first...

295
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,810
will inherit a large portion
of my fortune.

296
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,350
The losing family
will do house chores.

297
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,680
"The losing family
will do house chores."

298
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,050
"Good luck, everyone."
My goodness.

299
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,260
I guess eggs are important
for today's mission.

300
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,020
Today is the 10th Chuseok...

301
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,690
after Chairman Yoo passed away.

302
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,390
The heirs will be chosen...

303
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,390
just as Chairman Yoo wrote
in his will.

304
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,510
We must be chosen as the heirs.

305
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,760
Each of you will receive 10 eggs.

306
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,710
You have to make 3 types of jeon
by 3 p.m...

307
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,580
using eggs that Chairman Yoo liked
following the given recipes.

308
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,220
The family that prepares the table
first will win.

309
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,540
- My team has only three members.
- That's right.

310
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,440
But you will have benefits instead.

311
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,780
Of course. Only then, it'll be fair.

312
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,150
It won't be hard
if we follow the recipes.

313
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,920
However, the number of eggs
you have is also important.

314
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,630
The person in the winning family
that has the least eggs...

315
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,130
will have to do house chores.

316
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,230
(The person with the least eggs
will do house chores.)

317
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,290
The rest members of the family
will inherit his fortune.

318
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,870
As for the losing family,

319
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,060
only the person with the most eggs
will inherit his fortune.

320
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,610
The rest of the family
will do house chores.

321
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,640
If a family fails to complete
the dishes by 3 p.m.,

322
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,710
all the members of the family
will do the chores...

323
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,080
- before going back home.
- Okay.

324
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,090
You can either hide
or protect your own eggs.

325
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,250
(It's within their discretion
to hide or protect their eggs.)

326
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,280
You can also find out
someone else's eggs...

327
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,780
and use them.

328
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,050
Meanwhile, you can get more eggs
by completing missions.

329
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,290
And all eggs have
only one day left on it,

330
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,650
so you can't resell them.

331
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,330
- So can we steal others' eggs?
- Yes.

332
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,330
(It means they can steal
someone else's eggs.)

333
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,260
Gosh, it will be a mess.

334
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,110
This is an individual game
after all.

335
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,300
You're right.

336
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,010
But it can be like a team game.

337
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,530
We will have to protect
our family anyway.

338
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,930
- Exactly.
- Right.

339
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,940
Please go take a look
at the ancestral rite table.

340
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,380
- Okay.
- Let's go.

341
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,880
- Jong Kook.
- Look.

342
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,080
Grandpa has a protruding mouth.

343
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,310
(Amazing DNA)

344
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,260
- Se Chan got his mouth.
- It's all mixed up.

345
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,180
He's got Jae Suk's teeth.

346
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,550
- He looks like me though.
- Right. He looks like Se Chan.

347
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,260
- They mixed our faces.
- Right.

348
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,920
I think you're right.

349
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,060
We should place
three kinds of jeon here.

350
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,500
- Okay.
- Egg jeon.

351
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,000
- We just need to make three jeon.
- All right. Get out of here.

352
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,710
I was talking about the key point.

353
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,010
(The recipe for three dishes will
be revealed after each mission.)

354
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,640
I have to protect my family first.

355
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,340
All right. Now you should
keep your eggs safe.

356
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,350
- But you can't carry them around.
- Right.

357
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,080
So I will give you some time
to hide the eggs...

358
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,380
in the neighborhood.

359
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,390
You can break the eggs
of your team, but...

360
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,220
- What?
- It can happen.

361
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,330
You can break
the eggs of your team members...

362
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,360
to make jeon quickly.

363
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,650
If you betray your team.

364
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,260
I can cook using
someone else's eggs.

365
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,630
Gosh, we should try
to make our team win.

366
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,790
- Family comes first.
- That's ridiculous.

367
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,640
- We can do that later.
- If you betray us...

368
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,560
- No, I won't do that.
- We will disown you.

369
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,740
- Seriously, I won't be like that.
- I won't let it slide.

370
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,340
I'll slap you in the face.

371
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,510
- Sure.
- I think our team will win easily.

372
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,440
Kwang Soo has been light-fingered
since he was little.

373
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,140
I take after my dad.

374
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,680
- Why do you think I'm like this?
- I know.

375
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,010
Gosh, this is dangerous.

376
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,390
- And Haha isn't so reliable.
- Gosh, no.

377
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,650
I know. He's just as bad.

378
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,020
- But we're quite clean.
- You guys are no different from us.

379
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,190
Uncle Kong Kook, didn't you say...

380
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,330
that you don't believe in
fortune-telling earlier this year?

381
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,420
- But you wear pink all the time.
- The best color for you...

382
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,160
- is pink.
- It's pink again.

383
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,430
I do believe it.

384
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,400
What are you talking about?

385
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,900
I shouldn't do things
that are not good for my fortune.

386
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,010
I'll give each family
five minutes...

387
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,640
to hide your eggs.

388
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,940
You should hide your eggs well
and look for others'.

389
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,670
It's disadvantageous
to hide eggs first.

390
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,540
Because the second team might
find some eggs while hiding theirs.

391
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
Exactly.

392
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,990
So the fathers will play the game
of slap-match to decide the order.

393
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,230
- Okay.
- Slap-match.

394
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,420
Dad!

395
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,260
- Great.
- My dad is the king of slap-match.

396
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,730
- Dad.
- I haven't done this for long.

397
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,260
We should play the game
of slap-match on Chuseok.

398
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,760
It's been a long time though.

399
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,730
We have to win this game.

400
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,760
Okay.

401
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,190
(Powerful player, Jong Kook,
King of slap-match, Jae Suk)

402
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,610
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

403
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,030
Put it down here.

404
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,470
Don't step on it.

405
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,610
- Go, Dad!
- Good luck!

406
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,040
Let's do this.

407
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
- Father, go get them!
- Dad!

408
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,670
(Jong Kook slaps first.)

409
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,940
Okay!

410
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,750
(Jong Kook fails to flip it.)

411
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,260
You've lost your strength.

412
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,630
(Rooting for their family)

413
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,830
It's okay.

414
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,260
Hang on.

415
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,100
- What are you doing?
- You did the same thing to mine.

416
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,470
Hey!

417
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,000
You did it too. It's okay.

418
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,430
There you go. That's my boy.

419
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,640
You're so cute.

420
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,970
(Jong Kook's eldest son is
a favored child in the family.)

421
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,900
(Ta-da.)

422
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,010
Move over.

423
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,080
You might get hit.

424
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,400
- Okay.
- You might get hit.

425
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,250
He can't do that
to Uncle Jong Kook though.

426
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,080
- Be quiet.
- Dad tried not to touch him.

427
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,410
Will you hurry? Go ahead.

428
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,490
(Jae Suk's turn)

429
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,540
1, 2, 3.

430
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,620
- Yes!
- Oh, no.

431
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,150
(Jae Suk fails to flip it.)

432
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,330
(It's Jong Kook's turn again.)

433
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,780
- Dad!
- Good luck!

434
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,420
(Jae Suk's ttakji)

435
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,130
(Jae Suk's turn)

436
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,530
(Jae Suk flipped
Jong Kook's ttakji.)

437
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,400
(Our dad won!)

438
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,670
(Jae Suk won
the game of slap-match.)

439
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,850
It's okay.

440
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,710
- Dad!
- Dad!

441
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,010
(They laugh and cry
playing the game of slap-match.)

442
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,750
We have to play the game
of slap-match on holidays.

443
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,750
Right.

444
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,850
- This is upsetting.
- Our family has become one.

445
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,050
Team Jong Kook lost the game.

446
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,590
I'll give you the eggs first.

447
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,630
- Okay.
- Take the eggs.

448
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,860
You can hide the eggs
in the entire area.

449
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,360
It has my name on it.

450
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,230
If you find their eggs
while hiding yours,

451
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,060
you can break them
or use them to make jeon.

452
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,290
All right, Team Jong Kook.
Please begin.

453
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,740
- You have five minutes.
- Okay.

454
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,760
Do we have to hide all of them?

455
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,640
My gosh.

456
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,900
Where should I hide these?
If they find our eggs,

457
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,750
I'm sure they will break them.

458
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,900
What should I do?

459
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,170
My gosh.

460
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,910
Where should I hide them?
This is serious.

461
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,990
I think we should go up there.

462
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,890
(Se Chan hides his eggs...)

463
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,860
(in a kitchen cupboard.)

464
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
(Ji Hyo hides her eggs...)

465
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,050
(in a tissue box.)

466
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,230
This is good.

467
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,370
(This is perfect.)

468
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,370
What if I can't find my own eggs?

469
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,510
This isn't open.

470
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,880
Where should I hide the eggs?

471
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,380
(Where should I hide the eggs?)

472
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,170
Hang on. I'm pressed for time.

473
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,170
(She has only 5 minutes,
so she's pressed for time.)

474
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,170
Oh, right. Open your bag.

475
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,850
Open your bag.

476
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,010
Don't break them.

477
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,990
You have three.
Make sure not to break them.

478
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,490
Seriously, you should
never break them.

479
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,120
(She found an even better place.)

480
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,780
Don't break this.

481
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,860
(Don't break this.)

482
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,860
Don't you dare break it.
You have one egg here.

483
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,730
(Meanwhile,
Jong Kook's eldest son is...)

484
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,790
Be careful.

485
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,430
(He's filming a thriller
by himself.)

486
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,890
I hid five eggs in here.

487
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,210
I should hide one more.
There are six here.

488
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,640
I will hide mine in this house.

489
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,710
Where?

490
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,940
- Why do you ask?
- You...

491
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,140
- Don't be like that.
- Why do you ask?

492
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,380
It's not like I'll do
something with your eggs.

493
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,180
Even your family might betray you.

494
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,220
You never know.

495
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,460
You can't say that we never know.

496
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,810
- Haha, listen to me.
- I know them.

497
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,330
- I can't believe them.
- Dad, don't even think about it.

498
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,830
I want my team to win.

499
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,100
(He doesn't really mean it.)

500
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,390
You think? Then why
are you going there?

501
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,660
- What?
- You said you want our team to win.

502
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,370
I'm just checking to see
if there's a place to hide.

503
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,640
I should definitely
hide some in the house.

504
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,240
But this is...

505
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,980
Where should it go?

506
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
I don't think it's a good idea
to hide them separately.

507
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,800
Should I hide them all together?

508
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,670
(Staring at Kwang Soo)

509
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,890
(He's like a hyena
lying in wait for his prey.)

510
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,990
Gosh, Haha.

511
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,180
(He gets caught...)

512
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,620
(staring at Kwang Woo.)

513
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,860
- Don't be like that.
- What? Why?

514
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,130
- What?
- Let's not do this to each other.

515
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,520
- What did I do?
- I could see it on your face.

516
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,830
What did I do?

517
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,520
- Don't do that.
- Gosh, no.

518
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,970
I didn't do anything.

519
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,540
Do you really want to do this
to each other?

520
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,640
I mean...

521
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
You two are brothers.

522
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,270
Why are you hiding it
while saying that?

523
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
All right.

524
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,170
We are family. We have to
make our team win. Okay?

525
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,970
(Team Jong Kook is done
hiding their eggs.)

526
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,550
Shall we go out now?

527
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,910
Please go ahead
and hide your eggs.

528
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,210
It's obvious
where they hid the eggs.

529
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,640
It's better for us to find them.

530
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,860
I'm sure they hid it there.

531
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,210
(They will look for the eggs
while hiding theirs.)

532
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,250
I should find eggs
in a place like this.

533
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,300
Do you want to leave your egg here
with me to prove our friendship?

534
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,360
Really?

535
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,890
- If it breaks, we're done.
- Right. We're done.

536
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,370
Then I'll break your eggs.

537
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,420
Haha, here.

538
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,190
Let's put the eggs in here.

539
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,040
This is about friendship.

540
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,080
Put it in.

541
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
(Haha puts his egg
in the liquor box.)

542
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,550
(Is Kwang Soo
putting in his as well?)

543
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,310
Wait. You didn't put in yours.

544
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,320
(Only good people can see
Kwang Soo's egg.)

545
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,550
Oh, right. I should
put mine in here.

546
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,550
Okay.

547
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,790
- Get lost.
- Haha.

548
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,480
- Forget it. Get lost.
- Haha.

549
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,180
- Haha, I'm serious.
- No.

550
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,920
- I'm not doing this.
- Give me another chance.

551
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,330
(Kwang Soo has the liquor box
to himself now.)

552
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,600
What?

553
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,730
My gosh.

554
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,300
Haha.

555
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,730
(He found eggs?)

556
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,780
(Jong Kook hid 2 eggs in the box.)

557
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,280
- My gosh.
- Are there eggs?

558
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,710
(He runs hurriedly
to Kwang Soo upon hearing the news.)

559
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,050
- Let me see.
- Look.

560
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,050
My gosh.

561
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,820
We have to get rid of them.

562
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,350
We should make jeon with these.

563
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,590
Let's do that.

564
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,910
We should use them.

565
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,860
This is amazing.

566
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,860
This is great. Well done.

567
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,220
(Kwang Soo is on fire.
Where is he hiding his eggs?)

568
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,630
- No.
- What?

569
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,270
Why?

570
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,300
(He looks anxious.)

571
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,340
Why?

572
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,000
(He smells a rat and goes
through the bag hurriedly.)

573
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,410
(He found So Min's eggs in the bag.)

574
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,390
We all have the same ideas.

575
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,710
I can find more eggs. I can.

576
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,210
What do you want, honey?
Let me pour you some juice.

577
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,560
Get me a cup.

578
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,530
I'll get you some juice.

579
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,790
Thank you.

580
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,690
Suk Jin likes water.
Don't give him juice.

581
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,330
- He'd want some.
- No. He doesn't drink juice.

582
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,390
He only drinks water.

583
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,420
I like juice.

584
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,340
- I like juice.
- No. This is for your health.

585
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,930
You haven't changed
since your childhood.

586
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,870
No, Suk Jin. Just drink water.

587
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,970
You just fell for a woman and...

588
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,240
I fell for a woman?

589
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,550
Honey, you should watch and learn.

590
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,970
What do you mean?

591
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,020
- I'm nice to you.
- She wants him to watch and learn.

592
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,550
I'm really...

593
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,640
Honey.

594
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,940
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?

595
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,390
What?

596
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,950
(They all are flustered.)

597
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,800
(Even the skit master is flustered
by the situation.)

598
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,070
(Something amazing happened
to them before they knew it.)

599
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,570
- This is great.
- Already?

600
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,220
- Good for you.
- Already?

601
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,730
- Look at you.
- There you go.

602
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,370
- No.
- Look at you.

603
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,500
You're just back
from your honeymoon.

604
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,170
You're unbelievable.

605
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,080
- Hang on.
- Your honeymoon...

606
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,670
Isn't it that you have
an upset stomach?

607
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,900
- Don't try anything strange.
- No.

608
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,940
It's an upset stomach.

609
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,410
(They are having a productive day.)

610
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,290
No. While hiding her eggs,

611
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,090
she ate a raw egg.

612
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,980
They're back.

613
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,790
Why are you fighting already?

614
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,130
Uncle Jae Suk, why are you
fighting already?

615
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,650
Gosh, he's unbelievable.

616
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,570
- There you go again.
- He's really sly.

617
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,800
Kwang Soo, what's wrong?

618
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,990
- Why are you guys fighting?
- We should do this together.

619
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,540
- Don't do things like that.
- What?

620
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,570
Oh, it wasn't him.
Don't do things like that.

621
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,500
(He yells at Suk Jin
for no reason.)

622
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,580
Oh, it wasn't him.
Stop doing things like that.

623
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,350
- Why did you get confused?
- It's a habit.

624
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,610
- I see. Okay.
- Can you make some room for us?

625
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,210
Well... Can I call Se Chan's wife
by her name?

626
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,940
- You can...
- She's your niece-in-law, so...

627
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,320
- You can call me Sweetheart.
- Sweetheart.

628
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,680
- "Sweetheart"?
- Yes.

629
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,390
She told us great news earlier.

630
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,290
- She even did that too?
- Yes.

631
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,560
Just earlier, she did it.

632
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,870
(Jae Suk is taken aback.)

633
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,160
She meant that she can't cook today.

634
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,430
It means Ji Hyo should
do all the work.

635
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,930
- To avoid doing work?
- Yes.

636
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,570
She even had that calculated
in her head.

637
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,430
My goodness. I'm surprised.

638
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,500
My dear Pouty Mouth...

639
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Pouty Mouth is the fetus' name.

640
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,400
- We named the fetus Pouty Mouth.
- Yes, Pouty Mouth.

641
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,200
- I didn't know.
- That's intense.

642
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,470
- What now?
- I'm dizzy.

643
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,970
Will our show air at 11 p.m?

644
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,980
(The airing schedule might
be changed.)

645
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,850
The 1st mission will begin
in 10 minutes.

646
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,980
Before that, we'll give you
the recipes.

647
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,090
Whether you use your own eggs
or someone else's,

648
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,450
you just have to make jeon...

649
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,300
and put the exact number of jeon
on the table.

650
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,600
You're not allowed to steal
food on the table and broken eggs.

651
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,030
- Broken eggs?
- Yes.

652
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,460
- You can't steal any broken eggs.
- We should steal it before cooking.

653
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,800
Yes, you need to steal an egg
before it's broken for cooking.

654
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,700
Remember you can't steal such eggs.
We'll give you the recipes now.

655
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,900
- The recipes?
- Yes.

656
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,080
- I think we should...
- Here you go.

657
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,670
- Thanks.
- We should go in.

658
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,500
- Let's go in.
- Team Jae Suk will receive...

659
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,170
(Beef jeon)

660
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,240
(Beat five eggs
and add salt and pepper.)

661
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
(Make 10 pieces of beef jeon,
and it's done.)

662
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,390
Considering the difference
of the number of members,

663
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,680
Team Jae Suk will receive
three pieces of each type of jeon.

664
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Because we have fewer members?

665
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,650
- So we have to make 10 pieces.
- We have to make 10 pieces.

666
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,920
"Add salt and pepper..."

667
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,270
- And then cover the meat...
- "Cover the meat with flour,"

668
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,300
- "and then cover it with egg."
- Then we can just fry it.

669
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,430
- Is that it?
- Yes, 10 pieces.

670
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,400
We need five eggs,
which is the most important.

671
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,080
- Exactly.
- We need five eggs.

672
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,970
We need beaten-up eggs.

673
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,850
It's important to get five eggs.
Hold on a second.

674
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,320
It gave me a lot to think about.

675
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,210
We should figure out
what would be the best.

676
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,390
- My gosh.
- Are we going to play a game?

677
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,790
You'll play a game
to get more eggs.

678
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,890
And you'll have a 10-minute break
while cooking.

679
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,560
You can find your eggs back
or steal someone else's eggs.

680
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,060
- Shall we go outside?
- We need more eggs.

681
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,150
Let's go outside
to bring our eggs...

682
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,160
- Let's find some eggs.
- Broken eggs can't be stolen.

683
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,430
- Let's go out to find some eggs.
- Right?

684
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,570
If we break an egg outside,
we can't use it, right?

685
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,610
Can't they steal it
if I break it now?

686
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,370
(Can't they steal it
if I break it now?)

687
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,840
- Can I break it now?
- Yes, you can.

688
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,780
- Whose egg is it?
- Whose egg is this?

689
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,850
Is it yours?

690
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,670
(The owner of the broken egg is...)

691
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,090
- It's So Min's.
- What? Where did you find it?

692
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,350
- I found So Min's egg.
- Where?

693
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,680
- Do you have more?
- Hey, step on it.

694
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,020
- Where did you find it?
- I found So Min's.

695
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,590
I can break another one, right?

696
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,980
- Yes.
- Really?

697
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,860
(I can break another one, right?)

698
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,220
- Whose is this?
- Whose egg is it?

699
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,830
I found Jong Kook's egg.

700
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,070
(I found Jong Kook's egg.)

701
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,330
- What?
- Jong Kook.

702
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,570
Hey, Jong Kook.
Oh, right. He's my dad now.

703
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,870
You broke two eggs.

704
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,840
- Yes, I broke 2 eggs.
- You need 3 more eggs.

705
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,880
Jong Kook, one of your eggs
is broken.

706
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,430
I won't forget what he did.

707
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,970
I have made up my mind.

708
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,170
(I have made up my mind, Kwang Soo.)

709
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,520
(Without knowing
Uncle Jong Kook is mad at him,)

710
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,710
(Kwang Soo is looking for
another egg.)

711
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,890
(The master of finding eggs
is searching every cupboard.)

712
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,830
I think they hid an egg... What?

713
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,920
(Did he find another egg?)

714
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,220
(It's the egg that Se Chan hid.)

715
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,370
Okay.

716
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,730
I'm on a roll today.

717
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,930
(He's like an egg detective.)

718
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,460
I'm on a roll.

719
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,460
(He's like an egg detective.)

720
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,380
(My gosh!)

721
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,080
- Go away.
- Wait.

722
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
- Why?
- No reason.

723
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,970
- It's not what you think it is.
- Let me see it.

724
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,670
- I'll just have a look.
- What? It's not yours.

725
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,790
Hey, don't do that. Jae Suk!

726
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,890
- Why?
- I said, stop it.

727
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,590
- Jae Suk! Stop it.
- What is it?

728
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,820
Stop it.

729
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,890
- I'm serious.
- Why?

730
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,330
- Hey, stop.
- Jae Suk, stop her.

731
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,860
- What's wrong with you?
- Get her away from me. Look at her.

732
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,560
My gosh. Seriously.

733
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,300
- Jae Suk.
- Stop. Gosh, seriously.

734
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,390
Why are you doing this?

735
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,600
- Come on.
- I have something to tell him.

736
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,370
- What is wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

737
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,070
(Kwang Soo put the egg
in his mouth.)

738
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,570
(Cracking)

739
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,080
(The egg got broken in his mouth.)

740
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,080
Hey, come on. My gosh.

741
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,110
- Okay.
- Hey.

742
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,780
(It's so embarrassing
to show this on Chuseok.)

743
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,470
(The dirty fight in the Yoo family)

744
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,590
Okay. I broke one egg.

745
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,250
Why did you put it in your mouth?

746
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,950
- You can't use it now.
- She tried to...

747
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,680
Oh, boy. You can't use it now.

748
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,180
She tried to break the eggs
in my bag.

749
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,190
I can't believe this.

750
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,650
Was it Se Chan's egg?

751
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,990
Gosh.

752
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,070
I should've broken it sooner.
I broke almost five eggs.

753
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,730
I don't have any left...
Gosh. Jae Suk!

754
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,460
She broke another one!

755
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,430
Hey, how could you... Jeon So Min.

756
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,670
She broke Jong Kook's egg too.

757
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,970
(2 of the 4 eggs Kwang Soo found
are useless now.)

758
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,970
Jae Suk, we had four eggs.

759
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,550
I shouldn't have come
into this room. Darn it.

760
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,290
Did they fight again?

761
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,890
- We found a few eggs,
- Really?

762
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,480
- Whose eggs?
- but So Min broke all of them.

763
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,620
Who did that? Was it Ji Hyo?

764
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,630
I just said So Min did it.

765
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,680
(I just said So Min did it.)

766
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,490
Your eldest son can't seem to
get it together.

767
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,830
- Honey, I'm here.
- Oh, right.

768
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,390
You shouldn't go near So Min.

769
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,430
- Why?
- He has Alzheimer's.

770
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,190
I found two eggs,
but she broke them both.

771
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,230
Whose eggs were they?

772
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,660
One was yours,
and the other was Jong Kook's.

773
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,700
How did you find mine?

774
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,970
I found yours
where I was going to hide mine.

775
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,170
- Gosh.
- We all think alike.

776
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,000
- But she broke them.
- Did you find mine?

777
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,380
Jong Kook, let's begin.

778
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,320
- Okay.
- So you found my egg.

779
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
Is that mine?

780
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,290
- Why did you do that?
- What?

781
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,710
- Where did you find that?
- Sit down.

782
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,480
- That's yours too.
- This one is yours too.

783
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,120
Why did you find only mine?

784
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,390
It's Kwang Soo's.

785
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,150
(The eldest daughter-in-law Ji Hyo
found two eggs of Kwang Soo.)

786
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,130
Let's put it in here.

787
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,490
(She's proud.)

788
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,390
- Didn't you break the other egg?
- There was another one.

789
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,770
I put two in the bowl.

790
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,430
Why did you keep one egg?

791
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,700
- I put it in my pocket.
- Why?

792
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,930
- It must've been broken.
- To exchange it with mine.

793
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,500
- Gosh, you.
- Gosh.

794
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,500
(He's unbelievable.)

795
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,880
- Well...
- Bring one of your eggs.

796
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,080
I feel like we have another member.

797
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,240
It's like "X-Man".

798
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
- We found three eggs.
- Why did you do that?

799
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,320
I planned to exchange the egg...

800
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,590
with mine if I saw someone
finding mine, but So Min broke it.

801
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,290
Good job, So Min. Good job.

802
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,330
- Thank you.
- Well done, Sweetheart.

803
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,530
- She's good at everything.
- Gosh.

804
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,690
- Darn it.
- It's a tie, right?

805
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,370
We'll begin the first mission now.

806
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,990
The first mission is
Nagging Hide-and-Seek.

807
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,500
Both teams will play
offense and defense.

808
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,610
The defensive team write
what you heard the most...

809
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,580
on national holidays
on your headband,

810
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,350
and hide in three minutes.

811
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,940
The offensive team must find them
in 10 minutes,

812
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,550
and when you read the phrase
on the headband, that person is out.

813
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,550
That sounds fun.

814
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,890
The team that eliminates all members
on the other team faster wins...

815
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,980
- and will receive three eggs.
- Great.

816
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,180
- Okay.
- While hiding or searching,

817
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,990
you can look for eggs
or hide them as well.

818
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,920
The three of you will wait...

819
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,070
- in this room.
- We can just read the phrases.

820
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,300
Since this team has five members,

821
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,540
three of you will be tied together.

822
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,930
Then let's have Jong Kook
and Se Chan play individually...

823
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,930
- and we...
- The three of us together.

824
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,500
Then your team wins.

825
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,580
So Min, write a phrase on it.

826
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,350
Write something they would
never be able to imagine.

827
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,710
- "Why won't you get married?"
- Do you know any difficult phrases?

828
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,710
(They're trying to think of
something difficult to read.)

829
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,140
- You mean, English phrases?
- Yes, English phrases.

830
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,480
You know... Something that sounds
like packshae... Payshave?

831
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,320
- "Why don't you..."
- "Don't do..."

832
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,090
Is there a word like "newtrorasive"?

833
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,750
Something long and difficult.

834
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,750
(He's making up weird words.)

835
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,690
It's so frustrating
since I'm not good at English.

836
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,690
- "You should..."
- Poly... Polyster...

837
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,570
- No.
- Or...

838
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:46,160
How about that word?
It begins with "F". Fa... Fame...

839
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,500
What is it that you want to say?

840
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,730
I just want difficult English words.

841
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,140
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

842
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,380
- "Favorite"?
- "Favorite"?

843
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,580
- "Favorite"?
- Yes.

844
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,080
I'm sure they'll write
something difficult.

845
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,940
Jae Suk, tell us
some difficult phrases.

846
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
(Jae Suk, tell us
some difficult phrases.)

847
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,590
They won't be able to read
Chinese characters.

848
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,480
None of them will.

849
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,330
They won't be able to read it
even if we stand in front of them.

850
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,130
We can just walk around
without worrying about them.

851
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,420
Let's write Chinese characters
and find some more eggs.

852
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,430
That's a great idea.

853
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,140
Let's just walk around.

854
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,110
Jae Suk, I'm so happy that I'm
on your team. My dad.

855
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,930
I respect him so much,
and I'm proud of him.

856
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,400
Me too. He's so cool.

857
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,170
How about this?

858
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,470
"Hwang Min, go and tell
his mom to come here."

859
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,440
Hwang Min is my cousin's name.

860
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,560
It'll be hard for them
to guess his name, right?

861
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,290
"So Min, go and..."

862
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,750
- What should I write?
- Go on.

863
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,100
"And bring Hwang Min's mom here..."

864
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,830
- Grandmothers often say that.
- Exactly.

865
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,660
- It's done.
- That's better.

866
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,800
"You should do awesome comedy..."

867
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,930
- "that everyone would like."
- That everyone would like.

868
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
(Tell Hwang Min's mom
to come to Hakgok-ri.)

869
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
You should leave now.
You have three minutes.

870
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,700
- Let's get going.
- We have to hide outside.

871
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,400
- Jong Kook, shall we go there?
- Yes?

872
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,410
- Where?
- The trampoline.

873
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,410
Shall we?

874
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,710
They can't read this
even if they find us.

875
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,680
- That's a good idea.
- Let's go up there.

876
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,390
- I thought the same thing.
- Suk Jin,

877
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,980
don't worry about us
and keep So Min safe.

878
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,060
- Okay. We will...
- Honey, see you later.

879
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,830
- We should find more eggs too.
- Let's go up.

880
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,920
- Let's find some eggs too.
- Sorry?

881
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,030
Let's do that.

882
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,370
There it is.

883
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,370
(He's excited!)

884
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,430
(Se Chan has nothing to fear
as he has everything he needs.)

885
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,640
Let's make them all fall down.

886
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,640
- Let's go in.
- That's a great idea.

887
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,840
- Here we go.
- Okay.

888
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,900
- If they try to come in here,
- Hey.

889
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
we can make them fall down.

890
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,670
- You stay there. I'll be here.
- At the corner.

891
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,440
- When they come in here,
- Yes.

892
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,390
- we can make them fall down.
- Exactly.

893
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,390
(They think like little boys.)

894
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,390
Let's go this way.

895
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,680
- I found Kwang Soo's egg here.
- Really?

896
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,330
He hid his eggs around here.

897
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,220
- How about we hide in a car?
- How about we hide in a car?

898
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,300
- That's a good idea.
- Me too. Let's hide in a car.

899
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,330
(They're innocent
like little children.)

900
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,770
- 8, 7,
- Let's go.

901
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,300
- 6, 5...
- Tell them we're here.

902
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,660
4, 3,

903
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,960
- 2, 1.
- We'll let them know.

904
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,370
The mission starts.

905
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,670
We'll find them.

906
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
- Let's find them first.
- There they are.

907
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,080
- You read Se Chan's.
- They're here.

908
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,470
(Come here and try to read mine.)

909
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,120
We welcome everyone
who comes here.

910
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,360
(He's excited about playing
with his cousins.)

911
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,360
(Like this.)

912
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,330
(He's singing excitedly.)

913
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,420
(The nausea-inducing
jumping strategy)

914
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
"Everyone..."

915
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,420
(The nausea-inducing
jumping strategy)

916
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,460
"Everyone would..."

917
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,930
"Everyone would like"?
"Everyone would like". Yes.

918
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,930
(They're not doing
the Sargent jump.)

919
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,350
- Kwang Soo, take a look.
- Hey.

920
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,970
You can't be there.

921
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,790
- You can't grab him.
- Hold on.

922
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,350
- Just a second...
- Se Chan!

923
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,450
Awesome and favorite...

924
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,250
- And...
- And favorite...

925
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,390
- Favorite.
- Yes, favorite.

926
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,830
Awesome and...

927
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,920
You should do awesome comedy
that everyone would like.

928
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,690
Awesome and... Right?

929
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Nice.

930
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,730
(Se Chan's out!)

931
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,800
Run, Jong Kook!

932
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,400
(Jong Kook manages
to escape on his own.)

933
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,580
It's Jong Kook. My gosh.

934
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,930
He looks like a servant, doesn't he?

935
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,850
Especially with that
around his head.

936
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,970
Why isn't anyone coming over here?

937
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,620
It's a little upsetting.

938
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,620
This has to be the best spot.

939
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,320
(They're well hidden,
but too well hidden.)

940
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,090
(They're bored.)

941
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,720
(Stomach rumbling)

942
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,330
I must be hungry.

943
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,130
- Are you?
- Did your stomach rumble?

944
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,720
- It's upsetting.
- I know.

945
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,300
They're not letting us do our jobs.

946
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,160
Let's work, people.

947
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,960
I want to work.

948
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,230
Can I find the eggs then?
I can, right?

949
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,840
(After being eliminated,
Se Chan searches for the eggs.)

950
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,900
Hold on a second.

951
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,850
Okay.

952
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,550
(He spots an egg.)

953
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,780
It's Jong Kook's.

954
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,240
It's Jong Kook's.

955
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,210
(It's Jong Kook's.)

956
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,980
Darn.

957
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,890
(Se Chan spots an egg
that belongs to his team member.)

958
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,290
Darn.

959
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,800
(What do I do?)

960
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,100
(And so the inner struggle begins.)

961
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,870
(Up until 5 minutes ago,
they rode the trampoline together.)

962
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,700
(The servant is clueless
as to what's happening.)

963
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,810
Where's our bowl?

964
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,810
(What choice will Se Chan make?)

965
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,110
It's Jong Kook's.

966
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,700
(I'll add Jong Kook's egg.)

967
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,520
(He quickly cracks it
before anyone sees him.)

968
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,320
This is Jong Kook's too.

969
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,130
(He adds two eggs
that both belong to Jong Kook.)

970
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,180
(Team Jong Kook's egg count)

971
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,290
That's four.

972
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,920
(Meanwhile,
Haha's only searching for eggs.)

973
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,990
This is So Min's.

974
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,030
What else can I do though?

975
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,160
(They have all their five eggs.)

976
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,640
That's five, right?

977
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
- Where are they?
- 7, 6...

978
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,500
- Where's Suk Jin?
- 5, 4,

979
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,240
3, 2, 1.

980
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,280
- It's impossible to find them.
- Please gather around.

981
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,780
(The search ends
with only Se Chan being eliminated.)

982
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,890
- Why couldn't you find us?
- Where were you?

983
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,360
- We were all upset.
- Weren't you in a room?

984
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,560
An urgent situation
never occurred for us.

985
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,420
- Why didn't you look for us?
- It was upsetting, you know.

986
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,030
Did you find some eggs?

987
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,630
How many did you find?

988
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,660
- Did you find more?
- Yes.

989
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,220
- You? How many?
- Yes.

990
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,570
I found Haha's.

991
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,300
- Just one?
- Yes. Let's head upstairs.

992
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,040
- Do we have 4 then?
- Yes, we only need 1 more.

993
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,160
We only need one more.

994
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
(It's Team Jae Suk's turn to hide.)

995
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,780
For us, this is just a formality.

996
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,140
We'll be searching for eggs instead.

997
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,310
(Team Jae Suk's plan:
Find the eggs.)

998
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,520
Keep searching for the eggs
even if they find you.

999
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,120
- Okay, got it.
- You know what I mean, right?

1000
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,180
- The prize is only three eggs.
- Okay.

1001
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,410
(Instead of hiding,
they'll be searching for the eggs.)

1002
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,090
What's a difficult
Chinese idiom to read?

1003
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,090
Are you done?

1004
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,480
Sasangnugak.

1005
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,390
- Sasangnugak?
- Yes, sasangnugak.

1006
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,300
That'll be okay.

1007
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,330
"Always keep in mind..."

1008
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,540
"the four-character Chinese idiom,
sasangnugak."

1009
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,370
"Always keep in mind..."

1010
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,400
"the four-character Chinese idiom,
sasangnugak."

1011
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,500
(Kwang Soo searches
the definition of "sasangnugak".)

1012
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,110
Sasangnugak means...

1013
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,880
a house of cards.

1014
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,910
Right. So what did you write down?

1015
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,240
"Always keep in mind..."

1016
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,280
"the four-character Chinese idiom,
sasangnugak."

1017
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,820
And one should.

1018
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,890
- A strong foundation is always key.
- That's right.

1019
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:10,910
Right.

1020
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,820
(Always keep in mind
the Chinese, idiom sasangnugak.)

1021
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,150
(Wherever I am,
let nangjungjichu happen.)

1022
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,730
(Haesan lies in front of me
while Songshan is behind me.)

1023
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,960
Here we go then.

1024
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,690
Where would they be?

1025
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,770
I doubt there are any here.

1026
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,290
They won't make it that easy.

1027
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,190
This is a good hiding spot.

1028
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,270
(Searching thoroughly)

1029
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,600
- The search will begin.
- What should we do first?

1030
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,810
Should we find the other team
or the eggs?

1031
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,230
Let's see where they are.

1032
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,870
- Are you searching for eggs?
- Of course.

1033
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,310
We should look for the eggs.

1034
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,210
Let's see where they're hiding.

1035
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,170
(How are my eggs doing?)

1036
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,580
They're doing well.

1037
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,460
(Someone comes by.)

1038
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,690
They're doing well.

1039
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,830
(Jae Suk was on
the opposite side.)

1040
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,120
It's Jae Suk!

1041
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,790
(He runs away
after spotting So Min's eggs.)

1042
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,400
Kwang Soo!

1043
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,900
(He spots the eggs and calls
Kwang Soo to run away together.)

1044
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,500
She's on my tail. Come on.

1045
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,650
(Without being able
to put on his shoes properly,)

1046
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,770
(he runs with his hair
flapping in the wind.)

1047
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,190
- Wait. Someone took my eggs.
- Here she comes.

1048
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,080
(Kwang Soo hides in the back.)

1049
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,580
Man... No, young lady...

1050
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,650
(He jumps over the wall
before she can read it.)

1051
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,350
Jae Suk!

1052
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,620
Must you go this far?

1053
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,900
(His cameraman is forced
to jump over the wall too.)

1054
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,770
I can't jump the wall.

1055
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:42,350
(The grasshopper within him
remembers how to be nimble.)

1056
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,670
There's nowhere to go from there.

1057
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,850
Must you go this far?

1058
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,920
(Do you have a problem with this?)

1059
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,210
I saw "man".

1060
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,420
(So Min turned around
to go back when...)

1061
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,420
Aren't there any eggs here?

1062
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,190
(Is something there?)

1063
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,270
(Gulps)

1064
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,330
(She slowly moves toward Kwang Soo.)

1065
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,140
Don't you have a bag?

1066
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,060
(Her voice keeps getting closer.)

1067
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,600
Don't you have a bag?
You're not carrying a bag.

1068
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,370
You're not carrying a bag.

1069
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,080
Hey!

1070
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,540
(Busted!)

1071
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,810
Hold on. Hey!

1072
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,810
(An unexpected profit)

1073
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,210
Get over here.

1074
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,250
You took my egg, didn't you?

1075
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,690
I won't guess your sentence,
so give me back my egg.

1076
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,080
- I couldn't find it.
- Someone took mine.

1077
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,750
- Sangnugak...
- Kwang Soo, no.

1078
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,060
An old bachelor.

1079
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,020
An old bachelor.

1080
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,770
(She has no idea
what sasangnugak is.)

1081
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,900
- Don't be like this.
- I'll get down.

1082
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,690
I'll get down there.

1083
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,790
(He's relieved by
her lack of intelligence.)

1084
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,310
What is called sasangnugak...

1085
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,100
Wherever I am...

1086
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,400
(She can't read any of the idioms.)

1087
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,770
- Wherever I am...
- This will block her view.

1088
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,150
- Wherever you are...
- Can you hold us both yourself?

1089
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,440
- Did you find them?
- We need to read this.

1090
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,810
- Nang...
- Here they are.

1091
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,810
Can you read that?

1092
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,980
Wherever I am,
let "nangjungjihu" happen.

1093
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,120
- Wherever you are...
- The idiom.

1094
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,460
Make sure you're always bold, Ji Ho.

1095
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,730
It's nangjungjichu!

1096
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,900
Wherever I am,
let nangjungjichu happen.

1097
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,790
Wherever I am,
let nangjungjichu happen!

1098
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,540
- Jae Suk, you're out.
- Okay.

1099
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,060
- Sasangnugak...
- It's an idiom.

1100
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,540
The Chinese idiom sasangnugak...

1101
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,480
- Jae Suk, you must come out.
- Right.

1102
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,250
I can't believe I saw it as "Ji Ho".

1103
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,770
- The time...
- 10 seconds left!

1104
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,850
10 seconds!

1105
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,580
- Sasangnugak...
- Sasangnugak...

1106
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,620
Always keep in mind
the Chinese idiom...

1107
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,650
Six...

1108
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,620
- Do you know what it means?
- Incorrect.

1109
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,790
(Incorrect!)

1110
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,960
- Okay, good.
- What was it?

1111
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,420
- The idiom...
- At least one was saved.

1112
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,060
It's "Always keep in mind."

1113
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,620
- So that's what it was.
- That was close!

1114
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,170
- The Chinese idiom sasangnugak...
- Always keep it in mind.

1115
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,270
I missed that last part.

1116
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,400
- So...
- I read most of it though.

1117
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,900
So Min would never have guessed it
had she been alone.

1118
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,100
So Min was completely clueless.

1119
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,810
She didn't know what
nangjungjichu was.

1120
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,040
If it weren't for Suk Jin,

1121
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,940
I wouldn't have guessed it at all.

1122
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,580
How can you not know
what nangjungjichu is?

1123
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,710
You said "Ji Ho" at the end.

1124
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,420
That's what I thought it was,
so I kept saying it.

1125
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,390
We ran all over the place,
didn't we?

1126
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,420
You ran to places
that didn't have any paths.

1127
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,580
He ran through the bushes.

1128
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,690
Let me tell you...

1129
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,520
that I saw Hong Gil Dong in person.

1130
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,690
- Hong Gil Dong is real.
- I made noises too.

1131
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,770
- Jump, jump, and run.
- Exactly.

1132
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,690
- Didn't you hear me?
- Was that you?

1133
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,560
Anyway, Team Jong Kook
won this game.

1134
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,140
- You get three eggs.
- What a relief.

1135
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,830
- Thank you.
- You can cook with these...

1136
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,870
or accept stickers
if that's what you decide on.

1137
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,980
- Right.
- Let's use one.

1138
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,310
- Can't we use one?
- Let's use one to cook.

1139
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,480
- Just one.
- Right.

1140
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,980
You can get stickers on them.

1141
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,310
- Why don't you...
- We have other games to play.

1142
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,920
Can I get one then?

1143
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,150
I lost three of mine.

1144
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,480
- Well...
- Hold on.

1145
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,420
Father, that's another issue.

1146
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,560
We didn't tell you
how much you all lost.

1147
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,190
- Well...
- Hand them over.

1148
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,870
Hold on a second. Suk Jin...

1149
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,670
You didn't lose any of yours,
so why are you being greedy?

1150
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,500
(Even Jong Kook is
too immersed in his character.)

1151
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,230
Did you hear that?

1152
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,830
Right, he's my father today.

1153
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,100
Who taught you to be this greedy?

1154
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,150
Who else? I'm just like you, Dad!

1155
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,270
- I mean...
- How's this a functioning family?

1156
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,420
Let me know
once you come to a decision.

1157
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,210
- Suk Jin...
- Here's the second recipe.

1158
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,390
Why are you being greedy
when you still have all your eggs?

1159
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,190
More skewers?

1160
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,400
- Jong Kook.
- He hasn't lost any of his eggs.

1161
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,520
We need five eggs for this recipe,

1162
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,870
- so let's use them all.
- Right.

1163
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,640
- Okay, let's use them all.
- Right.

1164
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,210
It's now lunchtime.

1165
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,000
You can use all the products here.

1166
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,540
- The shelves are packed.
- Really?

1167
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,150
Enjoy your meal and get cooking.

1168
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,210
The next round will begin at 1 p.m.

1169
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,250
(Team Jong Kook's egg count)

1170
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,620
Let's crack one more here.

1171
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,310
- Yes, of course.
- Crack one more.

1172
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,650
What about the other eggs?

1173
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,480
- We'll crack them in there.
- We'll need them for other games.

1174
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,230
We should have them cracked open.

1175
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,420
- Crack two over there.
- Right.

1176
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,960
(The fifth egg is cracked.)

1177
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,640
- Se Chan, we need another bowl.
- A bowl? Got it.

1178
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,810
(They need a new bowl
for the tricolored skewers.)

1179
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,080
(While Team Jong Kook
steps ahead...)

1180
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,400
- Haha.
- Yes?

1181
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,810
What should we eat?

1182
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,810
We need to make the beef jeon.
There's a lot to do.

1183
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,040
- Let's eat lunch first though.
- Right.

1184
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,170
We're starving, right?

1185
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,540
There really is a lot.

1186
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,920
There are cup noodles.

1187
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,520
Then let's start eating.

1188
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,960
(Se Chan comes by to get a bowl.)

1189
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
I'm hungry.

1190
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,560
- Me too.
- We should eat.

1191
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,460
- Hold on.
- Se Chan.

1192
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,100
I'm going to crack yours.

1193
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,120
Why would you do that?

1194
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,330
Whose is that?

1195
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,190
- Se Chan.
- Let's say it's yours.

1196
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,270
Haha is listening. Jae Suk.

1197
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,600
I'll betray them.

1198
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,020
- We found a lot of yours.
- Hey.

1199
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,060
How many did you find?

1200
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,850
Give it to me,
and I'll let you know.

1201
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,930
If you tell us where
Suk Jin's are...

1202
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,750
or where Ji Hyo's are...

1203
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,660
We'll find them and give you five.

1204
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,870
The ones with my name on it?

1205
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,290
How many of mine did you find?

1206
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,140
- You don't have many left.
- Almost all of them are yours.

1207
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,040
- How many did you find?
- We found eight of them.

1208
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,500
Really? How?

1209
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,200
Even if your team wins,
you'll get the penalty.

1210
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,850
You will definitely get it.

1211
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,580
(These 3 blackmailers
con their family.)

1212
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,450
You won't come in first.

1213
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,750
Okay.

1214
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:24,980
What if I found Suk Jin and
Ji Hyo's eggs and cracked them?

1215
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,890
- You could do that.
- Okay, then.

1216
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,930
- Don't touch mine from now on.
- Okay.

1217
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,330
You know where mine are, right?

1218
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,160
They're inside the toilet
and behind the tissues.

1219
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,520
- I told you where they are.
- Okay.

1220
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,430
And behind the tissues.
I told you where they are.

1221
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,890
- Okay.
- So I will...

1222
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:37,890
get rid of the others'.

1223
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,660
- Right.
- Suk Jin's eggs...

1224
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,970
- and Ji Hyo's eggs.
- And Ji Hyo's.

1225
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,080
(Se Chan gets fooled
and decides to betray his team.)

1226
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:47,200
(He returns to his family's side
with evil intentions.)

1227
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,080
Se Chan, welcome back.
What took you so long?

1228
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,810
Come here and make
the tricolored skewers.

1229
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,350
- Okay.
- Come and put on a pair of gloves.

1230
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,290
- What else is there?
- It smells like the holidays.

1231
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,750
It really does.

1232
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,520
Pass it over after you put
flour on it.

1233
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,890
(The beef jeon is almost finished.)

1234
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,660
- This is incredible.
- I need some more.

1235
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,660
- What do you need more of?
- Gosh, it's hot.

1236
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,100
- Parchment paper.
- This one?

1237
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:10,330
Gosh, it feels like we're a family
since we're doing this together.

1238
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,660
It would be a lot of fun
if we were a family, right?

1239
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,480
- If we were a family?
- It would be so much fun.

1240
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,640
- It would be fun, right?
- It would be.

1241
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,910
If we were a family...

1242
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,700
We would gather together
like this.

1243
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,680
It would be nice if Se Chan
became a part of my family.

1244
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,810
Is there a possibility?

1245
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,540
- Of course there is. My nieces.
- Can you pour in more oil?

1246
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,850
- Oh, your nieces.
- Right.

1247
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,060
- Guys, I have...
- Done!

1248
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,580
- I have something to confess.
- What is it?

1249
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,790
(I have something to confess.)

1250
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,980
What is it?

1251
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,700
- A deal came in from downstairs.
- What kind?

1252
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,000
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

1253
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,890
- It came in, but I'm telling you.
- Is that why you came back so late?

1254
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,970
He must have felt guilty because
we were so harmonious...

1255
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,000
- like a family.
- Right.

1256
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,660
- For a moment,
- Aren't I right?

1257
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,600
since it smells like the holidays
and everything, I had to tell you.

1258
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,640
What kind of deal was it?

1259
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,230
- When I was downstairs,
- It's done.

1260
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,810
they said they already found
all of mine.

1261
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,750
- If we win everything,
- Yes?

1262
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,080
we won't get the penalty, right?

1263
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,980
- The person in last place gets it.
- Last place in our team.

1264
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,250
The person in last place
in our team gets it?

1265
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,680
I'll come in last place then.

1266
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,790
I'll come in last place...

1267
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,060
No, that's not right.

1268
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,660
- That's too much.
- I'll come in last place...

1269
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,350
because I have
a penalty transfer card.

1270
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,830
- That's too much.
- I'll come in last place...

1271
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,890
(Jong Kook has
a penalty transfer card?)

1272
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,700
(3 months ago, on July 12)

1273
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,470
(During the 10th anniversary
special live broadcast)

1274
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,730
(Jong Kook got a penalty transfer
card using his analyst skills.)

1275
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,230
I won't use it today.
I'll just get the penalty.

1276
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,680
(He saved
his penalty transfer card.)

1277
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,640
(It just so happens he only has
2 weeks left to use it.)

1278
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,120
- I have to use it soon.
- That's right.

1279
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,180
- You have one.
- Kwang Soo was so cheeky earlier,

1280
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,350
- That's right.
- so I've already decided on him.

1281
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,720
Are you going to use it today?

1282
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,980
What should I do?

1283
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,160
- Let's just do what we need to do.
- I'll do whatever you say.

1284
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,560
I'll even pretend to die
if you tell me to.

1285
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,890
I can take care of the penalty,
so let's be sure to win as a team.

1286
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,330
- Is this my apron?
- Dad.

1287
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,330
- He's our dad.
- Dad.

1288
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:49,000
I should feed my dad.

1289
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,430
- Se Chan.
- We need to put some more jeon on.

1290
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,540
Isn't it good?

1291
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,970
(They finished 10 more beef jeons.)

1292
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:56,770
(They place it on the ancestral rite
table before Team Jae Suk.)

1293
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,810
(Unlike Team Jong Kook,
who's making progress,)

1294
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,080
(Team Jae Suk forgot about
their grandfather,)

1295
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,310
(and they're excited
to feed themselves.)

1296
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,120
I should heat up some rice too.

1297
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,910
Let's have some rice too.
I'm hungry.

1298
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,180
(It sounds like something is frying.
Is it beef jeon?)

1299
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,830
(Of course not. It's fried dumplings
for themselves.)

1300
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,620
- It looks good.
- It really does.

1301
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,020
Haha, can you prepare our meal
while we make the beef jeon?

1302
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,040
(The rice just needs to heat up.)

1303
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,870
(Sneaking in)

1304
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,000
(He just steals it.)

1305
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,180
(He blatantly steals the rice
that's ready.)

1306
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,410
Hey!

1307
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,680
- Gosh, that...
- What is it?

1308
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,270
What's wrong with him? Is he crazy?

1309
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,290
What's wrong?

1310
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,980
He just took this.

1311
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,120
(The Yoo family has no morals.)

1312
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,890
(Laughing)

1313
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,020
- Suk Jin. I brought some rice.
- Okay.

1314
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,790
- That's good.
- They were heating it up,

1315
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,290
- so I took it.
- Good job.

1316
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,100
Bring the rice to the table.

1317
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,560
(Take the rice once it's ready
before they take it again.)

1318
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,790
(That's how Team Jae Suk's
lunch got more delayed.)

1319
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,100
He just stole it.

1320
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,200
(Jerry came back down
to the 1st floor.)

1321
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,410
(Tom has no idea
and is focused on the dumplings.)

1322
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,810
(Jerry goes after the ramyeon,)

1323
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,890
(but Tom figured it out.)

1324
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,850
(Tom can't hide his expression.
He is genuinely angry.)

1325
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,750
You guys should eat too.

1326
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,270
What are you doing?

1327
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,430
(Jerry comes near
the ramyeon again.)

1328
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,600
- I was just looking.
- Why...

1329
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,500
(In the meanwhile,
Tom's dumplings are ready.)

1330
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,540
I'll bring over the Spam
after I cook it.

1331
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,700
Oh, my. Hey!

1332
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,500
Hey! That...

1333
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,580
I'll bring it over.

1334
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,890
(Hey!)

1335
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,810
That's not right.
You shouldn't take that.

1336
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:48,980
Hey!

1337
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,180
(Laughing)

1338
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,390
Guys! Let's have dumplings!

1339
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,980
- What?
- You did a good job!

1340
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,230
I stole it from them.

1341
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,060
That little thief.

1342
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,390
We can't associate with you guys.

1343
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:00,930
Suk Jin.

1344
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,430
- Dad.
- What is it?

1345
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,600
- What is it?
- Dad.

1346
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,230
- You could've just asked.
- Why did you steal it?

1347
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,700
- Dad.
- I made that for us.

1348
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,040
- Dad, have it.
- This isn't right.

1349
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,640
- This isn't right.
- We only had dumplings.

1350
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,540
- Leave the rest for us.
- Don't do this.

1351
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,020
(Their audacity makes it seem
like they made it.)

1352
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,450
It's not cooked inside.

1353
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,810
(This rotten family!)

1354
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,640
(Team Jae Suk is hurt.)

1355
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,350
We really shouldn't associate
with that family.

1356
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,910
Father, you should have some.

1357
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,230
That family is so vulgar.

1358
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,500
Did they take a lot?

1359
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,890
If I finish making it, they take it.

1360
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,660
They're so uneducated.

1361
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,230
My goodness.
They are a piece of work.

1362
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:39,410
It's all because their father...

1363
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,040
is uneducated.

1364
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:43,810
- All he did was fight.
- Right.

1365
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:45,080
My goodness.

1366
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,680
How many jeons do we have to
place at the table?

1367
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,450
- We have to make...
- A total of 10.

1368
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,370
- We need to make seven then.
- Yes.

1369
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,480
(Since Team Jae Suk has less
people, they were provided with 3.)

1370
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,450
(Meanwhile,
Kwang Soo heads to the kitchen.)

1371
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,620
(He charges at Ji Hyo.)

1372
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,790
Okay. I'll give them to you.
Just don't crack them.

1373
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:01,930
- Your eggs?
- I'll give them to you.

1374
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,120
I'll give them to you
after I cook this.

1375
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,120
- I promise.
- Really?

1376
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,270
I'm going to crack them if you don't
give them to me in five seconds.

1377
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,200
- Okay. I'll give them to you.
- Five.

1378
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,330
- I'll give them to you.
- Four.

1379
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,470
- I'll give them to you.
- Whose is it?

1380
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:10,660
- Whose is it?
- No more.

1381
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,770
Whose is it?

1382
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,870
- Whose did you give him?
- It's mine.

1383
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,600
He was trying to crack them,
so I just gave them to him.

1384
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,730
(How dare you take
my sister-in-law's eggs?)

1385
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,450
- Haha.
- Where is our mother?

1386
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,600
(The newlywed rushes in.)

1387
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,220
- Hey.
- Don't.

1388
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,620
- We're going to crack it.
- We're going to crack it.

1389
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,350
I stole the ones in Ji Hyo's bag.

1390
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:26,450
It's better to just crack them.

1391
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,790
It's better to crack them
than to put them in there.

1392
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,020
- We have to put it in.
- Crack it in here.

1393
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,060
(The Tiger Moth newlywed is ready
to end things.)

1394
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,720
Okay. Here.

1395
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,680
- Wait.
- Gosh.

1396
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,850
My goodness.

1397
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,230
(They gave them the eggs...)

1398
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,600
(and took the ramyeon.)

1399
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,660
(Even the daughters-in-law
have a nasty habit of stealing.)

1400
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,970
- So Min, hurry up and go upstairs.
- Okay.

1401
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,200
Seven.

1402
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,310
(After much difficulty,
Team Jae Suk places the beef jeon.)

1403
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,560
Goodness, Grandfather.

1404
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,970
Enjoy this.

1405
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,730
(He acts filial as he places
the precious 10 beef jeons.)

1406
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,310
Done.

1407
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,310
(Team Jae Suk also finishes
the first dish, beef jeon.)

1408
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,350
Goodness.

1409
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,410
We need about three more eggs.

1410
00:47:58,810 --> 00:47:59,950
- I put mine...
- Yes?

1411
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,390
(Jong Kook says he'll give his eggs
to use as he has the transfer card.)

1412
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,950
You know the thing above
the trampoline?

1413
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:03,950
(He hid his eggs in a place
they would never find.)

1414
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,620
- If you go there...
- That's a good hiding spot.

1415
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,620
If you stick your hand
in the rain gutter...

1416
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,020
and move it,
you'll feel it in there.

1417
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,100
(They get 3 eggs thanks to
Jong Kook's sacrifice.)

1418
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,290
He was telling the truth.

1419
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,930
- Let's win no matter what.
- The transfer card...

1420
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,370
The transfer card is amazing.

1421
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,660
(They divided the labor to complete
10 tricolored skewers.)

1422
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,270
Our family is peaceful.

1423
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,700
(They divided the labor to complete
10 tricolored skewers.)

1424
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,310
- Should I place them?
- Yes.

1425
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,770
- Can I place it like this?
- They just placed it.

1426
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,980
Gosh. They are slow.

1427
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:29,770
They are like that.

1428
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,890
Let's move on to the next mission.

1429
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,410
Yutnori is a must.

1430
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,450
But the board...

1431
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,850
The master of yutnori will show you
how it's done.

1432
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,700
Excuse me, Suk Jin.

1433
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,330
Yes? What is it?

1434
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:47,120
If you think about it,
we have seniority over you.

1435
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,640
- Seriously.
- Seniority doesn't matter...

1436
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,700
between cousins.

1437
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,770
Suk Jin.

1438
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,700
He keeps getting scolded
by Jae Suk...

1439
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,310
and Jong Kook.

1440
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,100
- Dad...
- Suk Jin can't lean on anyone.

1441
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,680
- Uncle Jae Suk.
- He got criticized all day long.

1442
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,870
Please say something to Dad.
He called me a brat.

1443
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:04,810
- He has no one to lean on.
- All day long.

1444
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,950
Suk Jin, bring me a cup of water.

1445
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,980
- Dad.
- Suk Jin, bring me a cup of water.

1446
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,450
Do you know what makes it sadder?
Even his wife is staying quiet.

1447
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,250
Even his wife is staying quiet.

1448
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:16,620
Throw it.

1449
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,060
(He gets an ointment
for mosquito bites.)

1450
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,290
He went to the mountain earlier.

1451
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,660
He channeled Hong Gil Dong.

1452
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,560
Why did you do that?
Why did you go...

1453
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,470
- to the mountain?
- You know,

1454
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,700
when I jumped over the wall,
I heard the beats of the wings.

1455
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,980
He exerted his force
even though the wall was very low.

1456
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,850
He gave up quickly
when he got a mosquito bite.

1457
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:36,350
For goodness' sake.

1458
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,250
All right. The last mission is...

1459
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,680
Shall We Play Nukdungbegi?

1460
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,890
Nukdungbegi.

1461
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,080
You will play Jeju Island's yutnori
to honor your grandfather.

1462
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,980
- I see.
- He was from Jeju Island.

1463
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,700
I just learned
that he was from Jeju Island.

1464
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,370
As you can see,
the board is a bit different.

1465
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,540
You can take the shortcut
if you get a mo.

1466
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,870
(Shortcut)

1467
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,330
Put the yut-sticks in the bowl...

1468
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,930
and throw them
to the other team's area.

1469
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:02,930
I see.

1470
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,700
It doesn't count if the sticks land
outside or on the line.

1471
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,140
(It doesn't count if the sticks land
outside or on the line.)

1472
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,950
- This is hard. This is hard.
- This is hard.

1473
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:11,310
Many throws will be invalid.

1474
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,310
This is hard.

1475
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,480
We miss the shortcut
unless we get a mo.

1476
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,120
Getting a mo is the best.

1477
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,890
Or you can get a gae after a geol
or a geol after a gae.

1478
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,350
How dare you point your finger
at your uncle?

1479
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,730
- You punk!
- I was pointing at the board.

1480
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,750
Jae Suk, you are stretching it.

1481
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,270
I am not stretching it.
He crossed the line.

1482
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:30,470
Shall we make a fighting ring?

1483
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:31,470
For goodness' sake.

1484
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:32,810
It's natural for brothers to fight.

1485
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:35,000
- Shall we make a fighting ring?
- It's perfectly natural.

1486
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,480
Please calm down.

1487
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,770
Be quiet, you punk.

1488
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,600
Why is Suk Jin so mature?

1489
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,100
Uncle Jae Suk,
you are being unreasonable.

1490
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,540
How dare you talk back to me?

1491
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,770
You are wearing an outfit
in the color of sweet potatoes.

1492
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,450
Do you want your eyes to take on
the color of sweet potatoes?

1493
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,720
I have had enough.

1494
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,350
You haven't visited my house once!

1495
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:54,060
I will take you down with taekkyeon.

1496
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,790
(Do you want to get a taste
of taekkyeon?)

1497
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,060
- I learned it too!
- I will take you down.

1498
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,730
I learned it too!

1499
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,870
- Jae Suk.
- What is it?

1500
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,970
- Sit down.
- My goodness.

1501
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,930
- I wanted to sit down.
- Sit down.

1502
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,200
I wanted to sit down.

1503
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,370
- Uncle Jae Suk.
- Don't be like that.

1504
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,700
Ji Hyo, have you been in prison
or something?

1505
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,480
What is up with that hair?

1506
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,980
Leave her alone. It's her style.

1507
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,980
Prison?

1508
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,890
- I like that style.
- Don't talk to Ji Hyo that way.

1509
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,140
How could you ask her
if she has been in prison?

1510
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,890
Watch your behaviors.

1511
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,680
The Yoo family is a big mess.

1512
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,160
Right? The Yoo family is a big mess.

1513
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,120
How could he be like that
on a good day?

1514
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,750
All right. Let's play this game.

1515
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,270
You win if all three pieces
go past the finish line.

1516
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:33,970
- It won't be hard.
- okay.

1517
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:36,200
Father, let your daughter-in-law
go first.

1518
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,600
That's a good idea.

1519
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,330
- You can go first.
- Hold on.

1520
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,970
Since when did we have
someone so cheesy in the family?

1521
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:43,200
I cringed.

1522
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,430
She is so cheesy.

1523
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:46,140
- So Min.
- Seriously.

1524
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,700
- Sit behind the line.
- Okay, Father.

1525
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,950
- There you go.
- Why is she so cheesy?

1526
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,040
There you go. Good job.

1527
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,350
Who wears socks like them?

1528
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:56,290
- What an eyesore.
- Who wears socks like them?

1529
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,120
So Min, are you feeling better?
Will you be able to play the game?

1530
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,660
I had too much jeon earlier.

1531
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,790
- Is that so?
- Besides, Pouty Mouth likes jeon.

1532
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,870
- I see.
- Stop it. Stop it!

1533
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,620
- She is ridiculous.
- She is cheesy.

1534
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,640
(She makes everyone cringe.)

1535
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,660
Sweetheart.

1536
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,230
My goodness.

1537
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,830
(She is graceful.)

1538
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,040
- She is graceful.
- There you go.

1539
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,950
- Good job.
- Geol.

1540
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,250
- Geol is a good one.
- Dad, you like geol.

1541
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,250
Geol is a good one.

1542
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,250
Do I like geol?

1543
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,750
- Geol.
- It's a geol, Dad.

1544
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,250
It sounded like "You like girls."

1545
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,720
It's a geol, Dad.

1546
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,750
If we get a geol,
we will catch their piece.

1547
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,160
- Let's catch it.
- Then we will get another turn.

1548
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,160
Come on.

1549
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,560
Gosh.

1550
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,680
- Yut.
- There you go.

1551
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,890
Your knees need to touch the floor.

1552
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,750
- That's right.
- You need to sit down properly.

1553
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,830
- Gosh, I didn't know.
- Haha.

1554
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:42,470
- What are you playing at?
- Why are the rules so strict?

1555
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,140
Why should we
talk to Suk Jin politely...

1556
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,560
- when we have seniority?
- What are you talking about?

1557
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,830
- Seniority doesn't exist.
- Are you challenging me?

1558
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,100
My goodness.

1559
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,540
(Take this taekkyeon attack.)

1560
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:53,700
What is he doing?

1561
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,350
He looks like a grandpa.

1562
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,410
- Good job.
- You little brat.

1563
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:59,120
I will take you down with taekkyeon.

1564
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,750
- "Taekkyeon".
- Dad.

1565
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,250
Do we need to suffer this outrage?
We outnumber them.

1566
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,620
All right.

1567
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,350
Haha.

1568
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,850
Okay!

1569
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,000
- It fell outside.
- There we go.

1570
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,770
It was a good opportunity.

1571
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,730
You were too greedy.

1572
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,930
- Ji Hyo, go next.
- You look a bit tired.

1573
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:19,200
I am okay.

1574
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,410
You should go inside and rest.

1575
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:22,730
- No, no.
- Ms. Prison.

1576
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,040
- No.
- Ms. Prison!

1577
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,580
- I am okay.
- Ms. Prison.

1578
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,350
I can throw the sticks like this,
right?

1579
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:28,850
That's right.

1580
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,680
- Throw them lightly.
- Hey!

1581
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,540
Okay, okay.

1582
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,310
- This isn't easy.
- She failed.

1583
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,290
- Good job.
- Let's go, let's go.

1584
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,750
Hey, Beanpole.

1585
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:40,250
How could you say that to your son?

1586
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,060
Is he Japanese?

1587
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,600
Are you a Japanese intruder or what?

1588
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,430
What? How could you say that?

1589
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,000
For goodness' sake.

1590
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,560
How could you say that
during Chuseok?

1591
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,140
- Watch your mouth.
- I am sorry.

1592
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,730
- How could you say that?
- I am sorry.

1593
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,600
- Are you learning kendo?
- Stop it.

1594
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,430
Look at his posture.

1595
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,350
Please sit cross-legged.

1596
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,310
Look at your outfit.

1597
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,450
How could you pick...

1598
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:04,720
- that kind of an outfit?
- It's hanbok.

1599
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,640
- No way.
- It's modernized hanbok.

1600
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,560
He looks like
one of the Ninja Turtles.

1601
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,160
(He clears up a misunderstanding
and throws the sticks.)

1602
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,520
- My goodness.
- His arms are too long.

1603
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,560
What is this?
Are his arms that long?

1604
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,430
Perhaps the mat is too short.

1605
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:19,520
His arm...

1606
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,700
- What?
- Gae.

1607
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,930
(He did well despite an attack
on his outfit.)

1608
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,870
- Gae.
- Your younger brother will go.

1609
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,560
- My younger brother.
- Se Chan...

1610
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,540
- specializes in beating Beanpole.
- That's right.

1611
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,080
- Hey.
- What is up with that pose?

1612
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,080
Get a gae or...

1613
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,770
- Get a gae. Let's catch them.
- Fail! Fail! Fail! Fail!

1614
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,080
Fail! Fail!

1615
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,040
- That's good. Gae.
- Okay.

1616
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,310
- Gae!
- Dad!

1617
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,580
Catch the piece.

1618
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,220
(We got them.)

1619
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,350
- Dad, I did it.
- Catch the piece.

1620
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,480
(How did this happen?)

1621
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,580
- Let's catch it.
- Then we get another turn.

1622
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,160
You get another turn
if you catch a piece.

1623
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,060
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1624
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,700
- We need a gae or geol.
- That's right.

1625
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,000
- We can get their piece.
- We can get their piece.

1626
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,560
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1627
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,560
(He gets another turn.)

1628
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,500
- Okay.
- Hey!

1629
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
- Get either a gae or geol.
- That's too bad.

1630
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,810
Come on.

1631
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:03,200
Let's go, let's go.

1632
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,500
This round is important.

1633
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,750
Out. It's on the line!

1634
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,850
- It isn't on the line!
- It isn't on the line!

1635
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,700
- This round is important.
- Out. It's on the line!

1636
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,040
(Is it on the line?)

1637
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,770
- It's on the line!
- It isn't on the line!

1638
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,890
- It isn't on the line!
- It's on the line!

1639
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,410
- Safe, safe.
- The stick...

1640
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:16,890
- isn't on the line.
- Okay!

1641
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,220
- Is it a yut?
- It's a yut.

1642
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,790
- It's a yut.
- That's a bit tricky.

1643
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,950
- It's a geol!
- Hey.

1644
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:26,560
It's a yut!

1645
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,970
- Look at it.
- It's a yut!

1646
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:30,930
- It's a yut!
- A geol... Is it a yut?

1647
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,330
My goodness.

1648
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,500
(A geol... Is it a yut?)

1649
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,640
"A geol... Is it a yut?"

1650
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,540
I told you to keep quiet, you punk.

1651
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,680
- A geol.
- It's a yut.

1652
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:40,770
- It's a yut.
- Why...

1653
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,520
Why did you have to be so vocal?

1654
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,410
- It would be great to get a gae.
- Geol.

1655
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,250
Let's run away. Go.

1656
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,250
I believe in you.

1657
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,720
Let's go.

1658
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,910
- Here comes Kim Jang Hoon.
- Don't shake the sticks.

1659
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:54,120
Isn't he Kim Jang Hoon?

1660
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,750
I think he is Kim Jang Hoon.

1661
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:57,600
Isn't he Kim Jang Hoon?

1662
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,000
(My dear)

1663
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,730
(Stifling his laughter)

1664
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,000
Don't mind him.

1665
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,770
(My dear)

1666
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:08,100
(He attacks Kwang Soo
by singing like Kim Jang Hoon.)

1667
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,430
Do I really look like him?
I don't, right?

1668
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,750
(His attention wavers.)

1669
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,270
- I like Jang Hoon, but...
- You don't look like him.

1670
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,980
- You don't look like him.
- I don't have his hairstyle.

1671
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,850
From here,

1672
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,910
- you look like him.
- Listen.

1673
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,980
- I like Jang Hoon,
- Families can joke about this.

1674
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,060
- but I don't look like him.
- That's what holidays are about.

1675
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,750
- Seriously.
- You don't look like him.

1676
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,750
- Kim Jang Hoon.
- Why did you suddenly bring him up?

1677
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,330
- I will go. I will go.
- Dad.

1678
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:34,560
(Jae Suk decides to go
since his son is shaken up.)

1679
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,370
Do! Do! Do! Do!

1680
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:39,560
- Gae, geol, or yut.
- Do! Do! Do! Do!

1681
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,930
Do! Out!

1682
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,930
(This is driving me crazy.)

1683
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:46,410
- Yes!
- "Ik"! "Ek"!

1684
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,950
(They make fun of him
with some taekkyeon moves.)

1685
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,270
- "Ik"!
- Good job.

1686
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,810
You brats!

1687
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,080
- Good job.
- "Ik"!

1688
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,080
- Okay.
- This is driving me crazy.

1689
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,160
It's out.

1690
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,980
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1691
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,430
- Let's go.
- Let's catch their piece.

1692
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,750
- Let's go.
- Fail! Fail!

1693
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,750
(Jong Kook does well.)

1694
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,560
- Gae! Geol! That's good.
- It's a geol.

1695
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,700
(Team Jong Kook advances.)

1696
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,000
Let's go, Kwang Soo.
Let's go, Kwang Soo!

1697
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,140
- Yut, yut.
- Anything would be nice.

1698
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,410
- Gae would be nice too.
- Han Gi Beom will aim...

1699
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,980
- for a three-pointer.
- Why is his hand shaking?

1700
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,100
(Another doppelganger attack)

1701
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,310
Shouldn't you stop him
from calling me Han Gi Beom?

1702
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,600
You do look like him.

1703
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,120
I need to put my everything
to this throw.

1704
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,080
- He really looks like him.
- Come on.

1705
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,680
He is starting to resemble
Kim Yeon Koung.

1706
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,520
That's right.
He is starting to resemble her.

1707
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,680
How did he become so ugly?

1708
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,330
- Is his hand shaking?
- How did he become so ugly?

1709
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:35,850
- That's good.
- Gae!

1710
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,330
- We caught their piece.
- Let's go, let's go.

1711
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,850
- One more turn.
- Okay.

1712
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,890
- One more turn.
- Hold on.

1713
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:43,470
(Throwing)

1714
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,640
- Why did you throw it?
- He threw it.

1715
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,200
- I guess it didn't stick.
- What?

1716
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,730
- For goodness' sake.
- He threw it.

1717
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:51,200
That was... Okay.

1718
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,680
- Go.
- Getting a gae...

1719
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,480
- would be nice.
- Then you should run away.

1720
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,700
Go.

1721
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,850
- It's on the line!
- No!

1722
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,250
- No!
- It's on the line.

1723
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,680
- It's on the line.
- Okay!

1724
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,080
You failed.

1725
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,750
It's out, okay?

1726
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,850
(It's out, okay?)

1727
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,950
- You little...
- Dad.

1728
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,450
Shall we stop playing?

1729
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:10,160
- This won't do.
- Shall we stop playing?

1730
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,250
- Shall we?
- Go ahead!

1731
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,730
- Go ahead!
- Don't be like that.

1732
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,870
- Come on.
- Are you holding a weapon?

1733
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:15,930
Head!

1734
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,290
- Head!
- Look at you.

1735
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,100
- I could beat you up.
- "Ik"!

1736
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:22,770
- For goodness' sake.
- Come on.

1737
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,540
(The martial artists' showdown
ends without a single touch.)

1738
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,640
- Okay!
- What is it?

1739
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,640
- Geol.
- Geol.

1740
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,200
- Catch it.
- Catch it.

1741
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,040
- Let's go!
- Catch it.

1742
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,410
- Okay!
- Catch it.

1743
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,410
(He throws the piece as revenge.)

1744
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:34,980
Throw it.

1745
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,080
- Did you throw it?
- What?

1746
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,850
- Did you throw it?
- No, no.

1747
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,480
I just put it down.

1748
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,060
- Okay.
- Would a gae be nice?

1749
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,100
- Just throw the sticks.
- Gae!

1750
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,430
My gosh. Gae.

1751
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,930
(Please.)

1752
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,120
My gosh. Gae.

1753
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,910
- It's a gae!
- It's a gae!

1754
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,370
- Gae!
- Gae!

1755
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:55,930
(They reach the shortcut.)

1756
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,810
- We are fast.
- This is good.

1757
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,950
- Dad, show us.
- We are good at this.

1758
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:03,770
- Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

1759
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:05,910
(I will show you the power of Dad.)

1760
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,020
It's out.

1761
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,410
- He is really bad at this.
- For goodness' sake.

1762
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,930
- He couldn't throw them right once.
- He is really bad at this.

1763
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:15,660
- Why are you so nervous?
- Why can't I get them in there?

1764
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,160
Dad, move.

1765
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:20,660
- I am sorry.
- Dad.

1766
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,560
A do or a geol would be bad.

1767
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,140
Anything is good, right? Okay.

1768
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,270
- What is it? Yut!
- Yut!

1769
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,310
(It's a jackpot.)

1770
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,500
- Ji Hyo.
- Yut.

1771
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,640
Gosh, what is this? Gosh.

1772
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,810
- My goodness.
- Sweetheart is dancing.

1773
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:40,480
- Sweetheart is dancing.
- My goodness.

1774
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,450
- She is good.
- This is what Chuseok is all about.

1775
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,750
- It's a yut!
- That's good.

1776
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,480
- It's a yut!
- She is good.

1777
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,250
- Come on out, yut!
- She is good.

1778
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,870
Sweetheart is good.

1779
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:54,020
Sit down.

1780
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,060
- Okay.
- I feel dizzy.

1781
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,370
So Min must have brought luck
to the family.

1782
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,660
That one hasn't gone yet.

1783
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:03,230
Geol. Geol. A geol would be nice.

1784
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,080
- Gae.
- Gae.

1785
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,310
- Let's get a piece out.
- Let's do that.

1786
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:08,250
- Let's get it out. Let's graduate.
- Okay.

1787
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,640
- Okay.
- Okay.

1788
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:10,980
- Let's get it out.
- Let's do that.

1789
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,350
- Get both pieces out.
- Okay.

1790
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,140
- We have 1 piece left.
- We have 1 piece left.

1791
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,980
- It can be anything.
- Okay.

1792
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,020
- Don't throw them high.
- You can get a do.

1793
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:20,680
- You can get a gae.
- He hadn't succeeded once.

1794
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,020
- This is...
- Okay.

1795
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,350
He is too nervous.
His heart is pounding.

1796
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:26,870
- Dad.
- His heart is pounding.

1797
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,390
- Okay!
- My goodness.

1798
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:30,770
Dad!

1799
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:33,060
- My goodness.
- That was hilarious.

1800
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,870
- My goodness.
- This is driving me crazy.

1801
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,540
We keep missing a turn
because of him.

1802
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,450
Why do you get so nervous
about a game?

1803
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:42,040
- It's a game between the families.
- I am sorry.

1804
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,450
- What's so hard about it?
- I am sorry.

1805
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,410
This is driving me crazy.

1806
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,250
- Take them down.
- I will do that.

1807
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,480
They are...

1808
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,520
- Father, good luck.
- Okay.

1809
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,290
- Yut!
- Father, good luck.

1810
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,930
What is she doing?
Isn't she the Magnet Woman?

1811
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:58,350
- Magnet Woman.
- Magnet Woman.

1812
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,830
How did she do that?

1813
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,970
So Min has all sorts of talents.

1814
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:04,100
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1815
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,330
- Do, gae, geol, yut.
- It can be anything.

1816
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:07,310
- Which piece should I catch?
- Yut would be nice.

1817
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:08,470
- Okay.
- Mo!

1818
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:09,730
- It's a mo!
- It's a mo!

1819
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,680
(We did it again.)

1820
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,770
(The passionate techno dance)

1821
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,620
(Jae Suk grits his teeth.)

1822
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:19,350
- It's a mo!
- What is it? What is it?

1823
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,680
What is it? What is it?

1824
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,160
- What is it?
- Can't you read the room?

1825
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,180
Can't you read the room?

1826
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,680
This is fun.

1827
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,330
This is good, So Min.

1828
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,500
- It's a mo.
- This is a crucial moment.

1829
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,160
Here comes a mo.

1830
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,520
Let's catch a piece with a gae!

1831
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,000
Let's take it out with a gae.

1832
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,040
- This is so much fun.
- Let's crush them.

1833
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,540
- I hope they get a do.
- That would be perfect.

1834
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:39,810
Okay.

1835
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:41,470
Okay.

1836
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,180
(It's a yut.)

1837
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:49,250
- Yut!
- Yut!

1838
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,370
- Yut!
- Okay.

1839
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,580
- If we get a geol...
- Then it's game over.

1840
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,180
- Then it's game over.
- Is it game over already?

1841
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,250
Yes. It's game over
if we get a geol.

1842
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,120
- Geol!
- Geol!

1843
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,790
(Did they really get a geol?)

1844
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,430
- It's a gae.
- It's a gae.

1845
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,450
- Gae.
- Gae.

1846
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:03,450
- Is it a gae?
- Shall we catch it?

1847
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:04,660
- Catch their piece.
- Catch it.

1848
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,830
Okay.

1849
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,430
Let's get another yut.

1850
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,390
(He becomes flippant.)

1851
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:10,430
(Slapping)

1852
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,970
(An angry slap)

1853
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,060
(He adds a dropkick.)

1854
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:17,270
He brought that upon himself.

1855
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:20,000
- Dad!
- Dad!

1856
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,680
I was going to suppress myself
since it's a good day.

1857
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,450
- Come here!
- It's a fight!

1858
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:24,580
- Dad!
- You little punk.

1859
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,870
Dad, they are...

1860
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,640
- Hey!
- We are playing yutnori.

1861
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,720
Why would you do the techno dance?

1862
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,810
I could hit your head
with a bamboo sword!

1863
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,060
They are truly angry.

1864
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,750
They are serious.
They are truly angry.

1865
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,200
(Their anger level is at its max.)

1866
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:39,700
How should we finish it?

1867
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,270
- Just go.
- So Min, go.

1868
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,390
- The youngest member.
- The youngest member.

1869
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:44,040
- It's game over if it's a yut.
- Go outside with a yut...

1870
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,040
or have fun with a geol.

1871
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:47,730
Make it entertaining.

1872
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,230
- She is elegant.
- Thank you.

1873
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,480
She is like a forsythia.

1874
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,600
- She is elegant.
- My goodness.

1875
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,680
She is like a forsythia.

1876
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:58,750
(She suddenly stretches out
her leg.)

1877
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,250
- What is that?
- On a national holiday...

1878
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,750
What are you doing
on a national holiday?

1879
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,290
- What are you doing?
- It's her socks. I am sorry.

1880
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,520
- What are you doing?
- She is in "The War of Flowers".

1881
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:11,120
What are you doing?

1882
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,200
She is in "The War of Flowers".

1883
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,160
- I am sorry. I am sorry.
- On a national holiday...

1884
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,970
It's her socks.

1885
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:18,390
She is pulling a prank.

1886
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,060
- It's a diversionary tactic.
- A diversionary tactic.

1887
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:21,270
- That's good.
- Anything is good.

1888
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,680
- Okay.
- It's a geol. We are almost done.

1889
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,950
Do, gae, geol.

1890
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:28,310
- Okay.
- Gosh, good job.

1891
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:31,950
- Mo, mo, yut, gae.
- Mo, mo, yut, gae.

1892
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,640
- Mo, mo, yut, gae.
- Okay.

1893
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,350
Mo, mo, yut, gae.

1894
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:36,410
I will begin.

1895
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:37,450
(He talks big.)

1896
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,350
I will show you
how to turn the tables.

1897
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,350
(I will show you
how to turn the tables.)

1898
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,350
(It's the last chance
to have his revenge.)

1899
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,330
(The yut-stick bomb)

1900
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,810
Do, gae, geol, yut...

1901
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,180
You little...

1902
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,310
Are you kidding me?

1903
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,810
- Are you insane?
- Step on him!

1904
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,180
Hold on.

1905
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:03,750
- Are you kidding me?
- What are you doing?

1906
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,950
- What was that?
- They are con artists!

1907
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,040
How many sticks were there?

1908
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,020
- Dad!
- Let's do it again.

1909
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,180
- What are you doing?
- Let's do it again.

1910
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:14,750
- Let's do it again.
- How many sticks were there?

1911
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,600
For goodness' sake.
Let's do it again.

1912
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,700
Okay.

1913
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,200
That's good. It's a do.

1914
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,370
- Gae.
- Gae.

1915
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:22,870
- Gae.
- Gosh!

1916
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,270
I got a gae
from mo, mo, yut, and gae.

1917
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:28,470
(Team Jae Suk's worst player
talks big.)

1918
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:30,480
Dad. We are almost done.

1919
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,040
- Do we just need a do?
- We just need a do.

1920
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,480
Hold on. Should I make it fun?
What should I do?

1921
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,180
- Shall we fail on purpose?
- What?

1922
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,680
- Shall we fail on purpose?
- Shall I use my left hand?

1923
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,980
- Okay. Left hand.
- Left hand.

1924
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,390
- That's a good idea.
- Use your left hand here.

1925
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:43,120
- Shall I use my left hand?
- Gosh, throw with your eyes closed.

1926
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:47,020
Throw with your eyes closed.

1927
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:48,850
- Throw with your eyes closed.
- Shall I do that?

1928
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:50,450
- Yes.
- Okay, okay. I will do it...

1929
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:51,700
- with my eyes closed.
- Like Michael Jordan.

1930
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:52,970
I will do it with my eyes closed.

1931
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,700
Okay. My eyes are closed.

1932
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:55,700
He might get a do.

1933
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:58,370
(Team Jong Kook will win
if they get even a do.)

1934
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:00,640
(Please let him fail.)

1935
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,200
- That's incredible.
- It's over.

1936
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,640
- It's over.
- Okay.

1937
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,810
- Yes!
- Let's go!

1938
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:10,180
This is Chuseok!

1939
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:12,250
It ended in a fun way.

1940
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,790
Have a happy Chuseok!

1941
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,390
Bring three eggs.

1942
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:19,020
We are on another level.

1943
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,830
We win no matter what we do.

1944
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,660
We handed out three eggs.
Now comes the last recipe.

1945
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,390
(What's the last recipe?)

1946
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,470
Korean meatballs.

1947
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:30,160
Make the dish by 3 p.m.
The team that finishes it 1st wins.

1948
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,200
- Okay.
- 3 p.m.

1949
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,970
- It requires 10 eggs.
- 10 eggs?

1950
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,000
We need 10 eggs this time.

1951
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,830
(We need 10 eggs?)

1952
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,770
(There will be
a fierce competition for eggs.)

1953
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,770
- Let's move on to the final race.
- Okay.

1954
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:45,040
(Let's move on to the final race!)

1955
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,480
Please gather around.

1956
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:50,390
The current time is 2:22 p.m.

1957
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:52,120
- The race ends at 3 p.m.
- Okay.

1958
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:55,520
The team
that sets the table first wins.

1959
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,160
Once you are done,

1960
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,000
sound the gong
and get the table checked to win.

1961
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,600
Even if you finish the second,
you need to complete the dish...

1962
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,390
to avoid the all-member penalty.

1963
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,100
Let's begin now.

1964
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,200
- Go.
- Go, go.

1965
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,600
(Team Jong Kook: 4 eggs short,
Team Jae Suk: 7 eggs short)

1966
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,500
Where did Suk Jin put his eggs?

1967
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,350
It's important to have 10 eggs.

1968
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,770
Why don't we
gather ours around and...

1969
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:17,870
How many eggs did you get stolen?
I got four eggs stolen.

1970
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:18,950
I got six eggs stolen.

1971
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,640
- Come on.
- That didn't happen.

1972
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,250
- Yes, it did.
- Don't be like that.

1973
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,560
I got 3 to 4 eggs stolen.

1974
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,980
- Don't be like that.
- The number suddenly changed.

1975
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,330
- It sounds like a lie.
- 3 to 4 eggs.

1976
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:29,620
- 4 eggs. Exactly 4 eggs.
- I got 4 eggs stolen too.

1977
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,330
I will donate three eggs.

1978
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:33,430
Who will cook?

1979
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:34,890
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

1980
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,270
Rock-paper-scissors.

1981
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,200
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1982
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,540
(They can't stand
seeing Kwang Soo win.)

1983
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,640
This won't do.

1984
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:44,330
- Come on.
- Right?

1985
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:46,100
Go and cook.

1986
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:47,810
- Dad.
- That's the way to go.

1987
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:48,910
We need to go and...

1988
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:50,680
Listen to your dad, punk!

1989
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,250
Do you think I will sit there
and cook obediently?

1990
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:57,580
Then what do you want to do?

1991
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,250
- Hey.
- We need to win.

1992
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,480
We need to make
the tricolored skewers, okay?

1993
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,750
Let's play rock-paper-scissors...

1994
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,390
and have the loser make
the tricolored skewers.

1995
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,700
Okay. That will be fair.

1996
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:06,770
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1997
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:07,790
Okay.

1998
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,770
(Dad, please make
the tricolored skewers!)

1999
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:13,810
This is driving me crazy.

2000
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,430
(Kwang Soo runs somewhere
as soon as the race starts.)

2001
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:20,140
(Why is Kwang Soo here?)

2002
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:21,870
- Are these all the eggshells?
- Yes.

2003
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,750
- Aren't there stickers?
- No.

2004
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:25,770
- My stickers.
- Your stickers aren't here.

2005
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:27,140
(Kwang Soo wants to put his stickers
on other eggs.)

2006
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:29,350
Ji Hyo, you...

2007
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:32,250
(Ji Hyo is uninterested.)

2008
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,790
You are like Sin Saimdang.

2009
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:36,500
It's like a different world here.

2010
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:39,060
It's like a documentary.

2011
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,930
(Ji Hyo cooks elegantly
in beautiful hanbok.)

2012
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,930
(She keeps her distance
from the vile Yoo family...)

2013
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,290
(and films a cooking vlog.)

2014
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,600
(The most elegant woman)

2015
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,600
There are no eggs.

2016
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,500
- Where are Suk Jin's eggs?
- I don't see them.

2017
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:55,180
(When Haha heads to the playroom,)

2018
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,620
(So Min follows.)

2019
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,640
Haha.

2020
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:00,620
(She stays near Haha.)

2021
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,750
- What?
- You took my eggs, right?

2022
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,180
- My eggs.
- Of course.

2023
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,480
- Of course.
- Did you take them?

2024
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,520
Yes, I did.

2025
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:10,830
(At that moment)

2026
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:14,620
(So Min suddenly takes
something out.)

2027
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:17,230
- What?
- They are mine! No!

2028
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,140
(She struggles desperately.)

2029
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:21,200
(Cracking)

2030
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,640
(So Min's eggs crack.)

2031
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,230
My eggs!

2032
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:27,950
Yes!

2033
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:29,370
(She tried to get the egg before
Haha found it, but...)

2034
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:30,870
That one's mine.

2035
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:32,410
(She couldn't protect 2 eggs.)

2036
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:33,780
My goodness, Haha.

2037
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,410
(They say a thief is frightened
even by a mouse.)

2038
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:37,910
I thought you would open it.
You were planning to, right?

2039
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,950
- No, it never crossed my mind.
- Stop lying.

2040
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,450
Gosh, it smells nice.

2041
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:43,690
(Jae Suk is making the jeon.)

2042
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,030
(He's finally done with
the tricolored skewers.)

2043
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:48,190
We have to turn the tables
no matter what.

2044
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,230
(Determined)

2045
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:52,070
(He dreams of turning the tables...)

2046
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:54,810
(as he places the tricolored skewers
on the table.)

2047
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,900
(Both families finished making
beef jeon and tricolored skewers.)

2048
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,610
(They need 10 eggs
for Korean meatballs.)

2049
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:01,350
(Team Jong Kook has 6,
Team Jae Suk family has 3.)

2050
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,350
Where are the other three?
Bring them over.

2051
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,440
How can I?

2052
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,480
Stop being greedy.
You still have yours too.

2053
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,490
Mine? Okay.

2054
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:08,990
What if I get caught on my way?

2055
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:09,990
I...

2056
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:12,950
I should bring them. Okay, let's go.

2057
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,730
If things continue this way,
we're going to lose.

2058
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,150
I can't take them out. Gosh.

2059
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,290
(He watches where Jae Suk goes.)

2060
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,690
I think there is something in here.

2061
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,440
- So Min.
- Yes, Haha?

2062
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,610
- I know this.
- What?

2063
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,900
Suk Jin said it was under a gutter.

2064
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,610
I don't know anything besides that.

2065
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:34,980
(Under a gutter?
That's quality information.)

2066
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:37,240
(The moment So Min gave Haha
the information...)

2067
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,980
I know this.

2068
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:40,990
(Kwang Soo was near the audio team's
equipment.)

2069
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:45,190
(He finds out the information
at an incredible timing.)

2070
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:46,860
Suk Jin said it was under a gutter.

2071
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:47,990
(Under the gutter?)

2072
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:49,530
There's an egg over there.

2073
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,690
There's an egg over there.

2074
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:52,900
(He couldn't find Suk Jin's egg
no matter where he looked.)

2075
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,430
Suk Jin's egg is over there.

2076
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:59,070
(Looking under the gutters)

2077
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,470
Are they...

2078
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:02,610
(Suk Jin spots Kwang Soo.)

2079
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:04,370
My egg is over there,
and that's where he's looking.

2080
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,440
(At that moment)

2081
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,440
(Shouting)

2082
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,780
(He hits his shin.)

2083
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,820
(It's a pain that's hard to describe
with words.)

2084
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,220
What's wrong?

2085
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:17,990
- Did you get hurt?
- What's wrong?

2086
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,910
(He's expressing his pain
with ugliness.)

2087
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:21,060
No, I'm fine.

2088
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,890
(At that moment,)

2089
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,730
(Suk Jin sees that Kwang Soo fell.)

2090
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:27,660
(He rushes toward the gutter where
he hid his egg.)

2091
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,990
Why is Suk Jin here?

2092
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:32,440
(Fighting)

2093
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,500
Did you find something?

2094
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,310
It must be here!

2095
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,530
It must be above here.

2096
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,530
It must be above here.

2097
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,570
(Jae Suk tries
to climb up quickly.)

2098
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,810
Hold on.

2099
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,240
- Hold on.
- There must be one here.

2100
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,650
(Peeking)

2101
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:46,890
There's nothing here.

2102
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:48,490
(There's no egg there?)

2103
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,110
It might've fallen.
There should be one there.

2104
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,250
There's nothing there.

2105
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:54,560
- There's nothing there.
- I'm sure there's one here.

2106
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,250
(He peeks using his height.)

2107
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,530
Suk Jin came here when we did.

2108
01:10:58,530 --> 01:10:59,560
(Kwang Soo finds something.)

2109
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:04,530
(He finds 1 egg that Suk Jin hid.)

2110
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,570
(He puts it in his bag
while everyone is looking away.)

2111
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,000
There's nothing here.

2112
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,030
But Suk Jin is keeping an eye
on this area.

2113
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:13,240
But why is Suk Jin...

2114
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,180
Suk Jin is keeping an eye
on this area.

2115
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:16,940
Suk Jin was looking
in this direction,

2116
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:19,320
so I came here and pulled the table
when he ran toward me really fast.

2117
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:22,150
(He puts the table
back in its place.)

2118
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,610
(But there's a sudden
bag inspection.)

2119
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,990
(It's quiet for a second.)

2120
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:31,560
There's an egg in there.
Let's crack it.

2121
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,620
- Jae Suk!
- Let's crack it!

2122
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,320
- Protect me!
- Let's crack it!

2123
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,430
(He asks Jae Suk to protect him.)

2124
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:36,470
I found Suk Jin's egg.

2125
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:38,030
If you keep doing that,
we're going to crack it.

2126
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,100
You found mine?

2127
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,470
- That one is mine?
- Who is yellow?

2128
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,470
- Is it yours?
- This one is Suk Jin's.

2129
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:42,500
Should I crack it?

2130
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:43,810
Yes. It's better to just crack it.

2131
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:45,000
Okay. Crack it.

2132
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,370
Crack it.

2133
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:47,650
- That's better.
- It's better to just crack it.

2134
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:48,870
Give it to us.

2135
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,740
- Crack it.
- No.

2136
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:52,410
- No, we can't.
- Just crack it.

2137
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:53,780
- Should we crack it?
- Stay here.

2138
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:56,020
Stay here
while I look for the others.

2139
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,560
- I haven't been able to get mine.
- Where are they?

2140
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,580
In the back alley.

2141
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,780
Can you hold them off in here?
I'll go and get it.

2142
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,430
Bring three. We need to end this.

2143
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:04,400
- That way, we can win.
- Should I bring all six?

2144
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,690
- We just need three.
- Should I bring them all?

2145
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:07,030
- What if they find it?
- You have six left?

2146
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,160
Okay, then bring them all.

2147
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,320
Hurry up then.

2148
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,330
You get it.

2149
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,490
Where did you put yours, Kwang Soo?

2150
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:13,830
- Okay.
- Where are Kwang Soo's eggs?

2151
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,610
(He's moving.)

2152
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:20,370
(Suk Jin runs quickly to
the back alley.)

2153
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:22,070
- Hey.
- He said it's in his pants.

2154
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,410
- They're in his pocket?
- Is it still there?

2155
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:24,610
Where did you put it?

2156
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:27,610
(Suk Jin filmed his own spy movie
while burying 6 eggs in here.)

2157
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:28,990
We just need three.

2158
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:30,820
(If he can find them, they can make
Korean meatballs right away.)

2159
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,650
(But at that moment)

2160
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,250
- Hey!
- There's something over here.

2161
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,620
(He's blocked right in front
of the eggs!)

2162
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,930
Someone grab him.

2163
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:44,490
(The moment Suk Jin
started moving,)

2164
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,140
(Jae Suk sensed that
something was off.)

2165
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,360
You don't have any yet?

2166
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,440
Hey!

2167
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,200
(He sees Suk Jin coming
and climbs over the window.)

2168
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,200
(He blocks the path.)

2169
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,610
- Hey!
- There's something over here.

2170
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:56,850
- Someone grab him.
- There's something here.

2171
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,180
- There's something over here.
- Hey!

2172
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,320
You should've done this earlier.

2173
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,110
You should've done this earlier!
This was foolish.

2174
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,940
- I told you to hold on to him!
- You could've gone this way,

2175
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,610
- so why did you go that way?
- My gosh.

2176
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:05,820
There's something here!

2177
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,060
(They finally find it.)

2178
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,360
- Hey!
- I found it!

2179
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,450
(He grabs his collar with one hand
and steals with the other.)

2180
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,730
(He removes some of the dirt...)

2181
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:14,860
(and finds the eggs.)

2182
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,660
(The path is so narrow that
they can't move this way or that.)

2183
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:18,900
Someone help me grab him.

2184
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,000
What are you doing?
You should've done this sooner.

2185
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,440
(He digs out 6 eggs.)

2186
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,030
Move. Move out of the way.

2187
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,240
(A short reach)

2188
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,350
It's over.

2189
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:31,370
- Hey.
- Just crack them.

2190
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,870
That punk!

2191
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:34,280
My goodness.

2192
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,780
(If they can create an egg mixture
safely, they can turn the tables.)

2193
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,450
Just give me one.

2194
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,410
Give me one,
so I don't come in last place.

2195
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,390
Let's make a deal.

2196
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,990
Just give me one.

2197
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:44,360
(Please, give me one.)

2198
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,190
I shouldn't come in last place.
I'll get a penalty then.

2199
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,690
Just give me one
so that I don't come in last place.

2200
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:50,830
Ji Hyo.

2201
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:53,290
- Yes?
- We need to get three of yours.

2202
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,610
One.

2203
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:56,740
(They use 3 of Ji Hyo's eggs.)

2204
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,700
2, 3. That's enough, right?

2205
01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:59,870
Let's go.

2206
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:01,480
- Let's go and make them.
- Let's go.

2207
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,310
We just need to make them now.

2208
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,520
Hurry up and bring them.

2209
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,540
(They had 3, and Jae Suk and
Kwang Soo stole 7 of Suk Jin's.)

2210
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,610
I found one too.
It belongs to Se Chan.

2211
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,440
That's four.

2212
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,150
- Let's hurry up and make them.
- Okay.

2213
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,720
Let's hurry up and make them.

2214
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,950
Turn it on.

2215
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,360
Where is the recipe?

2216
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,620
Hurry up. Let's look at the recipe.

2217
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:18,120
Hurry.

2218
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,230
Give me the spatula.

2219
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:20,360
(Team Jae Suk begins to
make the Korean meatballs.)

2220
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,970
Hurry.

2221
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:23,400
We got this.

2222
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,530
Just pour it in.

2223
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:25,530
(Just pour in the egg mixture.)

2224
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:26,600
Just pour it in. It's fine.

2225
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,640
(Pouring in...)

2226
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,830
(the egg mixture)

2227
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,240
You poured too much of it in.

2228
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,850
If you do this, the temperature
of the pan will fall.

2229
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:38,020
Okay. Hold on.

2230
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,720
- Move it over to that side.
- Okay.

2231
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,240
- Why did you pour everything in?
- It's okay.

2232
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,780
You can't do this.

2233
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,220
- Jae Suk. Why did you do that?
- This is driving me crazy.

2234
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,560
- I was in a rush.
- Why do you keep causing trouble?

2235
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,120
You were like that during
yutnori too.

2236
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,360
(Troublemaker)

2237
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,450
It's because I'm in a rush.
I'm sorry.

2238
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,160
Put it in. Hurry.

2239
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,140
(We're in such a hurry.)

2240
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:59,030
We need tongs.
Hurry up and put them on the pan.

2241
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,810
You got all your eggs taken.
Why are you bossing us around?

2242
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:04,070
We have to move quickly
or else we're going to lose.

2243
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:06,140
I'll do it. Don't do it.
It'll fall apart.

2244
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,240
This is fine.

2245
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,810
You have seven minutes left.

2246
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,110
Please.

2247
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:14,220
(Thanks to Jae Suk's mistake,
the winner is a mystery.)

2248
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:15,890
Put it in.

2249
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:17,820
- Suk Jin. No.
- It's fine.

2250
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,780
- We need to hurry.
- He's worried he'll come last.

2251
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,530
Even if it looks like this,
I'm sure it'll taste good.

2252
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:24,620
If we came sooner and made them,
we would've won.

2253
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,150
Hey, Kwang Soo.

2254
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:27,770
It's 2:54 p.m.

2255
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:31,190
(Which family will make the Korean
meatballs and complete the table?)

2256
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,140
(6 minutes before the end,
Kwang Soo appears.)

2257
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,070
(Kwang Soo prepares
to hit the gong.)

2258
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,070
(Jae Suk brings in
the Korean meatballs.)

2259
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,540
Goodness, Grandfather.

2260
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,610
- Grandfather.
- Grandfather.

2261
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:42,680
(Team Jae Suk family finishes
setting the ancestral rite table.)

2262
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,780
Grandfather!

2263
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:51,220
- Grandfather.
- Grandfather.

2264
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,220
(Grandfather is proud.)

2265
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,860
We lost.

2266
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,190
They said it's over.

2267
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,860
(That's too bad. We lost.)

2268
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,990
- Why are you so...
- Some of us can get exempt.

2269
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:01,690
- Okay.
- We need to finish the jeon.

2270
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,290
If we finish before 3 p.m,
we won't all get the penalty?

2271
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:04,740
Yes. We're all done.

2272
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,940
Let's place it.

2273
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:07,830
You have five minutes left.

2274
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,940
Grandfather, I'm sorry we're late.

2275
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:14,040
Suk Jin, move over.

2276
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:16,350
- We're done too.
- Both teams finished,

2277
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:17,870
but Team Jae Suk came first,
so they win.

2278
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,910
(Team Jae Suk finished first,
so they win.)

2279
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:22,020
I'll give you five minutes.
We've prepared boxes for you.

2280
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,110
Bring back your eggs,
and we'll count them.

2281
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:25,490
- You can't steal them now, right?
- No, you can't.

2282
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:26,910
You just need to bring them here.

2283
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:29,030
This was the perfect spot.

2284
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:31,320
I thought they would find this one
really fast.

2285
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,360
(So Min hid her eggs in the dirt.)

2286
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,660
But this was the one that was safe.

2287
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:37,440
I'm so nervous about this.

2288
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,440
(Jae Suk hid all 10 of his eggs
in 1 place.)

2289
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,470
(He opens up the air conditioner,)

2290
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,140
(and all 10 eggs are still there.)

2291
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,350
Thank you.

2292
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:49,610
(He's so crafty.)

2293
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:51,240
Nobody would've thought
to look here.

2294
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,740
(Kwang Soo hid his egg
in the trash can.)

2295
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,520
(What's this?)

2296
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,780
Someone found it?

2297
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,120
(Who on earth found this one?)

2298
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,930
Someone went through
the trashcan?

2299
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:07,570
(Ji Hyo went through the trash
and stole Kwang Soo's egg.)

2300
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,530
Gosh.

2301
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,640
(It's been 10 years,
they all think alike.)

2302
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,240
(They're done looking for
the eggs they hid.)

2303
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,940
Team Jae Suk wins by two minutes.

2304
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,240
- Okay.
- Yes!

2305
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,530
Among the three winners,

2306
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:20,870
the person with the least number
of eggs will get the penalty too.

2307
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,110
This is a bit unfortunate.

2308
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,850
Please reveal how many you have.

2309
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:26,370
- I have 10.
- 10?

2310
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:28,020
- I have 8.
- 8?

2311
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:32,250
(How many eggs does Kwang Soo, who
put on a splendid performance have?)

2312
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,520
- He...
- I have five.

2313
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:36,250
(Kwang Soo came in last,
so he will get the penalty.)

2314
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,450
Did anyone on my team
break any of my eggs?

2315
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,490
- Since it's over.
- No.

2316
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:40,690
Haha, did you break any of mine?

2317
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,030
You did, didn't you?

2318
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,640
Hold on. No, it's not like that.

2319
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,330
(I ought to...)

2320
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,610
I broke the one in the ice cream...

2321
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:50,940
and the one in the plastic bag.

2322
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,500
Goodness, you are...

2323
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,940
What about this team?

2324
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,980
That's six.

2325
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:56,150
I have one.

2326
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:58,070
I had two left.

2327
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:00,150
- 4.
- 4.

2328
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:01,990
Five.

2329
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:05,320
(How many eggs does Ji Hyo
have left?)

2330
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,190
I have six left.

2331
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:10,430
- I had four left.
- Then Song Ji Hyo will get a prize.

2332
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,820
Today's prize is a Chuseok
Korean beef set.

2333
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:15,120
(Today's prize is a Korean beef set
for Chuseok.)

2334
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,430
(It's Korean beef.)

2335
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,640
This is amazing.

2336
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,240
You're on the same team.

2337
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,030
- Thank you, Jae Suk.
- What's gotten into you?

2338
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:25,400
- I'll enjoy Chuseok.
- Dad.

2339
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:28,040
Let me tell you
about today's penalty.

2340
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:30,780
Your grandpa wanted you
to do some chores.

2341
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:33,280
You will make songpyeon
for the production crew.

2342
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,940
Gosh, you guys must be happy.

2343
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,850
The 5 of you will make
100 pieces of songpyeon.

2344
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,250
- 100 pieces?
- Yes.

2345
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,110
- It's meaningful.
- Make 100 pieces before going home.

2346
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:41,780
- Are you feeling happy?
- No.

2347
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:42,890
Don't smile.

2348
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,320
Your uncle is really...

2349
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,790
He's really upset. He's mad.

2350
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:50,120
He's really annoying.
He has all his eggs.

2351
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,440
He has 10 eggs.
Where did you hide them?

2352
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,470
Because of you,

2353
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,570
our team lost.

2354
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:58,780
It's not because of me.
It's because of Suk Jin.

2355
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,540
Why don't you
make songpyeon with us?

2356
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:02,850
I'm not good at making songpyeon.

2357
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:05,150
It's not hard.
You can learn how to make it.

2358
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,040
But the thing is...

2359
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,490
- What?
- I should go. My car is ready.

2360
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:11,490
I'm going to give you
a penalty anyway.

2361
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,390
He will use his penalty
transfer card to you.

2362
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:16,530
(Jong Kook uses
his penalty transfer card.)

2363
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:18,230
Oh, that's right.

2364
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:19,430
(Jong Kook transfers
his penalty to Jae Suk.)

2365
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,770
I'm using it on you.

2366
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:22,230
(Jong Kook transfers
his penalty to Jae Suk.)

2367
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:24,440
- You should stay.
- Gosh, no.

2368
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:26,400
You're being really annoying today.

2369
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,400
- Wait.
- You just gave out your gifts.

2370
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,360
You are being really condescending.

2371
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,330
Jong Yoon, turn off the car!

2372
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:34,310
Go take a nap!

2373
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,500
Make some songpyeon
before you go home.

2374
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:39,150
If I make pretty songpyeon,
I can have a pretty daughter.

2375
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:40,180
Isn't it about dumplings?

2376
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,650
No. They also say that
about songpyeon.

2377
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:43,740
Add a lot of sugar.

2378
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,280
No, it will be too sweet.

2379
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,780
Kwang Soo, this is ridiculous.

2380
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:51,400
- No.
- Kwang Soo.

2381
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,400
This is too much.

2382
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,900
- It's a prize.
- It's a dud.

2383
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,690
- It's enough for one meal.
- This is too much.

2384
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,640
- No, it's not like that.
- What is that?

2385
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:58,990
We all have our own tastes.

2386
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,440
You just want to finish it
quickly and go home.

2387
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,360
- No.
- It looks like a foreign dish.

2388
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,360
There are people
who prefer big ones.

2389
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,180
You should make it look nice.

2390
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,070
There are about two pieces
that don't have stuffing in them.

2391
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:12,370
- Let's steam them.
- Okay. Let's do that.

2392
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:13,370
(Now they need to
steam the songpyeon.)

2393
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:15,110
I can't stop making it.

2394
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,390
- Keep making it then.
- Okay.

2395
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:20,620
They told me to stop making it,
but I just can't stop.

2396
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,490
I want the production crew
to eat more songpyeon.

2397
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,600
You don't even know who they are.

2398
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,990
(You don't even know who they are.)

2399
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,290
You're not wrong about that.

2400
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:31,690
That can be the last serving.

2401
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:33,570
Okay. We just need one more.

2402
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:39,030
All right. The production crew
will steam the rest.

2403
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:40,030
- Okay.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2404
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:41,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2405
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,680
- Happy Chuseok.
- Steam the songpyeon...

2406
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:44,980
and enjoy it.

2407
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:47,150
- Okay.
- All right. Let's go.

2408
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:49,110
Just say something before you leave.

2409
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,350
You can't just leave like that.

2410
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,250
He's like a robot.

2411
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:54,230
- Like a talking machine.
- Good job today.

2412
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:55,780
- Hang on.
- What was that?

2413
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:57,690
- He's so cold-hearted.
- What's with him?

2414
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:00,620
"I want the production crew
to eat more songpyeon."

2415
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,790
When they said it's over,
he went, "Gosh, I should go."

2416
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:04,400
He already took off his microphone.

2417
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,830
- He's like a machine.
- Thank you.

2418
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:09,160
(There are 4 gift boxes
in front of them.)

2419
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:14,180
(The guys are excited
to have a couple race.)

2420
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:17,150
(They are the guests
for today's couple race.)

2421
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,870
(Are they Ji Hyo and So Min?)

2422
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,150
(Two beautiful guests,
Song Ji Hyo and Jeon So Min)

2423
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,580
(They will find
their original intention...)

2424
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,320
(with the videos of their
first time on Running Man.)

2425
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,580
(Jong Kook's serenade in the subway)

2426
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:29,060
(It will make her heart flutter.)

2427
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,150
(You're being ridiculous.)

2428
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:31,190
(So annoying!)

2429
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:33,230
You're so pretty.

2430
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:34,230
(Is it an attack or a compliment?)

2431
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,400
(Throwing up)

2432
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:39,790
(Super cringing)

2433
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:41,310
(It's a mission for the guys
who have changed a lot.)

2434
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:42,470
(Going back to the basics)

2435
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:45,740
(New students of Running Man
High School, So Min and Ji Hyo)

2436
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,570
(To go back to the basics,)

2437
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:50,850
(they should take good care
of the two sisters.)

2438
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:51,850
I love it.

2439
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,040
(Their struggle
to go back to the basics)

2440
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,690
(How would it end up?)

2441
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,610
(Back to the Basics Race,
Precious Sisters)
