1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,200
(To the refreshing blue ocean
of Jeju Island)

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,370
This is my first time here
since shooting Running Man.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,370
This is nice.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,370
Ji Hyo, why did you
get here yesterday, by the way?

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,610
- I just...
- Did you get here yesterday?

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,140
This looks fake. Hello.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,740
- Isn't this computer graphics?
- This is amazing.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,740
Jeju Island!

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,710
It's so nice to be outside.

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,210
Welcome.

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,550
The ocean looks beautiful.

13
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,240
It's been a long time
since we did this last time.

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,810
- It's beautiful.
- This is so nice.

15
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,920
I couldn't go anywhere this year.

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,810
I took an airplane
after a long time.

17
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,920
This feels different.

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,260
It felt strange to fly in a plane.

19
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,750
- I know.
- Because it's been so long.

20
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,770
Look at the stylists. They're
taking pictures of the scenery.

21
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,360
- There's Jong Kook's stylist.
- They're on a vacation.

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,200
They will upload the pictures
on their social media.

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,560
I was excited last night.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,460
You've got some blusher
on your face to look lively.

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,430
- Because I'm in Jeju Island.
- Really?

26
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,540
She woke up at four to go to
a beauty salon this morning.

27
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,740
- Really?
- Yes.

28
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,610
I wanted to look pretty.
I want to look nice.

29
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,540
We've come to Jeju Island
after a really long time.

30
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,110
And we have four actresses
who are perfect for the scenery...

31
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,560
- of Jeju Island.
- My gosh.

32
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,150
- Really?
- Here come the actresses.

33
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,180
Welcome.

34
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,930
- Then...
- They've come a long way.

35
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,230
I decided to come here
because I heard you'd come.

36
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,990
That's not important.
It's just good to be on TV.

37
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,490
There they are.

38
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,930
- That's Choi Yeo Jin.
- I haven't seen Yeo Jin for long.

39
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,990
Yeo Jin.

40
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,230
Hello.

41
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,370
- E Hyun.
- Hello.

42
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,040
There's E Hyun.

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,200
And who else?

44
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,740
Can we go there? I'm nervous.

45
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,280
- It's Ju Bin.
- There's Ju Bin.

46
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,180
And Ji Eun is here too.

47
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,290
Nice to meet you.

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,920
She's from "Be Melodramatic".

49
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,820
(Han Ji Eun played a single
working mom in "Be Melodramatic".)

50
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,650
(She's a rising star who shows her
distinctive acting in many dramas.)

51
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,400
(She played an actress with a unique
personality in "Be Melodramatic".)

52
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,370
(Lee Ju Bin showed her impressive
acting in "Mister Sunshine".)

53
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,200
They've come a long way.

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,640
- I'm glad you're here.
- They've come a long way.

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,980
Let's talk to them one by one then.

56
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,340
We have So E Hyun here.
Your real name is Jo Woo Jung.

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,280
- Right.
- I didn't know.

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,450
- It's a pretty name.
- I like your name.

59
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,480
Why are you using a stage name?

60
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,850
My agency consulted a fortune-teller
and said it would be successful.

61
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,760
- A fortune-teller?
- So E Hyun?

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,130
- You're honest.
- Right.

63
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,200
I had nothing to do with it.

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,550
I like the name, Woo Jung.

65
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,360
I know. It's like Jo Friendship.

66
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,730
Jo Friendship?

67
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,940
(Jo Friendship)

68
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,170
Jo Friendship?

69
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,100
What? Jo Friendship?

70
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,200
- Is it her English name?
- Yes.

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,830
That sounds great.

72
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,540
And we have Choi Yeo Jin here.

73
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,540
It's been a long time.

74
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,850
- It's been years.
- You've met Ji Hyo before.

75
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,350
In "Lovely Horribly".

76
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,190
- Right.
- We met in "Emergency Couple".

77
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,190
I see. "Emergency Couple".

78
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,190
What was Ji Hyo like
when you worked with her?

79
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,320
She's a sleepyhead.

80
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,720
- She was the same.
- It's the same.

81
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,850
She's consistent all the time.

82
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,920
It was surprising that
she could act so well right away.

83
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,260
- That's surprising, right?
- Yes.

84
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,200
We're also surprised by that.

85
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,760
She's good here as well.

86
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,730
She just plays games
as soon as she wakes up.

87
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,410
- And she doesn't get puffy.
- She claps her hands getting up.

88
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,140
I'm serious.

89
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,200
- She's like a machine.
- That's amazing.

90
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,600
All right.
Next, we have Han Ji Eun here.

91
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,610
- Hello.
- When I saw her coming,

92
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,920
I wondered where I knew her from.

93
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,250
- It's "Be Melodramatic".
- She was in "Be Melodramatic".

94
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,820
- Right. It's "Be Melodramatic".
- I love the drama.

95
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,980
She went to the same college
as So Min.

96
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,260
- Really?
- Yes.

97
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,220
- We went to the same school.
- Tell us about So Min.

98
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,190
Ji Eun, what was
So Min like back in school?

99
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,350
So Min?

100
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,390
I don't know much about her.

101
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,020
(I don't know much about her.)

102
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,100
- She was...
- They weren't so close.

103
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,670
I worked really hard in school.
That's strange.

104
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,730
So Min, do you remember
anything about Ji Eun?

105
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,440
- Of course, I do.
- Okay.

106
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,230
But I don't remember it clearly.

107
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,750
Did you two fight or something?

108
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,350
(It's more awkward
when they're not close enough.)

109
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,820
- It's so strange.
- You two had a fight, right?

110
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,640
- So Min, did you fight with her?
- You should make up.

111
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
So Min won't start talking
before she hears anything.

112
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,010
Anyway, it wasn't...

113
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,130
Something wasn't so clean.

114
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,630
You mean your relationship?

115
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,020
- Me?
- I mean, it was clean...

116
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,500
- Ji Eun is upset now. "Me?"
- I mean our feelings...

117
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
- No.
- They might fight.

118
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,640
There wasn't a man involved, but
her friend was involved with a man.

119
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,040
- Me?
- I mean...

120
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,410
- She said, "Me?"
- No.

121
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,830
- "Me?"
- So Min.

122
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,100
You two weren't so close, right?

123
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,950
- It's not like that.
- What's going on?

124
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,950
I'm not saying Ji Eun was
involved with a man.

125
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,980
- Ji Eun is upset.
- Hang on. Let me correct this.

126
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,750
It's not that there was a man
between Ji Eun and me.

127
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,450
- I see.
- I meant Ji Eun's friend.

128
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,820
- I see.
- We have plenty of time today.

129
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,280
You should think about it.

130
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,060
Ji Eun said she had something
to say. Please tell us.

131
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,090
Well...

132
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,360
She's glaring at So Min now.

133
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,390
This is my first time in a variety
show, so I'm not sure...

134
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,300
- how much I should talk.
- Tell us about the whole thing.

135
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,870
- Just be honest.
- Tell us everything about So Min.

136
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,330
- It's okay.
- You remember something about her.

137
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,240
I remember that she was
in the group dating dream team.

138
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,810
The group dating dream team.

139
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,950
- She went on a lot of dates.
- That's right.

140
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,340
- And Ji Eun was there.
- Right.

141
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,840
- I remembered something.
- What?

142
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,210
(I remembered something.)

143
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,550
- I can't say that.
- No. What is it? Tell me first.

144
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,080
(No. What is it? Tell me first.)

145
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,260
What?

146
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,450
- What? She can say anything.
- I remember what she was like.

147
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,650
(So Min starts to recall the past,
and Ji Eun is nervous about it.)

148
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,460
- Tell us what it is.
- I remember it now.

149
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,870
- You're making me nervous.
- Tell us.

150
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,240
I once said that I went on
a lot of group dates back in school.

151
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,940
I tried hard to lighten up the mood,
but the boys asked someone else out.

152
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,830
- Do you remember I said that?
- You did.

153
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,010
It was Han Ji Eun.

154
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,380
It was Han Ji Eun.

155
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,900
(Their past has finally
been revealed.)

156
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,380
It was Han Ji Eun, everyone.

157
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,700
I lightened up the mood...

158
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,320
- and thought things would go well.
- You had a good chance.

159
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,550
I just remembered
that I was close to her.

160
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,490
- You know that So Min...
- She lightened up the mood.

161
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,120
- is good with words, right?
- Indeed.

162
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,560
- I led them while playing games.
- We've been there too.

163
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,200
In short, you were in the same
position as Jae Suk's.

164
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,720
- Yes, that's right.
- The female version of Jae Suk.

165
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,820
- She was in my position.
- She was the ice breaker.

166
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,700
You weren't asked out by anyone
because you led everyone.

167
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,160
The atmosphere was so good
that day, Suk Jin.

168
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,590
- Jae Suk was always like you.
- Suk Jin, don't...

169
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,310
Don't act like you know much
about a group blind date.

170
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,830
- We did it when I was younger too.
- I know.

171
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,940
Next up is Lee Ju Bin.

172
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,050
- Hello.
- Welcome.

173
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,340
- I'm so excited to see her here.
- Hello.

174
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,820
I'd like to tell you something
right now.

175
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,580
- She said she wanted to be here,
- What's the reason?

176
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,650
and the person she wanted to
team up with was...

177
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,950
Se Chan.

178
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,890
Why?

179
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,020
- Exactly.
- Ask her. We're in Jeju Island.

180
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,630
- Why?
- Oh, my.

181
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,720
- No one has picked me before.
- Let's ask her.

182
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,700
(His comment made her laugh.)

183
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,930
- Let's hear the reason.
- You have a chance.

184
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,390
- Let's let her explain.
- Why did you pick him?

185
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,800
Let's forget why you wanted to
be on this show.

186
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,140
Why did you pick Se Chan?

187
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,570
I've been a big fan
since he appeared...

188
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,010
- on "People Looking for a Laugh".
- "Woong's Father"?

189
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,240
- Yes, I liked "Woong's Father",
- My goodness.

190
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,750
"The Invisible Man", and "The Best".

191
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,840
Se Chan is even more charming
in person.

192
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,050
- He has such a kind heart.
- But I'm sure...

193
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,710
- I'm counting on you.
- But I'm sure...

194
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,760
- She's counting on me.
- Really?

195
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,760
(She's counting on me.)

196
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,150
Will you go back to Seoul today?

197
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,390
- Yes, I'll leave today.
- Oh, I see.

198
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,590
- What a shame.
- I'm sorry.

199
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,390
- What a shame.
- I'm sorry.

200
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,020
- You see...
- She drew the line.

201
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,500
- People like her...
- Yes.

202
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,870
usually leave hastily
as soon as the shoot ends.

203
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,530
- They just run away.
- We don't even get to say goodbye.

204
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,830
She said she'll leave later today,

205
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,570
but you might see her
on the plane tomorrow.

206
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,530
(My schedule has been changed.)

207
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,570
That would be the worst.

208
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,700
- Se Chan's heart is wide open.
- Yes, my heart is open.

209
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,610
I'm sorry to say this
from the beginning,

210
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,770
but I don't think you have a chance
with her.

211
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,510
- Jae Suk, come on.
- Listen.

212
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,640
- We all must...
- Don't be so negative.

213
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,890
- We must face the reality.
- I understand.

214
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,410
- I agree.
- Yes.

215
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,150
- Gosh, seriously.
- He's right about that.

216
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,280
Let's welcome our four guests.

217
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,800
(Welcome to Jeju Island.)

218
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,320
Today,

219
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,960
- you'll be divided into four teams.
- I see.

220
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,660
Our guests will be the team leaders,
and choose their team members.

221
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,370
We asked the guests to choose...

222
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,030
the best four members
to be on their teams,

223
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,940
- Okay.
- and ranked you by popularity.

224
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,470
A popularity ranking again?

225
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,070
But you won't reveal
who picked who, right?

226
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,070
- It makes us disappointed somehow.
- Yes.

227
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,580
- Exactly.
- We get our hopes up.

228
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,640
Don't take it to heart.

229
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,080
- Also, some of you...
- Yes.

230
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,190
get the wrong idea.
It doesn't mean they like you.

231
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,490
- They just want you on their teams.
- Just as a team member.

232
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,780
- Just as a team member. That's all.
- Exactly.

233
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,800
- But it means a lot to us.
- That's true.

234
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,890
- The person in fourth place.
- Is that the last place?

235
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,160
Let's find out
who's in fourth place.

236
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,520
The fourth place is not bad.

237
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,020
It's Se Chan.

238
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,330
- Is it a good thing?
- Of course.

239
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,810
- He must've been her best choice.
- I guess only Ju Bin picked him.

240
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,830
Only Ju Bin? I don't think so.

241
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,900
- You can say that Se Chan is...
- It's not bad.

242
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,940
- high on the ranking.
- It's good.

243
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,740
- I'm high on the ranking.
- It's not bad at all.

244
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,250
Let's find out who's in third place.

245
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,470
(The person in third place)

246
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,340
- Oh, my. It's Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin? Hang on.

247
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,640
(What?)

248
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,450
- Really?
- It's strange.

249
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,690
- You manipulated the result, right?
- What's going on?

250
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,190
It's because they would feel
comfortable around him.

251
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,820
I can't believe this.
Are you serious?

252
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,780
They know who is
the most popular member among us.

253
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,860
Let's move on to the person
in second place.

254
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,260
- What?
- It's Jong Kook.

255
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,390
My gosh. I didn't expect that.

256
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,630
- What?
- It's Jong Kook.

257
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,760
My gosh. I didn't expect that.

258
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,700
- Jong Kook is in second place?
- I'm surprised.

259
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,800
- Then who's in first place?
- It must be Jae Suk.

260
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,440
That person won
by an overwhelming majority.

261
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,710
I'm sure it's Jae Suk.

262
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,800
(I'm sure it's Jae Suk.)

263
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,510
- By an overwhelming majority?
- What?

264
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,250
(Who won overwhelming support
from the guests and came in first?)

265
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,880
- By an overwhelming majority?
- It's Kwang Soo.

266
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,440
(Kwang Soo seems more surprised
than the others.)

267
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,890
- What?
- It wasn't Jae Suk?

268
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,990
Then what about us?

269
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,620
Jae Suk is not in the top four?

270
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,260
- Then what about us?
- Hey, Jae Suk.

271
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,510
- What could be our rankings?
- Oh, no.

272
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,390
- Kwang Soo is in first place?
- This is ridiculous.

273
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,680
(Kwang Soo is Yeo Jin's 1st,
Ji Eun's 1st,)

274
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,960
(E Hyun's 2nd,
and Ju Bin's 4th choices.)

275
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,100
- Did you mix up the order?
- What's going on?

276
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,550
- Did you mix up the order?
- I think that's the case.

277
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,390
- We didn't mix up the order.
- Isn't he in last place?

278
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,430
- But we...
- I'm already upset from the start.

279
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,470
Kwang Soo is in first place.

280
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,740
Let us vote
for our best choices too!

281
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,760
Check the rest rankings.

282
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,800
- All right.
- Let's leave, Ji Hyo.

283
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,240
I knew this would happen when I
heard female guests would come.

284
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,840
Let's go, Ji Hyo. Let's go.

285
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,510
- Why did you throw sand?
- Hey, get the car ready.

286
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,750
- So Min.
- Why did you throw sand?

287
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,480
You two might be
in 5th and 6th places.

288
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,910
- Seriously.
- Wait and see.

289
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,490
Do you think I went to the beauty
salon to be humiliated like this?

290
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,510
- At 4 a.m.?
- Actually,

291
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,720
I understand why you're upset.

292
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,180
One of our guests is your friend.

293
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,280
- Your friend didn't pick you.
- No, she didn't.

294
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,460
- We went to the same school.
- The person in fifth place.

295
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,830
- I'm in fifth place.
- Gosh.

296
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,260
I'm starting to feel upset.

297
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,470
- Haha sounds like my dad.
- This is so annoying.

298
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,640
- Haha hasn't been called yet.
- He hasn't been called yet.

299
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,790
Let's find out who's in sixth place.

300
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,160
- Haha must be...
- I'm so relieved.

301
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,880
- I almost threw sand.
- Haha is in sixth place.

302
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,980
However, you know...

303
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,400
- I almost threw sand.
- If you'll keep going like this,

304
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,250
- You see,
- invite male guests for us too.

305
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,670
- Why invite only female guests?
- although we have female guests,

306
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,220
I didn't expect Ji Hyo and So Min...

307
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,010
- to be in the bottom two.
- It's not fair.

308
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,280
This is how yin and yang works.

309
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,410
- They must be disappointed.
- I'm disappointed.

310
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,550
- Yeo Jin, I'm disappointed.
- They must be disappointed.

311
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,960
- So Min, you must be in last place.
- 1 of them won by 1 vote.

312
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,150
- Although your friend is here.
- I'm sure I'm in last place.

313
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,420
(She's predicting
she's in last place.)

314
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,630
I must be in last place.

315
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,790
Ji Hyo is in seventh place.

316
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,790
(Song Ji Hyo in seventh place)

317
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,510
(Ji Hyo is Ju Bin's
third best choice.)

318
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,710
My, your friend is so harsh.

319
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,140
You have a good friend, So Min.

320
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,980
You have such a good friend.

321
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,940
Your friend is very honest.

322
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,640
- You hate her that much?
- I mean...

323
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,120
- Her friend...
- "You hate her that much?"

324
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,640
- You hate So Min that much?
- Her friend...

325
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,510
- I'm sorry.
- She absolutely...

326
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,680
I bet you hate her.

327
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,390
- She absolutely...
- I think I should remove my makeup.

328
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,330
I'm going to remove my makeup.

329
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,260
- I'm sorry.
- I can't believe this.

330
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,630
- She hates you. Right.
- This is so disappointing.

331
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,630
I'll tell you how the guests will
choose their team members.

332
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,290
- You see the water bottle, right?
- Yes.

333
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,240
We'll put flags with numbers
from 1 to 4 on them...

334
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,240
around the water bottle
in the order of rankings.

335
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,610
The guests will dance
to the music at the starting line,

336
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,980
and when Jae Suk blows the whistle,
run and pick one of the flags.

337
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,080
- Pick one flag.
- Oh, I see.

338
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,540
People in the top four,
please put your flags in the sand.

339
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,720
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

340
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,860
- We can pick who we want, right?
- The top four.

341
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,650
Yes, you can pick who you want
to be on your team.

342
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,760
(Kwang Soo, 1st, Jong Kook, 2nd,
Suk Jin, 3rd, Se Chan, 4th)

343
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,260
You know, I am sure...

344
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,520
that Yeo Jin will run like crazy.

345
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,690
- No, I won't.
- Really?

346
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,160
Wait. Let me just put this down.

347
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,240
Are you all ready?

348
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,010
- We'll play music for them.
- Okay.

349
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,510
Yeo Jin must be a fast runner.

350
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,300
Run when the whistle is blown
while dancing to the music.

351
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,400
- They'll pass by so quickly, right?
- E Hyun is also good at running.

352
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,980
(The top four are excited.)

353
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,310
(Her long arms and legs reacted
to the excited melody instantly.)

354
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,760
She's dancing on the beach.
All right. Come on.

355
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,590
- She must've prepared for this.
- Yeo Jin.

356
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,780
Yeo Jin, you're so cool.

357
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,630
(Taken aback)

358
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,330
- She hates it.
- We want to see your dance.

359
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,330
- Awesome. She's so cool.
- Oh, my.

360
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,760
- Yeo Jin is still good at dancing.
- That's awesome.

361
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,870
(Her stage presence is
on another level.)

362
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,470
(While only Yeo Jin was
doing her powerful warm-up,)

363
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,140
(the whistle was blown!)

364
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,010
Run!

365
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,270
(Running at full speed)

366
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,540
(She started running
while tying her hair.)

367
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,640
(She's running as fast as she can
among the tall and lean girls.)

368
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,890
(Screaming)

369
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,520
(She fell down
and went out of the frame.)

370
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,650
- Are you okay?
- Hey, Ju Bin.

371
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,020
(What was that?)

372
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,100
Oh, dear.

373
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,870
- Are you okay?
- Hey, Ju Bin.

374
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,500
(Please leave me alone.)

375
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,610
(Meanwhile,
E Hyun picked Jong Kook.)

376
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,400
(Yeo Jin picked Kwang Soo.)

377
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,380
(Ji Eun picked Suk Jin.)

378
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,710
- Wait.
- Ju Bin.

379
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,250
(Ju Bin successfully picked
her best choice Se Chan.)

380
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,770
- Did you see that?
- Oh, yes.

381
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,170
(Please pretend you didn't
see anything.)

382
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,890
- She used the falling technique.
- I've never seen that before.

383
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,460
It's as if she died on the street.

384
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,510
Ju Bin, are you...

385
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,960
- Are you okay?
- I've never seen anyone who fell...

386
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,890
She's not athletic at all.

387
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,050
- Why did that happen?
- I don't know. She fell like this.

388
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,150
(She's not athletic at all.)

389
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,500
Did you all pick the person
you wanted?

390
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,370
- Ji Eun, what about you?
- No.

391
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,560
- Did you pick the one you wanted?
- She's too honest.

392
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,900
(As Ji Eun answered firmly,
Suk Jin is disappointed.)

393
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,110
Did you pick the one you wanted?

394
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,770
- Fortunately, I did.
- Did you?

395
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,140
- Okay.
- You picked the one you wanted?

396
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,670
(She sounded happy to pick me.
I'm so excited.)

397
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,170
- Se Chan...
- You picked the one you wanted?

398
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,880
- Yes, I did.
- E Hyun, what about you?

399
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,010
- I picked the one I wanted.
- Okay.

400
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,390
All right. It's my turn.

401
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,780
I have never seen anyone...

402
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,760
- She fell really hard.
- I've been doing this for 10 years,

403
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,020
- I've never seen anyone like her.
- Exactly.

404
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,590
I've never seen that kind of
reaction before.

405
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,020
It must be a memorable moment
for her.

406
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,330
I have made my decision.
I'll join Ju Bin's team.

407
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,500
(What did you say?)

408
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,840
Ju Bin, please pick me.

409
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,370
- Why?
- You're dead meat.

410
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,430
Go away!

411
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,640
- Pick me, Ju Bin.
- She's going to come between them.

412
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,030
- Don't do that.
- Oh, to come between them?

413
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,080
All right. Are you ready?

414
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,480
(Now, it's time for the race
for the last four.)

415
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,670
- Dance.
- Oh, yes!

416
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,640
(As the dance time began again,)

417
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,810
(the predator of the dance world
started dancing.)

418
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,890
Dance together.

419
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,720
(E Hyun feels uncomfortable.)

420
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,150
(Even Yeo Jin's friend feels
uncomfortable to dance with her.)

421
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,650
- They should dance individually...
- We can't do it that way.

422
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,280
because the others are
intimidated by Yeo Jin.

423
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,550
- I won't dance this time.
- That's okay. You can dance.

424
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,260
- Let's start with E Hyun.
- Each of you will dance alone.

425
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,790
- Play some music.
- Woo Jung as in friendship.

426
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,970
Here goes Woo Jung.

427
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,000
- Here we go!
- That's great.

428
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,160
I haven't danced in a long time.

429
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,560
(She started dancing
the old-fashioned dance move.)

430
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,400
- Really?
- What's that move?

431
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,510
That's an old-fashioned dance move.

432
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,250
Next up is Yeo Jin.

433
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,580
- She's an instructor.
- Yes, she is.

434
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,010
She's a great dancer.

435
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,390
- She's like Poseidon.
- She's amazing.

436
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,460
- She's like Poseidon.
- She's amazing.

437
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,010
- Poseidon?
- She's just like Poseidon.

438
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,730
- She's scary.
- Next up is Ji Eun.

439
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,150
That's an old-fashioned way
of dancing.

440
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,520
(This dance move can make
your blind date a success.)

441
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,630
What's that?

442
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,600
(The whistle was blown
right that moment.)

443
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,740
(She started running while dancing.)

444
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,260
Here we go.

445
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,480
Ju Bin is running fast.

446
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,850
(Ju Bin is leading
the race unexpectedly.)

447
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,080
(She redeemed herself
and picked up a flag.)

448
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,540
(She picked up the flag
of the eighth place?)

449
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,410
(So Min is on Ju Bin's team.)

450
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,280
Yes, she picked me as I asked.

451
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,890
- Finally.
- I'm surprised that Ju Bin...

452
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,630
- She picked So Min.
- picked So Min.

453
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,150
Why did you pick
the worst member to team up with?

454
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,520
She asked me to pick her.

455
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,150
Se Chan. Se Chan.

456
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,690
(Yeo Jin picked Jae Suk.
E Hyun picked Haha.)

457
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,290
(Ji Eun picked Ji Hyo.
Ju Bin picked So Min.)

458
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,510
- Why did you pick So Min?
- Yang Se Chan!

459
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,530
- Yang Se Chan!
- I'm so tired.

460
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,510
- We're in trouble.
- I can't swear at her.

461
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,640
It's over here.

462
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,880
I only trust you.

463
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,720
- Okay, good.
- I only trust you.

464
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,140
I only trust you.

465
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,310
- I'm Ju Bin's avatar today.
- Okay. Let's see it.

466
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,680
We're in trouble if Yeo Jin is...

467
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,990
- the team leader.
- This is it?

468
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,330
- We're in trouble.
- My team is just perfect.

469
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,390
Are you all satisfied
with your team?

470
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

471
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,060
Today is episode one of...

472
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,390
the Jeju Island Special:
Wind, Woman, Rock, and Bomb.

473
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,660
What is that again?

474
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,640
Everyone will choose
one card each in secret.

475
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,740
The team that collects
one card each of the three things...

476
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,080
that represent Jeju Island,
wind, women, and rocks will win.

477
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,380
- We must collect one card each.
- Is that so?

478
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,620
The team that has the bomb card
will receive a penalty.

479
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,490
- We need to remove it.
- After a moment,

480
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,960
you will choose one card each.

481
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,830
There are two cards each
of the wind, a woman, and a rock.

482
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,360
5 cards are blank,
and 1 card is the bomb.

483
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,730
- One card?
- Yes.

484
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,550
Ultimately, a team will win
if they collect...

485
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,890
one card each
of the wind, a woman, and a rock.

486
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,890
If there aren't any teams
who accomplish that,

487
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,560
the team that collects the most
cards regardless what card will win.

488
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,660
We will give you the chance to
exchange cards through missions.

489
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,270
- We'll start drawing cards.
- Okay.

490
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,710
- We can start with this team.
- Let's go.

491
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,980
We have a better chance.

492
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,480
Gosh, Se Chan!

493
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,220
- He's leading.
- Okay, choose one each.

494
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,680
Se Chan is all the rage these days.

495
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,850
Try choosing one each.

496
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,280
Everyone, come this way.

497
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,680
Didn't Se Chan choose the same card?

498
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,810
(Se Chan, Wind)

499
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,860
Keep a straight face.

500
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,360
Okay, wait a minute.

501
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,630
Pretend that it's the bomb.

502
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,650
Okay? You should pretend
that it's the bomb.

503
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,970
(So Min, Woman)

504
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,020
I know.

505
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,190
We don't have the bomb, right?

506
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,100
- I'll start first.
- Se Chan.

507
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,740
(Suk Jin, Rock.
Ji Hyo and Ji Eun, Unrevealed)"

508
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,430
(The other teams also continue
to choose cards.)

509
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,740
- You're okay, right?
- Yes.

510
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,010
(Kwang Soo, Woman.
Jae Suk and Yeo Jin, Unrevealed)

511
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,640
(Haha, Rock.
Jong Kook and E Hyun, Unrevealed)

512
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,120
We'll move to the first mission
location now.

513
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,410
3 people will move at once,
and the spots are divided into 2.

514
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,620
- Really?
- The first keyword is "meat".

515
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,910
The second keyword is "seafood".

516
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,290
- We should go to "seafood".
- It's Jeju Island.

517
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,630
Jeju Island is famous for its
seafood. Meat is also famous, but...

518
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,860
- We'll choose "meat".
- It's obviously famous for meat.

519
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,330
- It's meat.
- It's meat.

520
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,220
- It's meat.
- It's meat unconditionally.

521
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,460
- It's Korean pork.
- If so,

522
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,890
we'll move
to the first mission location.

523
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,070
- Okay.
- Let's go.

524
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,960
- Nice!
- Let's go.

525
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,370
I'll put it in my bag for you.

526
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,500
Honestly, it's likely
that our team won't lose.

527
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,140
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

528
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,110
- I'll tilt my seat back a little.
- Yes, there's a lot of space.

529
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,350
Just tilt it a little!

530
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,520
- You said you would tilt a little!
- Gosh, this is...

531
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,890
You told me to tilt it back!

532
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,480
I just split my legs straight now.

533
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,950
Why is the tallest person
sitting in the back?

534
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,590
Why are you making me uncomfortable
by sitting in the back?

535
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,300
Everything will be over
if we eat perch today.

536
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,330
- Isn't perch expensive?
- They're expensive.

537
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,600
- Okay.
- They're the most expensive fish.

538
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,420
- I don't think that's true.
- I don't think that's true.

539
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,600
I just said one word.

540
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,230
Did the two of you take sides
to bully Kwang Soo again?

541
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,200
Kwang Soo isn't a fool.

542
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,900
Gosh.

543
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,500
I'm telling you one more time.
Kwang Soo isn't a fool.

544
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,440
- There's no need. It's obvious.
- That's right.

545
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,050
Doesn't his face look like
a type of fish?

546
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,350
Yes, he looks like a type of fish.

547
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,440
- You also look like fish.
- Isn't that right?

548
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
You kind of look like a rockfish.

549
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,790
A rockfish?

550
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,240
- We look like fish.
- We look like fish.

551
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,640
- Jae Suk looks like an anchovy.
- Anchovy.

552
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,520
That's perfect.
He looks like an anchovy.

553
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,250
How could you say I look like
an anchovy?

554
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,720
- Kwang Soo is...
- Yeo Jin kind of looks like...

555
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,060
- a halibut.
- A halibut is...

556
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,800
- That's not it.
- Do you want to...

557
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,720
- I'm just asking you.
- You're making a lot of mistakes.

558
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,990
You kind of look like one.

559
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,230
- Say something that looks pretty.
- Se Chan.

560
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,730
You could say mermaids.

561
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,810
- That's right.
- How could you call her a halibut?

562
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,340
Mermaids?

563
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,660
- Poseidon.
- I said, "Poseidon".

564
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,310
- Poseidon is cool at least.
- Yes, Poseidon.

565
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,310
- Poseidon is human.
- There are so many cool things...

566
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,500
- in the sea.
- That's right.

567
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,310
Please don't try to grab
me by the collar, Yeo Jin.

568
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,670
So Min kind of looks like
a kissing gourami.

569
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,740
- A kissing gourami.
- A kissing gourami without a mate.

570
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,240
She's lonely.

571
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,950
- No, I'm a doctor fish.
- Yes.

572
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,120
- A doctor fish?
- I will gnaw everything off.

573
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,950
- She will gnaw everything off.
- A doctor fish suits you.

574
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,190
What suits Ju Bin? Ju Bin is...

575
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,330
What do I look like?

576
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,890
- Nemo.
- Nemo?

577
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,960
- Why am I the only cute one?
- Nemo?

578
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,370
- Is she Nemo?
- Really?

579
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,660
- That's fortunate.
- I thought she looked like a carp.

580
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,900
- A carp?
- A carp?

581
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,070
Nemo suits her well.

582
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,200
- Yes.
- If so...

583
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,730
Say things like that out loud.

584
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,900
- No, it's okay.
- What did you say?

585
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,280
Se Chan just said this shyly.

586
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,170
"Nemo? That suits her well."

587
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,780
- I told him to say that out loud.
- Don't say that out loud.

588
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,820
(She suddenly turns around.)

589
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,410
Hey, Yeo Jin.

590
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,320
- Why are you so angry?
- No...

591
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,250
- Why are you angry?
- You're treating us differently.

592
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,290
- That's not it.
- Yeo Jin, please scold him.

593
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,330
I'm already hot as it is
after coming to Jeju Island.

594
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,690
- Stop that.
- Yeo Jin.

595
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,530
- So Min was just teasing me.
- Today's team atmosphere is...

596
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,630
Your responses for us are like
a hot and cold tub.

597
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,600
It's nice that Yeo Jin is
fighting about everything for us.

598
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,430
I'm not afraid of Jong Kook today.

599
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,660
Okay, I will protect you.

600
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,230
We might beat Jong Kook
with Yeo Jin.

601
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,280
I think she will beat him.

602
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,670
They must be giving us seafood
right next to the sea.

603
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,350
This must be it.
"Jeju's seafood rice"

604
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,020
Is there something called
"seafood rice"?

605
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,440
- It sounds good.
- Let's go.

606
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,550
Let's go.

607
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,620
- Cold raw fish soup.
- Gosh.

608
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,940
- It's really windy.
- Hello.

609
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,910
- We should sit by teams.
- Hello.

610
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,150
General Yeo Jin, sit there.

611
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,180
- You should sit at the end.
- Sit in the middle.

612
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,100
- Will Ju Bin sit there?
- Yes.

613
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,630
Sit there.

614
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,750
Am I the only man today?

615
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,830
- Yes.
- Okay.

616
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,920
(His cheeks are rising
since he's treated as the center.)

617
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,640
I'll tell you the menu that will be
the prize of the first mission.

618
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,040
- What is it?
- First,

619
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,660
there will be all kinds of
fresh raw fish.

620
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,930
(We will start with all kinds of
fresh raw fish.)

621
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,400
- We must eat raw fish.
- Assorted raw fish.

622
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,500
(You can smell the sea
from the assorted raw fish dish.)

623
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,670
Sea urchin roe.

624
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,780
(Savory sea urchin roe)

625
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,850
- It's my favorite.
- I really like sea urchin roe.

626
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,640
- I really like it.
- Grilled abalones.

627
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,780
(Tender grilled abalones)

628
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,940
Grilled tile fish.

629
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,020
(Grilled tile fish that will wind up
in your mouth quickly)

630
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,950
- Sea urchin rice.
- Sea urchin rice?

631
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,210
Cold raw fish soup,
abalone sea urchin seaweed soup,

632
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,650
and top shell kalguksu.

633
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,250
Top shell kalguksu is good.

634
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,390
There is top shell kalguksu.

635
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,800
Do they have
all of those menus here?

636
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,770
- It's my favorite.
- Top shell kalguksu?

637
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,220
I don't know about the others,

638
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,660
but I'm going to eat
top shell kalguksu.

639
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,690
Are you going to give us everything?

640
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,430
- It's the winning team's advantage.
- Will we eat everything?

641
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,270
- The winning...
- Only the winning team can eat?

642
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,270
- Yes.
- Gosh.

643
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,610
- This is too harsh.
- We're going to be in trouble.

644
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,730
- Let's win.
- I want to eat sea urchin roe.

645
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,240
The losing team will receive some,
but there won't be as many as this.

646
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,110
- The first mission is...
- Yes?

647
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,240
important to keep your cool.

648
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,710
It's Is Jenga the Reason
Why My Hands are Shaking?

649
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,450
Representatives of each team
will play Jenga 1 on 1.

650
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,750
You will attach a low-frequency
therapeutic apparatus...

651
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,590
on your wrist and hand.

652
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,560
You will pile Jenga blocks in turn,

653
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,190
and the team that makes it
fall down first will lose.

654
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,270
The team that gets two wins
first will win.

655
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,960
We won't be able to do it because
our hands are shaking.

656
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
My hands are already shaking
without the apparatus.

657
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,140
- That's right.
- Yes.

658
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,340
- I don't like that. I'm afraid.
- What am I going to do?

659
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,140
Okay. The winning team can check
the cards of their opposing team.

660
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
- What?
- We can check the cards.

661
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Next, they can exchange
up to two cards if they want.

662
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,310
- Okay.
- We can also exchange cards.

663
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,350
- Up to two cards?
- Yes.

664
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,520
- Yes, up to 2 cards.
- 2 cards.

665
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,580
Who will be the first representative
of each team?

666
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,350
(Round 1 of Jenga
Kwang Soo versus Ju Bin)

667
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,480
We can't sit down.

668
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,020
- Ju Bin, you must win.
- Okay.

669
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,680
Ju Bin, do you usually
like to drink alcohol?

670
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,590
- Yes.
- Do you like to?

671
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,990
We're in trouble. She's going
to shake her hands a lot then.

672
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,990
What am I going to do?

673
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,130
(She's shaking a lot.)

674
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,690
Look at this!

675
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,770
- What is going on?
- Wait a minute.

676
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,960
This is too harsh.

677
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,000
(His pupils are expanded.)

678
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,270
But this makes you healthy.

679
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,640
- Isn't it right?
- Doesn't it hurt?

680
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,110
- It's therapy.
- It doesn't hurt.

681
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,280
I think this is kind of strange.

682
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,610
It feels refreshing in the end.

683
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,440
You should pile Jenga blocks
like that.

684
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,880
- I'm in trouble.
- Who starts first?

685
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,140
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

686
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,210
- Rock-paper-scissors.
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

687
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,410
You can do it!

688
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,750
- What is that?
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

689
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,920
You can do it!

690
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,560
What is that?

691
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,150
- No...
- That's good.

692
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,190
- Ju Bin, you should start first.
- Should I?

693
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,190
You can do it.

694
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,570
- Wait a minute.
- We have to win.

695
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,770
- It won't last long.
- Wait a minute.

696
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,430
It's over the minute
you make it all down.

697
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,070
Are you going to take
the middle one out, Ju Bin?

698
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,340
- No.
- Take the one in the end out.

699
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,400
- You touched the one in the end.
- What?

700
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,780
- Can't you pick another block?
- It's over if you touch a block.

701
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,970
Take it out.

702
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,310
I think it will be safe.

703
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,440
But...

704
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,080
- But this is...
- No...

705
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,320
- There's a time limit.
- It's over.

706
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,120
- There's a time limit.
- Nice.

707
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,180
Pile it up strangely.

708
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,210
(She succeeds at taking
a block out safely.)

709
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,360
Hey...

710
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,390
- Hey...
- Be careful.

711
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,560
- Is it possible to do this?
- Of course, it's possible.

712
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,150
- It's possible.
- Is it possible?

713
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,560
- It's possible in Jenga.
- Is it possible?

714
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,750
- Is it possible?
- Yes.

715
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,160
Okay.

716
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,720
Kwang Soo!

717
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,770
Kwang Soo, your hand won't shake
if you concentrate.

718
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,230
Kwang Soo, concentrate.

719
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,430
You can do it!

720
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,400
Just take it out, Kwang Soo!

721
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,970
- Kwang Soo, just take it out.
- Oh, my.

722
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,700
- Just take it out.
- Pile it on top.

723
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,280
My hands keep shaking.

724
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,910
You know what will happen
if you drop it, right?

725
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,120
You're really frustrating.

726
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,640
- Kwang Soo.
- Oh, my.

727
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,450
(He succeeded at taking a block
out after many twists and turns.)

728
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,590
Will you pile it like that?

729
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,980
- Will you pile it like that?
- No.

730
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,650
- Kwang Soo...
- Are you going to quit?

731
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,420
Kwang Soo,
look into my eyes clearly.

732
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,600
(Emergency eye contact time)

733
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,990
- She grabbed him by his collar.
- I will pile it properly this time.

734
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,570
Kwang Soo, why can't you do that?

735
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,700
I will pile it properly.

736
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,170
Wait a minute,
what is your left hand doing?

737
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,610
- Gosh.
- Okay.

738
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,640
I will pile it quickly.

739
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,700
(What is your left hand doing?)

740
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,120
(The apparatus is on his right hand.
He's playing with his left hand.)

741
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,910
Wait a minute,
what is your left hand doing?

742
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,910
(He got caught by doing
tricks with his hands.)

743
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,590
- Okay.
- Using your left hand is cheating.

744
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,120
- I'm sorry.
- His left hand is even shaking!

745
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,320
- Hey...
- He's tricking our eyes.

746
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,530
Don't try to fool our eyes.

747
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,720
(The Jenga shark is even acting
out low-frequency now.)

748
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,720
(I can't believe him!)

749
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,330
I fell for it.

750
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,630
You shouldn't trick our eyes.

751
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,270
(He does it this time
without tricking their eyes.)

752
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,370
Go.

753
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,430
(He succeeds.)

754
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,770
- Good.
- Right now...

755
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,340
- Okay.
- Take number 38 out.

756
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,810
- You should take that out.
- We don't have any time left.

757
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,970
- Ju Bin.
- Ju Bin, your hands are shaking.

758
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,200
- That's it!
- Yes!

759
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,470
Ju Bin, piling it on top is
important.

760
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,410
- We don't have any time left.
- Just pile it.

761
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,550
You can do it.

762
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,140
Let's just end it the next round.

763
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,390
Let's just end it here.

764
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,980
- There's no need to shake. Just go.
- Okay.

765
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,630
- That's it. Good job.
- Ju Bin, you can't do that.

766
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,630
Do it gently.

767
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,980
- You can do it.
- You can't do that.

768
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,750
If number 38 falls down,
it will be over.

769
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,030
- It really will be over.
- That's right.

770
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,300
- Ju Bin, that will be the end.
- Concentrate.

771
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,460
- You can do it.
- Ju Bin.

772
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,070
The problem won't be solved
just because you concentrate.

773
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,100
- He just won't stop.
- Concentrate.

774
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,460
It's not all about concentration.

775
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,810
- Don't pay attention to him.
- That's...

776
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,000
- He's so annoying.
- Oh, my.

777
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
- Good job.
- Stay still.

778
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,970
- That's it.
- Okay.

779
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,470
- It's over now.
- It's over.

780
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,550
- Please end it.
- Kwang Soo.

781
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,140
- I want to stop.
- Kwang Soo.

782
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,670
- It's over now.
- Kwang Soo.

783
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,620
But this is dangerous
because this block is...

784
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,180
- supporting everything up.
- You should start from the bottom.

785
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,410
That's right.

786
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,680
Kwang Soo also knows that.
He's not a fool.

787
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,950
Wait a minute, Kwang Soo.

788
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,360
Kwang Soo, I told you to
do it with your right hand.

789
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,390
- Is he doing that again?
- Don't do that!

790
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,420
(His bad hand trick relapsed.)

791
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,030
(So Min didn't even know it.)

792
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,890
Kwang Soo, I told you to
do it with your right hand.

793
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,730
(Is he doing that again?)

794
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,660
- I almost fell for that.
- You should stop it.

795
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,430
- Kwang Soo, your acting is so good.
- Jae Suk.

796
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,470
- Thank you.
- We keep falling for that.

797
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,670
- I had no idea.
- He shook his hand.

798
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,670
I didn't know.

799
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,470
He shook his left hand so well.

800
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,910
- It just seemed right.
- He acts really well.

801
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,090
Kwang Soo, you can do this
if you stay focused.

802
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,180
- You can do it.
- Okay.

803
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,150
Good. You should stop
pulling pranks now.

804
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,150
Kwang Soo has got the hang of it.

805
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,150
It's not easy.

806
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,150
Kwang Soo, if you put it
on there, you'll win.

807
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,990
(She stays close to him
to distract him.)

808
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,800
So Min. Stay still unless you want
Yeo Jin to slap you in the face.

809
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,540
Yeo Jin can slap you.

810
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,730
Look at her. She raised her hand.

811
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,380
Hey!

812
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,900
Don't hold it. If you touch
the block at the bottom,

813
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,700
(Will Kwang Soo be able
to put the block on it?)

814
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,670
- you will lose.
- It's done. Kwang Soo did it.

815
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,820
- Kwang Soo did it.
- Oh no.

816
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,940
(Kwang Soo failed.)

817
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,180
- Oh no.
- Fail.

818
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,850
Okay.

819
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,520
- It's 1 to 0.
- Yes.

820
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,290
- Ju Bin, good job.
- Thank you.

821
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,420
- We have to win this time.
- Let's move on.

822
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,920
If you win the next round,
you will be the winner.

823
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,650
- That's great.
- All right, Yeo Jin.

824
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,990
- Yes.
- You have to win.

825
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,370
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Poseidon.

826
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,270
Get into the sea
after winning this game, okay?

827
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,190
- You can't lose.
- Good luck.

828
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,700
- She's so charismatic.
- Okay. I'll go first.

829
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,430
- Hang on, Yeo Jin.
- Why?

830
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,470
(Hang on, Yeo Jin.)

831
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,310
(Time out)

832
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,670
Why?

833
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,780
What?

834
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,740
- He turned it off, right?
- It's turned off.

835
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,860
(He turned off the device secretly.)

836
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,980
It's not turned on.

837
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,180
- You punk. Come here.
- You know what?

838
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,890
- I can't believe this.
- They were shaking differently.

839
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,560
Don't make it too strong.

840
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,460
As a penalty,
make it one level higher.

841
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,890
- Increase it.
- Gosh, it's too strong. Lower it.

842
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,100
A little more.

843
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,110
This is off.

844
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,200
Jae Suk, it's too strong.
It's just too strong.

845
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,810
- It's too much.
- Okay.

846
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,280
- It's too powerful.
- I'm sorry. Okay.

847
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,110
- Okay.
- Will you be nice then?

848
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,380
I'll be nice. I swear.

849
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,620
- You should be nice.
- I'll be loyal.

850
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,210
- Be nice. Behave yourself.
- I will. Okay.

851
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,520
- It's done.
- I guess it's strong.

852
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Will you date So Min or not?

853
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,250
- Will you date her or not?
- I'll just do as you say.

854
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,450
- I'll do as I'm told.
- Will you date So Min?

855
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,220
I'll do whatever you say.

856
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,650
- Say sorry to So Min.
- I'm sorry.

857
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,270
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry.

858
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,870
Behave yourself, okay?

859
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,900
- I want to keep this.
- It's level four.

860
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,110
I want this.

861
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,400
It was strong.

862
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,640
(They want to have an instrument
of power like this.)

863
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,280
Yeo Jin isn't shaking
her hand a lot. She seems fine.

864
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,050
I know how to do this.

865
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,670
This is fun.

866
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,210
- Good.
- What do I do?

867
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,940
You can't pick it up like that.

868
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,320
(A delinquent hand)

869
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,620
- Yeo Jin.
- You should pick it up like this.

870
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,620
Don't do that.

871
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,860
- Yeo Jin.
- You can just pick it like this.

872
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,100
- But this is too...
- Do whatever you want.

873
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,690
You can do whatever you want.

874
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,270
(She cups her hand
and tries it again.)

875
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,600
(Petty)

876
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,200
(Her fingers look petty
when they're put together.)

877
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,580
This is quite unique.

878
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,340
It looks like a duck.

879
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,940
This is really strong.

880
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,000
- She overcame it.
- I did it.

881
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,820
- She did it.
- Se Chan, show us what you can do.

882
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,640
- I will.
- Okay.

883
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,390
- Let's eat.
- Se Chan.

884
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,020
This will end soon.

885
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,650
Once he fails, it's over.

886
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,790
- Once he fails, it's over.
- Okay.

887
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,090
What? It will be over.

888
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,390
- So Min.
- Be careful.

889
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,690
Do it right.

890
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,100
- It might collapse.
- Gosh, this is...

891
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,660
Se Chan, you're really bad at this.

892
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,600
Touch it lightly.

893
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,390
(Groaning)

894
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,570
- That's for Yeo Jin.
- I'm sorry, Yeo Jin.

895
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,370
- I'm really sorry.
- Hey!

896
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,200
- That's for Yeo Jin.
- I'm sorry.

897
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,850
- I'm really sorry.
- I can't believe this.

898
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,900
Hey, you did it to Yeo Jin.

899
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,350
- Hey!
- I really didn't know.

900
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,550
(She felt a twinge
at an unexpected moment.)

901
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,180
- It hurt so much.
- I really didn't know.

902
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,520
Just hurry.

903
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,710
I will overpower
the high-frequency waves.

904
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,290
- I should overpower it.
- It's low frequency.

905
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,290
Is it low frequency?

906
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,130
- High frequency?
- Why did you point that out?

907
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,750
- I didn't know.
- Hey, Se Chan.

908
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,160
If it were high frequency,
you would've died.

909
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,130
Ju Bin is surprised.

910
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,270
Se Chan.

911
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,810
It's over.

912
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,870
It's almost over.

913
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,200
Oh no.

914
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,200
(Se Chan failed.)

915
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Fail.

916
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,670
It's done. It's over.

917
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,820
- I can't do this.
- I can beat So Min.

918
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,940
- Okay.
- We can still win.

919
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,290
Watch me. I'll win with my
mental and physical strength.

920
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,520
Show us.

921
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,090
This is stronger than you think.

922
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,290
Don't worry, Yeo Jin.

923
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,030
This is the final round.

924
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,300
So Min, let's eat.

925
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,630
- This is hard.
- Good luck.

926
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,770
It's okay. You can do this.

927
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,600
Jae Suk, you can eat
top shell kalguksu.

928
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,540
Right. There's also sea urchin roe
and grilled abalone.

929
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,070
- You can do this.
- That's my favorite.

930
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,310
Above all things,

931
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,110
- I'll eat top shell kalguksu.
- Jae Suk, let's just do this.

932
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,670
- Watch me.
- Are you holding out?

933
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,580
- Sure.
- It's not turned off yet.

934
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,320
(He was bluffing
while the device was off.)

935
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,740
This hurts a lot. It really hurts.

936
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,850
- Is this right?
- It hurts when it's strong.

937
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,180
It will hurt if I do this.

938
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,180
But this is fine. This is okay.

939
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,090
- This is okay.
- This is fine, right?

940
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,630
- It hurts when it's stronger.
- It will be about this.

941
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,690
Stretch out your hand. Okay.

942
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,060
It will be like this.

943
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,490
- Gosh.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

944
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,570
It just happened before I knew it.

945
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,370
- I accept that.
- You know what it is.

946
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,190
It doesn't feel like your hand
because of the low frequency.

947
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,640
- It hurts.
- Just do it, So Min.

948
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,110
Why does it hurt so much?
It's really painful.

949
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,140
That's right. So Min, well done.

950
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,000
- Slow down.
- It hurts so much.

951
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,020
- Good.
- She's really good.

952
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,550
Nice. This is good enough
for the final round.

953
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,850
It hurts so much.
He's holding out.

954
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,950
(It's the low frequency
boaster's turn.)

955
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,520
- Put it on.
- It's hard to put it on.

956
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,720
This is all about mental strength.
It's no big deal to me.

957
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,060
It's hard now. Look.
He can't put it on there.

958
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,220
He overcame the low frequency,
but he's shaking out of fear.

959
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,720
- That's the only explanation.
- He's shaking his hand.

960
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,340
- Because of the cameras.
- See?

961
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,460
- I'm sure we're going to eat.
- We have to eat.

962
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,570
That's right. Good.

963
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,500
Good. So Min, well done.

964
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,110
Once you get through this...

965
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,380
- You'll overcome it.
- Watch me.

966
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,970
I'll overcome it.

967
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,820
- I'll do it right away.
- He can't overcome it.

968
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,910
It's shaking.

969
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,090
We don't know it yet.

970
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,560
Okay. It's done.

971
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,220
So Min, what's hard
is to put the block on it.

972
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,190
It feels horrible.

973
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,190
(He should put the block
on the Jenga tower.)

974
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,390
I think it's hard.

975
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,420
Jae Suk doesn't shake
his hand a lot. He overcame it.

976
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,640
He's shaking. Bounce.

977
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,200
(If Jae Suk fails,
Team Ju Bin wins right away.)

978
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,110
- He's focused.
- Gosh.

979
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,670
Gosh, he has good concentration.

980
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,670
(It's breathtaking.)

981
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,810
It's almost time.

982
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,240
Let's move on to Part Two.

983
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,850
- Already?
- Is it too early?

984
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,620
No? Isn't it time yet?

985
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,940
- What?
- It's too early.

986
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,210
(Running Man Part 2
will start a while later.)

987
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,590
Drop it.

988
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,620
(After taking a break,)

989
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,210
(he manages to put
the block on the tower.)

990
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,420
It's done.

991
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,630
- So Min. This is it.
- It's over.

992
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,490
It's taking a long time
because it's the final round.

993
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,190
- You can do this.
- Just do it.

994
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,690
- I want sea urchin roe.
- Make it short.

995
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,390
- She better fail.
- Keep the balance.

996
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,430
It's falling down.

997
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,840
- Keep the balance.
- It's falling down.

998
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,200
(She put it vertically again.)

999
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,930
Stay still. We did it.

1000
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,700
(They are getting extremely excited
with the unstable Jenga tower.)

1001
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,850
Look at you. You must be nervous.

1002
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,470
(Extremely nervous)

1003
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,020
Kwang Soo is shaking
his hands. Good.

1004
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,520
Hey. It shouldn't be so easy anyway.

1005
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,620
Let's do this.

1006
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,830
I'm so distressed.
It's really painful.

1007
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,150
Hang on. Wait, Jae Suk.

1008
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,360
(Hang on. Wait, Jae Suk.)

1009
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,890
Hang on a second.

1010
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,990
- What is this?
- What?

1011
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,300
(A toothbrush case?)

1012
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,660
Why did you put it in here?

1013
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,660
- My hand was shaking.
- This is...

1014
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,640
(A while ago)

1015
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,110
so easy anyway.

1016
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,840
(He took the wire
off the device...)

1017
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,670
(and connected it
to his toothbrush case.)

1018
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,550
(Then he shook his hand himself.)

1019
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,210
I can do it this way.

1020
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,390
This isn't the device.

1021
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,910
This is a toothbrush case.

1022
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,090
Why did you do that?

1023
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,180
Jae Suk, when I unplugged it,
you started shaking your hand.

1024
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,250
That's teamwork. It's good teamwork.

1025
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,250
He says it's teamwork.

1026
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,390
They are unbelievable.

1027
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,640
Jae Suk is so good at this.

1028
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,690
Good.

1029
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,640
It will be over
once he puts it on the tower.

1030
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,110
This is the hard part.

1031
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,170
Wait. Are you sure
the device is working?

1032
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,200
- It is.
- He's overcoming it.

1033
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,550
Okay. It's working.

1034
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,320
He overcame it.

1035
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,820
(Groaning)

1036
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,480
- What was that?
- He shows off his strength.

1037
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,560
He's showing it off
against the low frequency.

1038
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,790
(He fights against
the low frequency.)

1039
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,090
It will be over once he places it.
You should pray, Se Chan.

1040
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,130
It's over.

1041
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,250
You can't use your body like that.

1042
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,270
Leave him be.
You know how it will turn out.

1043
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,630
- He might push it.
- It will collapse anyway.

1044
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,340
- It will crumble away.
- Hang on.

1045
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,900
I should do it as slow as I can.

1046
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,040
- Gosh.
- Yes!

1047
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,700
(Jae Suk failed.)

1048
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,320
Fail.

1049
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,470
We will enjoy the food.

1050
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,020
(So Min wins the final round.)

1051
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,620
(Team Ju Bin gets to eat
the Jeju Island seafood.)

1052
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,060
- Team Ju Bin wins.
- Okay.

1053
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,250
- Bring in the food.
- You're the best.

1054
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,250
Well done. So Min, you were amazing.

1055
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,690
She's been playing
board games a lot.

1056
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,270
What?

1057
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,660
- This is beautiful.
- My goodness.

1058
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,990
I have a question.
Should I carry this around?

1059
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,200
- Yes.
- But don't show it to others.

1060
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,500
- Okay.
- Be careful around Kwang Soo.

1061
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,580
- Kwang Soo? Why?
- And be careful around So Min.

1062
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,670
So Min is dangerous.

1063
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,100
Tell us about So Min.
I bet she's talking about you now.

1064
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,480
I'm sure she talked
behind your back, Ji Eun.

1065
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,710
- Really?
- Did you have...

1066
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,480
- any problems with her back then?
- Me?

1067
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,890
You two were friends, but you
weren't so excited to see her.

1068
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,060
I know.

1069
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,890
I think there's a secret
between you two.

1070
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,620
I'm sure there's something.
She holds a grudge.

1071
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,190
Earlier today,
she said I was dirty, right?

1072
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,100
- No. She didn't say that.
- What did she say?

1073
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,400
(Earlier today, she said
I was dirty, right?)

1074
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,000
(Her memory is distorted.)

1075
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,540
What did she say?

1076
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,210
- It wasn't clean.
- Our relationship wasn't clean?

1077
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,810
She said it wasn't clean,
but it's become dirty.

1078
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,000
"Ji Eun is dirty."
This is what she remembers.

1079
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's not easy to say such a thing
about your friend.

1080
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,670
- It's not easy.
- Gosh, this is hard.

1081
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,420
I'm serious.

1082
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,690
Actually, when there was
a group date,

1083
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,750
our seniors decided
who should go on the date.

1084
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,790
They were like, "You, you,
and you will go on the date."

1085
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,390
- Really?
- And So Min and I got picked a lot.

1086
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,500
- Your seniors decided it.
- They picked the best ones.

1087
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:12,600
If I did something on the date,
I'm sorry about that.

1088
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,730
I didn't mean to be like that.

1089
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,100
What can I do...

1090
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,440
- when that's what they said?
- Right.

1091
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,670
(She does a 180.)

1092
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,730
(It's her fault for being
too popular.)

1093
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,270
Right? It's not like...

1094
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,270
I told them to choose me.

1095
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,480
- No, right?
- But So Min could think that...

1096
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,540
you flirted in a way.

1097
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,790
To be honest,
this is how I remember it.

1098
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,790
My relationship with So Min
boils down...

1099
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,620
to her having...

1100
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,830
a victim mentality.

1101
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,580
(So Min has a victim mentality.)

1102
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,460
(Victim mentality?)

1103
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,920
(The bait caught
the biggest fish yet.)

1104
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,020
Gosh, that's harsh.

1105
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,900
That's what I believe.

1106
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,690
Also, there's something...

1107
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,100
quite complicated
between So Min and me...

1108
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,100
regarding a good friend of mine.

1109
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,540
(She took the bait.)

1110
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,480
Is that friend a man or a woman?

1111
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,100
- A man, no, a woman.
- It's a woman.

1112
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,440
- So a woman...
- A man got in between them.

1113
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
That's right.

1114
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,480
And I was kind of stuck in between.

1115
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,290
- You couldn't take one's side.
- Right.

1116
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,650
When splitting into groups...

1117
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,690
- Was that too mean?
- Who?

1118
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,830
- Was I too mean?
- Of course not.

1119
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,830
- So Min thinks she's a victim.
- It could happen.

1120
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,230
Yes, exactly.

1121
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,270
(No, that's not what I meant.)

1122
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,000
Guys, seriously?

1123
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,500
Gosh, this is hilarious.

1124
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,900
- This isn't how it should be.
- An old friend of mine...

1125
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,900
- Is this the place? Looks tasty.
- I bet it's delicious.

1126
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,600
This is what you'd expect
at Jeju Island.

1127
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,770
Check out the names
of the buildings.

1128
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,270
(Where local food of Jeju
is served!)

1129
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,440
(A place where you can
experience the old Jeju)

1130
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,750
We're here at the Commission
Agency Site of Kim Man Deok.

1131
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,020
- The first mission...
- Yes?

1132
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,920
Teamwork will be key...

1133
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,420
in this game
of I Can't Hear Your Voice.

1134
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,650
I Can't Hear Your Voice?

1135
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,460
You'll be given 100 seconds each.

1136
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,730
Two chosen members
will put on headphones.

1137
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,140
One will describe the word
while one answers.

1138
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,460
A total of four rounds
will be played.

1139
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,310
The team with the most
correct answers will win.

1140
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,580
Please note that
you can't directly name the word.

1141
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,350
- The winning team...
- Yes?

1142
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,420
will be able to see
a card of their choice...

1143
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,690
and receive a chance
to swap their cards twice.

1144
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,810
- Twice?
- Twice.

1145
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,420
Three servings of a meal
will be served...

1146
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,480
while the losing team...

1147
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,960
- only gets one.
- A single serving?

1148
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,350
- That's mean of you.
- No way.

1149
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,830
The name of our team...

1150
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,830
- is 1, 2, 3.
- Why?

1151
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,690
- He has 1 child, she has 2,
- I have 2.

1152
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,690
- while I have 3.
- 3.

1153
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,560
- 1, 2, 3.
- 3.

1154
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,670
(He just accepts it.)

1155
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,940
We'll call ourselves
Victim Mentality.

1156
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,640
That's our team name.

1157
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,040
No way.

1158
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,080
- Victim Mentality.
- Mentality!

1159
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,250
(Victim Mentality!)

1160
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,920
How hilarious.

1161
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,020
Let's do this!

1162
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,350
I'll try and guess the word.

1163
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,040
Ji Hyo, you should stand over here.

1164
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,460
- Okay.
- That's a good one.

1165
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,520
You can't point out
the number of syllables.

1166
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,750
How about this then?

1167
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,020
(Nod your head instead.)

1168
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,230
(Okay.)

1169
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,500
I bet it's loud.

1170
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,790
- It's really loud.
- Here we go.

1171
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,600
Ready, get set, go.

1172
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,230
(Macaron)

1173
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,460
The most expensive item...

1174
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,000
at coffee shops.

1175
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,900
- Expensive?
- You're insane?

1176
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,270
- A dessert...
- A sort of cake.

1177
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,870
The most expensive dessert!

1178
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,040
The most expensive cake.

1179
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,690
- A snack.
- What?

1180
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,940
A...

1181
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,150
A snack.

1182
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,920
- A snack!
- An expensive one.

1183
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,520
- An expensive one?
- Yes.

1184
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,960
Squid-peanut Balls!

1185
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,120
No, it's round.

1186
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,830
(Squid-peanut Balls
are most expensive to Jong Kook.)

1187
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,830
- What...
- How is that expensive?

1188
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,690
It's a round-shaped snack.

1189
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,790
Homerun Balls?

1190
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,900
An expensive snack.

1191
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,370
- Homerun Balls?
- A snack?

1192
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,600
- He must really not eat snacks.
- An expensive one?

1193
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,900
Is it round? Onion Rings?

1194
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,730
- Pass.
- I'll pass.

1195
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,080
Pass.

1196
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,250
- I like how frugal he is.
- Snacks that women like?

1197
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,940
- Pass!
- This is a tricky one.

1198
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,120
When driving...

1199
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,250
When joining the military?

1200
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,520
The military?

1201
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,750
- This is fun.
- A car!

1202
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,690
A car.

1203
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,460
The Let's Play app?

1204
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,060
(The Let's Play app)

1205
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,850
(The GPS system led him
to a lodging establishment.)

1206
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,230
- The Let's Play app?
- Are we advertising it?

1207
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,000
- That's what she said.
- What?

1208
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,170
The Let's Play app.

1209
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,560
(The Let's Play app)

1210
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,500
When you're driving a car...

1211
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,140
You're driving.

1212
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,900
- A towel?
- Yes, that.

1213
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,040
- When driving...
- Right, a towel.

1214
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,670
It shows you the way.

1215
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,520
On our cellphones.

1216
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,920
- Cellphones.
- Cellphones!

1217
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,080
The T Map app.

1218
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,620
- The T Map app?
- The T Map app!

1219
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,580
(Welcome to the world
of indirect advertisements.)

1220
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,150
- What was that?
- A map. A map!

1221
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,920
- A see-saw?
- Yes, a map.

1222
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,230
A map you need when driving.

1223
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,290
Driving, see-saw...

1224
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,400
- A map you need when driving.
- Yes, while driving.

1225
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,560
- Tell him the number of syllables.
- That's not allowed.

1226
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,960
You'll pass.

1227
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,330
- This...
- Hey!

1228
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,540
You'll probably get this one.

1229
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,710
Pyongyang or Hamhung?

1230
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,080
(Naengmyeon)

1231
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,770
- Park Myung Soo.
- After eating!

1232
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,940
Park Myung Soo.

1233
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,100
Park Myung Soo!

1234
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,580
After eating.

1235
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,210
Jessica.

1236
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,650
(Pondering)

1237
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,690
What you eat in the summer.

1238
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,790
- What you eat.
- Yes.

1239
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,290
- Noodles.
- Patbingsu?

1240
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,460
Noodles.

1241
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,250
- What?
- In the summer.

1242
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,100
- The summer.
- That's right.

1243
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,600
- What you eat.
- What you eat!

1244
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,170
- Naengmyeon.
- Naengmyeon!

1245
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,290
(She said it loud and clear.)

1246
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,870
(She was so frustrated
that she said it out loud.)

1247
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,140
You can't just say it!

1248
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,560
Your time is up.

1249
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,140
- This...
- Hold on.

1250
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,310
Is it over?

1251
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,170
- I mean...
- I was completely clueless.

1252
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,810
- Just the words...
- Not without any gestures.

1253
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,710
- Especially without any gestures.
- I see.

1254
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,270
It's impossible to know.

1255
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,580
- Naengmyeon.
- Hold on though.

1256
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,190
Jong Kook, have you never
had any snacks before?

1257
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,790
How can an expensive snack...

1258
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,350
- be Squid-peanut Balls?
- But...

1259
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,120
Squid-peanut Balls
and Homerun Balls.

1260
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,520
I couldn't make any of it out.

1261
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,580
I'll describe the word.

1262
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,730
Ready, get set,

1263
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,000
go!

1264
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,270
(Ceiling price)

1265
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,170
Shares. Stocks!

1266
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,040
Army doctor.

1267
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,230
Stocks.

1268
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,940
- That's right.
- Shares.

1269
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,000
- Soldier.
- Nice!

1270
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,730
The stock price...

1271
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,900
is going up.

1272
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,040
- Going up!
- Don't.

1273
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,670
- You can't do that.
- The frustration gets to you.

1274
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,940
- A soldier goes up.
- Yes, the stock price goes up.

1275
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,310
Say that in another way.

1276
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,710
A soldier goes up.

1277
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,290
- An airplane.
- An airplane...

1278
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,920
- An airplane?
- She's very one-dimensional.

1279
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,020
The opposite of floor price.

1280
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,560
- A soldier.
- Shares!

1281
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,730
- From what I can tell...
- The price goes up!

1282
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,480
- Say it again.
- She doesn't know much.

1283
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,560
The stock price goes up.

1284
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,400
What do you call that?

1285
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,730
I doubt she knows what this is.

1286
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,460
- Hey!
- Just move on to the next one.

1287
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,900
- Pass.
- This is probably new to her.

1288
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,960
Pass.

1289
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,100
- Pass.
- This is an easy one.

1290
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,370
Hang glider...

1291
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,100
It's over. We're moving on.

1292
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,940
- The next one.
- We're moving on.

1293
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,770
- Look at her expression.
- What?

1294
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,670
- What?
- We're moving on.

1295
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,080
(Why can't you move on?)

1296
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,790
- We're... Yes, we'll pass.
- Pass!

1297
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,290
- It's already been done.
- Pass...

1298
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,560
It's been done.

1299
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,920
Gosh, this is frustrating.

1300
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,060
At the sea...

1301
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,460
- Pass.
- In the sea...

1302
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,600
Can't we pass?

1303
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,750
We already did!

1304
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,330
- In the sea...
- Can't we pass?

1305
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,830
(It's impossible to
communicate with her.)

1306
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,420
(She's the only one
that hasn't moved on.)

1307
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,600
We already moved on.

1308
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,170
- Got it.
- We're on to the next one!

1309
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,600
Okay.

1310
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,270
They go into the sea...

1311
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,600
Abalones...

1312
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,810
What? Jjamppong?

1313
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,540
Abalones.

1314
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,790
- Abalones.
- Abalones.

1315
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,920
- Abalones!
- Oh, I know.

1316
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,020
Haenyeo!

1317
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,460
(She answers haenyeo correctly.)

1318
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,480
That's right.

1319
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,190
(Tattoo)

1320
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,730
(Tattoo?)

1321
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,850
The people of Hongdae area.

1322
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,460
(The people of Hongdae area)

1323
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,100
(The people of Hongdae area
are attacked.)

1324
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,730
(Choking)

1325
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,140
- Rooftop?
- The people of Hongdae area.

1326
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,140
- What?
- The people of Hongdae area.

1327
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,330
Why not just say
the Korean word "munshin"?

1328
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,480
Alone?

1329
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,730
A dragon on one's back.

1330
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,040
- A dragon?
- Yes, dragon.

1331
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,580
A dragon that's drawn on the body.

1332
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,520
- A dragon?
- A dragon that's drawn on the body.

1333
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,810
(Buffering)

1334
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,310
- A dragon.
- Swearing?

1335
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,580
- Yes, a dragon.
- She thinks it's swearing.

1336
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,890
- Your time's up.
- Swearing?

1337
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,290
- Gosh.
- What a relief.

1338
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,480
- I'm so glad.
- Just you wait.

1339
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,580
We'll end it for sure in this round.

1340
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,290
(Haha and Jong Kook are up next.)

1341
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,920
Why else would I
have chosen these two?

1342
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,230
- Okay, good.
- They're the best.

1343
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,500
- All right.
- Hold on.

1344
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,770
Are you ready?

1345
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,370
- And go.
- They'll dominate for sure.

1346
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,810
(Pork cutlet)

1347
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,830
- Our restaurant!
- Yes?

1348
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,100
You and I.

1349
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
- Yes, you and I.
- What do we sell?

1350
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,350
What do we sell?

1351
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,920
- Pork cutlet.
- Yes!

1352
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,810
(They easily get one right.)

1353
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,810
I didn't expect them to
get it right.

1354
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:18,980
Pororo.

1355
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,980
(Penguin)

1356
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,390
Pororo. The animal.

1357
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,920
What am I?

1358
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,980
Two syllables.

1359
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,750
Haha? Haroro.

1360
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,600
- Haroro.
- Haroro.

1361
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,690
The animal? Penguin!

1362
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,750
(Penguin is correct.)

1363
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,670
(They take the lead
with two correct answers.)

1364
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:33,770
This one seems tricky.

1365
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,600
(Ilchwiweoljang)

1366
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,000
(He's weak when it comes
to four-syllable idioms.)

1367
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,500
- I...
- You?

1368
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,580
(4 syllables)

1369
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,100
I've improved.

1370
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,400
A four-syllable idiom.

1371
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,150
I've suddenly...

1372
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,620
He has suddenly improved.

1373
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,750
I've, you know...

1374
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,250
I'm the bomb now.

1375
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,060
(He's trying to explain
what ilchwiweoljang means.)

1376
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,350
I didn't expect this either,

1377
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,400
- but I'm the bomb now.
- A superpower?

1378
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,460
Four syllables.

1379
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,400
- A four-syllable word?
- Your time's up.

1380
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
(Time over)

1381
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,190
He almost understood
"ilchwiweoljang" though.

1382
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,400
Why don't you two give it a shot?

1383
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,640
Was "ilchwiweoljang"
a word I needed to guess?

1384
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,100
Ilchwiweoljang? Seriously?

1385
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,870
You have to do well
in order to eat lunch.

1386
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,150
It won't be easy though.

1387
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,350
Ready,

1388
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:20,580
get set, go.

1389
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,270
(Nucksal)

1390
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,290
- Goodness.
- Oh, dear.

1391
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,520
A rapper!

1392
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,080
- He's a rapper.
- A rapper.

1393
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:33,960
He has thick skin.

1394
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,190
(Nucksal means to have thick skin?)

1395
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,290
- A rapper?
- He has thick skin.

1396
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,920
- What on earth?
- Thick legs?

1397
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,730
- His skin.
- His foot.

1398
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:45,960
(He's fascinated)

1399
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,830
- Look at her expression.
- Horse?

1400
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,040
Moon.

1401
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,850
(Pondering)

1402
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:51,940
- Horse?
- What's with her expression?

1403
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,080
(Two syllables)

1404
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,150
- Horse?
- Look at her expression.

1405
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,620
(She takes a note
out of Haha's book.)

1406
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,890
What on earth is she doing?

1407
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,810
A rapper who talks well?

1408
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,310
- Two syllables!
- She's copying Haha's strategy.

1409
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,310
(Copying Haha's strategy
results in...)

1410
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,080
- Two syllables?
- Yes.

1411
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,120
(She was able to tell Ji Hyo
that it's a two-syllable word.)

1412
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,420
This is what I like.

1413
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,850
(This is what I like.)

1414
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,870
(This is what she likes?)

1415
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,560
- This is what she likes.
- She must like Nucksal.

1416
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,270
(They finally understand
what she's saying.)

1417
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,330
- The rapper!
- Rapper.

1418
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,870
It's a name.

1419
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,100
- Name.
- "It's a name."

1420
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,600
- A name. A rapper's name.
- Name?

1421
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,400
- "It's a name."
- A rapper's name.

1422
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,580
A rapper is what?

1423
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,100
- No, it's a rapper and...
- A rapper and...

1424
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,310
She's so desperate.

1425
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,580
- This is crazy.
- She's so funny.

1426
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,620
- She's...
- Sit down when you talk.

1427
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,060
- This is good.
- Good?

1428
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,210
(Frustrating)

1429
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,960
Just pass.

1430
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,250
- Move on.
- The next one.

1431
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,650
(Pass!)

1432
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,900
(Repayment of a kindness
even after one's death.)

1433
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,000
(It's an old saying.)

1434
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,400
- Moving on to the next.
- She doesn't know what it means.

1435
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,140
You know this one, right?

1436
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,330
Don't know this one either?

1437
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,640
You know this one, right?

1438
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,440
- Jeju Island.
- Jeju Island.

1439
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,500
Famous rice cake!

1440
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,670
(Jeju Island! Famous! Rice cake!)

1441
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,980
Just talk slowly.

1442
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,270
- She doesn't know what it is.
- Jeju Island's...

1443
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,040
- She doesn't know.
- Jeju Island? Say it again.

1444
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,810
1, 2...

1445
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,420
(How many syllables?
Four syllables.)

1446
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,790
- Rice cake!
- We won't be able to have dinner.

1447
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,060
Say goodbye to the food.

1448
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,020
Jeju Island's rice cake.

1449
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,750
Jeju Island's rice cake?
Omegi rice cake!

1450
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,350
(Correct. Omegi rice cake)

1451
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,620
Omegi rice cake!

1452
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,230
(Now it's a tie!)

1453
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,190
- Come on. You're doing great.
- I'm sure she knows this one.

1454
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,370
Just get one more correct answer.

1455
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,060
(Olle Trail)

1456
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,640
- 1, 2, 3.
- Olle Trail. Her face is red.

1457
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,580
It's on Jeju Island.

1458
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,210
- It's on Jeju Island.
- This one is easy.

1459
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,750
It's a trail!

1460
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,440
It's a rail on Jeju Island?

1461
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,150
KT!

1462
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,080
- Gosh, KT?
- KT.

1463
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,690
- Why? Did you hear it?
- KT.

1464
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,650
- She won't get it.
- KT!

1465
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,480
- She won't understand.
- Don't do that. Don't do that.

1466
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,830
- A famous trail in Jeju.
- On Jeju Island.

1467
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,830
It's famous in Jeju. It's KT!

1468
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,170
- KT is famous in Jeju?
- In Jeju Island!

1469
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,730
Three syllables!

1470
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,290
A taxi is what?

1471
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,060
- Jeju Island!
- Taxi fare?

1472
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,170
You should move on to the next.

1473
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,170
- Pass.
- All right.

1474
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,580
(Acting cute)

1475
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,580
(Aing!)

1476
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,850
(Using her whole body
to express what it is.)

1477
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,310
What do you call this?

1478
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:14,690
(Ang!)

1479
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,210
- This is weird.
- It's weird that she got that.

1480
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,480
- You don't know this?
- What is this called?

1481
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,600
Acting cute.

1482
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,960
(The whole explanation
is one-dimensional.)

1483
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,060
- It's about how you act.
- Action?

1484
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,270
- Action.
- Action?

1485
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:31,040
(Just trying to act cute
as much as she can.)

1486
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,270
Acting cute.

1487
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:33,500
(That is correct.
Act charming)

1488
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,370
(Finally got the correct answer)

1489
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,000
(Turned the table but 3 to 2)

1490
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,170
Okay, time's up.

1491
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,040
- You are...
- One day?

1492
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,650
- Right now.
- Right now.

1493
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:43,810
You're wearing it.

1494
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,290
- You should stop.
- You're wearing it.

1495
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,580
- She's good.
- It took longer than I expected.

1496
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,920
- Good, good, good.
- Excuse me?

1497
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,790
He said we won. We won.

1498
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,020
(Now she finds out they won.)

1499
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,480
- She turned it around at the end.
- Ji Eun.

1500
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,890
When this episode is released,

1501
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,500
- other variety shows will want you.
- Great.

1502
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,790
- Too bad you lost.
- Gosh.

1503
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,600
Here is the result
of the first mission.

1504
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,640
Ji Eun's team can choose a member
to check a card.

1505
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,460
You should decide
which one's card you want to check.

1506
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,600
Do we swap cards
with the one they pick?

1507
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,080
It's up to them.

1508
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,270
- They'll take it if they like it.
- They can choose not to take it?

1509
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:12,980
- They won't if they don't like it.
- Oh, I get it.

1510
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,620
- Then we will...
- What card are you holding?

1511
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,040
- Your card.
- If you want to know,

1512
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,210
you have to pick mine.

1513
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,420
She's unusual.

1514
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,060
Did you really think
he would tell you that?

1515
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,390
E Hyun, are you holding
a useful card?

1516
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,890
- Your card.
- Mine is a bomb.

1517
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,060
- It's a bomb?
- Yes.

1518
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,250
She doesn't mean that
it's literally a bomb, right?

1519
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,790
Shall we check E Hyun's card?

1520
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,770
We'll check So E Hyun's card!

1521
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,870
- We'll check So E Hyun's card.
- So E Hyun.

1522
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,560
- Show us.
- So E Hyun, show them your card.

1523
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,170
They can check your card
just like that?

1524
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,370
I guess they can.

1525
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,710
Mine really is a bomb.

1526
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,480
(What kind of card
would So E Hyun have?)

1527
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,690
(It's empty!)

1528
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:51,920
I will make an exchange.

1529
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,310
Yes, let's do that.

1530
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,850
I'll make an exchange with Haha.

1531
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,620
Song Ji Hyo wants to make
an exchange with Haha.

1532
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,500
(Ji Hyo got Haha's rock card.)

1533
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,120
(Suk Jin, Rock.
Ji Hyo and Ji Eun, Unrevealed)

1534
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,670
(Ji Hyo, Rock.)

1535
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,730
(What is on the card
that Haha received from Ji Hyo?)

1536
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,710
(Jong Kook, Unrevealed.
E Hyun, Blank. Haha, Rock.)

1537
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:14,170
(Haha, Unrevealed)

1538
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,830
Now your meal will be served.

1539
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,140
The winners get three servings.

1540
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,250
The losers
will only get one serving.

1541
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,670
Please serve the food.

1542
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,620
(It's a feast of appetizing meat!)

1543
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,120
Okay, this is why we're in Jeju.

1544
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,710
- This looks really good.
- It's amazing.

1545
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,190
- I'm so hungry.
- It looks delicious.

1546
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,620
- My goodness.
- This is why it's called "Meat"?

1547
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,350
The yukgaejang
is unbelievably delicious.

1548
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,560
Yes, it's good.

1549
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,060
(Sweet bracken yukgaejang,
dombe meat...)

1550
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,120
(and noodle soup with pork)

1551
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,350
This is dombe meat.

1552
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,330
This one is dombe meat?

1553
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,330
Before we serve you your meal,
you should exchange cards.

1554
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,400
- Exchange cards.
- Should we pick one?

1555
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,830
- Let's...
- Hey, it's obvious that...

1556
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:47,540
Kwang Soo or Jae Suk has a bomb.

1557
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,710
So we should make sure who that is.

1558
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:50,850
Then should we pick Jae Suk's card?

1559
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:51,940
Jae Suk's? Okay.

1560
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,500
We made a decision.

1561
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,650
- We'll check Jae Suk's card.
- Okay.

1562
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,810
- Show us your card.
- Show them your card.

1563
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,250
This goes very well
with Jeju Island.

1564
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,350
- Oh, gosh.
- It's empty.

1565
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,690
- Nothing's in it.
- No.

1566
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:02,710
It's blank.

1567
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,390
- It's blank.
- Nothing's in it.

1568
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,730
Kwang Soo, what's yours? A rock?

1569
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,290
A woman.

1570
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,150
Did you just call Kwang Soo a rock?

1571
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,460
Hey!

1572
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,440
- No, I didn't mean it like that.
- What's wrong with that?

1573
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,230
- You deliberately said that.
- What's wrong with saying "rock"?

1574
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,440
He asked if I have a rock,
so what's wrong?

1575
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,540
Let me get this straight.

1576
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,230
- I'm okay. Don't make a big deal.
- Hey, you.

1577
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,210
Don't you dare call Kwang Soo
a rock again.

1578
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,270
- You just stay quiet.
- I don't care what he calls me.

1579
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,080
- You watch your mouth.
- What wrong with that?

1580
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,540
I straightened it out.

1581
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,620
It was also funny
when he said he has a woman.

1582
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,850
Since he has long hair.

1583
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:32,890
A woman.

1584
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:34,120
He's lying.

1585
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,390
- Shall we?
- Tell us how your picks.

1586
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,060
Well, we should try it.

1587
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,350
- This is the first game.
- All right.

1588
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:39,730
- We will make an exchange.
- Yes, we will.

1589
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:40,920
Who will exchange with whom?

1590
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,690
I will exchange with Kwang soo.

1591
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:43,850
- Making one exchange?
- Yes.

1592
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,400
- Please change your cards.
- Open it.

1593
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:47,900
Gosh, it's wind.

1594
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,940
(Not bad)

1595
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,230
- Wait, it's a woman.
- It's a woman.

1596
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:52,810
We told you honestly.

1597
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:54,770
- Wait a minute.
- We knew you were being honest.

1598
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,580
- This is good for both.
- Yes.

1599
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:58,870
- Well, for us...
- Right? For her too.

1600
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,310
Yes, you're right.

1601
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,040
- It was a good exchange.
- I'm happy for both.

1602
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,480
Now we will serve you your meal.

1603
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,190
- It's hard to have a meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

1604
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:07,960
- This is the meal?
- Gosh, it's abalone.

1605
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,080
(A plate of assorted fresh sashimi)

1606
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,310
It's amazing.

1607
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,150
(Various kinds of seafood)

1608
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,120
Look at the abalone.
It looks really delicious.

1609
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,150
It looks really good.

1610
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,330
- The smell.
- Smells good.

1611
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,230
How is it?

1612
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,520
- Is it good?
- Yes, it is.

1613
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,230
The rice and sea urchin bowl is
nicely scorched at the bottom.

1614
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:23,460
(Various kinds of seafood is making
him forget what to say.)

1615
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:25,810
- Amazing.
- Can they have some too?

1616
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,370
I don't think so.

1617
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,330
Jae Suk.

1618
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,040
- This is so good.
- It's rice with sea urchin roe.

1619
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,100
It's really good.

1620
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,980
Who can imitate an abalone?

1621
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:36,750
(Imitate an abalone?)

1622
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,810
What do we do about her?

1623
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:40,980
- This is humiliating.
- How could she do this?

1624
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,080
- This is ridiculous.
- Why aren't you giving us food?

1625
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,190
- It's urchin and abalone.
- Come on. Imitate an abalone.

1626
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,230
Cue!

1627
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,330
- Here he goes.
- Imitate an abalone. Cue!

1628
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,100
(Here's a wild abalone.)

1629
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,120
There's an abalone.

1630
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,600
Taste this. It's so good.
It's scorched nicely.

1631
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,330
I won't let you humiliate me,
Jeon So Min.

1632
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,640
The rice with sea urchin roe
is so good.

1633
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,770
You think so?

1634
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:06,000
It's time to choose the keywords
for the second mission.

1635
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,650
The first word is "steal".

1636
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:09,350
The second word is "take off".

1637
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,020
(Which member will move
to which team?)

1638
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:12,580
What is this?

1639
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:15,420
- What is it?
- What's this?

1640
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,080
Why is this "take off"?

1641
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:18,620
Are we doing taekwondo?

1642
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,250
They're taekwondo uniforms.

1643
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,350
There are socks. Maybe we're
taking each other's socks off.

1644
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,100
(An airplane zooms by
over their heads.)

1645
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,790
(It's noisy because there's
an airport nearby.)

1646
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:30,190
There are airplanes flying by
because there's an airport nearby.

1647
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,370
An airplane flies by
every four minutes.

1648
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,370
Really?

1649
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,980
My goodness.
Jong Kook shouldn't be here.

1650
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:38,650
- Who is it?
- Please let it be Suk Jin.

1651
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,480
(They're all waiting for
Suk Jin to arrive.)

1652
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,920
- Okay!
- That's it!

1653
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,210
It's Jong Kook.

1654
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,580
Can't you hear Haha?
Haha's here too.

1655
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,480
Come on! You're all dead!

1656
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,620
(Jong Kook, Haha, and E Hyun
have arrived!)

1657
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,310
- So E Hyun.
- E Hyun's here.

1658
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:51,980
- Jong Kook, gosh.
- I'm scared of her.

1659
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,150
It's Jong Kook.

1660
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,230
Gosh, it's Yeo Jin.

1661
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,870
Yes, there she is.

1662
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,170
(Hi, Yeo Jin.)

1663
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,060
Gosh, I'm scared of her.

1664
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,370
Hello.

1665
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,770
Gosh, this sucks.

1666
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,230
We're so dead.

1667
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,150
- I'm so scared.
- Hey, you're here.

1668
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,670
Gosh, what's with the uniform?

1669
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:18,390
All of you chose
the word "take off".

1670
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,980
Here's the second mission.

1671
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,920
You have to take off
your opponent's clothes...

1672
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,150
in order to gain points.

1673
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,210
- Take off clothes?
- What?

1674
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,580
(You have to take off your
opponent's clothes to win.)

1675
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,690
(Take off their clothes?)

1676
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:28,020
- Take off clothes?
- What?

1677
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,250
- Are you serious?
- This is so one-dimensional.

1678
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,900
- Seriously?
- It's so one-dimensional.

1679
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,290
The second mission is called
Stake Your Life on a Single Match.

1680
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,100
One member from each team
will fight one-on-one.

1681
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,040
We're adopting the rules of judo.

1682
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,250
If you take off your opponent's
pair of socks, you get a Yuko.

1683
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,250
If you take the top uniform or
the bottom, you get a half-point.

1684
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,480
If you get the name tag
under the uniform, you get a point.

1685
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,690
(Full point)

1686
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,540
(Two Yukos equals a half-point,
two half points equals a full point)

1687
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,080
Two Yukos equals a half-point.

1688
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,750
So if you get their socks
and a top, you get a full point.

1689
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,460
Which male member
will go for the first round?

1690
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,960
It depends on who
you're fighting against.

1691
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,830
I'm sure anyone can win you.

1692
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,830
So it doesn't matter who fights,
Kwang soo or me.

1693
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,000
(Anyone can win me?)

1694
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,770
You're the one who should
choose carefully.

1695
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:13,830
I pick you.

1696
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,670
(I pick you.)

1697
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,540
(Jae Suk ignores him,
so he decides to be rude too.)

1698
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,750
- He wants you.
- Just this once.

1699
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,500
"I pick you."

1700
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,980
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

1701
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,040
- I'll fight Haha, you fight him.
- All right.

1702
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,020
- Haha chose me, so I'll fight him.
- Okay, okay.

1703
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,080
Let's go.

1704
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,890
Of course, I'd be better for Haha.

1705
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,960
My back hurts today.

1706
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:32,480
Your back hurts?

1707
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,060
- Yes, a little.
- Where?

1708
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,250
Which part?

1709
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,520
- Hey.
- Just let me see.

1710
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,790
My goodness.

1711
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,330
- This part?
- Go away.

1712
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,060
This part?

1713
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,790
(Punching)

1714
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:44,730
(He really punched his back
when he said it hurt!)

1715
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,870
How dare you!

1716
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:48,080
- What's wrong with him?
- He says his back hurts.

1717
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,400
Then should we focus on
punching him in the back?

1718
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,250
I knew he wouldn't worry about me
but this is unbelievable.

1719
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,710
I can't believe this.

1720
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,210
Kwang Soo, what is that?

1721
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,290
- I tied a knot.
- Gosh, that's really...

1722
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,690
- unattractive.
- What?

1723
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,250
Then how should I do it?

1724
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,460
- Is it called "untie your knot"?
- He said it's unattractive.

1725
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,190
Then should I tie this?

1726
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,730
We're on the same team,
but you really are pathetic.

1727
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,900
(Even his team members
think he's pathetic.)

1728
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,230
Aren't you tired of it?

1729
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,040
- It's really fun.
- It's really fun?

1730
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,000
(He says it's fun.)

1731
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,210
I thought you would be
really tired of yourself.

1732
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,870
- Seriously.
- It's therapeutic.

1733
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:21,980
Thank goodness.

1734
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,830
Is it therapeutic for you?

1735
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:25,370
I am glad that it's therapeutic.

1736
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:27,670
You know the rules, right?
Let's begin.

1737
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:28,920
(The first round)

1738
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,920
Get ready.

1739
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,250
Let's go!
We need to win no matter what.

1740
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,480
Let's go!

1741
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,620
(Jae Suk needs to win this round
no matter what.)

1742
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,250
(Let's begin!)

1743
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:41,290
(It's a match
between the weakest members.)

1744
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:44,870
(They look weak from the start.)

1745
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:47,500
(Who will be the weaker one?)

1746
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,560
Is Haha drunk?

1747
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,000
Seriously.

1748
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,270
You didn't even budge.

1749
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,100
(Whirring)

1750
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,670
(An airplane passes over the arena.)

1751
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,150
- You little...
- You...

1752
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:04,690
(They swear at each other
while the audio gets drowned out.)

1753
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,210
I can't hear you
over the sound of the airplane!

1754
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,020
(What are they saying?)

1755
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,080
(They continue to have
a private conversation.)

1756
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,000
(They are fighters
who use their mouths, not bodies.)

1757
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,100
(The airplane passes by...)

1758
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,560
(and Haha aims for Jae Suk's sock.)

1759
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,600
You got it!

1760
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:27,940
(His back is wide open
as he reaches for Jae Suk's sock.)

1761
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,980
Okay. You got it!

1762
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,670
No! Guard your name tag!

1763
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:34,770
(Jae Suk will get one full point
if he rips off the name tag.)

1764
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,750
- No! Guard your name tag!
- Guard your name tag, Haha!

1765
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,690
One full point!

1766
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,750
(Jae Suk wins with one full point!)

1767
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:43,890
(The weakest members' match ends
so fast...)

1768
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,020
One full point!

1769
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,060
(that it's embarrassing.)

1770
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,190
He won with one full point!

1771
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:50,850
(Dazed)

1772
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,500
Does the game end
if the name tag gets removed?

1773
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,500
(Incredulous)

1774
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,500
(Their teammate is weaker
than they expected.)

1775
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,040
- Isn't it about the socks?
- He didn't know.

1776
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,460
- I didn't know.
- He didn't know.

1777
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:01,330
This is about taking off clothes.

1778
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,370
- One full point!
- Good!

1779
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,150
- The man with one full point!
- Okay!

1780
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,850
I had a really cool plan.

1781
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,420
- Haha looked so stupid.
- Hold on.

1782
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,120
- This match shouldn't count.
- He tried to lift me up.

1783
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,310
This match shouldn't count.
I had a really cool plan.

1784
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:13,580
- Okay.
- Haha loses with one full point.

1785
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,150
- Hey!
- Okay!

1786
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,790
- I was going to...
- All right!

1787
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,080
I even swore
when the airplane flew by.

1788
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,190
It took me more time
to change into these clothes.

1789
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,690
- He didn't understand the rules.
- Seriously.

1790
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:28,270
- Kwang Soo!
- All right.

1791
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,600
I will do my best.

1792
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,140
- Just do some damage to him.
- I might beat him.

1793
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,770
For goodness' sake.

1794
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,080
I am in a bad condition.
For goodness' sake.

1795
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,100
Jong Kook has a bad back today.

1796
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,870
(He pretends to be worried.)

1797
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,480
Don't overexert yourself.

1798
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,920
This is bad.

1799
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,790
Kwang Soo,
just do some damage to him.

1800
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:49,520
Do your absolute best...

1801
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,790
so that he is humiliated
even if you don't win.

1802
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:52,850
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

1803
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,250
Just fold him in half.

1804
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,230
Kwang Soo, that's your specialty.

1805
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,690
(He will aim for Jong Kook's back.)

1806
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,560
Jong Kook's back is hurting!
And you're aiming for his back?

1807
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:06,960
(He will hit where it hurts!)

1808
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,000
There you go!

1809
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:12,250
- He is the worst.
- Kwang Soo.

1810
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,500
- Kwang Soo.
- He is flippant.

1811
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,370
Kwang Soo, know this.

1812
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,750
Kwang Soo.

1813
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,210
Remember that the airplane passes by
every four minutes.

1814
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,620
Why did I pick him?

1815
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,790
- What?
- Why did I pick him?

1816
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,980
Isn't it great that he is
on our team?

1817
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,650
- He is insane.
- Had he been on another team...

1818
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,460
I really don't want to do this.

1819
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,830
(Picking up)

1820
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,400
Hold on. You can't use that.

1821
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:39,500
(He picks up a rock from
the corner of the park.)

1822
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,370
(It's a rock for therapy.)

1823
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,100
You can't use that.

1824
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,100
(He acts like
he doesn't know anything.)

1825
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,670
Hey! You jerk!

1826
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:47,670
(He stopped playing fair
10 years ago.)

1827
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,150
He is absolutely ridiculous.

1828
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,390
He has a license.

1829
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,120
A license?

1830
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,580
- The viewers...
- They forgive Kwang Soo.

1831
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,620
(The viewers go,
"He is always like that.")

1832
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,690
Kwang Soo.

1833
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:00,290
Remember that the airplane passes by
every four minutes.

1834
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,400
Okay, okay.

1835
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,600
Get ready. Set...

1836
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,190
(Round 2 begins!)

1837
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,060
He is ridiculous.

1838
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,460
- Five minutes, right?
- Yes.

1839
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,190
There is a tie, right?

1840
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,810
- Just take off his socks.
- Okay.

1841
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,210
Think of it as skinning him.

1842
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,580
(Jong Kook,
think of it as skinning him.)

1843
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,710
Skin!

1844
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,420
Kwang Soo, that's good.

1845
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,420
- Kwang Soo, save up your energy.
- Jong Kook,

1846
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,920
he is getting tired.

1847
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,620
(He exhausts his energy
by being flippant.)

1848
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,460
- Hey!
- He is breathing with his mouth.

1849
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,150
(Panting)

1850
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,520
- He is exhausted.
- Let's go!

1851
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:35,690
Kwang Soo, why are you taking off
your clothes?

1852
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:38,270
- Kwang Soo, fasten your belt!
- Okay!

1853
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,120
Why are you taking off your clothes?

1854
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,560
- Hey!
- It came undone.

1855
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:43,960
What is going on?

1856
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,100
(What is going on?)

1857
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,370
(It's time to stop playing dirty!)

1858
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:49,600
Kwang Soo!

1859
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,250
(Jong Kook begins to strike back.)

1860
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:57,440
Jong Kook, he is intimidated.
Look at his face.

1861
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,790
(Kwang Soo is intimidated.)

1862
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:00,020
He is totally intimidated.

1863
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,190
He is aiming for a tie game.

1864
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,460
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo. Hang in there.

1865
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,980
Here it comes.

1866
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,460
Kwang Soo!

1867
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:31,570
(Collapsing)

1868
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:34,030
(Jong Kook uses brute strength
to throw him down.)

1869
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:35,530
Kwang Soo!

1870
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,400
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

1871
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,900
- He is putting on a show.
- This is...

1872
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,280
(Kwang Soo gets folded up.)

1873
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,900
- You jerk.
- Wait. Stop!

1874
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,150
(Kwang Soo gets folded up.)

1875
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:48,110
You jerk.

1876
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,690
It's an airplane! It's an airplane!

1877
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:53,650
(An airplane flies by
while Kwang Soo gets folded up.)

1878
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:55,420
It's an airplane! It's an airplane!

1879
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,900
(He swore so loudly
that they could hear it clearly.)

1880
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,990
(He is saying everything
he wants to say.)

1881
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,820
You little punk. Come here.

1882
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:09,530
- My goodness.
- That's so funny.

1883
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:10,800
Good job.

1884
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,510
That's so funny.

1885
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:14,570
- Come on.
- Okay.

1886
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,570
(He attacks the lumbar spine.)

1887
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:18,780
He is kicking.

1888
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,650
I don't want to play
against this jerk!

1889
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,220
"I don't want to play
against this jerk."

1890
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,780
(There is nothing to be gained
by playing a game with Kwang Soo.)

1891
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,150
He is a lunatic!

1892
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:28,950
(He plays dirty
and kicks repeatedly.)

1893
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,650
- Oh, no!
- Kwang Soo, hang in there.

1894
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:32,590
- That's good.
- He keeps hitting Jong Kook's back.

1895
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:36,050
(Jong Kook finally manages to remove
Kwang Soo's name tag!)

1896
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,760
He wins with one full point!

1897
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,530
(Jong Kook wins
with one full point!)

1898
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,590
- Gosh.
- Good job.

1899
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,110
Why is it the winner
who always gets hurt?

1900
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,760
Kwang Soo, LFW. LFW.

1901
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,280
- LFW?
- Yes, LFW.

1902
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,970
Why is it the winner
who always gets hurt?

1903
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:52,650
What does LFW mean?

1904
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,170
"Lost but fought well."

1905
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,470
- LFW.
- I did my best.

1906
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,050
Say something to Kwang Soo!

1907
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,010
No one else would put up
with his behavior.

1908
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:01,150
(Punching)

1909
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,690
No one else would put up
with his behavior.

1910
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:06,050
(It's not over until it is.)

1911
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:08,950
- That crazy...
- He is full of energy.

1912
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:12,760
- That crazy jerk.
- LFW.

1913
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,090
He hit me for real.

1914
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,530
Hey, LFW.

1915
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:19,260
- He hit me for real.
- Okay.

1916
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,300
- Seriously.
- LFW.

1917
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,780
That phrase suits him very well.

1918
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,650
- Did you play Jenga?
- We destroyed Jae Suk.

1919
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:27,920
Did Jae Suk get shaky hands?

1920
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,240
We played it with this.

1921
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,690
I see.

1922
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,880
We will win this round easily.

1923
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,990
- Thank you for the food.
- They are no match for us.

1924
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:37,950
Thank you for letting us
play against Suk Jin,

1925
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,630
- the weakest member.
- But there is Ji Hyo.

1926
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:43,920
- So Min, I...
- You guys don't look so strong.

1927
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,170
The second mission is...

1928
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,900
Tubes on a Tangerine Tree.

1929
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,010
Pick a member
who will protect the tubes...

1930
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,940
as the tangerine tree.

1931
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:56,280
The two other members
need to steal the tubes...

1932
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,450
and put as many of them as they can
on the tangerine tree.

1933
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:02,280
You can steal tubes
from the other team's tree.

1934
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,190
The team with more tubes
on the tangerine tree wins.

1935
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,360
The winning team will get a chance
to check one member's card...

1936
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,010
and exchange the cards.

1937
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,650
Who won earlier?

1938
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:12,380
- We won.
- We won.

1939
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,950
Ji Eun, did you get to eat?
Did you win?

1940
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,050
- It was no joke.
- You are still...

1941
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,130
thinking about it, right?

1942
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,630
What? Did something happen
between her and So Min?

1943
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:23,070
- Nothing happened!
- We heard a lot about So Min.

1944
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:24,860
- We heard good things.
- I didn't do anything.

1945
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,900
Then why aren't you looking
at So Min once?

1946
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,110
- I am looking at her.
- She is looking at me. Come on.

1947
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:31,970
I heard there is bad blood
between them.

1948
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,010
- There is nothing.
- Check it when the episode airs.

1949
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,110
There must be a story.

1950
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,590
So Min, let go of your grudges.
We are on Jeju Island.

1951
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,690
- She has grudges.
- This is my first variety show,

1952
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:42,690
so I did as they asked.

1953
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,150
Don't do that, Ji Eun.

1954
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,300
I did it to give you
more screen time.

1955
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,420
Thank you.

1956
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,130
I don't know what's happening,
but thank you.

1957
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,490
Please pick a member who will be
the persimmon tree.

1958
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,900
Get ready.

1959
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:56,490
Set...

1960
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:57,630
You can go slow.

1961
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,110
You can take your time
in the beginning.

1962
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,630
- Ji Eun working so hard.
- Put the tubes on her.

1963
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,670
Go ahead.

1964
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:04,950
- I will throw the tubes.
- That's good.

1965
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:06,050
That's good. That's good.

1966
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,510
We got as many as we can.

1967
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:08,820
We got as many as we can. Wait.

1968
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,920
Knock out their tubes!

1969
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:14,320
(The awkward alumni meet
in front of a tangerine tree.)

1970
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,760
We just need to keep those tubes.

1971
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,820
(She gets past Ji Eun.)

1972
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:18,280
(So Min kicks.)

1973
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,530
We just need to keep those tubes.

1974
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:20,650
Hey!

1975
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:22,920
Don't kick!

1976
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,490
What?

1977
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:25,920
My goodness. My goodness.

1978
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,090
That was no joke.

1979
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:29,240
All right. Stop.

1980
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,940
- All right. Stop.
- Hey.

1981
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:34,380
(Ji Hyo runs somewhere.)

1982
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,840
(What?)

1983
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,840
(Why is she attacking Ju Bin?)

1984
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,900
Ji Hyo!

1985
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,170
- Ji Hyo!
- Hey.

1986
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:42,550
(Ji Hyo the delinquent
attacks the wrong person.)

1987
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:46,110
(Ji Hyo the delinquent
locks her head and throws her down.)

1988
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:48,280
- For goodness' sake.
- Hold on.

1989
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:50,110
Ten seconds remain.

1990
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,190
She is heavy!

1991
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:53,630
She is grabbing me by the neck.

1992
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:57,260
(Se Chan currently has 0 tubes
because of Ji Eun.)

1993
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,070
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

1994
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:00,570
(Ji Hyo is also struggling
because of Ju Bin.)

1995
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:01,570
Hurry up.

1996
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:03,590
- Hey!
- I will hold on to her.

1997
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,130
(Ju Bin is in Ji Hyo's clutches!)

1998
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:07,070
- Oh, no.
- Get your feet up.

1999
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,940
- 5, 4,
- Get your feet up.

2000
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,470
- three,
- Hurry up and stick them in.

2001
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,800
- two,
- Ji Hyo.

2002
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,400
- one.
- Let's go down together.

2003
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,650
Let's go down together. Come here.

2004
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:16,010
Come here.

2005
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:18,720
- Okay. Ji Hyo has five tubes...
- What is this?

2006
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,990
- and Se Chan has two tubes.
- How many does he have?

2007
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:21,650
I am exhausted.

2008
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,450
She cheated too much!

2009
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,320
- Seriously.
- Excuse me.

2010
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,880
Ju Bin...

2011
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,420
cheated much more.

2012
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,820
I... I...

2013
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,670
- She is so strong.
- You know,

2014
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:33,090
Ji Eun is so strong.

2015
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:34,440
Ji Eun is so strong.

2016
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,030
She is really strong.

2017
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,110
She must be angry at someone.

2018
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:41,070
- Guys.
- It's So Min, right?

2019
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:43,280
- You should make up here.
- You want to attack her, right?

2020
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:45,200
- She attacked me.
- Okay.

2021
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,670
- You must be angry.
- She attacked me already.

2022
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,510
"I haven't met my enemy in a while!"

2023
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:49,820
"I will show her!"

2024
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,320
(He adds a skit
to his made-up story.)

2025
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,990
- I understand, Ji Eun.
- She is so strong.

2026
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:56,360
Ji Eun's team can pick a member
and check his or her card.

2027
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,530
We will check Ju Bin's card.

2028
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,030
- Ju Bin.
- We will give you another chance.

2029
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:00,280
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

2030
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:02,700
(They decide to check
Ju Bin's card.)

2031
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,800
All right.

2032
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:08,070
(What's Ju Bin's card?)

2033
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,530
(They check
that it's the wind card!)

2034
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:11,570
For goodness' sake.

2035
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:12,610
They must have the same card.

2036
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,800
(Team Ji Eun members
school their faces.)

2037
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,400
We figured it out.

2038
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,050
You must have the same card.

2039
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,110
(They fall for the poker face.)

2040
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:20,150
It's the wind card.

2041
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:21,450
Then we will exchange two cards.

2042
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:22,950
Se Chan.

2043
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:24,240
Will you exchange cards?

2044
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:28,320
- We will switch Ju Bin's card...
- And Ji Eun's card, right?

2045
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,380
(Ju Bin and Ji Eun exchange cards.)

2046
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,650
Exchange cards.

2047
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:31,720
Then...

2048
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,380
Let's check it later.

2049
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,530
(Ji Eun originally hard...)

2050
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:39,360
(a blank card!)

2051
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,300
We don't know what will happen.

2052
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,070
- The rock card.
- The discussion is taking forever.

2053
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:44,240
- We have 2.
- We have 2,

2054
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,740
- so we need to give one to them.
- It's a technique.

2055
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:47,300
I will switch my card.

2056
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:48,740
Let's take our chances.

2057
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:50,240
That means...

2058
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,840
- I will switch mine with Se Chan's.
- Okay.

2059
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,050
(Suk Jin and Se Chan
exchange cards.)

2060
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,450
(Se Chan has...)

2061
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,590
(the woman card.)

2062
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,880
For a second...

2063
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,610
- I was about to take that.
- Okay.

2064
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:04,920
Let's check the cards. Come here.

2065
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,990
(Wind, woman, rock)

2066
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:08,050
(Team Ji Eun collected
all three cards.)

2067
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:09,260
Gosh, what is this?

2068
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,800
(Team Ji Eun collected
all three cards.)

2069
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,490
Are you satisfied?

2070
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,990
I guess this is a bit better.

2071
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:19,840
Let's move to the location
of the last mission.

2072
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,630
(Team Ji Eun completed their deck.)

2073
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,840
(The supermodels
are having the final match.)

2074
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,950
The strap is too...

2075
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:26,050
Come here.

2076
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:27,380
Come here.

2077
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:32,190
(Poseidon's tornado!)

2078
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,720
That's too...

2079
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,190
This match is too one-sided.

2080
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,720
- Help me!
- It won't take long.

2081
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,200
Yeo Jin is smiling.

2082
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:43,200
Yeo Jin!

2083
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,070
Yeo Jin!

2084
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:46,700
- Yeo Jin!
- I will take this.

2085
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,760
(Poseidon goes for the socks.)

2086
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,940
Yeo Jin! Yeo Jin!

2087
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,090
What is going on?

2088
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,010
- She ripped it.
- What?

2089
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,630
- She ripped it.
- Did she rip it?

2090
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,400
- Don't rip it.
- What is going on?

2091
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,840
Yeo Jin! Yeo Jin!

2092
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,380
- What?
- She ripped it.

2093
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:02,320
(She ripped the sock
with brute strength.)

2094
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,510
What is going on?

2095
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,050
Hey. Hey.

2096
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:10,760
(E Hyun's sock passed away
on Jeju Island.)

2097
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:11,990
She ripped it.

2098
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,220
(After ripping a sock,)

2099
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,220
Yeo Jin.

2100
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,990
(Yeo Jin takes the name tag
for one full point!)

2101
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:18,070
I got it!

2102
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,840
You won with one full point!

2103
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:23,300
- Okay. E Hyun, you worked hard.
- I am exhausted.

2104
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,030
Team Yeo Jin won.

2105
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:27,260
- You fought well.
- You fought well.

2106
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,670
- Okay. Whose card shall we check?
- Well...

2107
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,280
Shall we check Jong Kook's?

2108
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,570
- Sure.
- We will check Jong Kook's.

2109
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:34,240
He looked a bit...

2110
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:37,070
(Jong Kook's card is...)

2111
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,780
(blank.)

2112
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,120
- His card is blank.
- My card is blank.

2113
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,050
I will exchange mine with Haha's.

2114
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:43,880
- And...
- Mine with E Hyun's.

2115
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:47,120
(Jae Suk and E Hyun have
a blank card.)

2116
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,200
- Haha.
- Okay.

2117
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,220
Check the cards.

2118
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,030
(Jae Suk received Haha's card.)

2119
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:55,130
(What was Haha's card?)

2120
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,870
(A blank card!)

2121
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,740
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

2122
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:01,610
(Yeo Jin and E Hyun
switch cards as well.)

2123
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:04,170
(Yeo Jin got E Hyun's blank card.)

2124
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:05,780
It can't be helped.

2125
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,210
(Blank, blank, wind)

2126
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:08,840
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

2127
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,880
(What did E Hyun get
from Yeo Jin?)

2128
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:14,360
(Blank, blank, blank)

2129
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,190
(She got the bomb.)

2130
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:17,420
What is it?

2131
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:22,050
(E Hyun got the bomb from Yeo Jin.)

2132
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,860
I see.

2133
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,460
Okay, okay, okay. I see.

2134
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:28,740
- This isn't half bad.
- I get it now.

2135
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,070
I get it now.

2136
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,540
Please gather around in the center.

2137
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,280
You know,

2138
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,330
- So Min.
- Yes?

2139
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:36,830
I heard the news.

2140
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:38,450
Did it travel that far?

2141
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:40,950
Ji Eun said something about you.

2142
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:43,340
Ji Eun just thinks...

2143
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,990
that she didn't do anything wrong.

2144
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,620
She just thinks
that you have the victim mentality.

2145
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,080
Look at her facial expression.

2146
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:53,550
- We asked.
- We asked.

2147
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:54,660
She said it wasn't so clean.

2148
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,660
Something wasn't so clean.

2149
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,030
Ji Eun is clean.

2150
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:00,030
She is clean.
Her friend is the problem.

2151
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,660
- Her friend?
- Her friend is the problem.

2152
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,040
The puzzle pieces
are coming together.

2153
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,540
- Later on,
- That's the problem.

2154
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:07,940
you should sort things out
with Ji Eun.

2155
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,630
An airplane passes by
every four minutes.

2156
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,340
You can swear as much as you want.

2157
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:12,950
- Sort things out then.
- Okay.

2158
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,510
That's how it is.

2159
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:16,370
When your acquaintances visit
the show,

2160
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:18,340
- it's the most exhausting.
- That's right.

2161
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,490
- You know what it's like.
- You get older.

2162
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:21,080
- I am getting older.
- They know you too much.

2163
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:24,490
(An airplane approaches
and drowns out the audio.)

2164
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:26,360
So Min, now is your chance to speak.

2165
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,860
(She finally gets freedom.)

2166
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,160
(She brings up a real name.)

2167
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:32,160
(She gives the back story.)

2168
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:33,720
Don't speak ill of my friend!

2169
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:37,870
(Ji Eun counterattacks!)

2170
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:38,960
"Don't speak ill of my friend!"

2171
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:40,260
"Don't speak ill of my friend!"

2172
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,470
(This is interesting.)

2173
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:42,710
"Don't speak ill of my friend!"

2174
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:43,740
(A childish fight
between real friends)

2175
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,750
"Don't speak ill of my friend!"

2176
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:45,800
Hey!

2177
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,910
- Are you living well?
- The airplane is gone!

2178
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,210
- The airplane is gone!
- She is my friend!

2179
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:52,950
The audio is working.
The airplane is gone.

2180
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,660
Their fight is interesting.

2181
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:55,710
That was hilarious.

2182
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,920
I hope another airplane will fly by.

2183
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:59,620
Why don't we go to an airport
for the next location?

2184
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:01,550
I can't help but wait
for the airplanes.

2185
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,200
Please.

2186
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,660
That was so funny.

2187
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:07,290
- It's time for the final mission.
- It's the final one.

2188
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,870
One team has the bomb...

2189
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:10,910
and other teams are collecting
the cards.

2190
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:13,570
The last mission that will give you
a chance to switch the cards is...

2191
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:16,540
I Got Fooled
in an Attempt to Find What's Real.

2192
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,250
The game names are long today.

2193
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:20,170
It's the random game
in three stages.

2194
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:23,120
Every time you get past a stage,
you will win a point.

2195
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:26,820
One member from each team
will begin at the starting line.

2196
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,790
Stage one involves boxes.

2197
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:31,960
Out of the four boxes,
one has a water bucket.

2198
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,050
One person will be eliminated.

2199
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:34,360
The next stage involves
the vaulting boxes.

2200
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,700
Two are real vaulting boxes
and one is made of polystyrene.

2201
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:38,070
That leaves behind two people.

2202
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:40,400
One will get a water-filled ball
and the other will get a real ball.

2203
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,090
If you kick the real ball,
you get a point.

2204
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:44,300
If you score a goal,
you get two additional points.

2205
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,500
(If you score a goal,
you get 2 additional points.)

2206
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,940
You need to kick gently.

2207
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,740
- Yes.
- If it's the fake ball...

2208
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:49,940
- It won't go far.
- It won't go far.

2209
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:54,170
The team that places 1st
can exchange 2 cards.

2210
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,040
The team that places 2nd
can exchange 1 card,

2211
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,710
but they won't be able to exchange
with the winning team.

2212
01:13:58,710 --> 01:13:59,820
(The team that places 2nd
can exchange 1 card.)

2213
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,620
- One member's card.
- We need to avoid last place.

2214
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:04,790
This is hard. This is hard.

2215
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:07,160
Who will participate
in the first round?

2216
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,530
I will go.

2217
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:11,160
Okay. I will survive until the end.

2218
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:15,630
Jae Suk, just avoid the ones
you want to choose.

2219
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:16,830
I want to choose this one,

2220
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,040
- so I will avoid it.
- Avoid it.

2221
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,130
Choose well.

2222
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,630
Ji Hyo, it doesn't matter.

2223
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:21,870
I choose...

2224
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:23,370
number one.

2225
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:24,610
Is that your choice?

2226
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:26,170
- Yes.
- No!

2227
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,080
I chose number 1 although
I wanted to choose number 2.

2228
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,170
- Okay.
- You know what I mean.

2229
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,950
We need to do this.

2230
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,290
- I choose number three.
- Let's go!

2231
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:35,510
- I choose two.
- I will advance.

2232
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:37,010
- Okay.
- Let's advance.

2233
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,360
- Go, go.
- Jump!

2234
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,790
- Show us your jump!
- I will jump high.

2235
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:41,090
- Let's go.
- One,

2236
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:43,200
(Will Jae Suk avoid being unlucky
this time?)

2237
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,330
two,

2238
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:45,830
(In one of the boxes is
a water bucket.)

2239
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:46,900
three.

2240
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,630
(Who will get eliminated first?)

2241
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:50,090
- Let's go!
- Okay!

2242
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:51,630
(Ji Hyo is out.)

2243
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:53,240
- Three.
- Let's go!

2244
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,780
(She gets a foot bath.)

2245
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:57,080
Let's go!

2246
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:59,170
(Oh, no!)

2247
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:02,540
(Our team survived!)

2248
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,080
(Ji Hyo got eliminated in Stage 1.)

2249
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,150
That serves you right!

2250
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:06,820
I told you.

2251
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,320
Kwang Soo, I told you
that I wanted to choose number two.

2252
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,420
That's a good strategy.

2253
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,000
- I really wanted to choose it.
- You wanted to choose number two.

2254
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,460
Let's go. Let's go!

2255
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:17,960
Jae Suk, just go for it.

2256
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,370
- Okay. I'll go with number one.
- Oh, wow.

2257
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,130
I'm on a roll.

2258
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:23,630
You seem so confident.

2259
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,330
A man must be in the center.
I'll go with number two.

2260
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:26,410
Okay.

2261
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:28,170
Then I'll go with number three.

2262
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:29,940
- I'll show you how high I can jump.
- Okay.

2263
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:31,540
- Okay. I'll show you.
- That's good.

2264
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:32,750
All right.

2265
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,320
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Just go for it.

2266
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,870
- Let's go at once.
- Let's go.

2267
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:38,250
- Okay.
- 1, 2,

2268
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,010
- three.
- Jump.

2269
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:41,160
(1 of the 3 is made of polystyrene.)

2270
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,050
(Will Jae Suk be able to avoid
the bad one again?)

2271
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:45,360
- Jump.
- What could be the result?

2272
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,160
(Jae Suk failed.)

2273
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,400
Jump.

2274
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,500
(He picked the bad one again.)

2275
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,900
Nice!

2276
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,790
(I was a fool to get my hopes up.)

2277
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,540
Jae Suk.

2278
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,660
(Getting this far is a miracle
for Jae Suk.)

2279
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:00,870
I told you not to follow your hunch.

2280
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:03,410
- You can do whatever you want.
- You should've avoided it.

2281
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:04,670
I really wanted to pick that one.

2282
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:07,170
- Exactly. You should've avoided it.
- I told you not to do that.

2283
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:08,370
Nice.

2284
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:09,750
Nice. Good job.

2285
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:12,210
Oh, gosh. I have no idea
how to tell the difference.

2286
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,410
Pull this off.

2287
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:15,190
How do we tell the difference?

2288
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,880
- This time...
- Haha, did you pick that one?

2289
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,550
- Yes, I'll go with this one.
- Okay. Go ahead.

2290
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,330
- Good luck.
- Go ahead.

2291
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:22,030
All right. Ready.

2292
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,050
Get set. Go.

2293
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:25,900
(Who will kick
the water-filled soccer ball?)

2294
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,260
(Haha picked the water-filled ball.)

2295
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,130
(That means Se Chan picked
the real ball.)

2296
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:32,830
(If he scores a goal,
he gets extra two points.)

2297
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:34,500
Okay.

2298
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:36,610
(Se Chan scored a goal.)

2299
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:37,710
The ball went into the goal.

2300
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:40,210
(He made a clean shot.)

2301
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:42,170
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

2302
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:43,450
(Se Chan is the best.)

2303
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:44,840
- Good job.
- So Min, I think I did well.

2304
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,150
- You did well.
- Was it a real ball?

2305
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:47,540
- It was a real ball.
- That's awesome.

2306
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,820
(What a shame.)

2307
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:50,750
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

2308
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,690
- Let's go.
- You're our last hope.

2309
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:53,690
Let's go.

2310
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:56,460
- Ju Bin, you can do this. Let's go.
- Ju Bin.

2311
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,370
- I don't know what to choose.
- Let's go.

2312
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:00,870
- Let's go!
- I don't know!

2313
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:02,160
Which one should I choose?

2314
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,740
- This is the last round.
- This one was...

2315
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:06,000
- The box at the end.
- At the end?

2316
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:07,540
It was number two
in the previous round.

2317
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:09,440
I'm sure it's not the same box.

2318
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,470
- Okay!
- I'll go with...

2319
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,470
I pick the box that was the bad one.

2320
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,800
(Jong Kook picked the same box.)

2321
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,670
(But I already picked that box.)

2322
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:17,670
You picked the box
that was the bad one earlier?

2323
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,190
Sure. Go ahead.

2324
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:20,690
I can pick something else.

2325
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,160
- We have as many as four boxes.
- Just do as you always do.

2326
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,360
Okay. This one?

2327
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,960
- Okay.
- Let's go!

2328
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,220
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

2329
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:29,050
1, 2, 3.

2330
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:31,500
(Who will be eliminated
in the first round?)

2331
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,200
(Big Nose fell into water.)

2332
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,570
(Groaning)

2333
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,870
You failed.

2334
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:39,940
(Team Ji Eun failed in the 1st
round 2nd time in a row.)

2335
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,540
- This is ridiculous.
- I told you...

2336
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,330
I told you to choose that box.

2337
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,280
- No way.
- I told you to pick that one.

2338
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,410
I was worried.

2339
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:50,120
- It's hard to tell the difference.
- This is...

2340
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,320
- But...
- I'll go with this one.

2341
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,710
- I'll go with that.
- Okay.

2342
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:53,710
Good.

2343
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:55,290
Ju Bin, do you want to
switch places with Kwang Soo?

2344
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:56,460
No, don't do that.

2345
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:58,690
Give him a chance.
Ask him if he wants to do that.

2346
01:17:58,750 --> 01:17:59,990
Just in case.

2347
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:01,030
How about we play
rock-paper-scissors?

2348
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:02,960
Rock-paper-scissors

2349
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,070
- Okay.
- Switch with him. Good.

2350
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:06,370
- Do you think that's the bad one?
- This is a great chance for us.

2351
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:07,400
- Go, go, go.
- I don't think it is.

2352
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,400
- I think this is the bad one.
- Kwang Soo, go.

2353
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,570
- I think this is it.
- No.

2354
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:10,960
- Go, Kwang Soo.
- I think this is it.

2355
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,800
1, 2...

2356
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,630
- I think it's made of polystyrene.
- You should sit on it.

2357
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:15,710
Three.

2358
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:16,780
(Kwang Soo never gets lucky.)

2359
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,580
(Ju Bin switched places with him.
What could be their fate?)

2360
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,870
(Ju Bin fell.)

2361
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:23,040
Three.

2362
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,690
(The terrifying curse
of the unlucky man)

2363
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,290
(Nice!)

2364
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:30,990
- I knew it.
- She should've stayed there.

2365
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:32,380
- I knew it.
- I'm sorry, Ju Bin.

2366
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:33,620
- I'm sorry, Ju Bin.
- Se Chan.

2367
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,360
- You're a spy, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

2368
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,000
- You're a spy, aren't you?
- You did well.

2369
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:38,900
- Thank you, Ju Bin.
- Ju Bin.

2370
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,070
She shouldn't have switched
places with him.

2371
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:43,000
I knew it. I had a feeling
that it was the bad one.

2372
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,500
I didn't know. You did a good job.

2373
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:46,710
- Kwang Soo will fail in this round.
- Kwang Soo.

2374
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,470
This is the most difficult round.

2375
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:49,610
It's confusing.

2376
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:50,610
I think this one is it.

2377
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:51,670
This is the most difficult round.

2378
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:52,710
(Looking closely)

2379
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:56,250
(Looking at it won't make
any difference.)

2380
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:59,790
(Jong Kook chooses carefully
as if he chooses a protein shake.)

2381
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:00,790
I'll go with this one.

2382
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:02,660
- Go, Kwang Soo.
- Just kick it into the goal.

2383
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:05,080
1, 2, 3.

2384
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,160
(Kwang Soo didn't expect
he would make it this far.)

2385
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,420
(Will his luck last until the end?)

2386
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,530
(No way. He picked
the water-filled ball.)

2387
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,830
(Now, what's important is whether
Jong Kook will score a goal or not.)

2388
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:20,110
(If he scores a goal too,
his team will win the race.)

2389
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:22,280
(Will he scare a goal?)

2390
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,750
- They both missed.
- You unlucky man.

2391
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:27,780
(He missed a goal!)

2392
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,340
I got scared before I kicked it.

2393
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:32,950
I thought it was
the water-filled ball.

2394
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,190
Both of them failed.

2395
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:36,010
How could you miss that?

2396
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:37,380
I thought it was
the water-filled ball.

2397
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,750
- How could you miss that?
- I thought it was the fake ball.

2398
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,700
I got scared
and pulled my foot back.

2399
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,920
Each team won one point
every time they pass each round.

2400
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,290
The winning team is...

2401
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:50,700
(Which team will win the chance
to exchange two cards?)

2402
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:53,160
Team Ju Bin.

2403
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,440
(Team Ju Bin won.)

2404
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,080
- Oh, yes!
- Let's go around in a circle.

2405
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:02,250
(That's a shame.
If only I had scored a goal.)

2406
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,340
(Gosh. They're annoying.)

2407
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:06,190
(They're trying hard
not to show their emotions.)

2408
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:08,580
This is your last chance
to exchange your cards.

2409
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,160
The winning team, please tell us
which cards you want to exchange.

2410
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,860
- We will...
- We'll exchange...

2411
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:13,920
(They only need the wind card.)

2412
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,200
- exchange only 1 card.
- only 1 card.

2413
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,530
Whose card will you exchange?

2414
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:17,700
Mine.

2415
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,290
- We'll exchange hers for Ji Eun's.
- For Ji Eun's.

2416
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:20,330
- Mine?
- Yes.

2417
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:21,330
Whose for whose?

2418
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:22,370
(They picked the wind card
that Ji Eun has.)

2419
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:26,300
(They gave Ji Eun the wind card
at the second mission.)

2420
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,410
(And they received the blank card
from Ji Eun.)

2421
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:32,500
(So they knew that Ji Eun had
the wind card.)

2422
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,010
(They focused on Ji Eun's wind card
strategically.)

2423
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:37,370
(Ju Bin's blank card)

2424
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:40,410
(They picked Ji Eun's card
as they planned.)

2425
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:41,860
Give us your card, Ji Eun.

2426
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:43,360
- Give it to us.
- It's okay.

2427
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:44,620
That's not it.

2428
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:45,660
(Ju Bin had the blank card.)

2429
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:48,660
(So Team Ju Bin collected
all three cards.)

2430
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:49,900
- Here you go.
- Okay.

2431
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,900
(She's maintaining her poker face
just in case.)

2432
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,160
I can hear you.

2433
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,200
Everything went well for us.

2434
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,870
- This is hard to believe.
- Exactly.

2435
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:56,940
(Their strategy
worked out perfectly.)

2436
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,260
- It's unbelievable.
- Later...

2437
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,610
The team in second place, tell us
the card you want to exchange.

2438
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:01,830
We'll exchange mine...

2439
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,970
(Will E Hyun's bomb card...)

2440
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:07,450
(go to Team Yeo Jin
or to Team Ji Eun?)

2441
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:08,950
(We'll exchange mine...)

2442
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,580
for Ji Hyo's card.

2443
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:12,120
(They'll exchange E Hyun's bomb card
for Ji Hyo's rock card.)

2444
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:13,650
Okay.

2445
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:14,960
Can they exchange another card?

2446
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:16,790
They can exchange
only one card, right?

2447
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,530
(We're done for.)

2448
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:22,920
(Maintaining his poker face
is pointless.)

2449
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:25,660
- Why did they all take our cards?
- Why did you do that?

2450
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:26,920
Our team...

2451
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,540
- Did we do something wrong?
- You know...

2452
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,240
All right.
The card exchange is over.

2453
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:33,410
Reveal your cards
starting with Team Ju Bin.

2454
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,630
- You go first.
- Let's do it.

2455
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:35,710
- We go first?
- Yes.

2456
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,080
- Must we do this?
- Yes.

2457
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,870
- Se Chan nagged us to do this.
- Just this once.

2458
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:39,950
Let's give it a try.

2459
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:41,510
The hilarious Rock.

2460
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:43,120
The best in the universe, Woman.

2461
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,410
The fist beauty, Wind.

2462
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:46,150
- We succeeded.
- We succeeded.

2463
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:48,460
- We succeeded.
- We succeeded.

2464
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:51,050
(They look cheerful like the cast
of "TV Kindergarten".)

2465
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,330
We did a perfect job.

2466
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:55,590
It's awesome.

2467
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:56,920
(This is so annoying.)

2468
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:57,960
What?

2469
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:01,540
(The three of them worked hard
but only helped another team win.)

2470
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,960
We got lucky only in the beginning.

2471
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,260
- Awesome.
- See?

2472
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,300
Those comments were so neat.

2473
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,830
Look how they're whispering
to each other.

2474
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,440
They all look upset.

2475
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:12,080
They're just jealous.

2476
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,410
They're jealous.

2477
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:14,970
The next team,
please reveal your cards.

2478
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:16,150
- I have the bomb card.
- Okay.

2479
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:17,280
- They'll get the penalty.
- We lost our cards.

2480
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,380
They took our cards.

2481
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:21,080
They were the first team we met.

2482
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,320
The winning team
of the first part...

2483
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,360
of The Jeju Island Special is
Team Ju Bin.

2484
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,290
(Team Ju Bin won.)

2485
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,220
- The winning team will receive...
- We won!

2486
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:33,920
top quality Jeju Island's black pork
gift sets.

2487
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,130
(Jeju Island's black pork gift sets)

2488
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,000
Oh, my. That's amazing.

2489
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,660
I bet the meat has gone bad.

2490
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:39,870
Thank you.

2491
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:41,800
- Thank you.
- Oh, my.

2492
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,830
It's heavy.

2493
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:44,280
I've never won before.

2494
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,250
Now, I'll reveal today's penalty.

2495
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,340
Okay. What is it?

2496
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:48,670
- The penalty is...
- Yes.

2497
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:50,780
You will be slapped on the forehead
with a wet hand.

2498
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:52,380
- That's easy.
- It's not a harsh one.

2499
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,690
It's time for Suk Jin...

2500
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:57,160
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

2501
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,580
I need to temper my hand...

2502
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:00,250
- by repeating wetting and drying.
- Tempering your hand?

2503
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:01,550
- Like this.
- Jae Suk.

2504
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:03,330
- Dry it in Jeju Island's breeze.
- Of course.

2505
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:04,760
Of course, I use the breeze.

2506
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:06,530
You must know
what you've done wrong.

2507
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:10,260
(Welcome, wet hand slap.)

2508
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,710
(It's as refreshing
as Jeju Island's scenery.)

2509
01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:14,160
Let's hear how they feel
about being on the show.

2510
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:17,040
It was nice to get some fresh air
since it's been a while.

2511
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,870
- Exactly.
- That's right.

2512
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:21,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your help.

2513
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:23,750
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job.
