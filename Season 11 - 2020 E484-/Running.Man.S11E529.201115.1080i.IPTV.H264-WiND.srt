1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,250
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,430
Look at the fall leaves over there.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,830
I think the fall foliage
peaks this week.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,200
I know. It's beautiful.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,960
- It's chilly now.
- They are the best this week.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,890
- But it's quite warm.
- It looks amazing.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,790
Your boots are too much.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,660
- Gosh, I knew you'd say that.
- For this season.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,140
It's too soon
to wear boots like them.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,870
The most awkward part
of So Min's outfit is her boots.

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,680
I know. Why are you wearing them?

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,710
The edges of the boots are folded
around her knees.

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,250
Around her knees,

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,340
- they are wrinkled.
- You're bleeding on your knees.

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,240
So Min is standing
at the end for a reason.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,190
So stop pointing that out.

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,330
- Why are you trying to stop us?
- When a dog wears shoes,

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,520
it walks awkwardly.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,800
I'm just like that.
I feel awkward in the boots.

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,490
You look like a kid at an elementary
school entrance ceremony.

21
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,700
That's right. I'm dressed like this
to attend an entrance ceremony.

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,700
(That's right. I'm dressed like this
to attend an entrance ceremony.)

23
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,700
I'm dressed like this
to attend an entrance ceremony.

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,440
I see. That's good.

25
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,010
When he says that...

26
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,700
- You should attack him.
- I have nothing to say.

27
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,510
- I... By the way...
- Say something to attack him.

28
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,910
- Suk Jin, you should hit back.
- Is that what you're doing?

29
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,980
Suk Jin! My gosh.

30
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,870
That's what I thought
when I put these on.

31
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,870
That's perfect.

32
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,540
I'm very grateful.

33
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,910
I was right about that.
I got it right.

34
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,350
Suk Jin read your mind.

35
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,050
Suk Jin is good.

36
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,960
- Suk Jin...
- This isn't what he wanted.

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,730
- Just let it go.
- Hey, Se Chan.

38
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,100
Suk Jin is really mean.

39
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,430
He got flustered by what I said.

40
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,930
Then he checked Se Chan's outfit.

41
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,430
(He changed his target.)

42
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,660
(As soon as he failed
to attack Jae Suk,)

43
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,600
(he glanced at Se Chan
to pick on him.)

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,800
(And he got caught right away.)

45
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,570
(He leered at Se Chan
to change his target.)

46
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,210
Do you know why
he didn't say anything?

47
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,600
His shirt is similar to mine.

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,620
- It has a similar pattern.
- He's right.

49
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,990
I was going to say something,
but it looked just like mine.

50
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,320
He wanted to criticize
Se Chan instead.

51
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,120
It's like looking into a mirror.

52
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,880
The weather is
very nice today, isn't it?

53
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,730
Since fall is the season
of gastronomy,

55
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,430
you're going to enjoy
tasty food today.

56
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,600
- Okay.
- Nice.

57
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,960
And we have six guests...

58
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,290
whom we want to have a meal with.

59
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,070
- Gosh, six guests?
- Yes.

60
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,570
- We will...
- What? There's Bomi.

61
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,930
I really wanted to eat with her.

62
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,010
Bomi.

63
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,270
- There's Namjoo.
- Namjoo.

64
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,980
- Hello.
- She's Namjoo.

65
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,570
- Namjoo?
- It's Apink!

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,580
(Running Man's family, Apink
is here to have a meal together.)

67
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,320
(Namjoo got her wings
with her solo, "Bird".)

68
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,160
(Bomi is a charming girl
with a good appetite.)

69
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,880
(Welcome, guys!)

70
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

71
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,820
We just showed up
out of nowhere, right?

72
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,100
That's why it's so good
to see you.

73
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,420
- Namjoo.
- Hello.

74
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,700
- Nice to meet you.
- Namjoo.

75
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,160
- Bomi.
- It's been a long time.

76
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,290
They are gourmets.

77
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,630
Bomi, don't you think
this is too straight?

78
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,880
I've gained some weight,
so I want to cover my face.

79
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,630
- I need to cover it.
- It looks like you ironed it.

80
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,070
How did you do that?

81
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,250
- Namjoo, how have you been?
- A long time ago.

82
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,610
My solo album was released.

83
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,280
- That's right!
- Oh, right.

84
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,510
- You didn't know.
- I know. I watched it.

85
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,080
You had something on here.
I saw you dance alone.

86
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,480
I didn't have anything on.

87
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,880
- You didn't?
- Why would you make things up?

88
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,630
Namjoo came to my gym once,
but I didn't see her afterwards.

89
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,630
- Maybe you told her something.
- You didn't go?

90
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,730
- She said,
- That's not true.

91
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,570
"I'll start working out."
And she didn't come again.

92
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,970
She's here as a guest,

93
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,360
but she's being scolded
that she didn't go to the gym.

94
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,510
Really?

95
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,880
I think people like her
seem more humane.

96
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,450
Those who say they will work out
and never come back.

97
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,070
- I didn't see her again.
- Isn't that humane?

98
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,170
- She is indeed humane.
- Right.

99
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,570
Here are our next guests.

100
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,450
I guess we're having
guests with a good appetite.

101
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,290
- It's Mingyu.
- SEVENTEEN.

102
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,980
Welcome. How have you been?

103
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,380
Have you been doing well?

104
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,000
(Hoshi and Mingyu of SEVENTEEN
are back with "Home;Run".)

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,630
(SEVENTEEN is so popular
that they have no time to eat.)

106
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,820
(So the two members are joining
Running Man as representatives.)

107
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,970
(It's nice to see you.)

108
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,970
- All right.
- Mingyu...

109
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,040
- has been in our show many times.
- Right.

110
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,510
But this is the first time
for Hoshi.

111
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,540
- Right?
- Yes.

112
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,600
It's been so long since I met
Hoshi in "Sugar Man".

113
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,410
- In "Sugar Man"...
- I didn't appear in "Sugar Man".

114
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,880
- Gosh, he wasn't there.
- Why are you confused?

115
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,790
- Because...
- He's becoming like Suk Jin.

116
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,790
SEVENTEEN has a lot of members,
so I thought I met Hoshi.

117
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,850
But you weren't there.

118
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,030
Things are not going well
for you today.

119
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,100
- It's okay. Cheer up!
- Cheer up!

120
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,360
- Good luck.
- Get your energy up!

121
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,760
It can happen.

122
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,470
Let's bring in the next guests.
They are the last team.

123
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,970
We have a lot of guests today.

124
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,070
(Who are the last guests
to eat with the members?)

125
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,070
(Laughing)

126
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,230
What is it?

127
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,940
(They burst into laughter
as soon as the guests show up.)

128
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,570
Hello.

129
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,050
- What are you doing here?
- What's happening?

130
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,950
- Hello!
- Hello.

131
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,690
It's Soo-DRAGON.

132
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,880
- What are you doing here?
- Soo Yong is perfect for this.

133
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,580
- Chang Hee.
- Okay.

134
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,360
Okay. He's here.

135
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,020
Gosh. As they showed up...

136
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,720
right after Mingyu and Hoshi,
it's really...

137
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,130
- It feels heavy.
- It is heavy.

138
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,570
Soo Yong and I debuted together
at "KBS College Comedy Contest".

139
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,070
He was number one in Yeouido.

140
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,700
Right. He went
to Yeouido High School.

141
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,110
- Yes.
- He grabbed Jae Suk's shoulder.

142
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,880
It's not that he was
number one at his school.

143
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,970
He says he was a good fighter,

144
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,180
but it's not like there's...

145
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,270
a famous story about that.

146
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,580
I think he was
just a worthless scamp.

147
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,050
I didn't know that about Soo Yong.

148
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,510
- All right.
- My gosh.

149
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,820
How could he do that to Jae Suk?

150
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,200
- To Jae Suk...
- Actually,

151
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,260
he's always treated me like this
since our debut.

152
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,670
- Because he's older.
- When I talk a lot,

153
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,940
he always does this.

154
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,260
All right. Good.

155
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,570
If you don't have anything to say,
we will move on.

156
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,380
I don't have much to say.

157
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,510
Okay.

158
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,180
- We're moving on.
- All right then.

159
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,200
We've moved on.

160
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,180
All right. Every time...

161
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,770
Bomi joined us,
she showed her kicks.

162
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,320
I don't know if she'd do it today.

163
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,550
I want her to kick Soo Yong.

164
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,710
I think Soo Yong is ready.

165
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,780
- Right.
- He can give it a try.

166
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,780
Are you going to be okay?

167
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,080
Are you really okay?

168
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,130
- About getting kicked?
- Yes.

169
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,150
- In the buttocks.
- It's her signature.

170
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,150
It's her signature.

171
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,450
All of a sudden?

172
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,450
(Bomi is under a lot of pressure.)

173
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,930
- We all experienced it once.
- I can do that.

174
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,200
- Are you okay with it?
- Sure.

175
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,530
As far as I know, he's very strong.

176
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,630
Sure. He looks strong.

177
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,770
Are you really okay with this?

178
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,110
Yes. It's no problem.

179
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,570
Can I hit you after you hit me?

180
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,250
- What are you talking about?
- What?

181
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,820
- That's not what we're doing.
- How could you...

182
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,880
- How could you clench your fist?
- That's not it.

183
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,990
- That's not it.
- That's not what you're doing.

184
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,580
It won't take long.

185
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,820
- It just stings.
- With your foot?

186
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,190
- Where? In the buttocks?
- Look straight ahead.

187
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,360
Are you going
to do this at full strength?

188
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Yes.

189
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,800
Soo Yong was quite famous
in Yeouido High School too.

190
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,930
- I know. He really was.
- All right.

191
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,530
(Will he be able
to put up with Bomi's kick?)

192
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,530
(Groaning)

193
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,130
(The legend of Yeouido High School
groans like a weak person.)

194
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,950
(A scamp from Yeouido collapses.)

195
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,140
Did you hear his short holler?

196
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,450
Soo Yong doesn't usually
react much to anyone.

197
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,580
- But not to this.
- Yes, this is the first I've seen.

198
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,060
Thank you, Bomi.

199
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,320
Soo Yong doesn't react.

200
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,380
This is the first
I've ever seen a reaction.

201
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,720
You're the only one
who made him react.

202
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,950
Are you okay?

203
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,260
- That was good.
- Yes, it was fun.

204
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,320
(Bomi's single blow made everyone
laugh at Soo Yong's reaction.)

205
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,800
Before I explain the rules to you,

206
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,670
- we'll decide on the teams.
- All right.

207
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,700
- So there are teams.
- We'll divide you into three teams.

208
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,170
Each guest has already teamed up
with the person they came with.

209
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,740
- I see.
- Oh, really?

210
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,340
Now they'll decide
who's going to be on their teams.

211
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,970
Each team will pick a card...

212
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,950
to decide the order
of picking their members.

213
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,820
They will take turns to choose one
they want on their team.

214
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,650
(The result of fixing the order)

215
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,690
1, 2, and 3.

216
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,760
Starting there,
you will take turns...

217
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,260
to choose a member for your team.

218
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,260
We will choose...

219
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,020
Jeon So Min.

220
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,800
(My goodness)

221
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,130
She's grinning.

222
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,390
- She's smiling like this again.
- Yes, because she's so excited.

223
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,960
She doesn't know
how to hide her feelings.

224
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,130
Yes, every week.

225
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,880
- Hoshi and Mingyu picked her.
- She's excited.

226
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
Who's next?

227
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,970
We will choose...

228
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,840
(Who will be picked
by Bomi and Namjoo of Apink?)

229
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,210
- Jong Kook!
- Okay!

230
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,510
(They chose Jong Kook.)

231
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,490
- Jong Kook eats well.
- Thank you.

232
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,420
- He eats a lot.
- They want to win.

233
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,580
- Yes, they want to win.
- I can eat a lot.

234
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,950
Okay, next.

235
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,130
I will pick...

236
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,560
(Soo Yong and Chang Hee
will pick...)

237
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,220
(They're whispering to each other
like it's difficult to decide.)

238
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,570
(They chose Jae Suk!)

239
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,700
- We choose Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

240
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,070
(The scamp kicks Jae Suk's butt
to chose him.)

241
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,740
- Why would you pick me?
- Jae Suk.

242
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,110
I'm not good at talking
so we need you.

243
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,700
- This is crazy.
- We need you.

244
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,920
Okay, next.

245
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,270
We will choose Se Chan.

246
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,880
- Okay.
- Se Chan!

247
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,710
She doesn't like it though.

248
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,620
- I don't want him.
- You don't?

249
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,060
I don't want to team up with him.

250
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,490
You don't want her being happy
on their team, do you?

251
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,950
- Go get her.
- I'll ruin everything for you.

252
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,590
- Come on. Why?
- Just get lost!

253
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,640
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Don't!

254
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,900
Hey, hey, hey. Don't!

255
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,270
(Mingyu and Hoshi got a shield!)

256
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,970
Now it's Namjoo and Bomi's turn.

257
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,150
(She has to choose between Suk Jin,
Ji Hyo, Haha, and Kwang Soo.)

258
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,240
We choose Haha.

259
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,610
- Oh, yes!
- Yes!

260
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,150
I wanted to team up with you!

261
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,390
(Haha leaves with a cheer.)

262
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,080
(It's Soo Yong and Chang Hee's turn
to pick among the remaining three.)

263
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,820
- Who will you choose?
- What?

264
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,430
We will choose Mr. Ji.

265
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,980
- Mr. Ji.
- Hey, hey!

266
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,490
(They chose Suk Jin!)

267
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,570
- How could you choose Suk Jin?
- Hey!

268
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,270
- If you choose me,
- Is this a comedian team?

269
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,170
- we're 200 years old in total.
- You should've chosen Ji Hyo.

270
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,810
What is this, "Old Gang is Back"?

271
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,670
Why did you do that?

272
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,040
- You're all so old.
- What is it, a room for comedians?

273
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,070
Soo Yong isn't
good at talking to strangers.

274
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,570
- He's too shy to talk to strangers.
- Get along with the others too.

275
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,710
This is the worst team ever.

276
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,950
- Can I talk casually?
- Sure.

277
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,110
- No, you can't do that.
- Why not?

278
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,890
- You can't talk casually.
- Why not? Hoshi is younger than me.

279
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,750
- Don't talk casually. No.
- Why not?

280
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,080
- We should talk formally.
- Come on, why not?

281
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,160
Talk formally, all right?

282
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,400
These two keep fighting.

283
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,800
I don't want to be on this team.

284
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,360
She wanted to talk casually,
so I said no.

285
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,570
We are going to talk
formally to each other.

286
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,940
- Come on.
- Be polite to each other.

287
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,570
- He's ruining everything.
- Not today.

288
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,360
- Do not speak casually.
- Okay, now...

289
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,470
- Mingyu and Hoshi, your turn.
- It's our turn.

290
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,780
(It's Mingyu and Hoshi's turn
to choose.)

291
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,870
I choose Ji Hyo.

292
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,370
(He picked Ji Hyo.)

293
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,000
- Give me a five, Ji Hyo.
- This is great.

294
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,870
- You should try to stop Se Chan.
- I should?

295
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,110
- Yes, you should.
- Kwang Soo...

296
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,290
(Kwang Soo...)

297
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,020
(Ji Hyo leaves to join the team,)

298
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,620
(and only one member is left.)

299
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,750
(Deserted...)

300
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,200
Last time, he was picked first.

301
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,820
Last time, he was picked first
but not today.

302
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,930
(Left all alone in the corner)

303
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,640
(He comes in last
even before he joins a team.)

304
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,670
Hey.

305
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,770
Hey, Chalk.

306
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,570
- What?
- Chalk.

307
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,460
- What chalk?
- Blue chalk.

308
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,700
Do you want to be hit by chalk?

309
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,950
Chalkboard eraser.

310
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,920
Gosh, do we have to pick him?

311
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,970
(You don't want me?)

312
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,150
Why, because
you don't have an option?

313
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,480
- You want to have an option?
- No, we want you.

314
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,390
- Hey.
- I really like you.

315
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,660
Is it okay not to pick him?

316
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,930
Oh, come on!

317
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,320
Can Kwang Soo eat alone?

318
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,800
- Why would I do that?
- It'd be funny.

319
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,770
(Including the blue chalk,
they're divided into three teams.)

320
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,030
So today,

321
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,900
you're going to
visit old restaurants...

322
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,940
with more than
30 years of history...

323
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,500
to enjoy their food.

324
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,140
It's called Old Restaurant Race.

325
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,700
More than 30 years?

326
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,910
- We are the old ones.
- If Suk Jin and Soo Yong...

327
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,180
enter a restaurant,
that makes it an old restaurant.

328
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,740
- We are the old four.
- We're like an old restaurant.

329
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,870
- What does it mean?
- Old...

330
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,150
- Old restaurants.
- Right.

331
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,390
Since these two were
young comedians,

332
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,390
they were famous for
eating unappetizingly.

333
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,720
- Yes, he eats unappetizingly.
- I'm serious.

334
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,790
He also has a poor appetite.

335
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,750
These two eat
like the food doesn't taste good.

336
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,720
- I feel bad for Chang Hee.
- Serve them well.

337
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,820
When you look for old restaurants,

338
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,570
you should follow special rules.

339
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,170
First, please add up
every member's age.

340
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,910
- Seriously? Wait a minute.
- Gosh.

341
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,500
Adding up the age of you two
will make it 110 years old.

342
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,070
- I'm 39.
- And I'm 49.

343
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,450
Then it's 70, 80...

344
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,150
- Then it's 98 and...
- 198 in total.

345
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,710
- Our total age is 198.
- 198.

346
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,050
Yes, it is 159.

347
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,710
- 159? 159.
- Yes, 159.

348
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,150
- Se Chan.
- It should be more than that.

349
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,560
- 159.
- It's correct. 159.

350
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,850
I'm 26.

351
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,750
- Add up the age of you two.
- You're only 26?

352
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,790
(Add up Bomi and Namjoo's age.)

353
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,860
(Bomi is 28 and Namjoo is 26,
so adding up their age...)

354
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,030
It's 54.

355
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,140
Okay, 54. I'm 36.

356
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,910
- I'm 45.
- You're 36 years old?

357
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,310
54 and 36 is...

358
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,730
- You can use your cell phone.
- That's right.

359
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,940
- 54 and...
- Yes.

360
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,700
- Add your age to 90.
- 90?

361
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,340
135. Add it to 135.

362
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,180
I wish I could multiply by zero.

363
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,820
- You can't add up the numbers?
- It's 95.

364
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,980
(Team Jong Kook has a hard time
adding numbers of double figures.)

365
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,020
- You can't add up numbers?
- It's 96.

366
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,690
(Finally done calculating)

367
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,750
It's 177.

368
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,220
- It's 177.
- Okay.

369
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,030
We're the oldest.

370
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,300
- We only have 4 members.
- And our total age is 198.

371
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,720
Seriously?

372
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,590
It's 198, 177, and 159.

373
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,270
Until 3 p.m.,

374
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,410
you're going to have
meals at old restaurants you find.

375
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,470
Subtract the years of the place's
history from your team's number.

376
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,840
You win when your team's number
goes down to zero.

377
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,070
- What an original game.
- We should visit many places.

378
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,110
- But for us...
- It's tougher for us.

379
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,020
They should have
at least five meals.

380
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,580
Five meals.

381
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,420
You should subtract numbers
according to the rules.

382
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,160
First, you will find a restaurant
with more than 30 years of history.

383
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,490
You go through a mission to set
the order to subtract your number.

384
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,930
Starting with the winner, you may
subtract as much as you want.

385
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,540
So everyone still has a way to win.
Okay.

386
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,700
You will go through
a simple mission...

387
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,440
to subtract the number of its age
from the member's age.

388
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,810
Through the mission, you will
decide who will subtract first.

389
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,150
And you may subtract
as many as you want.

390
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,210
(Restaurant with 50 years of history
1st subtracts 30, 2nd subtracts 15,)

391
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,570
(4th subtracts 1)

392
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,920
You all start off
with your real age.

393
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,240
I'll show you an example.

394
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,710
This is Kim Soo Yong's Age Board.

395
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,710
You may return the badge to us
as you subtract your number.

396
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,390
- Okay, okay.
- Until you're out of badges.

397
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,390
This one is Mingyu's.
Everyone has one.

398
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,590
Gosh, there are so many.

399
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,200
Their age difference shows
a page full of badges.

400
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,400
A page full of badges.

401
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,030
- He's as old as his father.
- We're at a disadvantage.

402
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,640
Except for the winning team,
the other teams will get a penalty.

403
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,700
Two members with most ages from
the two teams will get a penalty.

404
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,730
I know who will get a penalty.

405
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,070
(You should work hard to subtract
your age to avoid penalty.)

406
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,780
So we're all competitors.

407
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,180
(Catching a glimpse)

408
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,420
Yes, Kwang Soo is on our team.

409
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,950
No, I won't betray.

410
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,610
Everyone, get in your team's van.

411
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,480
- Let's go!
- Yes, let's do this!

412
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,320
- I'm hungry.
- Let's go, let's go!

413
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,720
- Let's have something delicious.
- Let's go, let's go.

414
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,250
Ji Hyo.

415
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,450
Jeon So Min,
I'm sitting at the back.

416
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,900
So Min, you shouldn't
sit at the back.

417
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,960
I know you want to
sit at the back, but you can't.

418
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,270
- You can't.
- Because of Hoshi and Mingyu?

419
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,300
(So Min wanted to sit at the back.)

420
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,900
You think I wanted to sit there
because of Hoshi and Mingyu?

421
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,910
- But you can't.
- Thank you.

422
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,730
- What are you talking about?
- You can't.

423
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,600
They should be
as comfortable as they can.

424
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,310
I understand why you picked Ji Hyo.

425
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,410
But Hoshi and Mingyu,
why did you pick Se Chan?

426
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,370
- It'll be easier when they have me.
- He's funny.

427
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,190
- You think Se Chan's funny?
- Yes.

428
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,690
Yes, Hoshi thinks I'm funny.

429
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,520
Se Chan, you know a lot of
old restaurants?

430
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,250
- Of course, Ji Hyo.
- This is good.

431
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,450
- Here's the basic rule.
- He's the best.

432
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,580
Hear me out.

433
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,720
(Professor Yang Se Chan tells us
how to find old restaurants.)

434
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,450
If you want to find the oldest
restaurants, here's where you go.

435
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,160
- You should go to Jongno.
- That's right.

436
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,360
And if you fail to find one there,

437
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,900
restaurants nearby have a history
of 50, 60, and 70 years.

438
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,670
- I can't believe you.
- I'm serious.

439
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,600
How many years of history do Jokbal
restaurants in Jangchung-dong have?

440
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,640
- Well, many years I guess.
- 50 years, at least.

441
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,700
And there are hangover soup places
near there in Gwanghwamun.

442
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,570
- They have a history of 60 years.
- How about kalguksu restaurants?

443
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,680
- I think we will definitely win.
- Kalguksu restaurants are old too.

444
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,150
Three meals will be enough for us.

445
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,870
- You're right.
- We'll be done quickly.

446
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,450
Here's a list of restaurants
that we prepared.

447
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,190
Please refer to the list.

448
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,660
- You may call them before you go.
- Okay.

449
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,750
- Let's go find these places first.
- This one looks good.

450
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,350
- Which place?
- Give me a second.

451
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,750
- What's the name?
- Wait.

452
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,200
They serve hangover ramyeon.
This is the one.

453
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,720
- Let's go there.
- Why?

454
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,170
- They have 45 years of history.
- Let's go.

455
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,570
Okay, let's get going.

456
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,600
Gosh, ramyeon restaurant
with 45 years of history.

457
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,040
My goodness.

458
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,470
It's good to have ramyeon
as your first meal.

459
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,600
- I love ramyeon.
- I love it too.

460
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,500
So we're playing a game there and...

461
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,420
- the winner gets to subtract age?
- You're right.

462
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,840
- If they have 35 years of history,
- Yes.

463
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,980
you play a game...

464
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,160
and the winner gets to subtract
his or her age as many as 35.

465
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,060
- I got it.
- But you should be...

466
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,580
- loyal to the team.
- Yes, you're right.

467
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,850
(They have the highest chance to win
since they are the youngest.)

468
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,990
I think we have a high chance
of winning.

469
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,590
I'll show you how loyal
I am to the team.

470
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,990
- It'll end soon.
- I can't wait.

471
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,170
So here's what we're going to do.

472
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,360
When we have meals
at the first restaurant,

473
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,540
I think we should even out our ages.

474
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,600
Like I said, I will subtract
Ji Hyo's age first.

475
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,070
Because Ji Hyo is the oldest.

476
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,700
(Old girl)

477
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,870
Ji Hyo, this is a game.

478
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,600
- I'm not saying you're old.
- But you know what?

479
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,740
You are old, but...

480
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,920
- I'm not trying to dis you.
- He's a little...

481
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,790
- condescending.
- They're the rules.

482
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,950
If you keep being that way,
three of us will team up.

483
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,350
- See?
- I might text Hoshi and Mingyu...

484
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,290
secretly to team up with them.

485
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,890
- Within this team.
- But you don't know my number.

486
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,250
- Who?
- You.

487
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,090
- What are you doing?
- I'm just saying.

488
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,490
You can just give me your number.

489
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,200
- But I don't know your number.
- Come on, Mingyu.

490
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,720
- Hoshi, will you give your number?
- Sure, I will.

491
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,330
- Mingyu?
- I will give it to you right now.

492
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,860
- You can, can't you?
- I'll give it to you now.

493
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,540
- Okay. Let's exchange our numbers.
- I'll give it to you.

494
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,960
- This is how we become friends.
- Sure.

495
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,000
So Min, why...

496
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,230
I need your number.

497
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,370
- Se Chan.
- What?

498
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,100
- Do you like tigers?
- What?

499
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,450
I really like tigers.

500
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,570
Thank you.

501
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,340
- Do you like tigers too?
- Hoshi.

502
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,820
I was born
in the Year of the Tiger.

503
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,520
(She uses her Chinese zodiac sign
to win his favor.)

504
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,710
I was born
in the Year of the Tiger.

505
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,930
I have a tiger tattoo on here.

506
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,400
I have a tattoo.

507
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,160
(The two women are so into tigers.)

508
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,820
Okay. We all like tigers.

509
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,900
All right.

510
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,200
- Do you like to eat?
- Yes.

511
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,830
- I love it.
- I'm starving now.

512
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,230
I was talking to Hoshi.

513
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,970
Why are you being so mean
to me, Se Chan?

514
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,440
- No, I'm not.
- Do you really like me?

515
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,540
Hey.

516
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,270
Stop that!

517
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,080
Why would you say that
in front them?

518
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,650
He's being strange these days.
He's trying to avoid me.

519
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,710
- Is he playing hard to get?
- Yes.

520
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,710
Is that because
you have feelings for her?

521
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,710
I guess that's what it is.

522
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,950
We are close friends.

523
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,390
Why are you avoiding me?

524
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,480
- Why is that? Why?
- Why is he avoiding her?

525
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,200
- So Min...
- Ji Hyo, I'll stop making jokes.

526
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
- She can't.
- When he's like that...

527
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,670
Hey, that's enough.

528
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,490
You can't say such things
when the kids are around.

529
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,170
Why are you raising your voice?

530
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,110
That makes me raise my voice too.

531
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,530
Do you think I can't do that?

532
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,610
(Se Chan's patriarchal voice
is perfect for the skit.)

533
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,470
If they become a couple,
it will be really shocking.

534
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,680
I'll attend their wedding for sure.

535
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,000
I will throw feces at your wedding.

536
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
You will?

537
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,920
Once our age is reduced,

538
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,890
the hierarchy in our team
will change accordingly.

539
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,360
If I get my age deducted,

540
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,280
- Then you'll become younger?
- I'll become younger.

541
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,090
- We become younger just as much.
- Okay.

542
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,200
- Then we will...
- Do you understand?

543
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
- You shouldn't feel bad about that.
- Sure.

544
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,700
- Is this it?
- I know this restaurant.

545
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,100
- Let's go.
- I know this place.

546
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,140
It must be delicious.

547
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,790
(What would the first
old restaurant look like?)

548
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,530
It says tear gas ramyeon.
It must be really spicy.

549
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,030
- Tear gas?
- Yes.

550
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,440
It must be very spicy.

551
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,880
Okay. Let's go!

552
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,610
- Okay.
- It must taste good.

553
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,850
(Tear Gas Hangover Ramyeon)

554
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,740
- This is it.
- It says "old restaurant".

555
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,150
It means this place is old.

556
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,420
It's been here since 1972.

557
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

558
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,620
Compared to this restaurant,
we're so young.

559
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,710
We are young.

560
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,690
- This place is older than us.
- I know.

561
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,750
(The restaurant was loved
by a lot of student activists.)

562
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,400
(It was like a safe house for them.)

563
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,750
(Its signature menu,
tear gas ramyeon,)

564
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,720
(is spicy and refreshing
with Cheongyang chili,)

565
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,790
(bean sprouts, and clams.)

566
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

567
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,000
- Hello. Ma'am.
- Welcome.

568
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,580
How old is this restaurant?

569
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,080
When did you open this restaurant?

570
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,140
This place looks pretty old.

571
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,450
I'm sorry for asking this
all of a sudden.

572
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,710
This restaurant opened
in 1972 or 1973.

573
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,780
- Then...
- And you've been here all along?

574
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,920
So it's been 47, 48 years.

575
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,710
Can we have some ramyeon here?

576
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,550
- What is popular here?
- I didn't recognize you.

577
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,980
I'm Yang Se Chan.

578
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,430
What is the best menu?

579
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,490
What's popular?

580
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,660
- The popular menu?
- Yes.

581
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,700
- It must be ramyeon.
- Hangover ramyeon.

582
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,020
Hangover ramyeon?

583
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,560
- Where should we eat?
- We will have hangover ramyeon.

584
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,940
- We'll take a seat.
- Let's sit here.

585
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,560
I'll sit between the members
of SEVENTEEN.

586
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,500
(The old restaurant in Sinchon
shows the time of 49 years.)

587
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,230
I can tell this is
a traditional place.

588
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,800
This restaurant was here
even before I was born.

589
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,200
Was it 1973?

590
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,950
- In 1973...
- It was even before I was born.

591
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,010
Right.

592
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,080
You're in the first restaurant now.

593
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,450
And you can order only one serving.

594
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,590
- Only 1 serving?
- 1 serving?

595
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,650
- Can't we eat it all together?
- We're done for.

596
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,550
- Only 1 serving?
- 1 serving...

597
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,160
Is your signature menu
hangover ramyeon?

598
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,280
- Yes.
- We will have...

599
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,360
- 1 serving of hangover ramyeon.
- 1 hangover ramyeon.

600
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,200
- Please make it good.
- Please make it big.

601
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,460
The winner gets to eat the food
first, as much as they want.

602
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,370
Good.

603
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,200
- So this is like the loyalty game.
- It's the loyalty game.

604
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,640
- I like that.
- I'll show you...

605
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,060
what loyalty is. I'm serious.

606
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,170
I'll relieve my hangover here.

607
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,640
I can't do this though.
I'm hungry now.

608
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,730
I'm hungry too.

609
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,000
Once you finish one serving,

610
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,680
you can deduct the age of this place
from your team age.

611
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,420
This place is 49 years old.

612
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,450
This mission is called
Rubber Band Game.

613
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,240
The person who gets more
rubber bands on the face...

614
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,690
- in one minute wins the game.
- On the face?

615
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,690
On the face?

616
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,310
This might snap.

617
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,630
It sounds difficult. I'm scared.

618
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,190
- Get ready.
- I'm ready.

619
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,430
(The first player is
the old restaurant expert, Se Chan.)

620
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,160
It's not easy for Se Chan
because of his mouth.

621
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,130
It might bounce off. He did it.

622
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,900
This isn't about time.

623
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,140
Like this.

624
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,200
It hurts.

625
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,230
You're flustered, right?

626
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,970
(The rubber bands are too tight.)

627
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,080
It must hurt.

628
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,650
- It must hurt.
- My gosh.

629
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,740
- It hurts.
- He's got fat under his eyes.

630
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,150
Se Chan.

631
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,310
This is no joke.

632
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,380
This is...

633
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,620
This feels really strange.

634
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,150
You have 12 bands on your face.

635
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,190
Should I keep going?

636
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,360
- It's been 30 seconds.
- My gosh.

637
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,480
- Hey.
- You look good.

638
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,550
- Your face...
- No.

639
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,090
- Se Chan, you should stop it.
- It hurts.

640
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,950
(They haven't seen anything
so shocking for the past 49 years.)

641
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,130
My goodness.

642
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,400
(Se Chan's turn is over.)

643
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,700
- Gosh.
- It must hurt a lot.

644
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,170
(It's not easy to get rid
of the rubber bands.)

645
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,440
Hang on. I need to put these down.

646
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,600
Wait.

647
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,840
5 and 6.

648
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,800
How do I look? Do I look good?

649
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,230
- Am I handsome?
- Yes.

650
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,000
- You look like Voldemort.
- What about your chin?

651
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,610
I'm done.

652
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,150
This is good for blood circulation.

653
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,150
Good.

654
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,510
I can feel that
my blood is circulating.

655
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,850
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

656
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,850
Ready.

657
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,480
(The second player is Ji Hyo.)

658
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,920
- You have...
- There she goes.

659
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,980
plenty of time anyway.

660
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,310
Does it hurt, Ji Hyo?

661
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,430
It must hurt.

662
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,390
This is tighter than I thought.

663
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,520
I know. It's tight.

664
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,200
- It looks painful.
- You should spread them. Good.

665
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,600
- 15 seconds?
- Yes.

666
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
That's the last one.

667
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,170
Ji Hyo. You're being hasty.

668
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,030
Gosh, Ji Hyo. No!

669
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,230
- I want to eat ramyeon.
- Two.

670
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,440
One. Time's up.

671
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,000
- It's done.
- Take them off.

672
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
Time's up. Grab the bands.

673
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,450
- You should help her.
- My gosh.

674
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,950
Ji Hyo, why are you trying so hard?

675
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,210
No. Please, Ji Hyo.

676
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,010
I think this is good
for the text neck syndrome.

677
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,980
(They discover the virtues
of rubber bands.)

678
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,420
Ji Hyo's record is 33.

679
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,750
- My gosh.
- The margin is only three.

680
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,430
- Oh, no.
- What's your record?

681
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,950
- It's 30.
- I'm going to eat ramyeon.

682
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,430
She put on 33 bands.

683
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,930
- So Min, get ready.
- If you want to do it...

684
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,520
all at once, you should do it
toward the end.

685
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,490
Should I do it slowly?

686
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,900
You can take your time
for the first 15 pieces.

687
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,960
So Min isn't that pretty.

688
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,300
(Staring sharply at him)

689
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,850
(Se Chan's biting remark
upsets the Rubber Band Frog.)

690
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,650
So Min, you look
like a painting by Picasso.

691
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,950
I've seen a person
who looks just like her.

692
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,190
There's a comedienne
who looks like her.

693
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,210
Stop that.

694
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,130
- I won't let this slide.
- She looks artistic.

695
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,050
I think So Min will win this game.

696
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,450
You have 10 seconds left.

697
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,600
It hurts!

698
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,900
My goodness. This is crazy.

699
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,200
Her eyes look funny.

700
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,700
- 5, 4...
- So Min, stop it. Please.

701
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,410
Two.

702
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,340
- That's it. Take them off.
- Time's up.

703
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,500
It counts.

704
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,970
Help me.

705
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,240
Help me!

706
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,350
My gosh. I thought
my eyes would pop out.

707
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,880
You thought
your eyes would pop out?

708
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,190
(Groaning)

709
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,620
(Rubber Band Frog is wailing
at an old restaurant.)

710
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,860
It hurts.

711
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,860
- It hurts really bad.
- That's true.

712
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,130
It hurts.

713
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,430
Do I have to go this far
to eat ramyeon?

714
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,430
How many?

715
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,260
(Rubber Band Frog is leading
with her record of 36.)

716
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,340
Seriously, my eyes
almost popped out.

717
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,840
I can't do this.

718
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,440
- I think I did it wrong.
- It really hurts.

719
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,440
Did I win first place?

720
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,840
Starting from first place,

721
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,000
you will get rid of your age.

722
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,270
- I'll...
- Are we...

723
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,610
- doing this openly?
- No, you should tell me.

724
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,650
Really?

725
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,810
- I'll...
- Okay, So Min.

726
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,120
Let me tell you one thing.

727
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,040
This isn't the last place.

728
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,450
- This is the beginning.
- I'll show you...

729
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,710
what loyalty is.

730
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,510
I can give you my age here.

731
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,660
Okay. Go ahead.

732
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,160
I'll show you what loyalty is.

733
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,480
- Ji Hyo, trust me.
- Okay.

734
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,700
- Seriously...
- I believe you.

735
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,220
- I'll...
- I wonder what she's like.

736
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,670
- I'm excited, So Min.
- Seriously.

737
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,260
We have 49 years.

738
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,900
- So I'll...
- 30 years?

739
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,700
No. I'll remove only 10 years.

740
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,530
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

741
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,610
(Really?)

742
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,270
What's with So Min?

743
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,640
- Okay.
- Hey.

744
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,950
I can't betray you guys forever.

745
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,880
- It's not...
- This is nice. I like the peace.

746
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,040
Hang on. I can
get rid of a lot of my age then.

747
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,890
- What?
- 30?

748
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,150
Here's 10.

749
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,650
So Min deducted 10 years.

750
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,190
Of course. This is...

751
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,620
Ji Hyo, you're up.

752
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,450
- Deduct as many as you can.
- You have 39 years left.

753
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,520
(The age that's left is 39.)

754
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,950
Okay. I'll deduct 20 years.

755
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,220
If I deduct 20 years,
and if he deducts 10...

756
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,630
Then we have only 19 years left.

757
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,900
Ji Hyo is 20 now.

758
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,760
Then Ji Hyo is
the youngest one here.

759
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,340
I'll be harsh
on the youngest member.

760
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,600
I've warned you.

761
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,140
We've already talked about
the age and hierarchy.

762
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,440
- I'm shaking.
- I'll scold her.

763
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,500
If I don't do this,

764
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,880
I'm 100 percent sure
Se Chan will do it.

765
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm sure Se Chan will
use up all the age.

766
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,510
- I'm very positive.
- I won't do that.

767
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,950
So I tried to show you.
You wouldn't believe me.

768
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,280
I want to do this in secret.

769
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,090
Se Chan, it's your turn.

770
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,090
(He's doing it secretly
after talking about loyalty.)

771
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,480
- I know what's going on.
- Even if you do it secretly...

772
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,020
I can tell what's going on.

773
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,860
Hoshi and Mingyu are next.

774
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,830
(The age he can deduct is 19 years.)

775
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,400
He wouldn't do that to SEVENTEEN.

776
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,790
He's just mean to us. Right?

777
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,370
See? Do you hear the sound?

778
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,800
He's busy taking them off.

779
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,640
I'm just counting them.

780
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,110
- See? He's like a rat.
- Hey. You rat.

781
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,500
- I'm done.
- Okay.

782
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,580
I did it with my conscience.
I figured out what to do.

783
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,850
I did this openly on purpose.

784
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,350
- I wasn't supposed to do that.
- You have four years left.

785
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,810
Really?

786
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,190
(Se Chan deducted
15 out of 19 years.)

787
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,450
I did it so you'd believe me.

788
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,780
You should remember
that Hoshi is up next.

789
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,020
(Hoshi's age
depends on Mingyu's choice.)

790
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,450
I'll just do this.

791
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,630
(This is real loyalty.
Mingyu deducted only 1 year.)

792
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,130
(Mingyu is now 23 years old.)

793
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,490
You're the last one, Hoshi.

794
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,490
- You have 3 years left.
- 3 years?

795
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,730
Good.

796
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,940
- This is huge.
- Give us ramyeon.

797
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,370
Give us ramyeon.

798
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,640
He left some.

799
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,000
- Is this the tear gas ramyeon?
- Tear gas ramyeon?

800
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,140
It must be spicy.

801
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,110
So this dish is 49 years old.

802
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,410
- I'll...
- We should know that.

803
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,920
I won first place,
so I'll take mine first.

804
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,080
I don't think Hoshi will need
his own dish.

805
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,310
I'll take some bean sprouts.

806
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,190
And she took some clams.

807
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,280
And kimchi.

808
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,620
Okay. Kimchi.

809
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,360
- I like kimchi.
- It looks good.

810
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,630
I also need some soup.

811
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,020
(She takes some soup
out of the bowl.)

812
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,600
Watch your hands.

813
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,160
Pick this up for me.

814
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,100
- Into your plate?
- No, into the bowl.

815
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,340
I don't eat a lot. It's okay.

816
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,790
- Is that it?
- Here.

817
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,410
Take this.

818
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,840
- What do you mean?
- Eat that.

819
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,180
Take this.

820
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,410
- What do you mean?
- Eat that.

821
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,970
Have that. This is for me.

822
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,710
(I see.)

823
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,970
- Thank you for the food.
- Wait.

824
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,240
Then Ji Hyo should
leave some for us.

825
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,650
- She should share that with you.
- You can share that.

826
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,710
This?

827
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,740
(The other 4 members
will share this together.)

828
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,860
That's cool. She sounds tough.

829
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,310
(Slurping)

830
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,950
Okay. So Min, I'll remember that.

831
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,980
Okay.

832
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,400
But when we eat...

833
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,220
I'm being generous. This is a lot.

834
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,830
- That's a lot.
- Here.

835
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,260
- So is this for us?
- Yes.

836
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,730
(Ramyeon tastes the best when you
take a bite of someone else's.)

837
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,990
- It's good, isn't it?
- I should remove it from the shell.

838
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,110
Ji Hyo, you gave them...

839
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,960
Ji Hyo gave them a lot.

840
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,380
Don't get me wrong. It has meat.
You can suck it out.

841
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,580
Don't get me wrong, okay?
Don't get me wrong.

842
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,110
(Se Chan gave the others
1 clam with a generous heart.)

843
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,350
- It'll come out. Trust me.
- So...

844
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,980
I'm not lying. Eat up.
It'll come out.

845
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,590
- That's it?
- You should give him something.

846
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,450
You have to decide whether to eat
the clam or the bean sprout.

847
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,720
I'm done.

848
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,360
It's really spicy.

849
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,100
I'm going to eat
some of the noodles.

850
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,290
- You'll give him the clam?
- It really is spicy.

851
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,560
I knew it. You're giving him
only the bean, not the stem.

852
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,170
Good. How do you like it? Savor it.

853
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,030
(The rich flavor of the clam
and the crunchy bean sprout!)

854
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,560
I could taste the soup
as I chewed the bean sprout.

855
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,880
- It's crunchy, right?
- Try this.

856
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,000
Taste it.

857
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,470
We followed the rule.

858
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,110
- You have something to eat here.
- Can we have a look?

859
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,880
Hoshi, show it to them. It's yours.

860
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,350
"Share even one piece of bean."

861
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,850
6 of us are sharing 1 bowl
of noodles.

862
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,120
- It's good.
- Indeed.

863
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,750
Even the bean sprout was
seasoned well, right?

864
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,430
I don't think so.

865
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,220
- Ji Hyo is younger than me now.
- She's 20 now.

866
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,330
I'm in my 20s.

867
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,660
Ji Hyo is younger than me now.

868
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,720
I'm the youngest among us now.

869
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,670
- Se Chan. Gosh.
- Yes, Hoshi.

870
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,400
Se Chan, why didn't you leave
more food for us?

871
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,730
I'm sorry.

872
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,500
It happened that way.

873
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,760
I ate only one piece of bean.

874
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,410
I'm sorry. But it's actually
Mingyu's fault.

875
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,470
- You did wrong too, you brat.
- I'm sorry.

876
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,850
You should've left more food for us.

877
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,770
I'll make sure you'll eat
more food next time.

878
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,120
You brat, how dare you?

879
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,280
Slack off at the next game.

880
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,040
Of course, Hoshi.
I'll do as you say.

881
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,890
Ji Hyo, did you enjoy it?

882
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,860
Yes, So Min. It was delicious.

883
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,130
- Ji Hyo, did you enjoy it?
- I really enjoyed it.

884
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,200
- Shut it. We're the same age.
- Are we the same age?

885
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,370
You two are the same age.

886
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,290
Treat me as a same-age friend.
Don't act like you're older than me.

887
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,490
- I didn't do that.
- These two are...

888
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,410
It's because I'm intimidated.

889
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,580
- Let's get going now.
- Let's go.

890
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,730
- Let's go.
- We're going to...

891
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,040
(Team Suk Jin with the total age
of 198 is leaving.)

892
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,240
Oh, man. This is unbelievable.

893
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
This is the worst combination
for a team.

894
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,540
We're all so old.

895
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,150
Why must we search
for old restaurants?

896
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,590
If we just eat something
at a convenience store,

897
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,950
that store would look so old.

898
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,450
Suk Jin, put on your seatbelt.

899
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,480
(The team of oldest members)

900
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,020
I'm putting on my seatbelt,
you brat.

901
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,050
(The team of oldest members)

902
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,720
Good. The third oldest member
should check it.

903
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,660
- Let's go to this restaurant.
- Why?

904
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,370
B restaurant at Namdaemun Market,
Jung-gu.

905
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,370
It sounds like an old restaurant.

906
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,260
- What food do they serve?
- What kind of food?

907
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,730
- Noodles. If they have bulgogi,
- Oh, noodles?

908
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,460
- they have naengmyeon too.
- They serve naengmyeon.

909
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Pyongyang naengmyeon?

910
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,680
It says
it's a 60-year-old restaurant.

911
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,880
Do you like naengmyeon?

912
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,150
Of course, I like naengmyeon.
I'm a big fan.

913
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,950
You can make the noodles
for naengmyeon, right?

914
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,680
How can I make noodles?

915
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,950
That's what Soo Yong's jokes
are like.

916
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,890
- I know.
- What else?

917
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,620
- Strawberry milk.
- How to make strawberry milk.

918
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,360
Make the cow blush.

919
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,860
(How to make strawberry milk:
Make the cow blush.)

920
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,860
So that you can get strawberry milk.

921
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,950
That's how you make strawberry milk.

922
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,660
Even his jokes are old-fashioned.

923
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,700
- Right.
- That's funny.

924
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,060
I used to make people laugh
with my jokes.

925
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,170
(I used to make people laugh
with my jokes.)

926
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,440
People would laugh so hard
that they couldn't keep it together.

927
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,300
Chang Hee is nice, right?

928
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,610
I haven't had a chance
to get to know him.

929
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,880
Chang Hee is much nicer than you.

930
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
(Chang Hee is much nicer than you.)

931
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,110
- That means he's really nice.
- I thought so.

932
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,610
He's really nice.

933
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,620
Soo Yong,
you know what I mean, right?

934
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,620
That means he's really nice.

935
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,390
To survive this long
without the ability to talk funny,

936
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,420
you must have a good personality.

937
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,550
- Chang Hee is nice...
- Chang Hee.

938
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,710
and perfect in every way.

939
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,160
- He's also hard-working.
- I see.

940
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,360
But he lacks the ability
to talk funny.

941
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,550
That's okay.

942
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,200
Chang Hee, let me ask you
a question.

943
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,930
- Sure.
- When Cho Sae Ho became popular,

944
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,020
you got a little jealous
of his success, right?

945
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,760
- I'll be honest with you.
- Tell me honestly.

946
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,490
I didn't feel jealous at all.

947
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,730
- Really?
- Yes.

948
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,170
- I was happy for my friend.
- Of course.

949
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,440
- I never felt jealous.
- There's no way he got jealous...

950
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,380
- Soo Yong.
- because he cut ties with Sae Ho.

951
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,380
(There's no way he got jealous
because he cut ties with Sae Ho.)

952
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,700
- They don't see each other now.
- Gosh, seriously.

953
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,680
- They still see each other.
- I'm going to meet him...

954
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,350
- after the shoot.
- Soo Yong.

955
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,480
Have you ever felt jealous
of Suk Jin's success?

956
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,780
Of course, I'm jealous.

957
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,780
(That's a given.)

958
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,160
(Soo-DRAGON won't hide
how he really feels.)

959
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,550
Why? You're jealous too.

960
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,550
Why would he be?

961
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,860
- Jae Suk, aren't you jealous?
- Why would he be?

962
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,450
(Jae Suk, aren't you jealous
of Suk Jin's success?)

963
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,600
- Why would he be?
- He became more successful than me.

964
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,720
You know he's more successful.

965
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,960
- I bet he's jealous despite that.
- No way.

966
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,610
What he just said was so funny.

967
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,940
When Kim Yong Man was popular,
I didn't watch his shows.

968
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,940
I know.

969
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,140
- Really?
- Yes.

970
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,000
- In the early years of my career,
- Yes?

971
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,380
although Soo Yong and I debuted
in the same year...

972
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,850
- You didn't watch his shows, right?
- No, I didn't.

973
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,950
- Of course.
- It because I was upset.

974
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,150
- It's not that I was jealous.
- You wanted to be on TV too.

975
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,590
I was just upset and afraid
I might want to be on the show too.

976
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,620
I understand.

977
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,810
- I didn't want to feel that way.
- You see, Jae Suk would...

978
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,130
If it had not been for "Talk Box"...

979
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,160
If it had not been for that show,

980
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,450
Jae Suk would be running
a business now.

981
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,930
(Jae Suk would be running
a business now.)

982
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,930
It's because he was cast on the show
when his career was precarious.

983
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,060
- It was... It's the same for me.
- That's true.

984
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,030
- I haven't come here in a while.
- Namdaemun Market.

985
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,960
I used to come here often
to buy stage outfits.

986
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,030
You shopped here too, right?

987
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,680
When we were younger,
we didn't work with stylists.

988
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,300
I used to come here
with other comedians...

989
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,650
- That's right.
- to buy a suit.

990
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,180
I haven't been here for a long time.

991
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,890
These stores must have been here
for almost 50 years.

992
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,810
- It's nice.
- We could complete the mission...

993
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,250
- in this area.
- Absolutely.

994
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,930
If we visit
a few restaurants here...

995
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,750
- "B" restaurant. We're here.
- This is it.

996
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,950
- Such places are hidden like this.
- Let's go.

997
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,020
I can see the history
of the restaurant.

998
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,290
(It's a popular Pyongyang naengmyeon
restaurant at Namdaemun Market.)

999
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,370
(The wall is covered
with the traces of years.)

1000
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,410
(The vendors have been quenching
their hunger here for a long time.)

1001
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,640
My, it's nice.

1002
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
That bindaetteok looks so delicious.

1003
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,950
(Crispy bindaetteok is a bonus!)

1004
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,310
They've been running this restaurant
here for 60 years?

1005
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,390
- Sanitize your hands, everyone.
- Okay.

1006
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,590
Let's eat something.

1007
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,450
- You're here now.
- Yes.

1008
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,780
- But we did some research.
- Yes.

1009
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,860
Three generations have been running
this restaurant...

1010
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,630
- for 60 years,
- Yes.

1011
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,260
but they registered the business
in 1984.

1012
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,290
So it's 37 years old.

1013
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,370
- Gosh. That's ridiculous.
- You can't do that.

1014
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,170
They've been running this place
for 60 years. Then why...

1015
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,230
But we don't have any evidence
to prove it.

1016
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,970
They've been running the restaurant
with the same name for 60 years.

1017
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,200
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1018
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,580
We heard this is a 60-year-old
restaurant. Is it true?

1019
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,740
It's 60 years old, right?

1020
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,620
In what year
did you open this restaurant?

1021
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,780
(Please tell us it's been 60 years.)

1022
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,710
My grandmother-in-law started
the business...

1023
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,210
around the time when Korea
was liberated from Japan.

1024
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,250
- See? It's been 60 years.
- Back then...

1025
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,250
You can prove it, right?

1026
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,720
- It's a family business.
- Exactly.

1027
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,460
- Then we...
- It's as old as Namdaemun Market.

1028
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,490
- Exactly.
- That's what I'm saying.

1029
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,100
Then to be fair,
we'll meet you halfway.

1030
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,370
- Oh, yes.
- That sounds fair.

1031
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,140
- Oh, I see.
- Then 48 years...

1032
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,460
- It has a 23-year gap, so...
- We'll settle for 48 years.

1033
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,140
- 48 years.
- All right.

1034
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,040
If you look at the owner's watch...

1035
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,000
- Her watch is from "R" brand.
- Why would you say that?

1036
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,270
- That wasn't necessary.
- I'm surprised.

1037
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,580
You could've put it this way.

1038
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,090
We can tell how successful...

1039
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,620
- this restaurant has been...
- Yes.

1040
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,120
- only by looking at the owner.
- Exactly.

1041
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,190
You can tell how tasty their food is
to attract a lot of customers.

1042
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,550
All your children
studied overseas, right?

1043
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,020
- What?
- That's what they usually do.

1044
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,600
Why would you ask
if her children studied overseas?

1045
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1046
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,030
- We'll order food later. Thank you.
- Okay.

1047
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,560
You can deduct 48 years
from your ages.

1048
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,770
We'll begin the game
to decide the order.

1049
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,970
It's Age Based on Physical Ability.

1050
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,350
You will take a three-step
biological age test.

1051
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,350
I'm not good at things like that.

1052
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,740
I don't have a flexible body.

1053
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,740
You'll be ranked in the order of
your biological ages.

1054
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,050
I'm not good at things like this
because I'm not flexible.

1055
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,550
- Same here.
- My body is not flexible at all.

1056
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,950
- I can't do things like this.
- Let's begin the first step.

1057
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,700
- Oh, gosh.
- Tell them how to do it.

1058
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,250
If your elbows are above your eyes
like this,

1059
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,260
- you're in your 20s.
- That's too hard for me.

1060
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,830
30s up to your nose,
40s up to your lips,

1061
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,370
and 50s if your face is invisible.

1062
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,140
- If my face is invisible?
- Take turns to try it.

1063
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,870
- You don't get to practice.
- Jae Suk.

1064
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,960
- Shall I go first?
- Okay.

1065
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,770
My body is not very flexible.

1066
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,230
- Doing this alone is hard for me.
- Exactly.

1067
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,270
Gosh, I can't do it.

1068
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,180
- Hey, that's it?
- His arms are apart.

1069
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,880
- Hey, that's it?
- His arms are apart. Look at that.

1070
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,090
(His arms are shaking,
and his face is not visible.)

1071
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,190
- I couldn't see his face.
- I can't do this.

1072
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,090
- He failed.
- You're in your 50s.

1073
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,190
- You're in your 50s.
- I'll aim to be in my 40s.

1074
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,050
(I think I have a chance to win.)

1075
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,200
Okay. I'll aim to be in my 40s.

1076
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,870
- Gosh, seriously.
- I'm keeping my arms together.

1077
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,460
- Right?
- Yes.

1078
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,140
(What could be the biological age
of the confident Suk Jin?)

1079
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,100
(Struggling)

1080
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,500
I think his biological age
is over 70.

1081
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,680
(He can't do any better
than Jae Suk.)

1082
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,680
(His arms went up 3cm
and stopped.)

1083
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,180
(Laughing)

1084
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,680
(I'll get to eat naengmyeon.)

1085
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,980
Your arms are apart.

1086
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,480
(His biological age is over 70.)

1087
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,680
(But he's still a teenager
at heart.)

1088
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,080
- He can't lift his arms at all.
- I can't do it.

1089
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,660
- You're in your 50s.
- It's because I'm not flexible.

1090
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,960
It's a piece of cake.

1091
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,250
- Easy-peasy.
- Yes, indeed.

1092
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,060
- You try it.
- You can just show your chin.

1093
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,020
- Exactly.
- Try it.

1094
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,370
Your lips are visible for now.

1095
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,230
His lips are visible?

1096
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,100
Your nose is almost visible.

1097
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,710
- It's hard.
- I think that's the best he can do.

1098
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,230
- The lips.
- Over 40?

1099
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,580
- Yes, he's over 40.
- Gosh.

1100
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,080
- It's Chang Hee's turn.
- All right.

1101
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,410
<i>Nam Chang Hee</i>

1102
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,370
-<i> I am Nam Chang Hee</i>
- All right.

1103
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,980
(Shaking)

1104
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,120
What's wrong with him?

1105
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,620
What's wrong with him?
His biological age is over 60.

1106
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,910
- Wait. Just a little higher.
- Hey.

1107
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,480
You're in your 50s.

1108
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,080
- My gosh.
- Chang Hee.

1109
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,350
I'm disappointed.

1110
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,930
I thought you were quite flexible.

1111
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,750
I can move fast,
but my body is not flexible.

1112
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,830
- You can move fast?
- Yes, I'm fast.

1113
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:21,060
- His biological age is over 50?
- You're over 50, 50, 40, and 50.

1114
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,500
- It was the first step.
- My gosh.

1115
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,060
- It was the first step.
- I can't do it.

1116
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,410
- Let's move on.
- You came in first.

1117
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,100
- Let's begin the second step.
- Why are my arms shaking?

1118
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,330
- It's jump rope with your arms.
- I can't do that.

1119
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,850
- What?
- I see.

1120
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,040
With your hands locked
in front of your body,

1121
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,250
you have to pass them
under your legs and hips.

1122
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,250
Pass them under my legs?

1123
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,850
If you fail at your feet, you're
over 50, at your legs, over 40,

1124
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,350
at your hips, over 30,
and if you succeed, you're over 20.

1125
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,080
Some of us have a chronic disease.

1126
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,250
- I have back problems.
- I was born...

1127
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,660
- to be inflexible.
- That's ridiculous.

1128
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,750
I couldn't do things like this
even when I was a teenager.

1129
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,390
I couldn't do it when I was
in the military either.

1130
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,100
- We're not flexible.
- Can we do something else?

1131
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,330
They're complaining a lot
because they're quite old.

1132
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,870
It's not like that.

1133
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,100
- Listen to me.
- Why won't you stop complaining?

1134
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,330
- Just do it.
- Fine. Let's begin.

1135
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,680
And then legs...

1136
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
(The youngest Chang Hee goes first.)

1137
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,730
Could he pass it under his leg?

1138
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,270
What happens if he succeeds?

1139
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,350
He's made it to the age group
between 40 and 49.

1140
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,410
(His feet went over his arms.)

1141
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,620
- He stopped at his hips.
- That's it.

1142
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,790
- Can't you pass the hips?
- Gosh, I can't do it.

1143
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,790
- You're in your 30s.
- I'm in my 30s.

1144
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,460
- It's your actual age.
- Yes, it's my actual age.

1145
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,790
I'm in my 30s.
This is how it's done.

1146
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,680
If you can't pass your knees...

1147
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,160
- If you...
- What is he doing?

1148
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,230
What is he doing?
Suk Jin, what's this?

1149
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,750
- Put them up!
- I'm trying to make them flexible.

1150
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,830
- That's an old-fashioned way.
- Okay.

1151
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,960
- I'll give it a try.
- I can only pass one leg.

1152
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,000
(One foot easily goes through.)

1153
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,230
- Okay.
- A foot is out.

1154
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,370
You seem flexible enough.

1155
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,310
(If the other foot goes through,
he'll at least be in his 40s.)

1156
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,750
Your hands must stay clasped.

1157
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,350
(Why can't you step over the hands
that are in front of you?)

1158
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,290
It's like watching a baby
walk for the first time.

1159
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,390
(With silly movements,
he falls to the floor.)

1160
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,890
It can't be done.

1161
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,910
Your biological age is in its 50s.

1162
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,980
- You try it.
- Unbelievable.

1163
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,250
But this...

1164
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,680
- My two legs...
- Just you wait and see.

1165
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,890
I may be stiff and have a sore back,

1166
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,960
- but both legs will go through.
- Gosh, this is...

1167
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,500
Since you're on the older side...

1168
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,890
- Your foot grazed your hands.
- Hold on a second.

1169
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,930
- See?
- You can't do it either.

1170
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,930
- He can't do it.
- No way.

1171
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:06,960
Jae Suk, seriously?

1172
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,080
What...

1173
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,480
(He was confident
up until a minute ago.)

1174
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,750
- He can't do it either.
- I should be able to do this.

1175
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,580
- He can't do it.
- No way.

1176
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,580
Jae Suk, seriously?

1177
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,350
- You can't...
- You worked out for nothing!

1178
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,480
My gosh.

1179
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,040
(He ends up
destroying the property.)

1180
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,560
Your biological age is in its 40s.

1181
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,350
- This isn't accurate though.
- I'm quite stiff.

1182
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,850
- This is about being flexible.
- I'm not flexible at all.

1183
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,250
But that adds
to your biological age.

1184
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,730
- One must be flexible for this.
- That's true,

1185
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,460
- but it's not crucial.
- Okay.

1186
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,560
- All right.
- Hold on.

1187
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,140
Is Yogi Daniels in his teens then?

1188
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,430
- Yogi Daniels.
- Who's that?

1189
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,640
He's over 60, you know.

1190
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,600
- This is ridiculous.
- Yogi Daniels can do this.

1191
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,430
I told you that I'm not flexible.

1192
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,480
(His mental age
is probably still in its teens.)

1193
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,540
Do I put my leg through?

1194
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,580
(Last up is Soo-DRAGON.)

1195
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,710
Both legs must go through.

1196
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,810
- Like this?
- He'll probably manage both legs.

1197
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,140
I guess he can't.

1198
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,310
Seriously?

1199
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,140
- Hey. Can't you do it?
- In some ways,

1200
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,520
this isn't all that bad.

1201
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,560
They're all just as bad.

1202
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,290
- This is a mess.
- There isn't much of a difference.

1203
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,200
In sports events,
there's the group of death.

1204
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,890
Meanwhile, this is paradise.

1205
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,500
I'm in paradise.

1206
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,270
Next, you will hold
the V-sit for 10 seconds.

1207
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,100
- Sit with your arms out front.
- Okay.

1208
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,460
- Lift your two legs.
- This I can do.

1209
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,810
Come on.

1210
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,600
See? Look!

1211
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,250
- No way. That's not it.
- Let's check our sugar levels.

1212
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,680
Or our blood pressure.

1213
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,540
- Blood pressure...
- Must we go that far?

1214
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,950
You'll shed years off your age
starting with whoever came first.

1215
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,480
Soo Yong, you're up.

1216
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,890
You won the game,
so take at least 15 years.

1217
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,960
You're on the older side,
so you need to shed a lot of it.

1218
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,160
Hold on. Soo Yong?

1219
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,660
(Nothing can be heard except
the sound of the Velcro tape.)

1220
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,060
I hear a ripping sound.

1221
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,700
- I know.
- Soo Yong...

1222
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,460
Do I rip off at least 12?

1223
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,810
6, 7, 8...

1224
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,660
You're still only at eight?

1225
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,270
It's all right.

1226
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,750
What's taking you so long?

1227
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,310
- How many are you ripping off?
- 12.

1228
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,640
- 12.
- Just 12?

1229
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,350
What took you so long though?

1230
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,580
- It's not easy.
- It seemed like more.

1231
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,350
- Am I next?
- I only discarded 12.

1232
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,250
- I'll tell you how much is left.
- Sure.

1233
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,810
I ripped off 12.

1234
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,910
(Soo Yong shed 35 years off
a total of 48.)

1235
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,330
- I ripped off 12.
- Are you kidding me?

1236
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,290
- How sly of you.
- Why?

1237
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,730
I'll shed off the amount I promised.

1238
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,000
- You know how much.
- 12 years?

1239
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,540
You've got to be kidding me.

1240
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,910
You're 20 now.

1241
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,270
- Not even Kwang Soo would do this.
- Exactly.

1242
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,330
The food's here.

1243
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,430
Thank you.

1244
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,810
In the order
you finished the game in,

1245
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,250
you'll take as much food
as you want.

1246
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,680
Take as much as you want
with your spoon.

1247
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,350
- I mean, with your chopsticks.
- Sure.

1248
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,680
- Pass me the vinegar.
- I'm dying to try some.

1249
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,350
(Soo Yong is up first.)

1250
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,520
I'll only take a quarter.

1251
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,060
That's considerate of you.

1252
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,580
But it's not much.

1253
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,790
- That's a quarter.
- You only get one turn.

1254
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,000
Sure.

1255
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,520
That's kind of you.

1256
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,460
This isn't something you see
on Running Man every day.

1257
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,640
(Jae Suk is next.)

1258
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,770
- Hey.
- What?

1259
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,870
Be considerate.

1260
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,460
(A heap)

1261
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,540
Soo Yong should've eaten more.

1262
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,600
(This is what we
normally see on Running Man.)

1263
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,210
- Take a heap.
- Can one scrape the edge?

1264
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,450
(He uses a ladle
to secure his noodles.)

1265
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,710
- There you go.
- Okay.

1266
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,390
Get some of the broth too.

1267
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,790
That I can give him.

1268
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,310
(Here you go.)

1269
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,560
Do you know why
he's being generous?

1270
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,850
He doesn't favor
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

1271
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,160
Unbelievable.

1272
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,600
- I thought he was being kind.
- You probably did.

1273
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,100
He's not that kind of guy.

1274
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,290
Let's try the broth.

1275
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,830
(Jae Suk is a well-known
noodle lover.)

1276
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:28,640
(Thanks to him,
the naengmyeon seems delicious.)

1277
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,750
(Meanwhile, Soo Yong is known
to make food seem unappealing.)

1278
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,290
(Just so you know,
this is him enjoying the food.)

1279
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,710
(Then there's Suk Jin who doesn't
like Pyongyang naengmyeon.)

1280
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,850
I can smell the beef broth.

1281
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,410
(Then there's Suk Jin who doesn't
like Pyongyang naengmyeon.)

1282
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,850
This is delicious.

1283
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,430
I'd like some bindaetteok.

1284
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,060
(I'd like some bindaetteok.)

1285
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,250
- Don't order him any.
- Of course not.

1286
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,700
You need to choose
your next destination.

1287
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,500
- We...
- Yes?

1288
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,830
- We had noodles.
- Since we had noodles,

1289
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,000
we should get some meat.

1290
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,040
Let's eat a meat dish.

1291
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,830
- Pork galbi takes long to cook.
- That sounds good.

1292
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,580
- It takes long to cook.
- What do you say?

1293
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,350
- Hangover soups.
- How about a hangover soup?

1294
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,870
What about this C restaurant?

1295
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,370
That's the one...

1296
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:15,080
where people from
the Kim Du Han era used to eat.

1297
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,210
- Then it's been around for long.
- The C restaurant...

1298
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,580
- opened in 1937.
- See?

1299
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,500
- That's the one.
- Let's go there next.

1300
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,750
- Since 1937.
- Just so you know,

1301
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,020
- it's nearby.
- That's right.

1302
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,330
(They call the restaurant first.)

1303
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,230
Hello, this is Restaurant C.

1304
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,370
Hello, it's a pleasure.

1305
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,430
- Sure.
- You see,

1306
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,770
we're filming Running Man,

1307
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,810
- and I'm Ji Suk Jin.
- Yes, hello.

1308
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,850
- Why would he introduce himself?
- Yes, hello.

1309
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,710
- She's not excited though.
- Could we perhaps...

1310
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,850
film there for a short while
while we eat?

1311
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,520
- At this hour?
- Yes.

1312
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,580
Let me ask my boss first.

1313
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,660
Can you leave your phone number?

1314
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,430
My number...

1315
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,020
(Failing to ask
the proper questions...)

1316
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,600
(leads him to revealing
his own phone number.)

1317
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
- Just a second.
- Say you'll call back in 10.

1318
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,560
I'll call you back in five minutes.

1319
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,160
- Sure, in five minutes.
- Got it.

1320
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,270
(The minute-long call
was fruitless.)

1321
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,140
Are you kidding me?

1322
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,950
Who calls a restaurant like that?

1323
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,810
- I got to the point, didn't I?
- But...

1324
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,250
- That's not...
- I got to the point.

1325
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,040
You should've asked
when the restaurant opened first.

1326
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,890
- We already know that.
- Ask what dishes they sell.

1327
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:20,960
Also, why...

1328
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,160
- would you reveal your identity?
- We'll have boiled pork slices.

1329
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,660
Suk Jin identified himself,

1330
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,290
but she wasn't that excited
to hear from him.

1331
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,850
- She didn't seem pleased.
- She was only being polite.

1332
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,290
That's what it was.

1333
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,790
I see you don't know.

1334
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,020
- "I'm Ji Suk Jin..."
- I'm sure she danced in joy.

1335
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,100
She danced in joy?

1336
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,270
She must have.

1337
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,540
She sounded calm,

1338
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,730
but she was dancing with joy.

1339
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,500
Suk Jin's hilarious.

1340
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,330
It's seolleongtang,
so how can it not taste good?

1341
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,770
- It's seolleongtang, right?
- No, hangover soup.

1342
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,100
- It's the same.
- With intestines.

1343
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,540
- They have it all.
- Seolleongtang?

1344
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,980
- Right.
- Then we're good.

1345
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,250
- Suk Jin can't eat those dishes.
- What?

1346
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,450
He can't eat intestine soup.

1347
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,310
- I can't eat clotted blood.
- What a picky eater.

1348
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,890
- Suk Jin...
- He...

1349
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,680
- He was raised like a prince.
- He's the worst.

1350
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,520
- He never ate these things.
- Did I have to be on this team?

1351
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,830
- Suk Jin.
- Clotted blood...

1352
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,100
It's too disgusting.

1353
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,520
Doesn't Restaurant C...

1354
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,620
have a kid's meal?

1355
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,770
He can have the kid's meal instead.

1356
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,200
Or we could order from
another restaurant.

1357
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,210
- We'll have it delivered.
- He's the worst.

1358
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,540
We'll have assorted
boiled pork slices.

1359
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,770
- Sure, let's get searching.
- Think about...

1360
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:19,640
- what we mentioned earlier.
- That's right.

1361
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,180
We can find many old restaurants
in Jongno and Myeong-dong.

1362
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,080
- Myeong-dong and Jongno.
- Right.

1363
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,080
Ever since the Kim Du Han days...

1364
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,290
Type in "50 years",
and you'll get a whole list.

1365
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,660
Toegye-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul.

1366
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,960
Guys, Restaurant M...

1367
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,430
- has been open for 50 years.
- See?

1368
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,730
- Let's go.
- Let's go there.

1369
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,250
- It opened in 1966.
- That's right.

1370
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,890
The food there is delicious.

1371
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,100
- I love this place.
- Let's go.

1372
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,830
So right now, Namjoo is...

1373
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,870
- I'm 26.
- Right, 26.

1374
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,410
So let's all match her age first.

1375
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,910
Must we do it this way though?

1376
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,600
- Match what?
- You're being selfish already.

1377
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,870
Why should we match our ages first?

1378
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,410
You'll only betray us later.

1379
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,310
- Why would we betray you?
- Earlier,

1380
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,180
as soon as he heard the rules,

1381
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,180
he told Jong Kook his idea
while grinning.

1382
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,910
- That's what I hate the most.
- That's not the case.

1383
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,060
What's the main rule anyway?

1384
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,060
- I still don't get the game.
- Me neither.

1385
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,430
- All I want to do is eat.
- Guys.

1386
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,020
Okay, then. How about this?

1387
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,120
- We'll match ours to Kwang Soo's.
- Okay, that sounds good.

1388
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,500
Is that okay with you two?

1389
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,230
Why do we need
to level our ages though?

1390
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,230
Because...

1391
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,290
- We don't know the rules.
- Too much of an age gap...

1392
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,910
The oldest two
will receive the penalty.

1393
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,060
- I see.
- The oldest two.

1394
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,080
I'm sorry to say this,

1395
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,730
but we've repeated this
way too many times.

1396
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:23,810
- We'll explain it one last time.
- Let me explain.

1397
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,450
As you know, we...

1398
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,910
- First...
- The restaurant's 55 years old.

1399
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,310
Minus nine years,
and I'll be Kwang Soo's age.

1400
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,950
- What about you?
- In my case...

1401
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,480
- We're 6 years apart.
- Yes, 6.

1402
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,210
- That's what you'll shed.
- I have an idea.

1403
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,960
Spare us 15 years from 55 first.

1404
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,160
That'll level our age
with Kwang Soo's.

1405
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,750
Then we'll have 30 years
to share among us.

1406
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,600
- We'll share the 30 years.
- Then we'll divide it evenly.

1407
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,290
- You two will be safe.
- Only in the first round.

1408
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,560
- Only at first?
- We won't challenge you yet.

1409
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,140
Let us match Kwang Soo's age first.

1410
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,230
- Sure thing.
- Are we good?

1411
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,460
- Then 15 years each...
- Yes.

1412
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,000
No, not each.
Just 15 years in total.

1413
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,210
(Jong Kook's lecture
was all for nothing.)

1414
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:59,270
Let us take just 15 years
in the first round.

1415
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,540
We'll match our age
only to Kwang Soo's.

1416
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,870
As you know, I like to play fair.

1417
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,210
I play fair too when I need to be.

1418
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,580
- He...
- I play fair until I'm provoked.

1419
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,180
- We'll match ours with Kwang Soo's.
- That will come to bite you.

1420
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,330
- Just with Kwang Soo.
- You know how he is.

1421
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,790
A weasel like him
makes us all suffer a loss.

1422
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,390
- Shedding 11 years each is fair.
- We need to...

1423
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,290
level our age with Kwang Soo's.

1424
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,730
What do you mean by
shedding 11 years?

1425
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,140
The restaurant has been around
for 55 years.

1426
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,770
- And there are 5 of us.
- 11 years, 11 years...

1427
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,290
- 11 years, 11 years...
- I get it now.

1428
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,060
- 11 years, 11 years...
- Hold on a second.

1429
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,140
The girls are absolutely clueless.

1430
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,230
I'm pretty sure that...

1431
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,080
siding with you today
won't benefit me at all.

1432
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,750
Just don't do anything, all right?

1433
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,180
No matter how much we explain it,
we can't get through to them.

1434
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,520
- I get it now.
- You need to understand this.

1435
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,980
- I get it now too.
- Just eat whatever is served.

1436
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,810
That means we need to compete
against each other.

1437
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,410
- That's right.
- 11 years, 11 years...

1438
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,250
- I get it now.
- If you can be kind enough to...

1439
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,930
Are you still calculating the years?

1440
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,020
So 11 years each.

1441
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,700
- What...
- No, not 11 years each.

1442
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,540
I'm sorry, but can we
stop talking for a second?

1443
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,160
I'm getting woozy.

1444
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,230
- I want you to trust us.
- I'm curious though.

1445
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,770
Why are we even in teams?

1446
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,580
- What?
- This isn't some competition.

1447
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,230
- It's a single player game.
- How are we competing right now?

1448
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,640
We're trying to make sure
the team wins.

1449
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,910
- This is just our strategy.
- All right, then.

1450
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,000
If we're in it to win it,

1451
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,680
please explain the rules
clearly to me one last time.

1452
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,080
(Another explanation?)

1453
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,140
You've got to be kidding me.

1454
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,680
Are you serious?
She really is clueless.

1455
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,060
Just eat the food
that's presented to you...

1456
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,460
and receive the penalty at the end.

1457
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,350
This isn't complicated,
but she just doesn't get it.

1458
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,660
Why are you trying...

1459
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,930
- to shed years off your age?
- Okay, listen up.

1460
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,200
- Why shed the years?
- So our team members...

1461
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,000
- have a collective age of 177.
- Unbelievable.

1462
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,870
Bomi, why did you come here?

1463
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,310
- Do you know this is Running Man?
- To eat.

1464
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,730
- She's just pretending.
- I'll explain to you.

1465
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,270
- There?
- Deduct 65 years...

1466
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:38,750
(He explained the game rule
only for Bomi for a while.)

1467
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,410
You mean, the age badges,
not my actual age?

1468
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:42,710
That's correct.

1469
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,410
- It's your actual age.
- It's your actual age.

1470
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,750
- But if you don't deduct...
- That's what I said.

1471
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,410
(Complaining abnormal symptoms)

1472
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,120
I've become claustrophobic.

1473
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,830
(He passed out.)

1474
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,460
- I'm serious.
- Bomi, seriously.

1475
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,390
I bet Bomi is still trying to
figure it out.

1476
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,730
- No. I understand the rule now.
- But actually...

1477
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,370
I haven't been here in a long time.

1478
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,710
- We should put on a mask now.
- Okay.

1479
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,480
I haven't come to Myeong-dong
in a really long time.

1480
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,540
(Each of them has memories
of Myeong-dong.)

1481
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,710
- We're here.
- This is it.

1482
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,870
- All right.
- Oh, my.

1483
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,640
(Opened in 1966)

1484
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,710
(This is a popular kalguksu
and dumpling restaurant.)

1485
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,640
(Many tourists also visit the place
as it's located in Myeong-dong.)

1486
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,790
It smells so good. I'm excited.

1487
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,850
Oh, my.

1488
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:23,520
It looks so delicious.

1489
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,350
- Was there a place like this here?
- Hello.

1490
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,370
It was easy to find.

1491
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,560
Where should we sit?

1492
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,390
- You arrived at your first place.
- Yes.

1493
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,100
- I'm so excited to eat here.
- This restaurant is very famous.

1494
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,870
They opened up another location
in Los Angeles too.

1495
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:41,000
- What's most shocking is...
- Really?

1496
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,810
It's also one of the good things
about this restaurant.

1497
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:46,080
You can eat
as much rice as you want.

1498
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,640
- It's free.
- That's great.

1499
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,520
- Am I right, sir?
- I love rice.

1500
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,580
- It's great.
- Only when you order noodles.

1501
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,120
- I see. We should order noodles.
- Yes.

1502
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,890
I wasn't saying that we'll only eat
free rice here.

1503
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,580
- We wouldn't do that.
- We won't just ask for free rice.

1504
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,890
Of course, we'll order food.

1505
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:02,390
- We're not that kind of people.
- Why would we do that?

1506
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,830
Could you tell us
about the history of the restaurant?

1507
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:08,060
- It was established in 1966.
- In 1966?

1508
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,930
(It's a 55-year-old restaurant.
It was established in 1966.)

1509
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,100
- Suk Jin was born in that year.
- Exactly.

1510
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,600
- It's the same age as Suk Jin.
- That's right.

1511
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,980
- In 1966?
- Yes.

1512
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,810
You don't know what month it was,
right? I bet Suk Jin is older.

1513
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,270
- He was born in February.
- In the beginning of the year.

1514
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:22,120
- When you finish eating here,
- Yes.

1515
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,180
you can deduct 55 years,
the age of this place,

1516
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,480
- from your ages.
- Okay.

1517
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,910
But it's so unfair.
Is being old a sin?

1518
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,560
Of course, it's not.

1519
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,830
Then why would you come up with
a rule like this?

1520
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,890
The idea alone can...

1521
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,390
- make older people...
- Must Suk Jin die then?

1522
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:37,600
It can make older people upset.

1523
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,430
- I mean, is being old a sin?
- It's okay.

1524
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,000
Do you think you will never
be my age?

1525
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,830
That's why we're giving you a chance
to get your age deducted.

1526
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,370
- What I'm saying is...
- I know.

1527
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,730
that the members of our team...

1528
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,080
- reached an agreement.
- Haha.

1529
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,210
You sound so bossy right now.

1530
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,140
- The tone of his voice...
- I am talking right now!

1531
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,310
- It's not like that.
- He sounds even bossier than me.

1532
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,810
What's with you?
What has gotten into you?

1533
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,870
- We'll get 25 years.
- Doesn't his hat look like...

1534
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:58,640
- a traditional hat called gamtu?
- And we'll divide...

1535
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,910
the remaining 30 years.

1536
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:01,660
The remaining 30 years.

1537
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,160
- What happened to him?
- I can't believe him.

1538
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,620
He's so bossy.
He's much bossier than me.

1539
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,460
He used to have a young mind.

1540
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,620
- We'll let you make that decision.
- Okay.

1541
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,890
Then I have no problem.

1542
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,020
Wait. What was the rule?
1, 2, 3, and 4.

1543
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,100
- No dividing by the same number.
- Correct.

1544
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,060
For example, 2, 4, and 8. Or...

1545
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,140
Bomi, I think you're explaining it
because you're embarrassed.

1546
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,230
No, that's not the reason.

1547
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,980
All right. I'll explain...

1548
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,680
about the game you'll play.

1549
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,410
You'll play the same game
you played on Jeju Island...

1550
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,480
and gained the worst result.

1551
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,390
It's Half Proverb Quiz.

1552
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,480
- It was really difficult.
- Proverb?

1553
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,560
We'll tell you the latter part
of the proverb.

1554
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,750
You have to complete the sentence
in three seconds.

1555
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,850
(They succeed if they complete
the given sentence.)

1556
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,660
- This never has a peaceful day.
- That's easy.

1557
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,830
- What...
- It's easy.

1558
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,520
My family never has a peaceful day.

1559
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,730
- Hey.
- What's the answer?

1560
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,930
(Even the smart members were
humiliated playing the game.)

1561
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,330
- I don't know many proverbs.
- But...

1562
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,600
It was difficult.

1563
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,730
(It was difficult.)

1564
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,600
- I don't know many proverbs.
- But I think I have a chance.

1565
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,080
He's right. We have a chance to win.

1566
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,410
- The smart ones are not here.
- I think...

1567
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:02,640
- I can beat them.
- We have a chance to win.

1568
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,540
- I don't know many proverbs.
- I'm begging you...

1569
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,390
- Bomi and Namjoo should go first.
- I don't know any proverbs.

1570
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,060
Proverbs...

1571
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,250
- Kwang Soo should go first.
- Okay.

1572
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,520
- No.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

1573
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,160
- I don't agree...
- The winner gets to eat, right?

1574
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,480
The winner gets to eat food...

1575
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,750
- and gets the age...
- Get the age deducted?

1576
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,660
Bomi, come on. Please.

1577
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,430
I'm done for.

1578
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,500
Give me the question.

1579
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,600
- Bomi,
- Bomi.

1580
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,790
- we'll begin now.
- Okay.

1581
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,040
Move to Gangnam.

1582
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,140
- 3, 2...
- I move to Gangnam.

1583
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,770
(I move to Gangnam.)

1584
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:27,810
One.

1585
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,040
(It sounds like declaration.)

1586
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,600
- That was good. Next.
- My gosh.

1587
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,080
- Gosh. I really don't know.
- That was good.

1588
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,180
(Following a friend,
you move to Gangnam.)

1589
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,680
This never has a peaceful day.

1590
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:35,950
- Three.
- Well...

1591
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,870
- Two.
- I never have a peaceful day.

1592
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,540
(I never have a peaceful day.)

1593
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,910
Her answer always starts with "I".

1594
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,120
- I'm worried. I can't just laugh.
- Kwang Soo, why...

1595
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,410
Let's move on. Keep going.

1596
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,560
But you don't know
how giyeok looks.

1597
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,830
- You look at a sickle.
- Correct.

1598
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,660
(She finally got a question right.)

1599
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,770
You stay up all night.

1600
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,140
- Well...
- During the exam period.

1601
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,540
During the exam period,
you stay up all night.

1602
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
(She took the bait right away.)

1603
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,210
- Frying beans.
- "Frying beans"?

1604
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,770
- Using cooking oil.
- Two.

1605
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,910
"Frying beans"?

1606
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:07,480
(You should use cooking oil
when you fry beans.)

1607
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,620
- Beans?
- One.

1608
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,370
- You eat and fry beans?
- Wrong.

1609
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:11,790
"You eat and fry beans"?

1610
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:14,450
- I'm relieved that she's here.
- Frying beans with lightning?

1611
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,980
- Yes, that's correct.
- Okay.

1612
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,350
(He's holding back his laugh
as Bomi seems so enthusiastic.)

1613
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,180
It's so difficult
because we hear only the half.

1614
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,180
It's confusing.

1615
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,000
- It's hard to guess the front half.
- Exactly.

1616
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,600
But she did a good job.

1617
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,120
- It's difficult.
- Is it Jong Kook's turn?

1618
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,200
- Me?
- Yes.

1619
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,890
Give me some easy questions.

1620
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,270
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

1621
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,600
And pull yourself together. Three.

1622
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,830
- Empty your stomach?
- Two.

1623
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,910
(Empty your stomach
and pull yourself together?)

1624
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,210
- One.
- Jong Kook.

1625
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,430
Are you serious?

1626
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,250
I mean...

1627
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,350
You won't be the worst.

1628
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,950
- 3, 2...
- If you don't say anything.

1629
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,020
- Correct.
- What?

1630
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,350
The taste of the sauce.

1631
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,390
- 3, 2...
- What? The taste of the sauce...

1632
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:48,660
- One.
- The longer you store the sauce...

1633
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,060
- Wrong.
- The jar isn't better than...

1634
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,250
You break your nose.

1635
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,890
- 3, 2...
- Even when you fall backward.

1636
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,520
- Even when you...
- There's more.

1637
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,230
- 3, 2...
- What did you say?

1638
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,660
- One. You failed.
- Isn't that correct?

1639
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,560
- A rock.
- "If you're unlucky."

1640
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,290
- That's the missing part.
- Oh, right.

1641
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,100
- You unlucky punk.
- What?

1642
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,140
- That's the missing part.
- Oh, right.

1643
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,210
(He used the proverb
that he learned right away.)

1644
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,230
- You said the proverb, right?
- Don't act like you knew it.

1645
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,710
- That's it?
- Yes.

1646
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:12,810
- How many did he get right?
- Two.

1647
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:14,250
- 2 questions.
- I'm relieved that I got 2 right.

1648
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,040
We should stop him.

1649
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,180
Haha, you're up.

1650
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,250
You knock on the window.

1651
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,950
- 3, 2...
- When you're desperate.

1652
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,980
(While sleeping,
you knock on the window.)

1653
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,020
Wrong.

1654
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,410
You can't find any.

1655
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,020
When you need medicine as poop...
When you need poop as medicine.

1656
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,660
(When you need medicine as poop,
you can't find any?)

1657
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,100
- What do you mean by that?
- Darn it.

1658
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,100
(Bomi who got 1 question right
turns out to be the ace.)

1659
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,100
That's hilarious.

1660
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,270
Let's move on.

1661
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,140
This is impossible
even for a king.

1662
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,560
- 3, 2...
- "Even for a king"?

1663
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,910
- Running Man games...
- One.

1664
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,770
(Solving poverty is impossible
even for a king.)

1665
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,810
(Games on Running Man are
impossible even for a king.)

1666
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:44,810
Next.

1667
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,910
With a horseshoe.

1668
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,540
3, 2...

1669
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,680
The one who feels at ease.

1670
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,950
- What's horseshoe?
- I don't what horseshoe is.

1671
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,850
- And no man is below others.
- Three.

1672
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,680
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Two.

1673
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,250
Why are you doing this to me?
You never did it before.

1674
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,520
Under the sky...

1675
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,180
- No man is above others.
- Oh, right.

1676
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,460
And no man is below others.

1677
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,000
- They were too difficult.
- I think...

1678
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,700
- They were difficult.
- The ones in the beginning weren't.

1679
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,000
- Those two questions were easy.
- They don't suit me.

1680
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,020
Don't mind him.

1681
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,870
- The one with "poop" suits you.
- Indeed.

1682
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:10,890
It suits you well.

1683
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,500
- I'll announce the result.
- Okay.

1684
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,000
- Kwang Soo came in first.
- Yes.

1685
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,330
- Jong Kook is in second place.
- All right.

1686
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,480
Namjoo is in 3rd place,
and Bomi is in 4th place.

1687
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,870
Haha is in bottom place.

1688
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,750
Haha, thank you.

1689
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,950
We'll deduct 15 years
as we planned before, right?

1690
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,250
About that...

1691
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,910
We should try following the rule
to figure it out.

1692
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,580
- Just wait for now.
- You're in bottom place.

1693
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,680
- Why did you change your mind?
- You thought that too, right?

1694
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,480
- It's not like that.
- I love this about him.

1695
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:35,250
- Am I right?
- I really like this about him.

1696
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,830
- Deducting 15 years...
- We should follow the rule.

1697
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:38,890
is against the rule.

1698
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,270
But they said we could do that.

1699
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,430
It's against the rule.

1700
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,700
Who are you, mister?

1701
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,390
We're not allowed to do that.

1702
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,310
He said that we can do that
if we all agree.

1703
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,910
Before the food is out,

1704
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,330
you can take off as many badges
as you want...

1705
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,500
out of 55 years that you gained...

1706
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,750
and give the badges to us.

1707
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,950
Let's do as we agreed, okay?

1708
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,350
(Kwang Soo will go first
as he's the winner.)

1709
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:58,520
- Shall I step forward?
- They shouldn't...

1710
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,750
You should submit the badges
without letting us know.

1711
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,180
- Hey. He took off a lot of them.
- I mean...

1712
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,710
(He already took off
a lot of badges.)

1713
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,460
- I should deduct a few years.
- How many did he take off?

1714
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,580
Just a few. I took off only four.

1715
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,290
- How many will you take off?
- Not many.

1716
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,790
- How many?
- You shouldn't have let him.

1717
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,460
How many years will you deduct
from your age, Kwang Soo?

1718
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,390
- Don't take off too many.
- Okay.

1719
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,960
- You punk!
- He's taking off so many.

1720
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,040
How many badges is he taking off?

1721
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,710
I think he'll take off
all his badges.

1722
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,330
Kwang Soo, don't take off
too many.

1723
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:25,370
Gosh. I can't believe Kwang Soo.

1724
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:28,410
- Kwang Soo.
- He's so mean.

1725
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:29,580
(The staff member is trying to
calm him down for a while.)

1726
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,450
(The staff members are stopping him
as he won't stop.)

1727
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,140
- Stop it.
- Kwang Soo, my gosh.

1728
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,910
- Gosh, seriously.
- Deduct 36 years...

1729
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,290
The staff members are
trying to stop you, you punk!

1730
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:39,350
Hey.

1731
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,390
Kwang Soo, stop it.
It won't be funny if you do that.

1732
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,060
Fine. Deduct all the years you need
and get out.

1733
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,850
- You can't do it in the beginning.
- Just leave.

1734
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,790
I think there will be some years
left at least for me.

1735
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,370
Jong Kook, come forward.

1736
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,200
You know me, right?
I'm not that kind of person.

1737
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,160
I'm a reasonable person.

1738
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,910
I'll tell you how many years
he deducted.

1739
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,480
Exactly. I need to know that.

1740
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,040
- I'll decide based on that.
- I didn't take off many.

1741
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,750
- You'll get to deduct some years.
- Really?

1742
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,350
He submitted 30 badges.

1743
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,410
My gosh. He's a crazy punk.

1744
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,460
He took off all the badges he had?

1745
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,560
Hold on a second.

1746
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,660
You shouldn't have given him
a chance to do that.

1747
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,160
I'm shocked.

1748
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,520
- You still have enough years.
- He must've lost his mind.

1749
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,120
Then... My gosh.

1750
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,660
He must be out of his mind.

1751
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,230
Then I will...

1752
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,040
- So we have 25 years left?
- Yes.

1753
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,910
Then I'll take off 20 badges.

1754
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,730
(Jong Kook is taking off 20 badges?)

1755
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,210
(Jong Kook has finally changed.)

1756
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,980
(The icon of trust Jong Kook
is no longer the oldest member.)

1757
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,140
Okay. Done.

1758
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,310
My gosh. I can't believe this.

1759
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,290
I guess there's no year left.

1760
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,710
- Why? How many do you have left?
- Gosh, seriously.

1761
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:44,060
How many?

1762
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,680
Tell no one else but me,
and I'll tell you.

1763
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,980
Can I redeem myself?

1764
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,850
(After much thought,
Namjoo submitted age badges.)

1765
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,330
I was considerate of you two.

1766
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,230
- How many do we have left?
- Really.

1767
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,730
I shouldn't expect much.

1768
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:56,660
- Your team gained 55 years.
- Yes.

1769
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,540
But the members before you
deducted 54 years in total.

1770
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,770
(We have only 1 year left?)

1771
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:04,000
- What?
- That's not the reason.

1772
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,450
- You became...
- Do you think it was me?

1773
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,100
- You became a pirate.
- Do you think it was me?

1774
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,210
(Bomi also submitted something.)

1775
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,790
But you...

1776
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,750
You left me no choice...

1777
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,960
because you deducted...

1778
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,460
One of them went too far.

1779
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,830
- How many do we have left?
- He's like a pirate.

1780
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,120
You have none left.

1781
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,520
How can we have none left?

1782
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,200
I guess they took off
all the badges they had.

1783
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,560
- The last person...
- The bottom place has none.

1784
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,100
has a low chance of
getting the age deducted.

1785
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,960
All other members turned in
different numbers of age badges.

1786
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,000
(Haha became the oldest member.)

1787
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,330
- Okay.
- Are those leather?

1788
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:38,850
- Are you wearing leather pants?
- What is up with your pants?

1789
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,140
What about my pants?

1790
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,980
What about my pants?

1791
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,540
Look at you.

1792
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,250
That hat looks like
a traditional hat, doesn't it?

1793
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,560
We might be the oldest ones.

1794
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,020
- Are you satisfied with the result?
- I am totally satisfied.

1795
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,250
I wouldn't say I am satisfied
by 100 percent, but...

1796
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,350
All right.

1797
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,890
You suddenly became a preschooler.

1798
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,230
Can he even walk at his age?

1799
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,960
You suddenly became a preschooler.

1800
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,870
Would it be okay
if I go and change my diaper?

1801
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,870
It happened so suddenly.

1802
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,270
- It's not that bad.
- It happened in the first round.

1803
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,210
Shouldn't he eat baby food?

1804
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,770
We will serve food.

1805
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,270
- Okay.
- It must be delicious.

1806
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,480
- This is it.
- We got one serving.

1807
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,540
This is it.

1808
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,370
This is it.

1809
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,450
Would it be okay if I eat this much?

1810
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:21,620
- Of course.
- Okay.

1811
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:24,750
I will take two dumplings.

1812
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,980
All right. I followed my conscience.

1813
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,250
Thank you for the food.

1814
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,960
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1815
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,830
This restaurant has been around
for 55 years.

1816
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,330
I vouch for this restaurant.

1817
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,890
(They exclaim
as soon as they taste the food.)

1818
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,040
You must eat this kimchi.

1819
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,540
(The dish is perfect...)

1820
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,580
(with the dumplings and kimchi.)

1821
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,500
Look up restaurants
with 100 years of history.

1822
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:48,450
(They need to find
the next restaurant.)

1823
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:49,810
Jong Kook.

1824
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:50,980
Pyongyangmyeonok.

1825
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,020
It's the perfect restaurant
to visit next.

1826
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,450
- It will be delicious.
- Let's go.

1827
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:56,810
- Let's go.
- We can go to Hadongkwan next.

1828
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,750
- Yes.
- Then we will be done.

1829
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,830
Then it will be a happy ending.

1830
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,390
- We won't need to fight.
- Exactly.

1831
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:03,500
- Okay.
- Then we will be done.

1832
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:04,790
We will be done.

1833
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,500
Let's clap the slate.

1834
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:09,660
1, 2, 3.

1835
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,960
(The shoot at the first restaurant
ends.)

1836
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:13,430
(Jong Kook heads somewhere.)

1837
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:15,480
The staff members will move first.

1838
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,810
(He approaches the trunk.)

1839
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:21,370
(He takes something out.)

1840
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:24,040
Hold on. Where do I do this?

1841
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,710
- Where do I do this?
- You need to find a spot and do it.

1842
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,120
- Do I need to do it in secret?
- Yes.

1843
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,290
Really?

1844
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:29,790
(Does he need to do something
in secret?)

1845
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,060
(He stealthily moves
to the back of the car.)

1846
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,160
(Is that a die?)

1847
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,960
All right.

1848
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:42,290
How many age badges
do you have left?

1849
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:43,960
I can't show them.

1850
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,540
We will find out soon.

1851
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,540
I wish I could show you.

1852
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,330
(Running Man's hidden mission)

1853
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:51,270
How many age badges did you remove?
A lot?

1854
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,680
I didn't remove that many.

1855
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,450
(Did the oldest member in the team
get a hidden mission?)

1856
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:00,290
(Every 2 hours, the oldest member
in each team gets a hidden mission!)

1857
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,790
(2 dice are hidden at the set
at all times!)

1858
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,120
(The white die reduces your age...)

1859
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,600
(and the red die reduces a selected
member's age in another team.)

1860
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,270
(However, the location of the dice
changes every 2 hours.)

1861
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:16,540
(The oldest members were informed
of the hidden mission.)

1862
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:20,370
(Jong Kook was aiming
for his chance to do the mission.)

1863
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,410
(He finally got his chance
to complete the hidden mission.)

1864
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:23,540
I will roll it.

1865
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,750
(He rolls the white die
to reduce his age first!)

1866
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,640
(3 years are deducted
from Jong Kook's age.)

1867
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,540
(3 years are also deducted
from a member of another team.)

1868
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,140
- What is that?
- What?

1869
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,400
- What is that?
- It's nothing.

1870
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,900
(Kwang Soo comes out of nowhere
and catches him in the act.)

1871
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:51,610
What are those?

1872
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,000
I found them in the trunk.

1873
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:55,380
(Hitting)

1874
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:56,810
(Kwang Soo resorts to violence.)

1875
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:57,980
What are those?

1876
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,250
- What are those?
- I found them in the trunk.

1877
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,250
(He gets cornered
for his suspicious behavior.)

1878
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,190
You suddenly found dice
in the trunk...

1879
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:05,710
- and threw them.
- I did it without any thoughts.

1880
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,130
- Let me try it.
- What?

1881
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:09,080
- Let me throw them.
- It isn't something you can do.

1882
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:10,650
I just...

1883
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,520
Is this your secret space?

1884
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,560
No, it isn't.

1885
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:14,920
Haha, that's not how you do it.

1886
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,730
- Let me try it too.
- I mean...

1887
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,330
That's not how you do it.

1888
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,830
- What are these?
- Nothing.

1889
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,000
1, 2, 3.

1890
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,130
(He rolls the die
without knowing anything.)

1891
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,170
Six.

1892
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:26,710
Let's go.

1893
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,310
(Kwang Soo tries to figure out
the situation.)

1894
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,380
- Did you roll it?
- Did I get anything?

1895
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,020
(He steals the dice.)

1896
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,540
Is this a game center or what?

1897
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:37,380
Why are you doing this?

1898
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,380
(He rolls the dice.)

1899
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,560
6. 6.

1900
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,480
What is this? Is it a mission?

1901
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:43,630
Is it a mission?

1902
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,650
Do you know what you are doing?

1903
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,420
- No.
- Then why are you doing it?

1904
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,420
Will you deduct seven years
from my age?

1905
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,540
- What?
- Will you deduct seven years?

1906
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,270
- No.
- Is it a mission?

1907
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,960
Why did you roll the dice?

1908
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,540
I was bored, okay?

1909
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:01,710
(He angrily throws the dice.)

1910
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,610
(I am so annoyed.)

1911
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,710
(This clueless gambler is annoyed.)

1912
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:07,110
What is this?

1913
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:08,880
Let's hit the road.

1914
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:11,290
Is it really nothing?

1915
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:12,290
(He used his energy
without any gain.)

1916
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,520
I think it's a mission
only Haha and Jong Kook received.

1917
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:19,100
I didn't receive a mission.
I just copied Jong Kook.

1918
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:23,290
Why did you roll the dice,
Kwang Soo?

1919
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:24,290
Dice?

1920
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:27,060
- Why did you do it?
- I followed him.

1921
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,610
It seemed like a mission.

1922
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:29,880
Haha, why did you roll the dice?

1923
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,110
I just followed Jong Kook.

1924
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,130
Wasn't it your mission?

1925
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,880
- Did you do it without a clue?
- Yes.

1926
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,880
(Haha copied Jong Kook
and Kwang Soo copied Haha.)

1927
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,920
All right. You rolled the dice.

1928
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,850
Jong Kook, which member
will you choose?

1929
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,690
- What?
- A member from another team, right?

1930
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:44,810
Yes.

1931
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,380
I will choose Se Chan.

1932
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,150
Okay.

1933
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,560
- Tell us what that was about!
- Why won't you tell us anything?

1934
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,960
We feel left out.

1935
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,060
It doesn't affect you.

1936
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,900
Like I told you earlier...

1937
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,190
Did you receive a mission?

1938
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:02,630
Haha and Kwang Soo simply played
with the dice.

1939
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,500
Why do you keep saying that?

1940
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:07,250
(The dice will be hidden
at a different location now.)

1941
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,080
- Jong Kook, as for you,
- Okay.

1942
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,540
your result will be reflected.

1943
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,920
(Meanwhile, in Team Ji Hyo's car)

1944
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:15,210
(He receives a text about
a deduction in his age.)

1945
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:17,080
(3 years have been deducted
from Jong Kook and Se Chan's ages.)

1946
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,790
(He gets a benefit
without knowing what's going on.)

1947
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:20,250
Did you eat a lot?

1948
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,580
I drank some soup.

1949
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,230
By the way, So Min,

1950
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:25,230
(By the way, So Min...)

1951
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,230
act your age.

1952
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:30,060
Okay? When you are in your mid-20s,

1953
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,270
you shouldn't keep food
from the younger members.

1954
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:35,630
Hey, I am older than you.
I am 25 years old.

1955
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:38,810
I know that, but
you shouldn't tell me what to do.

1956
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,880
Listen.

1957
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,110
Don't stretch out the last syllable.
I don't like it.

1958
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:45,520
- Keep it short.
- Okay.

1959
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,710
(Okay.)

1960
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:48,150
(He is
as childish as a preschooler.)

1961
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:49,210
I will keep it short!

1962
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:50,420
Shall I talk like this?

1963
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,250
Shall I talk faster?

1964
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:54,560
(He annoys me so much.)

1965
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,080
What am I going to do with him?

1966
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,020
Call me when you come to Yongsan.
I will buy you a meal.

1967
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,020
Okay.

1968
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,270
But I don't know your number.

1969
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:03,600
I will give you my number.

1970
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,330
- Tell her you will memorize it.
- Just ask.

1971
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:07,230
Don't be ridiculous.

1972
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,310
Stop being jealous!

1973
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:10,900
- I am not being jealous!
- For goodness' sake.

1974
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,810
It would be nice if he tells you
he will memorize it.

1975
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:17,210
He gets so greedy about
something he won't have.

1976
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,020
I am not being greedy!
She is ridiculous.

1977
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,080
What time is it now?
It's 12:30 p.m., right?

1978
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,420
- If it's 12:30 p.m...
- We need to move fast.

1979
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,190
We should hit the road again
by 1:30 p.m.

1980
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:30,920
- At this restaurant,
- We don't have much time.

1981
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,920
we really need to move fast.
Otherwise, we will lose.

1982
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,600
(Team Suk Jin is close
to the second restaurant)

1983
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:40,710
It wasn't enough food
to fill my stomach.

1984
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:41,710
(Suk Jin complains
because he is hungry.)

1985
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:43,270
This is ridiculous.

1986
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,440
Suk Jin has a lot of complaints.

1987
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,710
I am still hungry.

1988
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:51,520
Suk Jin's complaints are never big.
They are always small.

1989
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:53,880
I will eat more.

1990
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,380
- I will eat more.
- Fathers are like that.

1991
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,610
But you should know...

1992
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:00,290
that Suk Jin never goes against...

1993
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,250
the production crew's wishes.

1994
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:03,790
He does everything.

1995
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,630
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yes.

1996
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,860
"Why are you making me do this?"

1997
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,600
"This is ridiculous."
When he gets the cue,

1998
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,040
he does it without fail.

1999
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,230
(He becomes a professional
when the camera comes on.)

2000
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,330
- You know people like that, right?
- Yes.

2001
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,710
(They are nearing
the second restaurant.)

2002
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:18,940
The thing is,

2003
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:21,270
it's not easy
to hold on to a position for years.

2004
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:22,440
It's not easy.

2005
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:26,580
Working in the show business
for 30 years...

2006
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,040
- is hard.
- It isn't easy.

2007
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,250
- I...
- There was a crisis.

2008
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,460
I told myself,

2009
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,980
"I will work until the age of 30."

2010
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,860
- Really?
- I didn't know...

2011
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,020
- if it was the right path for me.
- You weren't sure about that.

2012
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,290
I wondered if it would be okay
to pursue this career.

2013
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,730
I told myself that
I will quit if I don't succeed...

2014
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:42,770
until the age of 40.

2015
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:44,190
- And?
- So...

2016
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,440
when I hit the age of 40, I said,

2017
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:48,040
"I will quit if I don't succeed
until the age of 50."

2018
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,330
I pushed the deadline.

2019
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:52,110
(He failed to become popular
until the age of 40.)

2020
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:56,310
I will hang in there
until the age of 60 and quit.

2021
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:58,250
- You just need to stay healthy.
- That's right.

2022
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,540
We saw earlier
that he is in good health.

2023
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:03,210
- I keep pushing the deadline.
- That's good.

2024
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:05,080
- You don't need permission.
- This is the place.

2025
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,650
- It opened in 1937.
- Okay.

2026
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:08,060
You can see the history.

2027
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,230
(It really is an old restaurant.)

2028
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,600
Look at this place.

2029
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,920
(Cheongjinok is a hangover soup
place with 84 years of history.)

2030
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,190
It's Lee Ju Il.

2031
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,400
- Nami.
- It really is an old restaurant.

2032
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,770
This is a meaningful restaurant.

2033
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,170
This is incredible.

2034
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:20,230
- Seriously.
- This restaurant...

2035
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,460
(Hangover soup with clotted blood,
tripe, and radish green is popular.)

2036
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,710
This restaurant opened in 1937.

2037
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:28,610
Its hangover soup was picked
as Seoul's future heritage.

2038
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,650
Suk Jin can't eat...

2039
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:32,850
clotted blood.

2040
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,380
- No, he can't.
- What should we do?

2041
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,580
Boiled pork.

2042
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:36,810
Would you like to order boiled pork?

2043
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:39,210
No, no. Hangover soup is
their signature dish.

2044
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,830
Why are you being so difficult
when he offered to change the menu?

2045
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:43,690
They could take out clotted blood.

2046
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,650
- We need to eat clotted blood.
- We love clotted blood.

2047
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,500
We want to eat the original version.

2048
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,000
- This is driving me crazy.
- It's just Suk Jin.

2049
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,830
- We need their signature dish.
- That's right.

2050
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:54,170
I must do my best with the mission.

2051
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:55,940
I bet I will only get clotted blood
if I place last.

2052
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,230
Seriously.

2053
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,310
- That will happen if I place last.
- Hold on.

2054
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:02,480
You don't like the taste, right?
You can still eat it, right?

2055
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,170
- I can eat it.
- That solves the problem.

2056
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:05,250
I can eat it.

2057
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,810
- Let's begin the mission.
- Okay.

2058
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,940
Frog. 1, 2...

2059
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,560
- "Demetan Croaker..."
- Incorrect.

2060
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:13,290
(A well with a frog)

2061
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,150
- I placed second.
- My goodness.

2062
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:19,060
- This makes no sense.
- Turn in the age badges.

2063
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,670
21 years each.

2064
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:21,900
I left some age badges behind.

2065
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,790
(They go from Chang Hee
to Soo Yong.)

2066
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:24,940
I didn't turn in a lot.

2067
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,670
My goodness.

2068
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:28,360
Gosh, I turned in only a few.

2069
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,210
Are there any years left
for Jae Suk?

2070
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:31,710
- Are there any years left for...
- Jae Suk, your turn.

2071
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:33,080
- How many years remain?
- One.

2072
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:34,880
For goodness' sake.

2073
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:37,710
(That's a lot.)

2074
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,540
(Jae Suk could only deduct 1 year.)

2075
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,690
All right. If I place first
the next time...

2076
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:43,460
Just you wait.

2077
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,710
We will do this again.
This isn't the end.

2078
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:47,290
Seriously.

2079
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:48,480
Do you know what's a relief?

2080
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:50,400
Even though Suk Jin placed second,

2081
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:52,020
he can't eat clotted blood.

2082
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,060
That's right.

2083
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:54,790
I am hungry.

2084
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:55,790
- The soup.
- You know...

2085
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:57,630
- He might just drink the soup.
- He might just drink the soup.

2086
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:59,960
I will eat rice. I will eat it.

2087
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:03,400
The owner will give
a lot of clotted blood.

2088
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:05,880
Please give us a lot of meat.

2089
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,400
(The hangover soup
with 84 years of history is served.)

2090
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,540
Thank you.

2091
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:12,920
This is...

2092
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:17,210
(The dish has a generous amount
of clotted blood and tripe.)

2093
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,690
It looks delicious.

2094
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:20,190
Gosh, it's...

2095
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,290
- Shall we add rice?
- It looks delicious.

2096
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,330
- I am sorry, but I placed first.
- That's right.

2097
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,250
- That's right.
- You placed first.

2098
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,730
- That's how it is.
- I see. That being said...

2099
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:29,670
- What's that in the bowl?
- That's how it is.

2100
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,000
- What is this?
- What?

2101
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,460
"Due to Ji Hyo's hidden mission,
a year got deducted from your age."

2102
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,360
- What?
- Lucky you.

2103
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,900
"Turn in an age badge
to the production crew secretly."

2104
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,580
Why did you read it out loud?

2105
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,750
What is this?

2106
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:45,880
I didn't receive anything.

2107
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,790
I received a chance.
Is it okay if I do it?

2108
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,080
The die chance.

2109
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,690
- Why did you reveal it?
- What?

2110
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,520
It's a hidden mission.
Why did you reveal it?

2111
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:00,960
Ji Hyo must have succeeded
in the hidden mission.

2112
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,060
(Meanwhile, the 3 of them
are eating.)

2113
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,440
There is a lot of clotted blood.

2114
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,360
(He takes a ladleful
without the clotted blood.)

2115
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,540
Gosh, this seems to be a dish...

2116
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:12,080
that isn't easy for me.

2117
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,670
The smell...

2118
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,250
- What isn't easy for you?
- This dish.

2119
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,920
He is complaining about the smell.

2120
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,250
- It isn't easy for me.
- There is a lot of food left.

2121
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:24,690
Is that porridge?

2122
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,360
(Suk Jin got forced into a diet.)

2123
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,360
He is the worst. I told you.

2124
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,830
- Watch.
- It isn't easy for me.

2125
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,420
Soo Yong likes to eat,

2126
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,400
but he eats in an unappetizing way.

2127
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,820
Watch.
He eats in an unappetizing way.

2128
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,240
(Jae Suk starts an eating show
instead.)

2129
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,280
It's so tasty.

2130
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:46,740
By the way,

2131
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,500
why am I eating so much
when I placed last?

2132
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,980
(He is having his fill
thanks to a picky eater.)

2133
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,350
(He looks around without eating.)

2134
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:58,360
Gosh, this is a dish with history.

2135
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,560
(He talks about the history
without any food in his mouth.)

2136
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,360
- A dish with history.
- He didn't eat much.

2137
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,920
Watch him.

2138
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,490
He keeps doing this with rice.

2139
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:10,990
(Pushing the rice around)

2140
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,630
Why are you mincing the rice?

2141
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:15,030
Suk Jin,
why are you mincing the rice?

2142
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,170
This is a dish with history.

2143
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:18,910
I can feel the Korean spirit.

2144
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,280
Do you know what he said?

2145
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,950
He can feel the Korean spirit.

2146
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,950
- The ancestors' spirit.
- He is ridiculous.

2147
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:25,040
(He feels the ancestors' spirit
without tasting the dish.)

2148
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,020
- This is the place.
- When did the restaurant open?

2149
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,450
1980.

2150
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:31,380
It says, "100-year-old restaurant".

2151
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:32,880
100 years?

2152
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:34,190
Is it 100 years old?

2153
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,730
What is this place?

2154
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,400
They even received a medal.

2155
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,860
This restaurant serves
Pyongyang specialty.

2156
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,320
It's from Pyongyang,

2157
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:43,160
so it must be incredibly old.

2158
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,070
- I bet it's 200 years.
- Did it start in Pyongyang?

2159
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:46,570
It was passed down
through three generations.

2160
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:47,660
Three generations?

2161
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,370
Then it must be over 100 years old.

2162
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:53,000
- How old is it? 100 years?
- We should ask.

2163
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,410
You have arrived
at the second restaurant.

2164
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:57,350
They set up a table in advance.

2165
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:00,150
- We will proceed once you sit down.
- Shall we do that?

2166
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:01,820
- All right.
- Sir.

2167
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:05,080
(They call for the owner
with high expectations.)

2168
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,190
(Excited)

2169
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:08,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

2170
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,690
Please come in.

2171
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:11,860
It's my first time to meet the owner
of a 100-year-old restaurant.

2172
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:14,460
I heard that this restaurant is
100 years old.

2173
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,730
Sir,

2174
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,700
how old is this restaurant?

2175
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,660
(There was a sign that reads,
"100-year-old restaurant".)

2176
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,310
(Is it actually 100 years old?)

2177
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:25,170
It opened in 1984,

2178
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:26,480
so it's 37 years old.

2179
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,910
(It's 37 years old.)

2180
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,000
- 37 years old.
- 37 years old.

2181
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,170
That's... That's incredible.

2182
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,850
We don't mean
this specific building.

2183
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:33,990
We mean...

2184
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:35,280
The brand.

2185
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:37,080
We mean the entire brand,

2186
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,190
- not this specific branch.
- In that case,

2187
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:45,200
the grandfather of the owner...

2188
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,200
- ran a restaurant in Pyongyang.
- Right?

2189
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:49,820
He ran Daedongmyeonok there.

2190
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,240
If you combine that history...

2191
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,240
- If you combine that history...
- If I do that,

2192
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,110
this restaurant would be
about 100 years old.

2193
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:56,530
(This restaurant would be
about 100 years old.)

2194
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,130
(They finally hear "100 years"!)

2195
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,170
- I got goosebumps.
- That's Dadongmyeonok.

2196
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,110
- This restaurant...
- How old is...

2197
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:04,170
- Pyongyangmyeonok?
- How old is it?

2198
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:05,410
It must be close to 100 years old.

2199
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:06,480
It's 37 years old.

2200
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,880
No, no.

2201
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,080
The sign reads,
"100-year-old restaurant".

2202
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,950
- It's our pride.
- I see.

2203
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:13,690
When he moved to South Korea,

2204
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:15,750
he didn't open the restaurant
right away.

2205
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,920
- He did something else.
- He did something else.

2206
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,790
Will you only count
the history of this restaurant?

2207
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:21,730
- Yes.
- 37 years. Okay.

2208
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:23,270
What should we order?

2209
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,240
- Which dish is the most popular?
- Pyongyang naengmyeon.

2210
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:26,960
We should eat Pyongyang naengmyeon.

2211
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:30,310
(Noodles with the aroma of buckwheat
and clean broth complete the dish.)

2212
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:32,370
Please give us 1 serving
that feels like 5 servings.

2213
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:35,040
- That's too bad.
- 37 years.

2214
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,280
- 37 years.
- I continued to send a signal.

2215
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,850
We should hurry up
and move on to the next restaurant.

2216
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:41,320
- That's right.
- Let's hurry up.

2217
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,580
We need to go to Hadongkwan.

2218
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:43,710
We should do that.

2219
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:45,910
- This restaurant is 37 years old.
- Okay.

2220
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:49,060
The mission is, Blow Out Candles
With the Entire Body.

2221
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:51,990
With a fan attached to your waist,
you will generate winds.

2222
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:54,620
The time it took you
to blow out five candles...

2223
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,100
will determine the order.

2224
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,290
When we simulated the game,
men had an advantage.

2225
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:01,110
Thus, we will put the candles
50cm closer...

2226
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,660
- for women.
- What?

2227
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,170
- Here...
- Will the candles be...

2228
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,570
- here?
- Yes.

2229
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:06,940
- Is it even possible?
- Yes.

2230
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,950
Since women have a handicap...

2231
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,310
If you are against it...

2232
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:11,540
I am not against it.

2233
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,820
If I am against it,
will you reflect that?

2234
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,280
To be honest, I am against it.

2235
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,950
(He is petty.)

2236
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:18,450
(He promotes gender equality.)

2237
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:19,880
- It's too much.
- I am against it.

2238
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,660
If it's a small advantage,
I would understand.

2239
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:23,990
It's too much.

2240
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,100
How much of a benefit
would you accept?

2241
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,490
Move the sticker.

2242
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:30,070
- What is your problem?
- No, no.

2243
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,870
- We are on the same team.
- This needs to be fair.

2244
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:33,200
I know that we are on the same team.

2245
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,830
Then let's play fair.

2246
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:36,070
Don't give us a benefit.

2247
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:37,810
- No, no. You need it.
- Should we play the same way?

2248
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:39,740
- Come on.
- We aren't that mean.

2249
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:40,810
- All right.
- Move it a little bit.

2250
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:42,170
Move it a little bit.

2251
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,040
(Two big hand spans)

2252
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,370
That's good.

2253
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,580
What?

2254
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,560
What?

2255
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,780
- Where?
- Just don't give us a benefit.

2256
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:54,560
- We will give it.
- Do two hand spans.

2257
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,990
Do two hand spans.

2258
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:58,990
- For goodness' sake.
- Do two hand spans.

2259
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:00,700
(Wriggling)

2260
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:01,990
Do two hand spans.

2261
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:03,730
- You moved your fingers.
- You are heartless.

2262
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:05,160
- No, I didn't.
- You moved your fingers.

2263
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,270
That's good enough.

2264
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:08,160
- That's good enough.
- It's close to where it was before.

2265
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:11,170
- It was generous of Kwang Soo.
- Seriously.

2266
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:12,410
Do we put this on our waist?

2267
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,740
Haha, it's your turn.

2268
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:15,170
Isn't that what you wear
to work out?

2269
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:18,410
Do I keep going
until I blow out all the candles?

2270
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:20,120
Yes. The clock will keep going
until you blow out all of them.

2271
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,490
Don't grab the belt
with your hands.

2272
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,020
Get ready.

2273
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:26,060
Set...

2274
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:27,660
(Go.)

2275
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,420
(One candle goes out already.)

2276
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:32,450
He blew out one candle.

2277
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,750
(He swings as much as he can.)

2278
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,730
- Are you timing it?
- The wind is strong.

2279
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:36,960
The flame is coming back.

2280
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:39,240
I think the location is off.

2281
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,740
- It worked.
- They won't go out.

2282
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:45,240
It went out.

2283
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:47,410
Haha is fast.

2284
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,310
- A bit more.
- I did it!

2285
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:50,870
(He succeeded to blow out
all the candles.)

2286
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:52,670
26 seconds.

2287
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:54,650
- This is difficult.
- Why do my knees hurt so much?

2288
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,540
- His knees will get ruined.
- Why do your knees hurt?

2289
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:57,880
- Hey.
- Why do your knees hurt?

2290
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,120
You can do it.

2291
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,320
Bomi.

2292
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,750
We stand closer to the candles.

2293
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:04,420
Can I grab the handle?

2294
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:05,660
No, you can't.

2295
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:06,790
Never.

2296
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,320
Don't ever grab it.

2297
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:11,100
- Don't ever grab it.
- We become so sensitive.

2298
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,530
- Don't ever grab it.
- Get ready.

2299
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:14,870
Hey.

2300
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:16,460
- Don't step on the line.
- She stepped on the line.

2301
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,070
- I am sorry, but if you do that...
- Hey!

2302
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:19,280
- you will just be out.
- Oh, no.

2303
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,850
- It's over if you step on the line.
- Just go back.

2304
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:21,980
You will automatically be
in last place.

2305
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,110
- Okay.
- Go back more.

2306
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:24,950
- Don't step on the line.
- That's enough.

2307
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:26,120
I'll accept that.

2308
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,210
- Get ready.
- Okay.

2309
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,650
- Wait a minute.
- Go.

2310
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:30,710
What's happening?

2311
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,410
- What's happening?
- She put them out quickly.

2312
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,920
(The candles were put out
as soon as she started.)

2313
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:38,530
(Everyone stood up.)

2314
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,030
- She was too close.
- This isn't right.

2315
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:41,490
- Gosh.
- This is reverse discrimination.

2316
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,990
- She's good.
- This isn't right.

2317
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:44,460
Everyone agreed.

2318
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,030
- Everyone agreed to this.
- Still...

2319
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:47,770
Please decide it again then.

2320
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:48,870
- Let's do it from here...
- This is too easy.

2321
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:50,000
- because she's good.
- I could do it.

2322
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,570
- We're much older than her.
- Let's try it from here.

2323
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,170
- Let's try it first.
- Gosh.

2324
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:54,370
- Let's try it first.
- But this is...

2325
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,370
- Or...
- I'll try it.

2326
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,480
Let's try it first,
and if it's too hard...

2327
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,780
- Get ready.
- Let's try it.

2328
01:14:58,350 --> 01:14:59,370
Go!

2329
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:02,950
(Sabotage)

2330
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,060
(Despite of Haha's sabotage...)

2331
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,420
- What is happening?
- She's just good.

2332
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,360
- What is happening?
- She's just good.

2333
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,490
She's just good.

2334
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:13,750
(The candles were put out
within 3 seconds.)

2335
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,120
- How many seconds did I take?
- She only took three seconds.

2336
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,960
- She's just good.
- Okay.

2337
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,570
Honestly, you must give us
an advantage.

2338
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,740
I'm serious.

2339
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,410
Do you know how old we are?

2340
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:22,700
That is reverse discrimination.

2341
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,810
- The angle is important for this.
- That's good.

2342
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:27,310
- Good.
- Watch your feet.

2343
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:28,480
- Watch your feet.
- Okay.

2344
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,500
Okay.

2345
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:30,610
Okay, get ready.

2346
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:31,780
- I'm done.
- You punk!

2347
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,150
Go!

2348
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:35,240
(Go.)

2349
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,210
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

2350
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:38,410
It's over.

2351
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,250
Oh, my. This is just...

2352
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:43,530
(No movement at all)

2353
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:44,620
It's over.

2354
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,750
(He got the hang of it now.)

2355
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,420
- He's doing a good job.
- That's it.

2356
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,400
- No.
- Okay!

2357
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,790
- It's back on.
- No.

2358
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:53,570
Hurry!

2359
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:57,370
(The candles look like they
will get put out, but they won't.)

2360
01:15:57,370 --> 01:15:58,410
What are we going to do?

2361
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:00,280
- He got it.
- I'm mad.

2362
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,310
He got it.

2363
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:03,350
What are we going to do?

2364
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,850
- Okay!
- No. Put it out.

2365
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:06,450
(Okay! What?)

2366
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:08,910
- Okay!
- No. Put it out.

2367
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:11,120
(It's a supernatural phenomenon
that only happens to Kwang Soo.)

2368
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,820
Is this a prank show? Is it a prank?

2369
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,080
Is it a prank?

2370
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,420
(Flapping)

2371
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:18,530
He's going to be funny now.

2372
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:21,730
He's going to be funny now.

2373
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:23,790
(It's a never-ending desperate
struggle with candles.)

2374
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,200
- Okay.
- A new...

2375
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,240
It got put out.

2376
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,270
(It finally got put out!)

2377
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:29,530
(He gave his all.)

2378
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:31,110
Lee Kwang Soo took 42 seconds.

2379
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:32,910
- This will be hard.
- It's harder than I thought.

2380
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:35,170
- It's hard looking at him do it.
- Did some of them come alive?

2381
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:36,370
- It's Namjoo's turn next.
- It's the fourth person.

2382
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:37,410
Is it me?

2383
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:38,850
Make sure embers are
completely extinguished.

2384
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:40,280
You need to gather your hands
behind your back to do a good job.

2385
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,780
- Yes.
- Get ready.

2386
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,490
- Okay.
- Go.

2387
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:48,360
(Cheerful)

2388
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,450
- She lost her balance.
- She's bad.

2389
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:53,030
- Why is she drawing an eight?
- What's happening?

2390
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:54,660
Is she being serious or what?

2391
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:56,600
- She's serious.
- What is she doing?

2392
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:57,960
(She's putting the candles out
with screaming and laughter.)

2393
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,270
Why are you moving up and down?

2394
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:00,960
If not...

2395
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:02,960
Why are you moving up and down?

2396
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:06,670
(Why is she suddenly moving
up and down?)

2397
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:07,910
I mean...

2398
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:09,310
(No matter how much she shakes...)

2399
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:10,540
What is happening?

2400
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,670
- I mean...
- Aren't you going to do it?

2401
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,350
- She won't be able to do it.
- She got it.

2402
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:14,410
She got it. That's it.

2403
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:15,780
- Make long strokes.
- Yes.

2404
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:17,380
- Make long strokes.
- She got it.

2405
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:18,990
There's the last one left.

2406
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:22,120
Namjoo, you crossed the line
too much.

2407
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,620
- Namjoo.
- It's because...

2408
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,530
- It's okay. Make long strokes.
- there's a line.

2409
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:26,990
You just have to make long strokes
like earlier.

2410
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,290
- Make long strokes.
- This one won't get put out.

2411
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:30,120
- Make long strokes.
- It's really not getting put out.

2412
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,530
That one won't get put out.

2413
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:32,870
- I...
- Oh, my.

2414
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,660
That one has a long wick.

2415
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,070
Blow it out for her, Haha.

2416
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:38,310
(If Namjoo fans,)

2417
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,310
(Haha will try to put it out
by blowing it.)

2418
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:41,200
Blow it out for her.

2419
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:42,670
See? Do it again.

2420
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:44,540
Namjoo, you need to move.

2421
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,950
You need to be in sync
with each other.

2422
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:48,580
(Tiki-taka)

2423
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,040
- You can't do that.
- Yes!

2424
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:52,580
(They finally succeeded.)

2425
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,060
You got it.

2426
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,530
Namjoo took 1 minute 41 seconds.

2427
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:58,230
- This is really hard.
- This is hard.

2428
01:17:58,230 --> 01:17:59,420
Bomi did a really good job.

2429
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,490
- She did a ridiculously good job.
- This is hard.

2430
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:01,820
How did you do it?

2431
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:03,530
- I just shook everything.
- Bomi did a good job.

2432
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,830
Is it my turn now?

2433
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,160
He got it.

2434
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,740
(This is the result of Jong Kook
also shaking everything.)

2435
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,070
- What happened?
- He's certainly good.

2436
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:10,500
- What happened?
- Oh, my.

2437
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,630
Okay.

2438
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:14,070
(He succeeded at putting
the candles out in 9 seconds.)

2439
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,910
- I got it.
- I'm getting stressed out.

2440
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,780
I just need to be in second place.

2441
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:20,910
We will start taking away
age from first place.

2442
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:23,320
You can take away
as much age as you want...

2443
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:24,660
from 37 years,
the age of this restaurant.

2444
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,250
- From 37 years?
- Yes.

2445
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,820
- Wait a minute.
- Bomi, I beg you.

2446
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:29,320
From 37 years?

2447
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,230
How many do I have?

2448
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:34,960
(It seems like she's taking away
a lot of things.)

2449
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,770
- Okay, she's done.
- You look really light, Bomi.

2450
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:39,100
No, I'm not.

2451
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,810
- Kim Jong Kook is in second place.
- Okay.

2452
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:43,030
I'll take a look.

2453
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:45,240
I still have a lot. I'm full.

2454
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:48,000
- These are the remaining years.
- Yes.

2455
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,040
(The remaining years
after Bomi took away are...)

2456
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,650
There are 10 years left.

2457
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:55,350
(0 and rich)

2458
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:57,910
Really?

2459
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,380
I was more considerate
than you thought, right?

2460
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,450
(He's really surprised.)

2461
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,730
- She's...
- Your face turned completely red.

2462
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:05,320
No, I really didn't take away a lot.

2463
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,920
- How serious is it?
- I didn't take away a lot.

2464
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,790
I think we should put her
in an incubator.

2465
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,030
Does she have to get in
an incubator?

2466
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:13,270
Right now, she's...

2467
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:14,810
- I'm inside my mom's belly.
- Right now, she's...

2468
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:15,870
Is she inside her mom's belly?

2469
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,160
Gosh, this is really...

2470
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:18,330
At that rate...

2471
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:20,500
Our team has no sense
of teamwork, right?

2472
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,350
- We just have to win.
- Let's not do this.

2473
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:24,450
We can't win if we do this.

2474
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:25,540
(Jong Kook took away 6 years.
He's currently 16 years old.)

2475
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,120
There's only this much left?

2476
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,580
He just went crazy anyway.

2477
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:32,710
Can he walk or not?
Just tell me that.

2478
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:33,990
He can't walk in my opinion.

2479
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:34,990
(Toddling)

2480
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:37,080
He can't walk. He can't walk now.

2481
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,030
(The last person is Namjoo,
who is currently 22 years old.)

2482
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:40,060
- Namjoo.
- Yes?

2483
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,870
- Don't go.
- I'm not going to take it away.

2484
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:43,290
Namjoo, you won't be able
to take anything away.

2485
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:44,770
There's nothing left.

2486
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:46,070
Okay.

2487
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:47,100
You got it, right?

2488
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,000
There's no other...

2489
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,500
- I already knew it.
- Okay.

2490
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:51,630
I guess you can't help it.

2491
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,630
- We will give you your meal now.
- Okay.

2492
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,240
- It looks good.
- Oh, my.

2493
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:58,370
They gave us double portions.

2494
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:01,850
Okay, I'll eat this much.

2495
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:03,950
(Slurping)

2496
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,820
(Kwang Soo, who was 4th place,
takes away some naengmyeon.)

2497
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:09,660
Aren't you taking away too little?

2498
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:12,120
- Let's eat together.
- Okay.

2499
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,400
- You should eat a lot.
- Aren't you hungry?

2500
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,830
(The younger ones are moved.)

2501
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:20,740
I'll eat this.

2502
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:22,700
So...

2503
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:24,810
- Do you want some more?
- No.

2504
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:26,530
I'm sorry,
but I really like naengmyeon.

2505
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,650
- I thought you were full.
- We will also go there next time.

2506
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:30,110
I never thought that a baby
who can't even walk properly...

2507
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:32,020
could eat so much
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

2508
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:33,040
This is different.

2509
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,580
Kids usually don't like
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

2510
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,190
I didn't know you could eat that
in an incubator.

2511
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,780
Aren't you supposed to be breastfed?

2512
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:40,910
- I'm being breastfed right now.
- Gosh.

2513
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,420
- You first started with 177 years.
- Yes.

2514
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,920
You currently have...

2515
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:48,920
82 years left.

2516
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,120
We have a lot left.

2517
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,200
Let's go with 90 years.

2518
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,400
- This is unbelievable.
- Why?

2519
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:55,030
There's a cafe that has 100 years
of history.

2520
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,740
- What?
- It's right next here.

2521
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,810
(It's a race against time
from now on.)

2522
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,870
(Every team is beginning
to become anxious.)

2523
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,280
(It's an old restaurant war
with their ages on the line.)

2524
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:09,780
(Which team will be the winner?)

2525
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:11,820
(And)

2526
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,730
(November 2020,
The penthouse resident presentation)

2527
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:22,370
(It's a luxurious
opera performance for the VIPs.)

2528
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,830
(4 residential candidates
of the penthouse appeared.)

2529
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:26,700
(Kim So Yeon, Lee Ji Ah, Eugene)

2530
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,700
(Ha Do Kwon is also here
to go after Jong Kook.)

2531
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:32,110
(Their malicious fight to join
the top club began.)

2532
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:33,910
(Will they join the top club...)

2533
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:36,110
(or the bottom club?)

2534
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:39,950
(Their war of nerves is tough.)

2535
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,520
(There are only a few people
allowed to join the top club.)

2536
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:45,880
(Who will join the top club and
become a penthouse resident?)

2537
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,450
(The penthouse is
currently recruiting.)
