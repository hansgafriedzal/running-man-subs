00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,640
(One winter day when you want
to listen to ballad songs)

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,340
(There's Running Apartment
in a quiet place.)

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,710
Hey, good morning.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,320
Hello.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,690
It's been a while.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,280
- Okay.
- Hello.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,410
- My gosh.
- You all are here.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,960
(The residents of Running Apartment
are having a neighborhood meeting.)

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,030
- Hello.
- Hello.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,230
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,930
Is that how
a laughter therapist talks?

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,390
- He sounds like...
- Hello.

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,140
(HaHa: Unit 101, laughter therapist,
Se Chan: Unit 310, magician)

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,860
(Kwang Soo: Unit 306,
bar exam taker)

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,880
(He's full of laughter energy.)

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,310
Clapping hands is
good for your health.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,250
- Hello.
- Hello.

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,210
She's a simultaneous interpreter?

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,650
(So Min: Unit 208, poet)

21
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,650
(Ji Hyo: Unit 103,
simultaneous interpreter)

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,490
(A simultaneous interpreter doesn't
match her real-life personality.)

23
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,430
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please translate it.

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,990
Hello, everyone.

25
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,470
Is that right?

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,240
Isn't this modernized hanbok?

27
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,030
Are you a laughter therapist?

28
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,940
- Why is he a laughter therapist?
- I have no idea.

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,330
You should treat me.

30
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,270
- I have to treat myself first.
- Treat me.

31
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,710
- Okay.
- He's a bully.

32
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,970
- What?
- He's a bully.

33
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,970
(He's a bully.)

34
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,180
He's a bully.

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,970
- Are you sure you're a trainer?
- This is real.

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,190
- He's here to work out.
- He's a real trainer.

37
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,550
(Jong Kook: Unit 205,
health trainer)

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,220
What is Jae Suk?

39
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,360
- What?
- It's Hurricane Blue.

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,880
Hurricane Blue.

41
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,360
(He's full of rock spirit
in a leather jacket.)

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,390
Come here.

43
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,270
Jae Suk seems familiar, but
I don't remember where I saw him.

44
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,940
(Jae Suk, Unit 207,
indie band rocker)

45
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,000
Who are you guys?

46
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,440
This is how he talks
when he's wearing a wig.

47
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,770
- He speaks like that in a wig.
- It looks great on you.

48
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,140
- It's a habit.
- He looks good.

49
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,580
- I look good, don't I?
- It's not strange at all.

50
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,800
- It just feels natural.
- I've seen a guy like him.

51
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,640
I'm a little sensitive because of
my music. Don't get on my nerves.

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,440
- Really?
- You write your songs.

53
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,740
I'm working on my new song,
but it's not going well.

54
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,910
Do you want me
to make you wail instead?

55
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,660
(Do you want me
to make you wail instead?)

56
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,660
(He wants to help Jae Suk
find his own voice.)

57
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,050
- What?
- Instead of singing.

58
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,460
What is this guy up to?

59
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,550
You're working on your new song.

60
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,590
Are you a bully or something?

61
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,200
- What's that? What did you write?
- I'm a poet, remember?

62
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,330
Really?

63
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,140
"Music is magic."

64
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,200
(The poet hands a note over to him.)

65
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,710
- Gosh. She's a poet.
- I'm...

66
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,510
- I just...
- So she just wrote a poem.

67
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,510
- Really?
- She wrote about music.

68
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,300
"Music is magic."

69
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,870
And she wrote this
for the interpreter.

70
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,420
"Translate my heart."

71
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,420
- That's good.
- She's a crazy poet.

72
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,020
Yali yali yala sheong.

73
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,110
"Yali yali yala sheong"?

74
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,710
- What about a trainer?
- Isn't "Yali yali yala sheong"...

75
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,920
- a folk song from Goryeo?
- Anything for a trainer?

76
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,050
- For a trainer?
- Yes.

77
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,460
Like "You're a trainer of love"?

78
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,330
(The poet writes a phrase
for the trainer right away.)

79
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,490
"I hope I could
build up muscles in my heart too."

80
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,490
"I hope I could
build up muscles in my heart too."

81
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,860
"I can help you grow muscles
that withstand breakups."

82
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,590
They're good, but they sound like...

83
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,270
I've heard them before
from somewhere.

84
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,460
Abracadabra, that's nice!

85
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,270
They're something
that I wrote just now.

86
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,710
"Grow me muscles
that help me withstand breakups."

87
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,270
(Satisfied with what he said)

88
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,420
My goodness.

89
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,870
- The wig is so uncomfortable.
- Wait a minute.

90
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,810
- Did you write this? No, right?
- No.

91
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,420
- There are many sitting mats.
- This is so funny.

92
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,810
How many sitting mats are there?

93
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,550
I guess we have many guests today.

94
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,330
(Are we having many guests today?)

95
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,490
Se Chan, do you know
who'll be here today?

96
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,050
- Goodness.
- Gosh, Suk Jin's here.

97
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,270
- Good morning.
- Suk Jin!

98
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,090
(Suk Jin enters
when no one's interested in him.)

99
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,830
(Good morning!)

100
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,060
- Are you a taxi driver?
- Who are you supposed to be?

101
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,270
- Taxi driver.
- Who's he supposed to be?

102
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,400
Excuse me!

103
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,240
- Who do you think I am?
- Genie?

104
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,930
Are you a recreation instructor?

105
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,610
Excuse me!

106
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,370
- Genie?
- Who do you think I am?

107
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,140
- He's "Genie".
- Oh, Genie?

108
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,240
He's Genie.

109
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,050
I see. He's Genie.

110
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,920
Hello, everyone.

111
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,520
- So you...
- Wait.

112
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,620
- You should cover yourself.
- What? Why?

113
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,180
- This is in style now.
- But...

114
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,230
I can see things through your shirt.

115
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,020
Then cover them with something.

116
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,930
- I'm fine.
- You can see Genie's things too.

117
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,830
- Genie is always like that.
- Then cover them with something.

118
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,490
Yes, he's always topless.

119
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,640
- Why don't you use these to...
- Don't do that.

120
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,110
- Cover them with the Post-its.
- Don't.

121
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,040
But if you want me to, then I will.

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,680
- As you know, I'm your servant.
- Yes.

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,840
- Put them inside.
- All right.

124
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,110
You want me to put them in here?

125
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,270
Genie, I want to watch SBS.

126
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,080
- SBS?
- He's not that Genie.

127
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,310
- Not that Genie.
- No, he's not.

128
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,180
- Genie!
- Turn on "Banana Chacha"!

129
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,180
All right. How this?

130
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,360
(Ji Seok Genie
isn't that kind of Genie.)

131
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,160
I can still see them
through the Post-it!

132
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,250
Where?

133
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,530
- Post-its won't cover them.
- Don't...

134
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,660
Everyone.

135
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,300
Don't focus on things like this.

136
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,560
- But I can see them.
- Don't.

137
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
I can clearly see them.

138
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,260
Suk Jin's sweating. He's nervous.

139
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,240
It's because
the shirt is too small for me.

140
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,910
But everyone,
just don't look at them.

141
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,130
- How can we not notice them?
- I mean,

142
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,630
- they're looking at us!
- That's right.

143
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,910
- They're very noticeable.
- Don't mind them.

144
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,650
So let's start this.

145
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,110
I'm the manager of this apartment.

146
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,090
Yes, so if there are any requests,

147
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,790
- This is an apartment?
- please let me know.

148
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,110
- My goodness.
- Look at Suk Jin's face.

149
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,860
- He's overwhelmed by pressure.
- I know.

150
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,380
I think he didn't
get enough sleep last night.

151
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,620
Yes, he said he didn't sleep well.

152
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,050
- So he's hosting it today.
- Yes.

153
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,550
No wonder.

154
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,120
This morning, he screamed
when he got out of the car,

155
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,490
"I can do this, I can do this!"

156
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,930
So that was why you did it.
Because you had a big mission.

157
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,000
You lie so well
that it seems like it's true.

158
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
So today, we're gathered here...

159
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,980
- because...
- How many times are you saying it?

160
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,130
Wait a minute.

161
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,180
You be quiet!

162
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,280
- Ji Hyo finds this fun.
- Sure.

163
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,570
- Are you having fun?
- Yes, this is fun.

164
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,550
- All right.
- You're doing great.

165
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,050
Three writers are sitting there...

166
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,180
- biting their nails right now.
- All right.

167
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,490
- They're regretting it.
- So today,

168
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,320
you can tell me anything
if you have any requests.

169
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,750
- Is that so?
- Yes, I will fix it for you.

170
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,450
So should I call you Ji Seok Genie?

171
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,620
You can call me either
Genie or Ji Seok Genie.

172
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,990
Why don't you practice? 1, 2, 3!

173
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,360
- Ji Seok Genie!
- That's not it.

174
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,560
Why aren't you saying it?

175
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,670
That's too old-fashioned.

176
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,610
What are you going to do about it?

177
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,410
- Gosh.
- This is getting boring.

178
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,280
- Catch the mouse.
- Catch the mouse.

179
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,410
- Squeak, squeak, squeak.
- Squeak, squeak, squeak.

180
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,300
(Catch the mouse, catch the mouse.
Squeak, squeak, squeak.)

181
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,220
How many mice?

182
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,940
Three mice.

183
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,180
I got them.

184
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,440
(Genie was a host of a popular
show of KBS 15 years ago.)

185
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,120
(He's Ji Seok Genie now, but he was
the best MC in the old days.)

186
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,950
- How many mice?
- Three mice!

187
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,950
Three mice.

188
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,190
- I got them.
- I lost them.

189
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,490
It feels good to see you
play along so well.

190
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,560
Yes, he was good in the old days.

191
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,990
That's right. I was a famous MC
in the old days.

192
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,040
So we're all here today...

193
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,630
because we have to welcome
some new residents.

194
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,110
Let me introduce them to you.

195
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,980
Here are our new residents.
Please come out!

196
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,720
(Who are the new residents
of Running Apartment?)

197
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,750
- Here he is.
- My goodness.

198
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,810
- Hey.
- Jin Wook!

199
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,320
My goodness.

200
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,660
- It's Jin Wook.
- Hello, Jin Wook.

201
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,600
Hey, Song Kang!

202
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,800
(Song Kang: Unit 210, actor trainee)

203
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,670
- Gosh.
- You're here again.

204
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,170
- Si Young, long time no see.
- Back then...

205
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,860
- Do Hyun.
- Hello.

206
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,700
(Lee Do Hyun: Unit 305,
bar exam taker)

207
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,340
(Lee Si Young: Unit 309, landlady)

208
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,610
(Four leading actors of Netflix's
new original series, "Sweet Home")

209
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,510
(Thriller drama with a fresh concept
and strong visuals)

210
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,240
My goodness, Jin Wook.

211
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,850
So you moved in here?

212
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,220
- It's good to see you.
- Here.

213
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,310
Thank you.

214
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,660
They're giving us rice cake.

215
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,790
- Gosh.
- Have some.

216
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,250
(As soon as he sees Si Young,)

217
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,860
(teasing boxer
suddenly starts shadowboxing.)

218
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,190
- Stop it.
- Why?

219
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,320
Stop it and have a seat.

220
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,660
- Gosh, Si Young.
- Sit down.

221
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,170
You're supposed to do this
when you see Si Young.

222
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,120
(He'll be knocked out
if she really fights him back.)

223
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,040
- Just stop it.
- Why?

224
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,340
You two should stand here since
you're wearing the same sweats.

225
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,760
Gosh, you're a bar exam taker also?

226
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,500
- Why are we dressed up...
- What is this?

227
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,110
Why are we dressed up the same?

228
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,910
They're both exam takers,
but they look so different.

229
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,150
You can compare the two.

230
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,870
Do Hyun looks great.

231
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,220
- He really looks like one.
- Yes, he looks real.

232
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,420
How am I different from him?

233
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,510
Everyone, these are
our new residents.

234
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,880
Please give them a big hand.

235
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,250
(Welcome to our apartment!)

236
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,310
He's a bar exam taker.

237
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,990
Now they'll introduce themselves.

238
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,230
Starting from Jin Wook.

239
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,120
I live in Unit 206.

240
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,360
I'm a detective,
and my name is Lee Jin Wook.

241
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,060
- A detective?
- He's a detective.

242
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,990
I haven't seen Jin Wook
for a long time.

243
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,030
- Yes, he's right.
- That's not it.

244
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,690
He's on our show for the first time.

245
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,300
Back when I...

246
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,040
It's the first time I've seen him
since "Family Outing".

247
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,910
Yes, he was on "Family Outing"
12 years ago.

248
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,570
- 12 years ago.
- It's been so long.

249
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,800
- Yes, it's been a long time.
- Hello.

250
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,410
I live in Unit 210.

251
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm an actor trainee,
and my name is Song Kang.

252
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,480
Gosh, he's handsome.

253
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,570
Yes, Song Kang.

254
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,220
So Min's looking at him
like she's interested.

255
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,650
Actually, we've met before.

256
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,420
- Yes, on "Village Survival".
- Right, on "Village Survival".

257
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,590
- Lee Si Young.
- Hello, guys.

258
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,600
Hello, guys.
I live on the top floor.

259
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Why are you speaking casually?

260
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,260
(Why is she speaking casually?)

261
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,670
- She's the landlady.
- She is?

262
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,060
I should keep my eyes on him.

263
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,260
Aren't you a boxing trainer?

264
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,400
No, I'm the landlady.

265
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,840
Come on, you're a boxer.

266
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,060
Gosh, you'll get beaten up.

267
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,540
Stop provoking her.

268
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,110
- Stop it.
- What's wrong with him?

269
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,010
But I've seen her boxing.

270
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,200
No, she's the landlady.

271
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,210
- She's the owner of this building.
- I see.

272
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,810
- I should suck up to her.
- Do Hyun, you're next.

273
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,550
Hello, I live in Unit 305. I'm
Lee Do Hyun, and I'm an exam taker.

274
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,810
- His voice is...
- I know him very well.

275
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,620
- He has a great voice.
- As you all know,

276
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,630
Running Man raised Do Hyun.

277
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,630
You're right.

278
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,890
I'm right, aren't I?
What do you think, Do Hyun?

279
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,320
- Aren't I right, Do Hyun?
- Yes, it's true.

280
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,760
We raised Do Hyun ourselves.

281
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,960
- We did.
- Yes, we did.

282
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,090
(We understand how they want to
take credit for raising him right,)

283
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,600
(but the truth is,
Do Hyun raised himself well!)

284
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,010
We raised Do Hyun.

285
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,300
And we took care of Suk Jin
with fake nipples since infancy.

286
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,940
Yes, we changed his diapers too.

287
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,380
Right, we did.

288
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,710
I joined you as an adult.

289
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,250
- What are you talking about?
- I was an adult.

290
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,480
- Nipple Genie. Nipple Genie.
- Nipple Genie. Nipple Genie.

291
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,710
(He's Nipple Genie.)

292
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,160
(As they pay much attention to him,)

293
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,450
(he dances along.)

294
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,890
- He loves it.
- He does.

295
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,660
- He's excited.
- Just call me Genie.

296
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,690
He's Nipple Genie.

297
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,130
Jin Wook, how does it feel to be
on our show for the first time?

298
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,000
- How do you...
- What?

299
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,670
- Your way of hosting is old!
- Why? What did I do?

300
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,370
- This isn't the 60s.
- So how do you feel?

301
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,560
- I feel good.
- Do they normally ask that?

302
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,540
- I feel good.
- Oh, is that so?

303
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,510
Suk Jin, try to make him talk more.

304
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,730
- Don't listen to others.
- Don't.

305
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,280
- Just stay focused.
- Don't listen to others.

306
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,680
Weren't you two in the same
military base?

307
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,750
- Yes.
- Yes, you're right.

308
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,470
He was my superior
when we were in the military.

309
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,150
- You two must be close then.
- Sure, we are.

310
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,260
- What kind of superior was he?
- Yes, tell us that.

311
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,020
Just as you imagine.
He was quiet and nice.

312
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,930
- Really?
- He was nice to the others.

313
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,720
And he's more humorous
than you think.

314
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,930
Yes, I'm sure he is.

315
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,720
He's funny, but Genie
isn't good enough to bring that out.

316
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,930
He's a funny guy,
but Genie isn't helping.

317
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,500
He doesn't talk
when he's intimidated.

318
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,960
Why is he intimidated?

319
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,800
Jin Wook keeps shaking his head.

320
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,730
Well, to be honest,
Suk Jin is really good.

321
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,940
(He gives an empty compliment
as his senior comedian.)

322
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,050
Gosh, this is funny.

323
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,680
Suk Jin is so funny today.

324
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,570
Why don't we all have a seat now?

325
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,070
- All right.
- Are we sitting down?

326
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,810
I'll explain the rules to you.
Please pay attention.

327
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,120
Through today's mission,

328
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,050
you'll increase or reduce the number
of members who will get a penalty.

329
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,820
The race is called
The Apartment You Live In.

330
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,820
Through the mission, more members
could get a penalty...

331
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,460
or fewer members
could get a penalty.

332
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,530
If you fail, one more person
will get a penalty,

333
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,900
which means every member
could end up getting penalty.

334
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,100
Every time the mission ends,

335
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,330
each of you will go back
to your room and use the laptop...

336
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,070
to vote for the member
you want to give penalty to.

337
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,050
Gosh, they make us
do that all the time.

338
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,250
(They can vote for the person
who they want to give penalty to...)

339
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,340
(by writing a name in the chat room
during their free time.)

340
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,150
I'm going to write Genie first.

341
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,260
- Can I get a penalty too?
- It's okay to write nothing, right?

342
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,210
- I can't get a penalty.
- Why can't Genie get a penalty?

343
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,630
I can't get a penalty.

344
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,320
Instead of not getting penalty,

345
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,950
I have to take care of
all of your requests.

346
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,960
So I'll be very busy today.

347
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,930
But if everyone votes for no one,

348
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,270
then one less person
will get a penalty.

349
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,560
If you don't vote, one less
person will get a penalty.

350
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,930
- One less from all members?
- Then I won't vote.

351
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,010
Yes, from all members.

352
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,100
I won't vote.

353
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,940
(If every member doesn't vote,
one less member will get a penalty.)

354
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
But if even one of you votes,

355
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,750
the same number of members
will get a penalty.

356
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,550
And the members with most votes
will get a penalty.

357
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,890
Can't you read the script
prior to the shoot?

358
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,220
- I'm reading it for the first time.
- Yes, you're reading it now.

359
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,450
But they gave me this a minute ago.

360
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,820
- My goodness.
- So many times do you vote?

361
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,370
Only two times.

362
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,220
- You only get to vote twice.
- Excuse me.

363
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,060
- Anyone can tell...
- Genie, no one's listening to you.

364
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,230
- Hey!
- They're busy eating the rice cake.

365
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,600
I'm explaining the rules.

366
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,300
But the new residents and the
landlady brought us the rice cake.

367
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,430
- So we should eat it.
- All right.

368
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,150
Well, since you have ears,
just listen.

369
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,550
- What?
- How can you say it like that?

370
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,340
You only use your mouth to eat
so listen while you eat.

371
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,020
- Gosh.
- Just listen.

372
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,550
And when there's a request
you want to file,

373
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,790
- use the notes on the table.
- All right.

374
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,530
Write your request on it...

375
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,900
and put it in my mission bag.

376
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,800
Then I will take care of
all of your requests.

377
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,900
- Really?
- All of them?

378
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,930
- All of them.
- Okay.

379
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,690
- You'll take care of all of them?
- I'll do my best...

380
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,460
- to take care of them.
- Here is one.

381
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,800
- What did you write?
- What is it?

382
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
Maybe he wrote, "Please go home."

383
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,830
"Genie, get lost."

384
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,470
(Genie, get lost!)

385
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,050
Why would you want me to get lost?

386
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,410
I can't take care
of this kind of request.

387
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,180
- Really?
- I can't get lost because...

388
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,940
Can't you go back
into your magic lamp?

389
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,710
- Get lost.
- Go back into the lamp.

390
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,340
- In this apartment,
- Please get lost.

391
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,210
I'm being paid.

392
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,260
- My gosh.
- So I can't get lost.

393
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,130
Even the guests
can give me a note...

394
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,430
- Really?
- if there's anything they want.

395
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,590
Then I will be sure to take care
of all of your requests.

396
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,630
Because I'm Ji Seok Genie.

397
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,040
Suk Jin, will you go
wash my car then?

398
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,690
I can't do that.

399
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,460
- He says no to everything.
- But...

400
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,730
He's not doing anything.

401
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,830
It requires a lot of work, but it
wouldn't get me enough screentime.

402
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,910
Ask me something else.

403
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,750
What kind of Genie
cares about his screentime?

404
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,440
- You know what I mean.
- Actually, that sounds good.

405
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,880
It takes about an hour, but it will
be on screen only for two minutes.

406
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,310
Suk Jin, washing his car
sounds hilarious.

407
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,710
- Right? You should try.
- Write it down here.

408
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,890
- Put it in here.
- Put it in?

409
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,580
I didn't know there would be
so many requests.

410
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,760
I can't take care of all of them.

411
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,430
Who put this in?

412
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,930
What should I make him do?

413
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,270
"Cover this."

414
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,530
Who wrote this?

415
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,300
"Get a crew cut."

416
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,370
- Can't you do that?
- Who wrote this?

417
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,510
That's my request.
Can't you do that?

418
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,200
Why do you want me
to get a hair cut all of a sudden?

419
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,010
Why can't you do that?

420
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,070
I have my own style.

421
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,910
I can't do things like this.

422
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,810
- He can't do anything.
- It's not like that. Guys.

423
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,180
- He's giving you one.
- It's from Kang.

424
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,340
Read it for us.

425
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,980
This is from Song Kang.

426
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,620
"Please take good care
of the guests."

427
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,260
(Please take good care
of the guests.)

428
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,660
On our show,

429
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,530
- no one takes care of others.
- Kang said that.

430
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,030
- He really meant it.
- We all are on our own.

431
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,560
He's serious about that.

432
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,090
I'm getting too many requests
all at the same time.

433
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,060
- He says no to everything.
- I'll keep reading.

434
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,410
- Oh, this one! Who wrote this?
- What is it?

435
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,800
- This is something I can do.
- What is it?

436
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,680
"Please get me some coffee."
Who wrote this?

437
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,510
- Okay. Wait a second.
- Okay.

438
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,650
I like a request like this.

439
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,280
- He wants to drink coffee.
- I'm from Unit 208.

440
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,470
- He wants coffee for himself.
- I really like it.

441
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,750
Why? Is it his mission?

442
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,380
Why does he like it?
This is strange, isn't it?

443
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,810
- Really?
- You should order coffee.

444
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,440
I can make coffee... Hang on.

445
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,310
- Iced coffee.
- I can get you coffee.

446
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,390
Genie, make it one shot.

447
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,820
- What?
- Make it weak with one shot.

448
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,850
- Hang on. Did you see that?
- Make it weak.

449
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,690
Suk Jin said he liked it,
but he was just like this.

450
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,220
(He just spun round and round
on the same spot.)

451
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,540
- He was like this.
- What are the writers doing?

452
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,930
They should get me some coffee.

453
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,300
I gave you enough time
to get me coffee.

454
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,570
I kept running around in here.

455
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,070
You should get me coffee...

456
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,750
so I can continue my skit.

457
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,340
We just don't click.

458
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,750
He was like this.

459
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,120
(He just kept turning
round and round at the same spot.)

460
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,020
All right. This is what I can do.

461
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,660
- You're not doing it yourself.
- He's the worst.

462
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,820
Here you are.

463
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,630
- This is...
- He's the worst.

464
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,000
- Genie.
- We all want coffee.

465
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,630
You should give coffee to all of us.

466
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,170
- You will have some free time now.
- What?

467
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,300
Do we have free time?

468
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,770
For 10 minutes,

469
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,600
you can either vote for a person
to get a penalty...

470
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,670
or get some rest in your room.

471
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,880
Like Suk Jin said,
if none of you vote,

472
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,680
the number of people to get
a penalty will be reduced.

473
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,620
We shouldn't vote at first.

474
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,050
- We shouldn't vote.
- Then it will be reduced by one.

475
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,050
- Why would we vote?
- Otherwise, it'll keep increasing.

476
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,150
If someone votes,

477
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,680
the person who gets the vote will
be more likely to get a penalty.

478
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,080
If someone votes, the person with
most votes will get a penalty.

479
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,320
- Please go back to your places.
- Okay. Let's go home.

480
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,130
Make sure not to vote.

481
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,130
Okay.

482
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,930
It would be stupid to vote.

483
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,500
It would be really stupid
to vote now.

484
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,430
I wonder what's in our rooms.

485
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,330
- There's Genie's room.
- This is Genie's room.

486
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,730
This is Genie's room.

487
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,440
I'm wearing thin clothes,
but my room is outdoors.

488
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,100
- Okay. Let's go.
- Is this my room?

489
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,200
My place is Unit 310.

490
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,680
- Mine is Unit 208.
- They bring requests here.

491
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
(This is where
he receives requests.)

492
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,020
I'll receive requests here.

493
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,180
(He's being nice to the residents.)

494
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,480
I'll receive requests here.

495
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,820
Gosh, I've got a lot of requests.

496
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,220
Let me check them.

497
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,030
(He checks the requests
he's received.)

498
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,900
"Pick up my second son, Soul,
at his kindergarten..."

499
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,930
"and get me cheonggukjang
for lunch."

500
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,800
My gosh.

501
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,100
"Order jjamppong
and fried dumplings for me."

502
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,510
(Order jjamppong
and fried dumplings for me. )

503
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,050
Hello?

504
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,780
Is this a Chinese restaurant?

505
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,020
I'd like to have jjamppong
and fried dumplings.

506
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,340
What is this?

507
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,680
(What is this?)

508
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,930
What is this laptop for?

509
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,800
What's this?

510
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,400
(There's a laptop for voting
with a chat room on it.)

511
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,000
Gosh. What is this box for?

512
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,530
(What is this box for?)

513
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,300
(There are 3 boxes
next to the laptop.)

514
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,040
(All 3 boxes are locked up.)

515
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,300
I guess something's in here.

516
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,470
(All 3 boxes are locked up.)

517
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,010
(What's the secret of these boxes?)

518
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,210
This is strange.
Why are there books?

519
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,480
Let me see. What is this book for?

520
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,780
(All the residents have books
in their rooms.)

521
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,060
I can have a chat with others.

522
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,660
(They can chat online
before the voting.)

523
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,100
Is this how I cast a vote?

524
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,570
(Is this how I cast a vote?)

525
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,070
"Kim Jong Kook."
Why would she call me like this?

526
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,530
"Why would you call me like that?"

527
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,610
(He's giving her
an etiquette lesson online.)

528
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,430
"You punk."

529
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:33,940
(Why would you call me
like that, you punk?)

530
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,740
(I think this is
the room escape game.)

531
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,820
(Jong Kook, try to type faster.)

532
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,660
He wants me to type faster.

533
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,130
(He types fast with webbed fingers.)

534
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,900
- Can I create a group chat room?
- Sure.

535
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,100
(He creates a group chat room
without Kwang Soo.)

536
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,110
(Hello. This is a group chat room,
and only 10 of us are in here.)

537
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,410
(They have a friendly conversation
without Kwang Soo.)

538
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,940
Kwang Soo isn't in here.

539
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,210
(While the residents are busy
building a friendship...)

540
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,510
Cookies and iced coffee.

541
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,590
My gosh. Where's the cafeteria?

542
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,560
Excuse me.

543
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,160
- Come in.
- Okay.

544
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,430
- Hello.
- Hi.

545
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,250
I got you the cookies.

546
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,450
- You brought them here?
- Sure.

547
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,760
Please tell me if you need anything.

548
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,730
- And send me a lot of requests.
- Okay. Thank you.

549
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,790
It's been a while
since I sent my request.

550
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,760
What is it?
I haven't checked it yet.

551
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,960
Please tell me what it is.

552
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,410
I asked for jjamppong with rice
and a lot of pickled radish.

553
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,270
Gosh, I'm in trouble. Okay.

554
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,180
- Jjamppong with rice?
- And a lot of pickled rice.

555
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,270
- Got it.
- Okay.

556
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,620
Is it possible?

557
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,710
My goodness.

558
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:46,010
They could order
jjamppong themselves.

559
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,360
Don't they have phones
at their places?

560
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,220
(While Genie is busy
taking care of the requests...)

561
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,220
Hello?

562
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,830
I got a message.

563
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,430
"This is the chat room
to take a ballot for the penalty."

564
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,100
"This is the chat room
to take a ballot for the penalty."

565
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,200
"If you want to cast a ballot,"

566
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,500
"send me the name of the person
whom you want to give a penalty."

567
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,680
(If you want to cast a ballot,)

568
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,940
(send me the name of the person
whom you want to give a penalty.)

569
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,040
If we don't cast a vote,
none of us will get a penalty.

570
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,280
So I shouldn't probably vote.

571
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,710
I've never seen...

572
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,950
the members
keep their promises before.

573
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,060
But this time,

574
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,060
(He will trust other residents
and abstain this time.)

575
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,290
I'll trust them.

576
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,720
(If you want to cast a ballot,)

577
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,520
(send me the name of the person
whom you want to give a penalty.)

578
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,790
(Is it anonymous?)

579
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,700
(It is anonymous.
Will you cast a ballot?)

580
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,030
(He votes for
Lee Si Young immediately.)

581
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,910
(Because of Kwang Soo, the number of
people to get a penalty is still 1.)

582
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,620
I'll vote for Lee Jin Wook.

583
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,620
He's a great guy.

584
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
(Kang votes for Jin Wook.)

585
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,780
I sent the message.

586
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,820
(Kwang Soo votes for Si Young,
and Kang votes for Jin Wook.)

587
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,560
(The magician votes for Si Young
without hesitation.)

588
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,900
(At that moment...)

589
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,530
(The password of Box 1
is "1218".)

590
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,570
(Those who cast a vote
gets the password of Box 1.)

591
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,640
It's 1218. Hang on.

592
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,760
Do they give me the password?

593
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,410
(Kwang Soo also
gets the password of Box 1.)

594
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,410
What?

595
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,770
(The password of Box 1
is "1218".)

596
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,150
Hang on.

597
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,210
(He tries to open the box with the
password from the administrator.)

598
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,250
(It's open.)

599
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,280
What is this?

600
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,250
(What's in the mysterious box?)

601
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,660
What is this?

602
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,570
Can I take this off? What is this?

603
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,790
(1 R coin)

604
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,790
R coin?

605
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,430
(Those who cast a vote
got 1 R coin each.)

606
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,500
What is this?

607
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,180
This is an R coin.

608
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,410
I got the password
because I cast my ballot.

609
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,970
The password is like a benefit.

610
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,590
(The sweet benefit
of the ballot is an R coin.)

611
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,390
(Yoo Jae Suk.)

612
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,780
(Can I cast a ballot again?)

613
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,330
(He wants to cast a ballot
for everyone to get more coins.)

614
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,360
When you meet other members,

615
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,630
don't talk about the coin.

616
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,520
(You can cast a ballot
only once in each round.)

617
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,500
(The ballot in this round
is already over.)

618
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,910
I knew it. They wouldn't let us
cast a ballot for nothing.

619
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,970
(Kwang Soo found out that he can
get a coin by casting a ballot.)

620
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,180
There's something.

621
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,710
(Only the three of them
know the secret.)

622
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,620
(The residents are gathered together
after the short break.)

623
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,180
I won't send him any more requests.

624
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,750
I won't ask Genie
for anything anymore.

625
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,820
Why not?

626
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,220
He's a big senior,
but he got me this coffee.

627
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,450
He said, "Here's your coffee."

628
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,560
I can't do this anymore.

629
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,670
Hey, since when did you
care about things like that?

630
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,130
You should do it more for him.

631
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,400
You think? Okay.

632
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,530
He'll become healthy this way.

633
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,030
Okay. I'll do it for his health.

634
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,030
Sure. He should move a lot.

635
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,380
- Give us the coffee.
- All right.

636
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,470
- Oh, no.
- This is what I heard...

637
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,310
from the hallway.

638
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,970
(They heard Genie groan
in the hallway.)

639
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,880
Genie was sweating a lot.

640
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,240
I'm like your servant.

641
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,780
I'm not Genie. I'm a servant.

642
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,360
- Hurry.
- This is crazy.

643
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,360
The first test is called
Nerve-wracking Quiz.

644
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,220
- What?
- Have you heard of it before?

645
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,720
The 11 residents will be...

646
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,690
divided into 3 teams
of 4, 4, and 3 people...

647
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,340
- to solve quizzes of each category.
- What? "Catagory"?

648
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,140
- "Catagory"?
- Did you say "catagory"?

649
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,570
If you find fault...

650
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,070
- You're like this every time.
- People make mistakes.

651
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,530
I hope time will
fly by quickly today.

652
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,410
The host should speak clearly.

653
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,970
- It could be "catagory".
- It's category.

654
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,000
- You know what I mean.
- It's category.

655
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,180
You know what?

656
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,710
It seems that Suk Jin has to
deal with five of us...

657
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,620
- while talking for one minute.
- Please...

658
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,820
Please go easy on me.

659
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,320
- He's the Sirasoni of MCs.
- That's right.

660
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,660
- He's incredible.
- The Sirasoni of MCs.

661
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,630
- Ji-rasoni, you're amazing.
- Ji-rasoni.

662
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,280
You'll be divided into 3 teams
of 4, 4, and 3 people.

663
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,220
The category for Team One
is "Singers".

664
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,400
"Singers"?

665
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,870
The category for Team Two
is "Entertainment".

666
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,900
"Entertainment".

667
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,490
The category for Team Three
is "Common Knowledge".

668
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,900
Jae Suk, you'll choose
"Common Knowledge", right?

669
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,070
You should choose
"Common Knowledge".

670
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,640
Then Jae Suk and I...

671
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,340
- Yes... Why you?
- "Common Knowledge"?

672
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,810
Don't choose that. Are you insane?

673
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,240
- Exactly. Don't do that.
- Maybe that's best for him.

674
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,650
- He doesn't know anything.
- Hold on.

675
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,270
Don't you think it's too mean to
to call me insane...

676
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,010
- because I chose that?
- Don't be ridiculous.

677
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,010
He can't be in that team.

678
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,780
- Do Hyun, which team will you join?
- I choose "Common Knowledge".

679
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,280
"Common Knowledge"? Really?

680
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,390
- Really?
- I choose it too.

681
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,630
- Si Young, are you serious?
- You choose "Common Knowledge"?

682
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,930
- Really? That's unexpected.
- Si Young, choose "Entertainment".

683
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,520
- Sorry?
- Choose "Entertainment".

684
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,100
No. I choose "Common Knowledge".

685
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,960
- That doesn't suit you.
- Don't be upset.

686
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,830
- What's with her?
- Don't be upset.

687
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,730
- Why would you be upset?
- I don't understand...

688
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,870
- I think Kwang Soo is targeting me.
- I said nothing wrong.

689
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,410
Please sit with your team members.

690
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,430
- 4, 4, and 3 people.
- Where's Team Entertainment?

691
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,810
Team Singers, please sit
on this side. Thank you.

692
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,970
If even a single team succeeds
within seven attempts,

693
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,820
the number of people
to get the penalty will remain.

694
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,850
I see.

695
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,390
You have to succeed consecutively.

696
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,250
Team Singers, you will see a photo
of an idol singer,

697
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,920
and guess the group name
in three seconds.

698
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,390
- That's easy.
- It's easy to succeed.

699
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,830
- Indeed.
- It's easy.

700
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,570
Team Entertainment, I'll tell you
the name of an actor or actress.

701
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,330
Each of you has to say a movie
that he or she acted in.

702
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,490
I can do that. I'm confident.

703
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,600
Movie titles?

704
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,230
- Lastly, Team Common Knowledge,
- Yes?

705
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,410
you will take an open book quiz.

706
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,880
- An open book quiz?
- You'll receive a newspaper...

707
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,270
- from which the questions are made.
- I see.

708
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,120
Say the correct answer written on
the newspaper in three seconds.

709
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,650
- It's so difficult.
- A newspaper?

710
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,150
- Each member will receive it.
- Read it as much as you want.

711
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,920
Oh, my. Look at this.

712
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,250
It's too difficult.

713
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,780
- This is too difficult.
- They can find the answer in it.

714
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,290
Wait. This is an economy newspaper
for middle and high school students.

715
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,460
- It's too difficult.
- This is an economy newspaper.

716
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,430
- It's so difficult.
- From the newspaper,

717
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,070
we made easy questions.

718
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,430
We'll begin the first round.

719
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,200
- Okay.
- Okay, Jae Suk?

720
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,700
You can browse the newspaper
to find the answer freely.

721
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,110
- Do I go first?
- I'm sure Jae Suk will succeed.

722
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,180
I'm sure he will.

723
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,740
This isn't a tabloid.

724
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,970
Janet Yellen, the former Federal
Reserve chairwoman, has been...

725
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,210
nominated as
the Treasury Secretary...

726
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,850
for Joe Biden's cabinet that will be
formed in January, 2021.

727
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,420
Then...

728
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,630
who is Biden's running mate
and the vice-president-elect?

729
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,680
Kamala Harris.

730
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,330
(He said the correct answer
without hesitating.)

731
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,430
I knew it!

732
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,790
(Kamala Harris)

733
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,830
(Impressed)

734
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,640
Kamala Harris.

735
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,340
(Jae Suk, the undisputed king
of common knowledge of Running Man)

736
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
(The smartest member of Running Man
made everyone proud.)

737
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,870
We all can trust Jae Suk!

738
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,970
- My, he's so cool.
- We all can trust Jae Suk!

739
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,110
(Everyone is amazed
by the smart rocker.)

740
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,500
- He didn't even look at it.
- He's so cool.

741
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,380
Jae Suk, you looked so sexy.

742
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,420
(Jae Suk is enjoying
their compliments.)

743
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,710
He's a close friend of mine.

744
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,420
His pronunciation was also
very good.

745
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,890
Jae Suk, that was so sexy.

746
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,980
(Jealous)

747
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,510
Next up is Jin Wook.

748
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,980
Jin Wook, you have to succeed.

749
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,890
Jin Wook reads newspaper every day.

750
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,430
- Does he?
- You must not tell him the answer.

751
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,720
- Okay.
- How did he know the answer?

752
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,600
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
the global debt increased...

753
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,570
by 15 trillion dollars
through September this year.

754
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,530
There are concerns...

755
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,700
that many developing countries
will declare this.

756
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,110
What is this?

757
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,180
5, 4,

758
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
- Three...
- A default.

759
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,770
Okay!

760
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,010
(Smiling)

761
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,780
(Default)

762
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,540
(Amazed)

763
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,560
(Jin Wook got the correct answer
following Jae Suk!)

764
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
- That was awesome.
- My goodness.

765
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,160
(Even his brain is sexy too.)

766
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,160
- "Fault"?
- It's "default".

767
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,630
Right? It's "fault", right?
I knew that word.

768
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,790
- No, it's "default".
- You should know that much.

769
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,530
- Haha, that's common knowledge.
- All right. Good.

770
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,600
- "Fault"?
- Yes, "fault".

771
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,900
If Si Young gets the correct answer,

772
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,340
- this team will succeed.
- Then we'll succeed at once.

773
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,340
We'll definitely succeed.

774
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,640
- Si Young, you can do it!
- Si Young, keep reading it.

775
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,910
- It's not easy to make it this far.
- Go, Si Young!

776
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,110
Be quiet.

777
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,540
She tells me to be quiet
whenever I say something.

778
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,510
You did talk too much.

779
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,510
- I was cheering for her.
- Be quiet, Kwang Soo.

780
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,890
- This is also in the newspaper.
- Okay.

781
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,830
"Multi-personas" means to express
a person's various identities...

782
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,680
by transforming into
a different person.

783
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,520
Then what are the three characters
of Comedian Yoo Jae Suk...

784
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,870
who's shown his multiple identities
that were reported in the newspaper?

785
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,260
(What are the 3 characters
of Comedian Yoo Jae Suk?)

786
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,530
(You know the answer, right?)

787
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,030
What... Three characters
in the newspaper?

788
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,530
But it's not in here.

789
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,530
- Locust.
- Yoo San Seul.

790
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,650
It's in the newspaper.

791
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,180
- Yoo San Seul and Jimi Yu. Right?
- Really?

792
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,010
Yoo San Seul, U-Doragon, and Jimi Yu.
It's in the newspaper.

793
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,770
But this is...
This is common knowledge.

794
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,210
But this is...

795
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,090
- She should've known...
- What a shame.

796
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,010
They were so close,
but Si Young ruined it.

797
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,720
(Glaring)

798
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,290
I mean, it's hard
to make it this far.

799
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,360
Team Entertainment will go next.

800
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,990
The four of you have to
say the movie titles...

801
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,260
that this actor appeared in
consecutively.

802
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,140
- If anyone fails, the team fails.
- Okay.

803
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,870
The actor is...

804
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,430
Lee Kwang Soo.

805
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,680
"Collective Invention".

806
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,180
Darn.

807
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,610
What was that?

808
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,910
"Collective Invention".

809
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,270
(Murmuring)

810
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,710
(Is it that difficult?)

811
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,150
I was going to say
"Collective Invention".

812
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,710
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks".

813
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,390
"Once Upon a Time in a Battlefield".

814
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,620
- I'm relieved.
- "Atka Mackerel Seven".

815
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,450
"Atka Mackerel Seven".
You should've known all these.

816
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,780
What's "Atka Mackerel Seven"?

817
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,720
- Didn't you play in that movie?
- Hey, it's "Sturgeon".

818
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,190
- Oh, right. "Sturgeon".
- What about "Once Upon a Time"...

819
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,660
- Yes?
- "in a Battlefield"?

820
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,720
- It's "Battlefield Heroes".
- Oh, right.

821
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,730
I can't believe none of you knows
any of my movies.

822
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,170
- He played in "The Treacherous".
- Did you play in "The Treacherous"?

823
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,340
- I didn't play in that movie.
- You didn't?

824
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,380
I didn't play in "The Treacherous".

825
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,180
I thought you did
because you're so treacherous.

826
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,540
I didn't play in that movie.

827
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,150
- Kwang Soo, "An Eagle Family"?
- I didn't...

828
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,350
- Come again?
- "An Eagle Family".

829
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,420
- It's "A Dynamite Family".
- Oh, right.

830
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,890
Enough, you punk!

831
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,180
- He can't say any title correctly.
- That's enough.

832
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,210
- Just shut it.
- This is the hardest category.

833
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,520
- "A Dynamite Family". I knew it.
- Gosh. What do we do?

834
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,390
- It was quite difficult.
- You don't know any of my movies.

835
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,930
- It was quite difficult.
- Jin Wook...

836
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,720
swallowed saliva many times.

837
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,370
As if he was thinking,
"I can't do this with these idiots."

838
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,340
"These idiots..."

839
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,340
(Jin Wook was frustrated
by their childish conversation.)

840
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,140
- Kang, switch seats with me.
- Movie titles are confusing.

841
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,910
- Okay. I'll go there.
- What a shame.

842
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,880
I think I'll do better
in this category.

843
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,810
- Let our team try.
- It's Team Singers' turn.

844
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,350
- All right.
- See the photo and say the answer.

845
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,620
And then, the next person
will do the same.

846
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,180
Why am I so nervous
when this is just a game?

847
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,780
Here we go. Ready.

848
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,280
Get set. Go. Two.

849
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,120
- Turbo.
- That one was easy.

850
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,660
- Go!
- 2, 1.

851
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,560
- TWICE.
- Wow. He did a great job.

852
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
You're almost there.

853
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,220
(Half of them succeeded easily.)

854
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,560
2, 1.

855
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,790
- Who is he?
- ZE:A.

856
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,600
- ZE:A.
- Who is that punk?

857
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,190
"I can't stop crying somehow".
The singer of "Aftereffect".

858
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,810
- Who are you?
- He's Kim Dong Jun of ZE:A.

859
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,810
He's so cute.

860
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,770
- He's a member of ZE:A.
- So Min.

861
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,640
It's not the time for you
to compliment Dong Jun's face.

862
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,910
(She doesn't care about the quiz.
Love Frog just can't stop smiling.)

863
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,710
Jong Kook, move to
Team Entertainment.

864
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,540
I'll move to Team Entertainment.

865
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,780
So Min, join our team.

866
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,780
Ji Hyo, join our team and solve
common knowledge questions.

867
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,090
- No, Ji Hyo, stay here.
- Okay.

868
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,980
- Ji Hyo, it's an open book quiz.
- Stay here.

869
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,520
- No, Jae Suk. I won't go.
- Come with me. Give it a try.

870
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,520
- Give it a try.
- Give it a try.

871
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,130
- Just give it a try.
- Gosh.

872
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,570
She ended up joining
Team Common Knowledge.

873
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,130
I hope she gets a question
from the article she's reading.

874
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,760
You can just read the answer.

875
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,230
- You can just read it.
- I'll find it for you.

876
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,640
- Hey, submit a request.
- Gosh, seriously.

877
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,260
- Ask me to find it for you.
- She ended up in that team.

878
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,110
Suk Jin is simply trying to
get more screen time.

879
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,540
So don't mind him.

880
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,700
- The same goes for you, Jae Suk.
- Pardon?

881
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,510
I think you're trying to
get more air time too.

882
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,440
I'll help you find the answer
when your turn comes.

883
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,390
How about we continue
while they're reading it?

884
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,350
- Which team should go next?
- Team Singers.

885
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,620
- Team Singers?
- Yes.

886
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,710
Please give me a chance
to say something.

887
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,390
- Ready.
- We can do this.

888
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,390
- Go.
- Three.

889
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,990
- H.O.T.
- That's easy.

890
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,360
That was so easy.

891
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,020
- 3, 2...
- Solid.

892
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,430
- It's Snail, you punk!
- Gosh, it's Snail.

893
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,170
(Snail!)

894
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,970
- The answer is Panic.
- Oh, right. It's Panic.

895
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,110
(Snail will sing "Panic".)

896
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,270
I'm panicking right now.

897
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,270
(Snail will sing "Panic".)

898
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,510
He and I formed a duo
called Sagging Snail, you know.

899
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,970
- He's called Snail.
- I was...

900
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,380
- My gosh.
- We were Sagging Snail.

901
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,820
He yelled at me when he didn't
know the answer either.

902
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,920
Chul Min, Si Young wants to
try again.

903
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,950
Si Young wants to try again.

904
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,060
Ji Hyo, you can do this.
Give Ji Hyo double points.

905
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Okay.

906
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,220
(Chuckling)

907
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
(The embarrassing demand...)

908
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,720
(and the director's quick consent)

909
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,930
Hey, bring it on. Let's do this.

910
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,990
That's the spirit.

911
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,070
- Ji Hyo will pull it off.
- She'll pull it off.

912
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,430
- Bring it on. I can do this.
- Go, Ji Hyo!

913
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,370
- I've never seen her like that.
- Ji Hyo, prove yourself.

914
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,870
- Will Ji Hyo go first?
- Yes.

915
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,270
- Go, Ji Hyo!
- She's good at an open book quiz.

916
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,610
Let's overcome this.

917
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,640
Here's your question.

918
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,970
(Ji Hyo's challenge
for common knowledge quiz!)

919
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,440
In "Parallel Lives"
written by the Greek historian...

920
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,710
Plutarch, the name
of Alexander's horse is...

921
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,320
Bucephalus.

922
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,160
- Then what's the name...
- She doesn't seem to know.

923
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,250
of the horse Lu Bu and Guan Yoo ride
that can run 420km in a day?

924
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,360
(What's the name of the swift horse
that Lu Bu and Guan Yoo ride?)

925
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,390
(Let's go!)

926
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,430
You know the answer, right?

927
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:11,400
(What's the name of the swift horse
that Lu Bu and Guan Yoo ride?)

928
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,490
- Red Hare!
- That's correct!

929
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,900
(Throwing the newspaper)

930
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,070
(Red Hare)

931
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,230
(Ji Hyo got the correct answer.)

932
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,340
(Unbelievable)

933
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,150
(All the residents are cheering.)

934
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,820
Song Ji Hyo! Song Ji Hyo!

935
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,780
(Her success makes their jaws drop.
They give her a standing ovation.)

936
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,180
That's amazing.
She got the right answer.

937
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,660
Song Ji Hyo!

938
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,420
(The graduation ceremony of
the opsimath of Running Man)

939
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,830
- I did it! I got it right.
- Good job.

940
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,290
- Ji Hyo, you did a great job.
- She actually pulled it off.

941
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,020
- Next up is Jin Wook.
- She sure is an interpreter.

942
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,220
- She knew the answer.
- She's so smart.

943
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,430
That was sexy.

944
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,230
- She's so cool.
- Intelligent and sexy.

945
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,070
She's happy.

946
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,200
I haven't seen her smile like that
in a while.

947
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,770
- I'm proud of her.
- Ji Hyo seems so happy.

948
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,970
Ji Hyo, I'll ask you
about difficult questions later.

949
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,540
I'll tell you the answers.

950
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,540
She's so cool.

951
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,580
She'll probably watch this episode
real time this week.

952
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,820
(Her family and friends will gather
to watch the show together.)

953
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
Queen Red Hare.

954
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,250
Let's move on to Jin Wook.

955
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,330
- Let's go.
- Jin Wook, here's your question.

956
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,220
Jin Wook, please succeed.

957
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,520
(I must succeed not to let
Ji Hyo's success go to waste.)

958
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,750
This literally means to glare at
someone showing the white.

959
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,900
This refers to look down on...

960
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,930
Prejudiced view.

961
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,100
That's correct!

962
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,290
What was that? What did he say?

963
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,600
Jin Wook, great job!

964
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,990
He didn't even need to
look through the newspaper.

965
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,230
- That was good.
- He's amazing.

966
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,960
My goodness. He's so smart.

967
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,310
You knew that expression, right?

968
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,810
- It's written here.
- Oh, my.

969
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,540
I knew it would be in the quiz.

970
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,200
(The only person who can't smile
despite her team members' success)

971
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,940
- Si Young, you're up next.
- Sure.

972
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,820
She needs to get it right this time.

973
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,940
This is our last chance.

974
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,280
- We'll be better off giving up.
- Help me, guys.

975
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,450
Si Young said herself
that she had a lot...

976
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,360
- of common knowledge.
- Yes, she did.

977
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,290
- She insisted.
- If you get it wrong again,

978
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,720
you should switch places
with Suk Jin.

979
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,490
Oh, dear. Anyway, I'm ready.

980
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,230
- Get it wrong, and we'll switch.
- Sure.

981
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,760
- Si Young, here's your question.
- Right.

982
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,840
Let's see.

983
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,880
- We all need insurance policies.
- Right.

984
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,680
Which coffee house in London...

985
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,440
gave birth to
the modern insurance industry?

986
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,240
What did you just say?
A coffee house?

987
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,510
A coffee house. Hold on.

988
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,040
A coffee house in London.

989
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,040
(All she did was
repeat the question.)

990
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,320
You should've named
any coffee house you know!

991
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,360
Starbucks!

992
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,390
(Starbucks?)

993
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,930
- Starbucks is everywhere, right?
- Come on!

994
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,490
Starbucks! Unbelievable.

995
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,990
You should've at least
said Star Coffee House.

996
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,100
Si Young...

997
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,290
You should've said it
at least for a laugh.

998
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,790
Tell me about it!

999
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,460
- Si Young!
- It wasn't even funny.

1000
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,700
You should've at least
said Mindeule Youngto.

1001
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,680
- There are many shops to name.
- MY!

1002
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,930
- Star Coffee Shop.
- A punch is what you need.

1003
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,940
You'll get beaten up instead.

1004
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,180
You deserve a punch.

1005
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,580
Not again.

1006
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,150
Look at Ji Hyo studying.

1007
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,980
How cool!

1008
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,320
(Clearing throat)

1009
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,160
I haven't seen her like this before.

1010
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,320
(Ji Hyo reading a newspaper.
Who would've thought?)

1011
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,180
- I should get her a subscription.
- How about this?

1012
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,720
Let's give Si Young another chance.

1013
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,860
Team Singer should go first.

1014
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,130
She must be feeling bad.

1015
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,870
Genie, is the color of the mat
rubbing off on you?

1016
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,070
Unbelievable.

1017
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,230
It's like he's dressed
for a green screen in movies.

1018
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,070
- Can you see me?
- What?

1019
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,730
No, we can't tell you apart.

1020
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,680
Are you sure it's not
rubbing off on you?

1021
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,140
- Director.
- We'll start with Si Young.

1022
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,410
Si Young, Jin Wook,

1023
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,940
- and then Ji Hyo.
- Let's do this.

1024
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,140
(Si Young gets a chance
to redeem herself.)

1025
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,440
What's the distance between
Dokdo and Ulleungdo,

1026
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,750
the two most well-known islands
in Korea?

1027
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,190
What's the distance between
Dokdo and Ulleungdo,

1028
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,290
the two most well-known islands
in Korea?

1029
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,060
It's written in there. I saw it.

1030
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,600
- Where...
- It's on this page.

1031
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,730
What?

1032
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,830
Count it down for her.

1033
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,330
(Dokdo that is 88km
apart from Ulleungdo...)

1034
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,560
Seriously, Si Young?

1035
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,940
Count it down for her.

1036
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,160
(She fails to answer
3 times in a row.)

1037
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,160
- Seriously?
- Si Young!

1038
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,270
- What on earth?
- Unbelievable.

1039
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,810
<i>Southwest of Ulleungdo</i>

1040
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,440
<i>80km by sea</i>

1041
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,480
<i>- A lonely island
- A lonely island</i>

1042
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,810
<i>- The hometown to birds
- The hometown to birds</i>

1043
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,640
<i>- Despite others claiming
- Despite others claiming</i>

1044
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,270
<i>- It's theirs
- It's theirs</i>

1045
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,140
<i>- Dokdo is our land
- Dokdo is our land</i>

1046
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,140
<i>- Our land!
- Our land!</i>

1047
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,250
The answer is in the song.

1048
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,190
What's wrong with her?

1049
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,930
Even traitor Lee Wan Yong
would know.

1050
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,660
- Lee Wan Yong?
- Hold on.

1051
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,100
Lee Wan Yong?

1052
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,660
(Unbelievable!)

1053
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,790
Hold on a second.

1054
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,290
(No wonder the sly face
looked familiar.)

1055
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,060
(The insult leads
to an altercation.)

1056
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,870
My surname is Yang!

1057
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,370
You're Lee Wan Yong.

1058
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,540
Are you Lee Wan Yong today?

1059
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,870
(The laughter therapist
shows no mercy to traitors.)

1060
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,750
Traitor, get back here.

1061
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,870
I'm done with the mustache.

1062
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,810
Lee Wan Yong, you traitor!

1063
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,680
(He gets rid of the remnants
of the pro-Japanese traitor.)

1064
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,690
- Lee Wan Yong...
- He makes me sick.

1065
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,410
Anyway, I've been reborn.

1066
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,210
All right!

1067
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,190
Lee Wan Yong...

1068
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,520
"He makes me sick."

1069
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,060
- Let's get back to the quiz.
- Let's do this.

1070
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,870
- Red Hare!
- Red Hare!

1071
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,060
(They put their faith in Ji Hyo
and Team Common Knowledge.)

1072
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,160
Ji Hyo should go first.

1073
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,500
The Red Hare of Mapo-gu.

1074
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,660
- Ji Hyo, let's do this.
- You've got this!

1075
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,540
(Ji Hyo is ready to gallop.)

1076
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,910
- Here we go.
- Go, go!

1077
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,580
Novels are treasure chests
filled with vocabulary.

1078
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,710
What is the spelling
for the English word "squeeze"?

1079
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,080
S, Q, U, E, E, Z, E.

1080
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,480
(She even gets the spelling right!)

1081
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,910
- Song Ji Hyo!
- Song Ji Hyo!

1082
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,690
(The interpreter squeezes
out the spelling...)

1083
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,190
(with perfect pronunciation.)

1084
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,660
- Song Ji Hyo!
- Song Ji Hyo!

1085
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,190
(First "Red Hare",
and now "squeeze"!)

1086
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,930
Song Ji Hyo!

1087
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,120
(They chant her name
with the same thought in mind.)

1088
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,620
- Red Hare!
- Red Hare!

1089
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,270
- Red Hare!
- Unbelievable, Ji Hyo!

1090
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,410
(Proud)

1091
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,000
(They ride off like Ji Hyo...)

1092
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,580
(who only rides toward
the correct answer.)

1093
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,080
- She did it!
- Nice one.

1094
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,730
She did it!

1095
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,940
- No, wait.
- She did it.

1096
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,350
- Hey!
- I'm amazed.

1097
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,480
You're amazing.

1098
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,850
(Go, Ji Hyo!)

1099
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,910
You're amazing, Ji Hyo.

1100
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,690
- You did it.
- Unbelievable.

1101
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,890
(Finally, Ji Hyo wins the battle
against common knowledge.)

1102
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,690
- Nicely done.
- She actually spelled the word.

1103
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,580
(Thanks to Ji Hyo,
they're close to success.)

1104
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,750
- No way.
- I got the chills.

1105
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,960
She didn't even hesitate.

1106
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,520
History, English...

1107
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,620
What doesn't she know?

1108
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,790
She's a genius.

1109
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,190
The lady with a sexy brain.

1110
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,330
She must be
taking classes or something.

1111
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,100
Si Young must really
be feeling the pressure now.

1112
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,480
- That was so cool.
- Jin Wook should go first.

1113
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,140
- I'll read one more.
- Jin Wook's up.

1114
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,480
- All right.
- The man with a sexy brain.

1115
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,680
Let's go.

1116
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,910
What's the English word
for only seeing...

1117
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,620
people in a neutral way
regardless of their gender?

1118
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,350
- Gender neutral.
- All right!

1119
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,020
(That is correct!)

1120
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,390
Gender neutral.

1121
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,080
(Once again, he answered
without looking at the newspaper.)

1122
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,120
Nice!

1123
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,960
(Si Young collapses
on the table again.)

1124
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,890
Come on up.

1125
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,100
Okay!

1126
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,190
All right.

1127
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,440
(Joy is shared
by tossing him in the air.)

1128
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,000
Okay!

1129
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,160
The man with a sexy brain.

1130
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,580
Okay, gender neutral.

1131
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,500
- That was incredible.
- Okay.

1132
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,870
You both couldn't be sexier.

1133
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,410
It's like I'm watching art.

1134
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,620
That's 2 down, 1 to go!

1135
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,710
Si Young, you've got this.

1136
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,910
It's the final question of the day.

1137
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,560
Guys, get ready
to rise on your feet.

1138
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,910
Si Young must feel burdened.

1139
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,960
Here we go.

1140
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,460
- Oh, no...
- Si Young, focus.

1141
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,890
Focus. I got it.

1142
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,690
She's been reading this
for over an hour now.

1143
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,750
Adam Smith!

1144
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,000
Sorry?

1145
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,060
He didn't even ask the question.

1146
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,890
- I was just getting fired up.
- Here we go.

1147
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,160
Si Young, focus.

1148
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,790
Focus. I got it.

1149
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,770
In "Snow-falling Map"
by poet Yoon Dong Ju,

1150
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,410
who is "Soon Yi"...

1151
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,680
that he desperately searches for?

1152
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,540
- 5, 4...
- Soon Yi, Yoon Dong Ju.

1153
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,600
"Snow-falling Map"!

1154
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,750
(She repeats the question.)

1155
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,980
(Time's up.)

1156
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,850
Give her 10 minutes, will you?

1157
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,810
- Just 10 minutes.
- I'll give her 5 seconds.

1158
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
- What was it again?
- 4, 3...

1159
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,960
Jin Wook, what's the answer?

1160
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,710
The snow. The snow!

1161
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,930
- Darn it.
- Wait, it's the letter.

1162
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,190
- The letter.
- Let's get going.

1163
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,960
- The letter.
- Have a good day.

1164
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,870
(He's holding back harsh words.)

1165
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,640
The letter.

1166
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,730
Letter.

1167
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,660
- The answer is "our people".
- The letter.

1168
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,960
Seriously?

1169
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,270
Don't you know what a metaphor is?

1170
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,710
- It was a metaphor.
- So much for laughter.

1171
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,770
Why insist on being on
Team Common Knowledge?

1172
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,580
All you had to do is read it.

1173
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,020
"Our people". How hard is that?

1174
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,980
Why not sit around and guess
names of celebrities instead?

1175
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,580
Names of singers.

1176
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,080
- She's clueless.
- Sit down, everyone.

1177
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,850
Okay, I'll see you all
in the chat room.

1178
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,790
(It seems like the residents
have come to an agreement.)

1179
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,890
Come on.

1180
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,830
(Now 2 people will
have to receive the penalty.)

1181
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,770
- Unbelievable.
- What else can we do?

1182
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,370
We should open
another chat room immediately.

1183
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,770
I smell jjamppong!

1184
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,710
- You're right.
- I smell jjamppong too.

1185
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,980
Jjamppong?

1186
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,440
I bet you're hungry.

1187
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,310
- It's here!
- Your meal is here.

1188
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,850
(It's time to eat!)

1189
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,440
I see it receives applause.

1190
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,080
Take whichever you want.

1191
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,750
- We'll serve ourselves.
- Sure.

1192
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,120
You should serve this for us.

1193
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,190
Got it. Can you wait though?
There's quite a lot.

1194
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,350
Unbelievable.

1195
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,160
Suk Jin has never done
anything for others his whole life.

1196
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,500
- You ordered a lot though.
- Jong Kook...

1197
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,770
Of course. This is tangsuyuk.

1198
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,890
- Tangsuyuk's a good choice.
- Here you go.

1199
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,790
- Si Young.
- Yes?

1200
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,870
Here are fried dumplings.

1201
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,290
- They had it on the menu.
- Here you go.

1202
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,770
No way.

1203
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,770
Here you go.
It's what you wanted, right?

1204
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,500
- Can I get some wet wipes?
- Wet wipes?

1205
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,910
Coming right up.

1206
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,910
He must be the part-time server.

1207
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,980
(He must be the part-time server.)

1208
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,480
We're missing the sauce.

1209
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,310
He doesn't like it
when people tell him to sit down.

1210
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,710
- We wanted to dip.
- We wanted it as a dip.

1211
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,060
Are you kidding me?

1212
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,390
Did he pour the sauce over?

1213
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,460
(Sighing)

1214
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,660
- That's insane.
- We wanted it as a dip.

1215
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,690
How inconsiderate!

1216
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,250
This is plain crazy.

1217
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,330
We explicitly told you
that the sauce would be a dip.

1218
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,000
Who pours the sauce over tangsuyuk?

1219
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,390
No wonder that they say
"Beating is the answer."

1220
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,660
I mean it.

1221
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,160
(Beating is the answer?)

1222
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,500
Kwang Soo, hold on.

1223
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,810
Beating is the answer?

1224
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,330
- "Beating cures all."
- Isn't it "cure"?

1225
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,810
You do know that
knowledge is power, right?

1226
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,810
Kwang Soo's just as clueless.

1227
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,270
(Even Se Chan's vocabulary
is wider than the bar exam taker.)

1228
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,480
"Beating is the answer."

1229
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,770
- Beating...
- Beating is the answer.

1230
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,310
Here's some Coke.

1231
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,580
(Meanwhile, the genie
delivers Coke to the residents.)

1232
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,520
Here.

1233
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,730
Why are you pouring it here?

1234
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,560
This is rice.

1235
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,060
Coke and rice? Are you insane?

1236
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,620
- There aren't any cups.
- But the rice...

1237
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,430
- Just drink it.
- You poured it over rice.

1238
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,290
- Just drink it.
- Hold on.

1239
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,600
I'm busy too, you know.
I need to eat as well.

1240
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,770
What's wrong with you?

1241
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,140
Who pours Coke over rice?

1242
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,000
How many are angry with him
right now?

1243
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,870
Suk Jin, my gosh.

1244
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,620
(Anyway, I dealt
with all of their requests.)

1245
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,910
(They vote for the second time
after lunch.)

1246
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,410
(Kwang Soo gets busy right away.)

1247
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,620
(Lee Si Young.)

1248
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,910
I'm already casting my vote.

1249
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,000
What's this though?
"Books are the legacy..."

1250
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,430
"left to mankind by great geniuses."

1251
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,160
Why is this quote here?

1252
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,270
The books must be a clue.

1253
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,710
We opened a chat room
and left Si Young out.

1254
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,330
I mean...
I couldn't be more disappointed.

1255
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,140
(Se Chan, goodness.)

1256
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,310
Look at Se Chan.

1257
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,100
How many chat rooms are there?

1258
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,940
(Si Young was terrible
in the last round,)

1259
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,980
(so I thought we should
leave her out.)

1260
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,890
Si Young's been left out.

1261
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,790
(Se Chan tries something.)

1262
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,020
(He holds a video conference.)

1263
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,620
- My gosh. This is...
- No way.

1264
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,330
What's this?

1265
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,500
This is incredible.

1266
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,370
(While Se Chan pats
himself on the back,)

1267
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,660
(Kwang Soo gets busy.)

1268
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,500
(Si Young, there's a chat room...)

1269
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,940
(He tells on Se Chan to Si Young.)

1270
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,730
(Shocked)

1271
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,980
(Kang, So Min, Haha agree
about casting a vote your way.)

1272
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,140
No way.

1273
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,680
Se Chan made a chat room
and left Si Young out,

1274
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,210
so I told her that.

1275
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,710
This way,
she won't cast a vote my way.

1276
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,690
(Kwang Soo,
Se Chan did the same earlier,)

1277
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,020
(but left you out instead.)

1278
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,520
- Hold on.
- No way.

1279
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,960
Can you believe this?

1280
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,230
(Se Chan got caught
making multiple chat rooms.)

1281
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,290
I can't believe this.

1282
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,960
Which room is Se Chan in?

1283
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,730
(You made a chat room
and left me out?)

1284
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,000
Just a second, guys.

1285
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,680
Si Young's here in my room!

1286
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,140
(She's here in person
to rattle his cage.)

1287
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,540
(Streaming live)

1288
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,710
I bet you'll get a punch
in the side.

1289
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,580
(The scary, forced union)

1290
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Hold on.

1291
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,980
(Kwang Soo is going somewhere.)

1292
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,020
Hey.

1293
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,580
- Is it true?
- What is?

1294
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,580
Did you really open a chat room?

1295
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,830
- What do you mean? What chat room?
- "Si Young..."

1296
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,100
- Did you leave me out?
- What?

1297
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,430
- Did you leave me out?
- No, I didn't. Trust me.

1298
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,770
- Did you really do that?
- How could you...

1299
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,500
Wait. Hang on a second.

1300
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,770
- She's actually hurting me.
- Did you really leave me out?

1301
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,270
Hey, she's actually hurting me.
Wait.

1302
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,830
I think he's getting beaten up.

1303
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,370
She went to his room.

1304
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,100
Leave now.

1305
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,830
Can she take those boxes?

1306
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,710
- Shut it...
- You can't take the boxes.

1307
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,540
She's like a game destroyer.

1308
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,520
- You can't ignore the rules.
- How dare you?

1309
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,480
Do you all want to get beaten up
by her?

1310
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,580
Will you come to your senses
after that?

1311
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,690
She always does everything
as she pleases.

1312
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,020
Kwang Soo, hurry up
and cast your vote. Let's vote.

1313
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,790
- My gosh.
- Guys.

1314
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,560
- Jin Wook.
- Yes?

1315
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,890
The people in this chat room are...

1316
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:28,730
Ji Hyo, So Min, Haha, you, and me.

1317
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,370
So I think we should all vote
for Si Young or Kwang Soo.

1318
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,870
- I should vote now.
- I'm still here.

1319
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,480
What?

1320
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,750
- Hey, Se Chan.
- I'm sorry.

1321
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,210
I said, I'm still here.

1322
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,210
(His camera is turned off.)

1323
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,080
Hey.

1324
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,790
Kwang Soo, I'm sorry.

1325
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,810
(While the others are doing
underhanded things to each other...)

1326
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,850
I think I should vote for Se Chan.

1327
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,330
(Jae Suk cast his 1st vote
for Se Chan.)

1328
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,730
(Do Hyun also quietly cast
his 1st vote for Si Young.)

1329
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,060
(These 7 people voted
for the 1st time.)

1330
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,940
(He got the password of Box 1
after casting his 1st vote.)

1331
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,190
Oh, I have to cast my vote
to get the password.

1332
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,100
(He finally found out the secret
and opened the box.)

1333
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,500
This is so unexpected.

1334
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,600
(The 7 people who voted
finally got to open Box 1.)

1335
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,540
There's an R coin.

1336
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,020
(While Jae Suk obtained
an R coin in the box...)

1337
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,790
Should I vote?

1338
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,310
(If you want to vote, send me
the name of the person.)

1339
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:21,310
I won't vote.

1340
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,330
(He decided to trust the others
like he did at the 1st voting time.)

1341
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:27,850
(The 3 people who won R coins
earlier voted again right away.)

1342
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,560
How could you be so clumsy?

1343
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,190
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1344
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,390
(The password of Box 2 is "0128".)

1345
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,390
All right.

1346
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,000
(He's opening Box 2
as soon as he got the password.)

1347
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,330
(There's a mysterious message
with 1 R coin.)

1348
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:43,980
"If you want another benefit,
vote again."

1349
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,680
"But if you vote, there will be
another person to get the penalty."

1350
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,580
(He can get another benefit
if he votes again!)

1351
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,520
(He votes for Se Chan right away.)

1352
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,960
(He's like a train of greed
with broken brakes.)

1353
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,660
(The password of Box 3 is "9516".)

1354
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,460
Has everyone left this chat room?

1355
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,020
(He got the password of Box 3.)

1356
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,640
(He's opening the box hastily
hoping for a better benefit.)

1357
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,310
"Among residents,
you can find one monster."

1358
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,000
(There's a message with an R coin
in this box as well.)

1359
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,040
(There's a monster
among the residents?)

1360
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,270
"To survive, you have to
eliminate the monster,"

1361
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,250
"or escape before the monster
eliminates you."

1362
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,390
(Among residents,
you can find one monster.)

1363
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,690
(It'd be advantageous
if you kept this from the others.)

1364
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,250
(Among the 11 residents,)

1365
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,850
(there's 1 monster.)

1366
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,120
Who could be the monster?

1367
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,390
(Se Chan opened Box 3
at the same time!)

1368
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,000
He's voting again.

1369
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
(Kang also opened Box 3.)

1370
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,100
I have to escape? From where?

1371
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,410
(Only the 3 of them know
about the monster.)

1372
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,830
(Escape before the monster
who tries to eliminate the humans.)

1373
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:55,620
(Which of the 11 residents
could be the monster?)

1374
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,580
(The others don't know
about the monster.)

1375
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,910
"The residents must escape
this place in one hour."

1376
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,350
"Among the residents
who fail to escape,"

1377
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,980
"the number of people that we just
announced will receive the penalty."

1378
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,790
"The ones with the most votes..."

1379
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,100
"among those who failed to escape
will receive the penalty."

1380
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,830
"Below is how you can escape here."

1381
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,790
"Collect seven R coins,"

1382
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,160
"and put them into
the coin box in front of your room."

1383
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,960
"And you will obtain
the Certification of Victory."

1384
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,640
"Go to Ji Seok Genie
with the certificate,"

1385
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,540
"and he will take you
to the room of winners."

1386
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,810
(Ji Seok Genie will take you
to the room of winners.)

1387
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,140
(In the room of winners,
there are comfortable chairs...)

1388
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,520
(and all sorts of snacks
for the winners.)

1389
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,290
"If you find tickets
that are hidden in random places,"

1390
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,690
"you can enter the room of coins..."

1391
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,960
"where you can get more coins."

1392
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,100
I see. The room of coins?

1393
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,690
(The 3 people want to escape
before the monster eliminates them.)

1394
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:47,730
Okay.

1395
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,870
(And the other 8 people think
they just have to collect 7 coins.)

1396
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,770
(They all need to get 7 coins
and go to the room of winners.)

1397
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:59,210
(And the monster among them
will try to eliminate them.)

1398
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,520
(Where is a ticket?)

1399
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,980
Who could be the monster?

1400
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,040
(Who could be the monster?)

1401
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,910
Right now, my goal is...

1402
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,080
to get seven coins
and escape from here.

1403
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,750
(Get 7 coins and escape
before the monster finds you!)

1404
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,460
(They need to find a ticket
to get more coins.)

1405
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,730
- Kwang Soo, let's go together.
- Okay.

1406
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,500
Darn it.

1407
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,410
Tell everyone not to throw garbage
like this.

1408
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,660
I thought you found a ticket. Gosh.

1409
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,330
(Put your garbage in the bins.)

1410
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,350
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

1411
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,410
(It's hard to find a ticket.)

1412
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,410
(At that moment!)

1413
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,440
(Si Young came right behind him
quietly like she's shadowboxing.)

1414
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,520
Where is it? My goodness!
You scared me.

1415
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,390
- Why would you do that?
- Kwang Soo.

1416
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,520
- What?
- Show me what's in your bag.

1417
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,690
Why?

1418
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,350
- Do you have any coins?
- Yes, I do. But why...

1419
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,390
Give me just one.

1420
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:52,730
This is ridiculous.
What's wrong with you?

1421
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,190
- I have only one coin.
- Or do you have a ticket?

1422
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,940
This is no joke.
It's like a battlefield.

1423
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:00,310
Wait.

1424
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,210
She's trying to rob me of my coin.

1425
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,440
Why would you do that?
What has gotten into you?

1426
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,580
- She's so scary.
- Did you find any tickets?

1427
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,080
Isn't there a ticket there?

1428
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,620
- Why? What's wrong with you?
- My gosh.

1429
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,980
- Don't be like that.
- Come on.

1430
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,390
- You're scaring me to death.
- Right. I'm so scared.

1431
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:20,750
(Jin Wook, the only person with
no coin is searching for a ticket.)

1432
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,290
(It's not here.)

1433
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,330
(He doesn't have a coin either.
He has a long way to go.)

1434
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,560
How would I know where a ticket is?

1435
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,370
Oh, my. Oh, yes.
I found one already.

1436
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,830
"You want more coins!"

1437
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:40,250
"Come to the room of coins
with this ticket!"

1438
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,310
(Mission Ticket)

1439
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,770
Where is the room of coins?

1440
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,640
(She can enter the room of coins
with this ticket!)

1441
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,750
- Did you have any?
- No, I have none.

1442
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:49,480
- What do you mean?
- Pardon?

1443
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,690
- What don't you have?
- Nothing.

1444
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,790
(She just has to go downstairs.)

1445
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,020
(The laughter therapist noticed
her suspicious behavior.)

1446
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,830
- Si Young.
- You must have found something.

1447
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:57,730
- What is this?
- She must've found something.

1448
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:59,660
What's in that bag... Gosh.
You startled me.

1449
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,270
- What are you doing?
- Stop it. Why...

1450
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,370
(You startled me.)

1451
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:03,690
(Running away in fear)

1452
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,100
Is there something in the bag?

1453
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,060
Is it that big?

1454
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,210
Where is she going?

1455
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,410
- So soon?
- Can she do that?

1456
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,040
What's that?

1457
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,140
(The room of coins is opened.)

1458
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,640
- Is she going in there?
- Why? Why did she go in there?

1459
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,850
- How could she go in there?
- Si Young already went in there.

1460
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,940
That can't be.

1461
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,210
To get a chance to try
the mission for getting more coins,

1462
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,750
you have to cast a vote
for a person to receive the penalty.

1463
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,460
- Would you like to vote?
- Yes.

1464
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,830
I vote for Yang Se Chan.

1465
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,390
You've won a chance to try
the mission by voting.

1466
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:33,730
It's a can-rolling mission.

1467
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,560
Roll a can, and you'll get coins...

1468
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,960
according to the number that's
written where the can stops.

1469
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:39,410
I'll begin now.

1470
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:41,730
I'll start.

1471
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,710
(She can get 2 coins at most.)

1472
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,480
(She got no coin.)

1473
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,690
Why did you stop there?

1474
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,690
(Disappointed)

1475
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,690
I failed, right?

1476
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,390
You obtained no coin.

1477
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:58,730
- Where is it?
- You mean, the room of coins?

1478
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,020
- I can go around too, right?
- Yes.

1479
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,460
What... Hey, what should we do
to go into the room of coins?

1480
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,600
I read the instruction earlier,
but I'm confused.

1481
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,660
(He's writing a request
to Ji Seok Genie.)

1482
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,690
The room of coins...

1483
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,290
(Please give me a tip
on getting coins quickly.)

1484
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,500
The thing is...

1485
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,270
I'm trying to figure it out,
but the writer won't tell me.

1486
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:16,440
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.

1487
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,750
- I'm here to help you all.
- Exactly.

1488
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,100
I got another request
for a hint on the mission.

1489
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,080
Give me just one tip.

1490
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,580
Ji Seok Genie is...

1491
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,520
Entrance tickets are hidden
in random places.

1492
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,410
They have to find a ticket to enter
the room of coins and get more...

1493
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,710
Oh, I see. I'm going to take care of
this request.

1494
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,930
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1495
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,660
- I found out something.
- What is it?

1496
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,430
- Come this way.
- Your uniform looks too thin.

1497
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,790
- I'm very cold.
- Of course.

1498
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:39,690
- I should wear a jacket.
- What is the hint?

1499
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,600
- If you find an entrance ticket...
- I already know that.

1500
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,660
- Come on. My role in this game...
- Of course, I know that.

1501
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,270
Listen to me. My gosh.

1502
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:50,600
(Everyone else knew it
except for Ji Seok Genie.)

1503
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,770
You should...

1504
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,600
give me some information
so I can grant the request.

1505
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,410
Gosh, seriously.

1506
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,890
(Kwang Soo feels more impatient
as he knows about the monster.)

1507
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,850
- Of course.
- Really?

1508
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,910
(Haha is looking for a ticket
enthusiastically.)

1509
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,250
Si Young, did you...

1510
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,790
(He found a ticket!)

1511
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,190
- Hey!
- What's going on?

1512
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,060
Hey, give me that.

1513
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,370
- I'm the one who found this.
- Hey.

1514
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,370
I'll use that ticket. Give it to me.

1515
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,460
I'm the one who found this.

1516
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,770
(Groaning)

1517
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,040
(She's even using
grappling techniques.)

1518
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,100
Hey, stop it.

1519
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:20,210
- Let go of it.
- I found this ticket.

1520
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,480
(The laughter therapist
lost his laughter.)

1521
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,640
Si Young!

1522
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,210
(Head-butt)

1523
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,600
Si Young!

1524
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,180
(She dominated both of them easily
using her entire body.)

1525
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,520
I didn't do it.

1526
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,710
Leave me out. Leave me out.

1527
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,620
- Si Young is so cool.
- She's so scary.

1528
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,310
- She's too scary.
- No.

1529
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,080
You can't take that!

1530
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:38,850
(Let go of me
when I'm asking nicely.)

1531
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:39,930
No!

1532
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,020
- You can't... You can't...
- She's so cool.

1533
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,460
- Si Young, wait. Si Young.
- What's wrong with her?

1534
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,730
Why does she have to do that?

1535
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:51,040
There must be something
related to the books.

1536
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,460
Maybe I should collect
all the books.

1537
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,830
We should collect the books
and figure it out together.

1538
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,210
How could you have the books
all to yourself?

1539
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:57,440
Exactly. What does it mean?

1540
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,040
Try to find some words
to combine or something.

1541
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,500
Were these books in your room?

1542
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,710
The title of one of the books I had
had "resident" in it.

1543
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:05,020
And it was underlined in yellow.

1544
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,080
- "Resident"?
- Yes.

1545
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,020
(Jae Suk started looking for other
books after talking to Jong Kook.)

1546
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,560
What could this mean?

1547
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,930
(He's looking at the books
left in a room.)

1548
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:16,890
There it is.

1549
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,460
(Find the other books
with an underlined word!)

1550
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,190
Gosh. Someone took
all the books from this room.

1551
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,330
Come here and lift this mattress.

1552
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:27,460
(So Min has the books
that Jae Suk is looking for!)

1553
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,540
Check this out.

1554
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:30,910
This is number 205.
Let's start with this one.

1555
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,640
"One..."

1556
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,750
"Monster".

1557
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,640
- "You can find one monster."
- "Monster".

1558
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:44,020
(Among residents,
you can find one monster.)

1559
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,560
A monster? There is a monster?

1560
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,020
Did you see the sentence
the syllables make?

1561
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,020
We should combine them.

1562
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,190
- Did you see it?
- What was it?

1563
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,730
- It was something about a monster.
- Se Chan and So Min figured it out.

1564
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,270
- "You can find one monster."
- A monster.

1565
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,540
There is a monster
among the residents!

1566
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,660
That's right.

1567
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,680
There is a monster
among the residents!

1568
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,370
"Among residents,
you can find one monster."

1569
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,850
There is a monster
among the residents.

1570
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,120
(The residents become more nervous
upon finding out about the monster.)

1571
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,310
(Se Chan is writing something down.)

1572
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,620
(What is Se Chan doing?)

1573
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,080
(Se Chan leaves
as soon as Do Hyun comes.)

1574
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,620
- What did you write?
- Nothing.

1575
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,690
I saw you write something.

1576
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:24,890
No, I erased it.

1577
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,770
(He goes to the place where
Se Chan was writing something.)

1578
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,730
("Protein" is written
at Jong Kook's room.)

1579
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,910
Why did you write "Protein"?

1580
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,040
It's Jong Kook's nickname.

1581
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:39,000
"Protein" is the name
of the monster in our drama.

1582
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,310
("Protein" is the name
of the monster in our drama.)

1583
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,870
- What?
- Excuse me?

1584
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,180
What?

1585
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,350
Why did you write it?

1586
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,410
- It's Jong Kook's nickname!
- Why did you write it?

1587
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,210
Hold on. Stop cornering me.

1588
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,310
I am not cornering you.
Protein is the monster in our drama.

1589
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,330
- Seriously.
- Really?

1590
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:55,500
Yes. Se Chan wrote "Protein"
on the whiteboard.

1591
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,120
- What?
- It must be his mission...

1592
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,960
to write the monster's name
at each room.

1593
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,370
Gosh, I don't know
what he is talking about.

1594
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,640
Protein is the monster in the drama?

1595
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,230
Then Jong Kook must be the monster!

1596
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,180
Is Se Chan the monster?

1597
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,710
Doesn't it add up? Think about it.

1598
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,370
Se Chan is writing things
on the whiteboard.

1599
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,810
- What is he writing?
- Seriously.

1600
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:16,910
- Earlier,
- The name of the monster.

1601
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,210
- he wrote "Protein".
- Really?

1602
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,250
Where?

1603
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,810
There is a high chance
you will be the protein monster.

1604
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:23,910
- Me?
- Yes.

1605
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:24,930
Is there such a thing
as the protein monster?

1606
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,520
It's a monster that appears
in our drama.

1607
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,930
Really? What does it do?

1608
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,660
- It's just the protein monster.
- Really?

1609
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,930
- Hey, watch what you say.
- It's just the protein monster.

1610
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,830
(Jong Kook, the human protein,
feels uncomfortable.)

1611
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,640
Is there such a monster?

1612
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,690
- Yes, there is.
- Really?

1613
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,640
If it's a lie,
Jong Kook will go after you.

1614
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,940
It's in the trailer too.

1615
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,060
- Really?
- Yes.

1616
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,210
- Is it in the trailer?
- Yes. But...

1617
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,500
Are you the protein monster?

1618
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:45,500
Am I the protein monster?

1619
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,000
That could be the case, right?

1620
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,120
- There he comes.
- Hey.

1621
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,580
- Come here for a second.
- Come here.

1622
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,580
It's not like that.

1623
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,140
Why did you write "Protein"?

1624
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,210
I wrote it to tease you.

1625
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,460
He says it's the same as the plot
of the webtoon.

1626
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:58,930
- Last week...
- Jong Kook,

1627
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,830
he suddenly put his hand
in the pocket.

1628
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,290
I collected all the coins.

1629
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,330
Congratulations.

1630
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:07,160
A resident received
the Certification of Victory.

1631
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:20,890
(They suddenly hear
that a resident has won.)

1632
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,260
What?

1633
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,160
(Did someone collect 7 coins
already?)

1634
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,660
A resident received...

1635
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,030
(Hold on.)

1636
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,260
Isn't that your voice?

1637
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,640
I recorded it in advance.

1638
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,930
- That startled me.
- Seriously.

1639
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,160
That really startled me.

1640
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,010
- I recorded it in advance.
- Gosh.

1641
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,300
(Before the shoot today)

1642
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,780
(Suk Jin automated
all the time-consuming tasks.)

1643
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,350
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1644
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:43,780
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1645
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,640
- That startled me.
- Seriously.

1646
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,080
I was so surprised to see Suk Jin
when the announcement came on.

1647
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,260
I thought you were a genie for real!

1648
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,390
What was that? That startled me.

1649
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,950
I recorded it in advance.

1650
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,850
I recorded a few comments
because I was busy.

1651
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,390
Do we have a winner?

1652
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,600
It seems that way.

1653
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:02,100
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1654
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,370
There is a winner.

1655
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,260
- Is it Se Chan?
- Who escaped?

1656
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,870
- What is it?
- Come here for a second.

1657
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,800
- Something isn't right.
- Come here for a second.

1658
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:09,970
What is it?

1659
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,370
Something isn't right.

1660
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,740
Should I go in here?
Do you have a request?

1661
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,240
(He takes something
out of the pocket.)

1662
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:20,720
(The Certification of Victory)

1663
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,720
(Se Chan opened 3 boxes
by voting 3 times.)

1664
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:27,660
(He started out rich
with 3 coins from the boxes.)

1665
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:31,330
(In the 1st room of coins,
he acquired 2 more coins!)

1666
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,570
(Then he acquired 2 more coins
in another room of coins.)

1667
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:37,070
Through the mission...

1668
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,470
(Thus, he collected 7 coins...)

1669
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:43,240
(and became the first member to get
the Certification of Victory.)

1670
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,240
(The Certification of Victory)

1671
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:46,870
This is the room.

1672
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,140
(He becomes the first person
to enter the room of winners.)

1673
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,140
Congratulations.

1674
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,510
Please take a seat...

1675
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,990
- and eat tasty snacks.
- Thank you.

1676
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,050
- You can wait here.
- Okay.

1677
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:58,220
Congratulations on entering
the room of winners.

1678
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,350
Let's have a toast!

1679
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,430
That's impressive.
You became the first winner today.

1680
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,660
What's your role?

1681
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,260
I just show people around and stuff.

1682
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,970
- It drives me insane.
- Why didn't I get such a role?

1683
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,490
You are working so hard today,
Suk Jin.

1684
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:10,870
It drives me insane.

1685
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:13,100
They are making me do everything
I hate today.

1686
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,200
- Seriously.
- I hate running errands.

1687
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,240
How did it happen?

1688
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,870
I think they gave me this role
to torment me.

1689
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,100
(While Ji Seok Genie complains
about his situation)

1690
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,300
Is Se Chan done?

1691
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,300
He is done.

1692
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,220
When did he collect so many coins?

1693
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,680
When did he do that?

1694
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,280
How did he complete it so fast?

1695
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,350
We need to get seven coins
no matter what.

1696
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,180
(The residents become anxious
now that there is a winner.)

1697
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,550
Is this how it's going to be?
There are no tickets.

1698
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,470
(She finally found one.)

1699
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:44,260
I am anxious. Director, hurry up.

1700
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,390
(She received another opportunity.)

1701
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,570
- Please vote for someone.
- Okay.

1702
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,470
I am sorry. Se Chan.

1703
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,580
(She votes for Se Chan
to participate in the mission.)

1704
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,870
It didn't hit the floor.

1705
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,870
(She succeeded to catch the bottle
after it bounced over the ball.)

1706
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,280
Thank you. Hold on.

1707
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:03,510
- Director, did I add one earlier?
- Yes.

1708
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,680
Did I add one earlier?

1709
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,350
I added two!

1710
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,550
(I added two!)

1711
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:10,350
Look, there are two coins.

1712
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,330
3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1713
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,470
(Si Young collected 7 coins.)

1714
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,600
Please take this to Ji Seok Genie.

1715
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,410
- Please take me to the room.
- Yes?

1716
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,330
Let me see the certification.

1717
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:24,280
(She meets up with Ji Seok Genie.)

1718
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,080
- Thank you.
- Okay. Please enter.

1719
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,300
It's the room of winners.

1720
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,010
My goodness.

1721
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:32,550
(So Min was looking for the coins.)

1722
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,720
What was that sound?

1723
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:37,260
Why did I hear a bell?

1724
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,930
It wasn't me.

1725
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:41,390
It must have been the whistle.

1726
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,430
See? The sound didn't come from me.

1727
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,120
What?

1728
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,330
(Jae Suk stares at So Min
without a word.)

1729
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:51,740
I didn't know...

1730
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,330
(I didn't know...)

1731
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,830
you would come of your own volition.

1732
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:58,700
Please don't be like that.
Please don't be like that.

1733
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,970
It can't be helped.

1734
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,180
Don't be like that.

1735
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,470
I am the monster.

1736
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:05,240
(I am the monster.)

1737
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,580
(Is Jae Suk the monster?)

1738
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,580
(Jae Suk says he is the monster.)

1739
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,820
No way.

1740
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,550
- No way. Are you serious?
- Yes.

1741
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,490
Are you serious? Why?

1742
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:15,760
I am dressed in black.

1743
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,970
How could you be the monster
just because you look like one?

1744
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,600
(Was he picked as the monster
because of his looks?)

1745
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,100
That's so annoying.

1746
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,370
Jae Suk.

1747
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:27,660
How could you say
that I look like a monster?

1748
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,370
Then there is no twist whatsoever.

1749
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,280
I will let you off this once.

1750
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,780
That's your pride talking.

1751
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,970
(He finishes the skit
by acting cool.)

1752
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,870
That's your pride talking.
Jae Suk, are you the monster?

1753
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,950
- Of course not.
- Right?

1754
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,450
(Who could be the monster
that is hiding among the residents?)

1755
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,120
(Jin Wook found a ticket
for the first time.)

1756
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,580
All right. I will enter.

1757
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,200
Hello. What is this?

1758
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,700
You must vote for a member
who will receive the penalty...

1759
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,030
to participate in the mission.

1760
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,330
Will you vote for a member?

1761
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,970
Can I win coins
if I vote for a member?

1762
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,510
I won't vote for a member.

1763
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,200
(It's the first time
a member refused to vote.)

1764
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:11,240
(Jin Wook didn't vote either
in the 1st vote or the 2nd vote .)

1765
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,180
(He decided not to vote
even in the room of coins.)

1766
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,030
(Sitting)

1767
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:20,660
Please pick one.

1768
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,850
(Please pick one.)

1769
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:23,160
Please pick one.

1770
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,870
(After refusing to vote,
he is suddenly asked to pick one.)

1771
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:29,070
(There was a hidden rule
of today's race.)

1772
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,700
(You can receive a hint
on the monster's identity...)

1773
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:37,970
(if you refuse to vote
in the room of coins.)

1774
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:42,780
(Other residents have voted
without hesitation.)

1775
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:46,180
(But Jin Wook refused to vote.)

1776
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:49,580
(Jin Wook's belief brought
an unexpected chance!)

1777
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:53,530
(Jin Wook picks one
without knowing what it is.)

1778
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,430
"Investigation Log Number One,
witness accounts on the monster".

1779
01:00:56,430 --> 01:01:01,030
(Investigation Log Number 1,
witness accounts on the monster)

1780
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:05,570
(Hyo Im: The monster is a man.)

1781
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:09,580
(According to the Investigation Log,
the monster is a man.)

1782
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:13,140
(There are 7 men besides Se Chan
who have already won.)

1783
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,410
Congratulations. A resident received
the Certification of Victory.

1784
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,510
It's the room of winners.

1785
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:20,220
(More residents receive
the Certification of Victory.)

1786
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,240
- I am here.
- Here.

1787
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,350
It's this room.

1788
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,620
This is incredible.

1789
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,180
(After Song Kang,
residents enter one after another.)

1790
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,990
Here comes another resident.

1791
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:32,220
(Jin Wook figured out a way
to receive the hints.)

1792
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,930
(He focuses on searching
for the tickets.)

1793
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,030
(He finds a ticket.)

1794
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,510
(He enters the room of coins
with ease this time.)

1795
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:44,830
I won't vote.

1796
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:45,970
(I won't vote.)

1797
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,140
(He receives another hint...)

1798
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,180
A hint.

1799
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,410
(by refusing to vote.)

1800
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:53,390
(What could be the second hint?)

1801
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:59,450
(Ga Eun:
The monster was born in April.)

1802
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,660
(Five men are remaining.)

1803
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,550
(Do Hyun and Jong Kook
were born in April!)

1804
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:07,030
(Could one of them be the monster?)

1805
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:09,430
What are you doing here?

1806
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,370
I am looking for tickets.

1807
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:13,530
- Did you find a lot?
- No.

1808
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,740
- I didn't find a single ticket.
- This is driving me crazy.

1809
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,930
I looked everywhere.

1810
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:23,350
(Do Hyun stops in his track
with a serious expression.)

1811
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,240
What is up
with that facial expression?

1812
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,850
(What is going on?)

1813
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,010
What?

1814
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,220
Are you the monster?

1815
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,330
You are the monster, right?

1816
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:37,100
I am not the monster.

1817
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,570
Didn't you receive something?
You must have a mission.

1818
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,120
No.

1819
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,970
I don't understand
how Se Chan escaped...

1820
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,700
when he was writing things
on the whiteboard.

1821
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,140
I guess Se Chan wasn't the monster.

1822
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,570
Then you must be the monster.

1823
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,530
- Why?
- "Collective Invention".

1824
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,370
You...

1825
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:54,100
(I can't believe you.)

1826
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,120
I am the fish-man in that movie,
not a monster.

1827
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,120
- The fish-man.
- The fish-man.

1828
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,950
(Jin Wook searches everywhere
for another ticket.)

1829
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,180
(While looking at the desk,)

1830
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,450
(he moves in a hurry.)

1831
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,620
(This laptop...)

1832
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:11,800
(stayed with the members
since morning.)

1833
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:15,120
(Does the laptop contain
information?)

1834
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:19,330
(He sees something.)

1835
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,200
(The laptop is locked
with a password.)

1836
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,030
(Hint for the password)

1837
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:29,450
(What does the hint mean?)

1838
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:30,550
The hint.

1839
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:33,490
(Jin Wook studies the notebook
for a while.)

1840
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:37,180
(Then he goes through the rooms.)

1841
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,720
- Jin Wook.
- Yes?

1842
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:41,660
You know something, right?

1843
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,760
No, I don't have a clue.

1844
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,390
Putting the books together...

1845
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,570
You are looking for books.

1846
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,100
- The number...
- You need a number, right?

1847
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,140
That's right.

1848
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,280
- You aren't the monster, are you?
- No.

1849
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:58,430
I can't be the monster.

1850
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,350
I know the number.

1851
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:02,970
(I know the number.)

1852
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,970
(Does Jae Suk know the number?)

1853
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,140
Avoiding the penalty
isn't the end of it.

1854
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,740
It's here.

1855
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,180
(While looking for the hints,)

1856
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,180
All the books are here.

1857
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,620
(Jae Suk put the books together.)

1858
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,200
(If you put the books
in the order of the room number,)

1859
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:18,450
2028.

1860
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,470
(you get four numbers
at the bottom.)

1861
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,930
What does 2028 mean?

1862
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:27,330
(Jae Suk didn't know
the purpose of the number.)

1863
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,010
What is the number for?

1864
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,470
- Shall we work together?
- That's right.

1865
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:32,510
Okay.

1866
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,550
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1867
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,080
- You aren't the monster, are you?
- Of course not.

1868
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:42,720
(They enter in 2028.)

1869
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,120
(The laptop becomes unlocked.)

1870
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,490
"Only those who received
the Certification of Victory..."

1871
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,950
"by collecting seven coins
become the monster's targets."

1872
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:55,200
Collecting seven coins
makes you a target.

1873
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,530
(The secret behind today's race)

1874
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:04,300
(They could make
fewer people receive the penalty.)

1875
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,370
(To receive coins,)

1876
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:11,970
(some residents voted for the others
to receive the penalty.)

1877
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:14,890
(For the tickets,)

1878
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:18,450
(they even had scuffles.)

1879
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:26,030
(As a reward, they won
the Certification of Victory.)

1880
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:28,660
(But the Certification of Victory
actually is...)

1881
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,990
(the Certification of Greed.)

1882
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,300
What?

1883
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,830
(Se Chan was the first to receive
the Certification of Greed.)

1884
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,510
(He got eliminated by the monster
that feeds on greed.)

1885
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,450
(The other residents who entered
the room of winners...)

1886
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:42,450
(became the monster's targets
as well.)

1887
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:44,240
You are out.

1888
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,320
What?

1889
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,910
(The greedy residents met
a tragic end.)

1890
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,350
I see.

1891
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,080
The message is that you die...

1892
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,450
if you live selfishly.

1893
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,550
(The second piece of information
in the memo)

1894
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,120
"The monster's name tag..."

1895
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,530
"contains the password of the exit
for humans' survival."

1896
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,570
"Rip off the monster's name tag
to acquire the password."

1897
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:06,570
(Humans win if they get the password
and escape through the exit.)

1898
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,260
We need to eliminate the monster.

1899
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,870
Who could the monster be?

1900
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:14,470
(Humans win if they avoid the coins
and rip off the monster's name tag.)

1901
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:18,550
(Hiding behind the secret identity,
the monster takes out the winners.)

1902
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:21,010
(The hints suggest...)

1903
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,410
(that Jong Kook and Do Hyun are
the monster candidates.)

1904
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,680
Where did you receive
so much information?

1905
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:29,430
I didn't vote for a member.

1906
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:31,660
(He didn't vote for a member
in the room of coins.)

1907
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:32,970
That way, I received a hint.

1908
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:36,830
This game teaches you
various lessons.

1909
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,490
My goodness.

1910
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,070
You shouldn't desert the others...

1911
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,410
no matter what.

1912
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,740
Will you vote?

1913
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:45,600
No, I won't vote.

1914
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,850
Please pick one.

1915
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,580
Gosh, I should have done this
from the start.

1916
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:53,320
(He looks back on the days
he was busy voting.)

1917
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:54,890
"Witness accounts on the monster".

1918
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:55,910
(Jae Suk receives
the Investigation Log as well.)

1919
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,450
(Investigation Log Number 1,
witness accounts on the monster)

1920
01:06:57,450 --> 01:07:02,490
(A Reum:
The monster is among the guests.)

1921
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:03,530
I won't vote.

1922
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:04,830
(Upon receiving the tip-off,
Ji Hyo refused to vote as well.)

1923
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:06,600
This is why you shouldn't be greedy.

1924
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,720
(What does her hint say?)

1925
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,720
This is driving me crazy.

1926
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,660
"The monster isn't wearing glasses."

1927
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,600
(Yeon Ju:
The monster isn't wearing glasses.)

1928
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,200
(Investigation Log Number 1,
witness accounts on the monster)

1929
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,780
(The only member who fits
the witness accounts is...)

1930
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,870
That means the monster is Do Hyun.

1931
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:22,100
(Lee Do Hyun.)

1932
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,450
(All the hints point to Do Hyun.)

1933
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,550
- Hey!
- Yes?

1934
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,450
- He wasn't born in April, right?
- That's right.

1935
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:31,680
I wasn't born in April.

1936
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,430
Do Hyun, were you born in April?

1937
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:34,550
Yes.

1938
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,430
- Jong Kook was born in April.
- I was born in April.

1939
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:41,700
(Jong Kook was born in April,
but the monster is a guest.)

1940
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,660
(What are you doing?)

1941
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,570
(Ripping off)

1942
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:50,180
(Do Hyun is out.)

1943
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,300
You are the monster, right?

1944
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,850
You are the monster, right?

1945
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,320
(Four hints pointed to Do Hyun.
What's his identity?)

1946
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,450
What was that?

1947
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,740
- You are the monster.
- I am not the monster!

1948
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:01,910
What?

1949
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,160
(Isn't Do Hyun the monster?)

1950
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,910
I mean... I mean...

1951
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:08,120
Aren't you the monster?

1952
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,850
(All the hints pointed to Do Hyun.)

1953
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:13,370
(But Do Hyun was a human.)

1954
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:15,720
(Sad)

1955
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,870
I mean...

1956
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:18,140
All right.

1957
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,510
(At that moment)

1958
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,700
We will give a coin to Jin Wook.

1959
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:22,830
- What?
- What?

1960
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:24,530
- Why?
- Why does he get a coin?

1961
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,780
Why?

1962
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,640
- You ripped off the wrong name tag.
- What is going on?

1963
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,300
- What?
- Why does he get a coin?

1964
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:31,010
- I don't know.
- The race will continue.

1965
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,670
I don't know.

1966
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:33,880
What is going on?

1967
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,420
So Do Hyun isn't the monster?

1968
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,680
(Jin Wook knows that coins
will get him closer to elimination.)

1969
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:39,460
- What?
- Why does he get a coin?

1970
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,030
- I don't know.
- The race will continue.

1971
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:42,920
- I don't know.
- Are you the monster?

1972
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,530
I am not.

1973
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:45,920
The hint said
the monster is among the guests.

1974
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,920
I am not the monster.

1975
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:50,570
So Do Hyun isn't the monster?

1976
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,800
(Who is the real monster?)

1977
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:58,740
(The eliminated members: Se Chan,
Si Young, Song Kang, Haha, Do Hyun)

1978
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,410
I should gather more hints.

1979
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,100
I think...

1980
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,170
My goodness.

1981
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,920
I found it.

1982
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,380
(She finds a ticket
for the room of coins.)

1983
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,490
Let's hurry up and go.

1984
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:11,290
(She picks the Investigation Log.)

1985
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:12,380
(What will it say?)

1986
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,660
"Investigation Log Number One,
witness accounts on the monster".

1987
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:17,960
Hold on.

1988
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,760
(I get it now!)

1989
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:22,330
Guys! Guys! Guys!

1990
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:23,760
Guys! Hold on.

1991
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,870
Did you find a hint?

1992
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,240
Listen.

1993
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,600
Seo Rim, Yeon Kyung...

1994
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:30,300
"A Reum is lying."

1995
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,000
- "A Reum is lying."
- A Reum?

1996
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,580
(Investigation Result:
Among them, A Reum is lying.)

1997
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:40,420
(A Reum:
The monster is among the guests.)

1998
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:41,450
It's a lie.

1999
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:43,120
The monster isn't among the guests.

2000
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,120
(A Reum's witness account is a lie,)

2001
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,120
(so the monster isn't
among the guests.)

2002
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,350
- A Reum?
- Earlier...

2003
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,530
What was A Reum's witness account?

2004
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:48,590
Where is it?

2005
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,030
Then the monster is among us.

2006
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:51,660
Then I am the only one
who fits the description.

2007
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:54,630
You are the only one.

2008
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:56,130
- Jong Kook.
- While that's the case...

2009
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:58,430
You are the only one
who fits the description.

2010
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,210
- Let's rip off his name tag.
- I am the monster?

2011
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:01,240
(Jong Kook denies it vehemently.)

2012
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:04,000
(What's his identity?)

2013
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,300
(Panting)

2014
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,470
No! That's not enough!

2015
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:10,820
More. More.

2016
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,750
More.

2017
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,340
I love it.

2018
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:15,840
I love it.

2019
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,250
(While pumping up his muscles,)

2020
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,750
Who is it this time?

2021
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,130
(Jong Kook receives a call.)

2022
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,250
Hello.

2023
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,790
You couldn't suppress your desire
for muscle growth.

2024
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:26,290
You will turn into a monster
from this moment.

2025
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,760
What are you talking about?
My muscles are being well-fed now.

2026
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,840
Gosh.

2027
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:33,340
No, it's not enough.

2028
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:34,930
(He starts lifting weights after
hanging up the mysterious call.)

2029
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,580
(But...)

2030
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:43,120
(He turns into a muscle growing
monster with high skit engagement.)

2031
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,170
(A protein monster was
born like that.)

2032
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:49,040
You will win if you induce
the residents to give in to desire,

2033
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,250
and put out eight humans.

2034
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,420
(Induce 8 humans to give in
to desire, and put them out.)

2035
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:54,960
They shouldn't be hidden too well.

2036
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,350
(He relocates the tickets so he can
arouse the desire of humans.)

2037
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:57,420
Okay.

2038
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,250
(He relocates the tickets so he can
arouse the desire of humans.)

2039
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,700
That's it.

2040
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,090
(He must enter the room of coins
from time to time...)

2041
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,340
(to avoid suspicion.)

2042
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:05,570
I'm a monster,
so I can't do it anyway.

2043
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:07,870
(Grinning)

2044
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:08,870
Okay, I got it.

2045
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,040
It's hard.

2046
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,970
(To humans who went to the room of
winners after collecting 7 coins...)

2047
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:13,600
- What is happening?
- What is happening?

2048
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:17,380
- Did you succeed? Okay.
- Did you?

2049
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:20,490
- Gosh, Jong Kook.
- Okay!

2050
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,010
(Ripping)

2051
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:24,180
Jong Kook, gosh. What happened?

2052
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:27,460
You punk. You came back so quickly.

2053
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,220
(What happened?)

2054
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,290
Wait a minute, this is unfair.

2055
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:33,000
(Jong Kook came to kill the winners
in his spare time.)

2056
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,960
- I'm really okay.
- How could you do this to me?

2057
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:37,130
- So follow me.
- No.

2058
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,570
(3 people couldn't be his target
since they didn't collect 7 coins.)

2059
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:42,000
- I...
- Grab him quickly.

2060
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,210
So Min, grab him quickly.

2061
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:45,780
Do you think it will be okay
to do this to me?

2062
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:46,910
Do you think it will be okay?

2063
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:48,040
(They ripped his name tag.)

2064
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,100
Do you think it will be okay?

2065
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,510
- Do you think it will be okay?
- We had to rip it off.

2066
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:52,920
- What is it?
- Is he a monster?

2067
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:54,090
- Let's take a look.
- Gosh.

2068
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:57,180
- Yes.
- You... This is...

2069
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,490
(The sign of monsters
and the password)

2070
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:02,490
- You punk!
- Gosh.

2071
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,850
- He really is the monster.
- Jong Kook.

2072
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:08,370
- How could you look in my eyes...
- Wait a minute.

2073
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:09,390
79?

2074
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,370
Why is it "79"?

2075
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,960
- The race isn't over yet.
- Jong Kook was born in 1977.

2076
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,880
(Monster Jong Kook is out,)

2077
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,040
(but the race isn't over yet.)

2078
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,780
- He was born in 1976.
- That's right, 1976.

2079
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:23,510
(Does the emergency exit password
only have two digits?)

2080
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,320
It's different from
the book hint earlier.

2081
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,340
There's one more monster.

2082
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:31,160
(There is more than one monster?)

2083
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:34,880
(According to the book hint, there's
one monster among the residents.)

2084
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,130
(For some reason, there seems
to be another monster.)

2085
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,570
Isn't it either Kwang Soo
or Jin Wook then?

2086
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,000
No, it's really not me.

2087
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,740
- How could we trust you?
- He also ripped the name tag off.

2088
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,070
It's Kwang Soo then.

2089
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,170
- Naturally...
- Let's go to Kwang Soo.

2090
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:49,460
- Let's go to Kwang Soo. Hurry up.
- Kwang Soo?

2091
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:52,630
- Kwang Soo is outside.
- Hurry up.

2092
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,100
(They get separated to go to
each building to find Kwang Soo.)

2093
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,320
(At that moment!)

2094
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,320
This is unbelievable.

2095
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,040
(So Min found the mission ticket.)

2096
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,460
(She received another
investigation log.)

2097
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:05,320
"Monster eyewitness account".

2098
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,880
(Investigation Log 2,
Monster Eyewitness Account)

2099
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,460
(Min Hee: The monster
isn't in their 50s.)

2100
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,160
It's Kang!

2101
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:14,960
Wait a minute, investigation log
1 and 2 are different.

2102
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,030
(There are also numbers
for the investigation logs?)

2103
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,740
Are they the same or different?

2104
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:22,910
(If you look closely, investigation
logs have numbers written on them.)

2105
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:27,410
(But the members couldn't figure out
the difference of the numbers.)

2106
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,120
(Even after acquiring
"Investigation Log 2",)

2107
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,580
(they mistook the hint thinking it
was pointing to the same monster.)

2108
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,450
(Yeon Ju:
The monster isn't wearing glasses.)

2109
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:38,210
(The number of investigation logs
implied there are two monsters.)

2110
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:39,490
Yoo Jae Suk.

2111
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:40,790
(But at that moment...)

2112
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,130
- Since you collected seven coins,
- I didn't.

2113
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:44,960
the Certification of Victory
has been issued to you.

2114
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:46,570
I didn't collect seven coins.

2115
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,570
(At that hour, Kwang Soo is
in front of the coin bank.)

2116
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:54,630
(He puts in several coins and
gets up mysteriously.)

2117
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:58,740
(Yoo Jae Suk's room?)

2118
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:00,710
Do I really have to go there
after receiving the coins?

2119
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:03,000
- I...
- Just come.

2120
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:06,710
(While Genie left the room,)

2121
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:09,820
(the protein monster appeared
after hearing the news.)

2122
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,210
- I heard that you...
- Oh, my!

2123
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:13,380
(Lee Kwang Soo is out.)

2124
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,350
- I already told you.
- Isn't that right?

2125
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,830
- What?
- Did we get something?

2126
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,000
(The humans who were dejected
from being out received a message.)

2127
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,000
(Running Man Administrator 1,
Will you remain as a human?)

2128
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,130
(Or will you resurrect
as the monster's underling?)

2129
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,100
If I go out as a monster
and the monster wins,

2130
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,100
I won't receive the penalty, right?

2131
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,600
Can I be the one to choose?

2132
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,080
(1. They can resurrect
as the monster's underling.)

2133
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,580
(2. But they can't rip
name tags off directly.)

2134
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:37,420
(3. They will automatically receive
the penalty when they're out.)

2135
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,470
I...

2136
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,210
will become the son of the monster.

2137
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,160
But I suddenly became
so embarrassed of myself.

2138
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,510
I was suddenly reminded
of the things I did.

2139
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:46,850
I'll just become a monster.

2140
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,680
(Song Kang and Se Chan took long
to announce their resurrection.)

2141
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,830
(Kwang Soo was putting coins in
secretly as an underling.)

2142
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:54,170
Kwang Soo.

2143
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,420
(But Jae Suk and Jin Wook
appeared.)

2144
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,870
(As soon as he got caught,)

2145
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:59,070
(he started a grand release
of the coins.)

2146
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:02,710
(Lee Jin Wook is on the way.)

2147
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,930
(Ripping)

2148
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,630
- Kwang Soo.
- Where did you put them?

2149
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,100
Come here.

2150
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,100
(Underling Kwang Soo is out
permanently after doing his job.)

2151
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,250
This is it.

2152
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:11,580
- He's a monster.
- "Underling 3"?

2153
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:13,510
Lee Kwang Soo is completely out.

2154
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:15,950
The race isn't over yet.

2155
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,620
- What is this?
- Monster Underling 3?

2156
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,710
Am I number three in rank?

2157
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:20,920
(He's the last in ranking
among the underlings.)

2158
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,720
Kwang Soo, are you number three
among the monster's underlings?

2159
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,160
(You're also not a monster?)

2160
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:26,890
(In the meantime, Ji Hyo received
another investigation log.)

2161
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,920
"All of the eyewitnesses are lying."

2162
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:33,170
(Investigation Log 2,
Monster Eyewitness Account)

2163
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:35,960
(Investigation result:
All of the eyewitnesses are lying.)

2164
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:38,430
(Yeon Ju and Min Hee are lying.)

2165
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:42,250
(The monster is wearing glasses.
The monster is in their 50s.)

2166
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,450
(The real monster is leading
his two underlings.)

2167
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,790
(Ji...)

2168
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:50,660
(Seok...)

2169
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:55,030
(Genie.)

2170
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:01,390
Please go up.

2171
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,630
No, don't crash. Don't crash!

2172
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,090
No!

2173
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:08,600
(His mood swings maximize
according to the KOSPI index.)

2174
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,240
Please go up.

2175
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,140
Who is it? I'm really busy!

2176
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,140
Hello?

2177
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:18,340
You couldn't suppress your desire
to become rich.

2178
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,340
You will turn into a monster
from this moment.

2179
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,960
What is this? Don't make
prank phone calls!

2180
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,210
It has to go up.

2181
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:26,680
(He was only watching the chart
crashing while ignoring the call.)

2182
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:31,030
(He turned into a monster
that went crazy because of stocks.)

2183
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,460
(He's the number one actor when it
comes to this kind of acting.)

2184
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:39,960
I will also turn all of you
into monsters.

2185
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,760
(A stock monster was born.)

2186
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,840
(This comment confused the members.)

2187
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,640
("There's 1 monster
among the residents.")

2188
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,340
(Among the residents,
there was Kim Jong Kook.)

2189
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:53,010
(Aside from the residents,
there was Ji Suk Jin.)

2190
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,490
(The secret behind
the requests is...)

2191
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,050
And there's another mission...

2192
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,620
- for Suk Jin.
- Okay.

2193
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,550
Write down the requests all day,

2194
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,050
and pass them on to
the administrator Ji Seok Genie.

2195
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,090
Ji Seok Genie has to take care
of all of those requests.

2196
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,090
- Me?
- Yes.

2197
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:07,090
Taking care of those desires...

2198
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:09,030
will seem like a joke to others,

2199
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:11,840
but we will give you two a coin
for each request.

2200
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:15,100
You can give all of the coins
to someone who doesn't have seven.

2201
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,130
(They can save their coins
in the human coin banks by force...)

2202
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:17,170
(with the coins they earned
from the requests.)

2203
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:20,780
(Ji Seok Genie's request time
started like that.)

2204
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,670
(Plus 1 coin)

2205
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:25,450
(Plus 1 coin)

2206
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,950
(Ji Seok Genie saved coins
from inducing the desire of humans.)

2207
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,340
(Plus 1 coin)

2208
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:32,380
You got a total of 12 coins.

2209
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,880
Okay.

2210
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:36,460
Si Young made me mad today.

2211
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,460
(Ji Seok Genie's first target is
Si Young.)

2212
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,500
(He saved coins by force.)

2213
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,530
Si Young's room...

2214
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:42,200
(Si Young mistook all of them as
her coins blinded by desire.)

2215
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,840
I added 2!
Look, there are 2 coins.

2216
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:50,280
(She was out with the monsters'
cooperative play.)

2217
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:53,450
(He was teased all day, but monster
number 2 was preparing for revenge.)

2218
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:54,450
Okay.

2219
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,580
Kwang Soo, I helped you.

2220
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:00,880
(Ji Seok Genie)

2221
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:04,660
(He appeared imposingly
with his underlings.)

2222
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:06,290
Am I number three in rank?

2223
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,920
- Kang, why did you come out?
- Me?

2224
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,790
- I'm his tour guide.
- I requested a tour.

2225
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:14,200
Yes, please come this way.

2226
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,390
(He gathered his underlings with
the ridiculous excuse.)

2227
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,570
(He's a monster, but he was
mistaken as a zombie.)

2228
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,130
Wait a minute.

2229
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:20,130
(Jae Suk and Jin Wook still don't
know that Suk Jin's a monster.)

2230
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:22,070
- Jin Wook, are you a monster?
- No, he's not.

2231
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:23,540
Kang, why did you come out?

2232
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,840
(Ji Seok Genie's preemptive attack)

2233
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,170
- Wait a minute.
- Rip his name tag off.

2234
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,780
Kang, rip his name tag off.

2235
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,970
- Is it Kang?
- Rip it off.

2236
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:33,170
Kang, grab him.

2237
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:34,210
(The two didn't see the hint,)

2238
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,250
(so they think that guest
Kang is a monster.)

2239
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,320
Grab him.

2240
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:37,820
- Let me go.
- Rip it off.

2241
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:39,620
- Song Kang!
- Grab him.

2242
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,460
(Song Kang is out.)

2243
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:45,530
- I ripped it off.
- He's a monster.

2244
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:47,070
- I ripped it off.
- He's out.

2245
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:49,200
(Jae Suk, the 7th human,
is out as well.)

2246
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,260
Who is it?

2247
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:52,290
Grab him.

2248
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:54,500
Is Suk Jin a monster?
What is happening?

2249
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,080
(Hey! Is Suk Jin a monster?)

2250
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,470
Who is it? I'm out.

2251
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,470
Jin Wook!

2252
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,820
You need to rip Suk Jin's
name tag off.

2253
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,250
(Detective Lee Jin Wook versus
Monster Ji Suk Jin)

2254
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:08,420
- No!
- Oh, my.

2255
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:11,180
(Jin Wook just grabbed
Suk Jin's name tag.)

2256
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:15,290
(The person who rips it off first
wins. Who will be the winner?)

2257
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:16,550
Wait a minute.

2258
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,240
(Ripping)

2259
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,500
(Human Lee Jin Wook is out.)

2260
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,500
Good job.

2261
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,950
(It was Suk Jin.)

2262
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:36,000
Good job.

2263
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,380
(Team Monster won after
putting 8 humans out.)

2264
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,420
(The race ended.)

2265
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,420
Okay, I will tell you the results.

2266
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:45,490
The monster among residents
who eats the desire of humans...

2267
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,920
- was Kim Jong Kook.
- Gosh.

2268
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:50,830
The monster aside from the residents
was Ji Suk Jin.

2269
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:52,350
- Yes.
- It was Genie.

2270
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:53,760
- Genie betrayed us.
- Gosh.

2271
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,290
Why do you have
so many underlings?

2272
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,460
As such, Team Monster won.

2273
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,500
- Gosh.
- Really?

2274
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,340
- Honestly, I...
- You made this happen?

2275
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,410
- Suk Jin...
- I could have won.

2276
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:04,240
- He did such a good job.
- Really?

2277
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,710
He left while leading underlings,
but he was really not trustworthy.

2278
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,800
I blamed you.

2279
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:11,880
Among all of the humans, five of
them will receive the penalty.

2280
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:12,920
That's a lot.

2281
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,490
Kwang Soo and Kang,
who used to be humans,

2282
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:17,680
had their name tags ripped off.
They're penalty candidates.

2283
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,050
Me?

2284
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,920
That was the condition
of resurrecting.

2285
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,630
That's right.

2286
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,160
And 5 among the humans... We ended
with 5 humans earlier, right?

2287
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,500
In that order, a total of seven are
penalty candidates.

2288
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,540
Penalty candidates.

2289
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:32,540
Please draw a card now.

2290
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,070
(They will select 3 people to
receive the penalty with a draw.)

2291
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:35,430
He survived.

2292
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,080
- I survived.
- Haha survived.

2293
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:39,930
- I also survived. Next.
- What is happening?

2294
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,910
- Are you okay?
- Do Hyun...

2295
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,640
Did you die?

2296
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,280
- Penalty.
- Penalty.

2297
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,290
- Penalty.
- Gosh.

2298
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:49,090
Wait a minute. Who will receive
the penalty between the two?

2299
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:50,420
1, 2, 3.

2300
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,490
(Between Kwang Soo and Song Kang,
who will receive the penalty?)

2301
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,290
- 1, 2, 3.
- Penalty.

2302
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:57,390
- Gosh, Kang.
- Song Kang...

2303
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,750
He's really unlucky.

2304
01:20:58,750 --> 01:20:59,960
That's amazing.

2305
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,390
For today's penalty, you will
get your cheek slapped with water...

2306
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,870
to cleanse your human desires.

2307
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:07,070
- It's simple.
- It's simple.

2308
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,430
I understand why people want to come
again because they're upset.

2309
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:10,910
- That's right.
- Come again.

2310
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:13,040
- Come again.
- I kept thinking about that.

2311
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,250
- Come again.
- You will be reminded of this...

2312
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,450
when you go back home.

2313
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,600
(He takes a refreshing shower.)

2314
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,340
1, 2, 3.

2315
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,540
(Splash)

2316
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:20,820
Be careful.

2317
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,140
I didn't do it on purpose.
I'm sorry.

2318
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:25,380
- I was too fast.
- That was cheap.

2319
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,250
I would like to thank the four leads
of "Sweet Home".

2320
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,030
- Good job.
- "Sweet Home"!

2321
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:30,420

made an appearance,)

followed them.)

want to pick have participated.)
