00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,580
(2021 Running League Rookie Draft)

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,910
Hello. I'm Announcer Bae Sung Jae
who will host...

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,410
2021 Running League Rookie Draft.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,720
We have a lot of
outstanding rookies this year,

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,790
so all eyes are on this draft.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,750
First, the team owners
who are here to discover rookies...

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,090
will enter first.

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,250
Please come on in.

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,130
(The two dignified team owners
are walking in.)

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,290
He's got outstanding agility
and intelligence.

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,830
- Nice to meet you.
- He's the owner of Team Yang,

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,970
Yang Se Chan.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,640
He's got the leadership
for the whole country.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,730
He's the owner of Team Yu,
Yoo Jae Suk.

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,370
(Bursting into laughter)

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,830
Aren't we taking a photo?

18
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,250
- What?
- Aren't we taking a photo?

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,650
- A photo? What photo?
- Yes, let's take one.

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,080
- Let's take a photo together.
- I didn't know it was you.

21
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,110
(2021 Rookies Are Ours!)

22
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,720
(Team Owner Yang Se Chan
and Yoo Jae Suk)

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,820
Mr. Yoo and Mr. Yang,
it's nice to meet you.

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,580
The draft is very important
for the victory of your team.

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,190
Is there any player you have
your eye on for this draft?

26
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,330
Any player you like?

27
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,970
- There are about 2 players.
- 2 players.

28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,870
Yes. I'm interested in two players.

29
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,510
- I see.
- Can you tell us who they are?

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,530
Yes. They are Ryu Hyun Jin
and Kim Kwang Hyun.

31
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,230
(He announces
that he will take them all.)

32
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,510
Will you take them all?

33
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,340
- You're taking them all.
- Other than these two,

34
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,010
I'm not so interested.

35
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,920
Players like Ji Suk Jin...

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
shouldn't be here for the draft.

37
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,590
- He will be kicked out right away.
- Right.

38
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,590
Now the rookies will enter.

39
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,790
2021 Running League Rookie Draft.

40
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,000
- Entry number one.
- Do we have to do this?

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,200
Is this necessary?

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,500
(Shinil High School song)

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,930
(All players are entering
with their school songs.)

44
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,340
(Booing)

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,140
I will never pick him.

46
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,670
- I'm telling you.
- I'll kick him out.

47
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,870
He's been in the hot stove league
for the past 30 years.

48
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,200
He's a rookie who will show
the power of a veteran.

49
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,810
(Fizzing)

50
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,980
He can't be a pitcher.

51
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,620
He has weak shoulders.

52
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,840
I don't understand why he's trying
to become a pitcher.

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,180
(Groaning)

54
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,420
See? He can barely come up here.

55
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,280
He barely climbed up here.

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,860
- He's exhausted already.
- See?

57
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,830
He doesn't even have
the right pitching form.

58
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,460
- He's out.
- He's discharged.

59
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,860
Here comes the next player.

60
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,860
Entry number two.

61
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,300
(Entry No. 2, Kim Jong Kook)

62
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,110
Bench-clearing brawl is my thing.

63
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,200
He's unbeatable All Mighty.

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,170
- This is my school song.
- Kim Jong Kook.

65
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,980
- Gosh, he's a headache.
- He really is.

66
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,640
I'm exhausted already.

67
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,920
He plays soccer well,

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,010
- but he's bad at baseball.
- He's a terrible baseball player.

69
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,860
He's like a scarecrow
when it comes to baseball.

70
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,830
- Compared to his body...
- Gosh, what was that?

71
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,730
(The real monster rookie
threatens the two team owners.)

72
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,130
- Why are you being like this?
- He was...

73
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,130
- about to throw a ball at us.
- Don't threaten us.

74
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,860
- He knows nothing about baseball.
- He's a scarecrow.

75
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,940
This is the ball...

76
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,140
used in the seventh game
of the World Series.

77
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,330
- He's bragging about it.
- Are you serious?

78
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,010
Yes. It even has some dirt on it.

79
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,770
And it has Ryu Hyun Jin's autograph.

80
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,850
He's bragging
about knowing him again.

81
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,080
I went to watch the game.

82
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,980
I will never pick him.

83
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,480
- He's condescending.
- Condescending?

84
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,690
- What did you say?
- You're condescending.

85
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,820
He brags about
knowing Ryu Hyun Jin.

86
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,290
- I will never pick him.
- I'll be sure to start a fight.

87
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,760
I will never pick you.

88
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,760
I will straighten your teeth
with a bench-clearing brawl.

89
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,100
- What?
- I'm wearing braces.

90
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,390
- Straighten my teeth?
- Yes.

91
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,600
- What are you talking about?
- I'll make them even.

92
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,960
Okay. I get it.

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,940
Let's move on to the next player.

94
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,230
Entry number three.

95
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,910
He's a super rookie
from Osan High School.

96
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,010
- It's him.
- It's Haha.

97
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,040
He can barely play baseball.

98
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,820
Is he a junior player?

99
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,710
"Don't make fun of my height.
I'm a player with a quick wit."

100
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,420
Rookie player, Haha.

101
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,110
Isn't he from the little league
baseball team?

102
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,630
He is. He's a junior player.

103
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,790
All right. Shall we move on?

104
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

105
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,230
- You've gained a lot of weight.
- Right.

106
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,990
(He points out his weight.)

107
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,860
- Why would you say that?
- That wasn't necessary.

108
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,990
You are bulking up.

109
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,330
Why are you...

110
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,860
I was told there would be
no cross talk.

111
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,330
- Just continue.
- You look like...

112
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,440
- You look like a baseball player.
- I didn't know you'd be so close.

113
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,480
You can keep going.

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,770
- I was surprised to see him.
- All right.

115
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,010
Entry number four.

116
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,480
- He's good.
- It feels like...

117
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,390
She's the ace player who's
come out of the cave for today.

118
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,580
- That's a good swing.
- Song Ji Hyo.

119
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,930
Ji Hyo, I like your swing.

120
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,020
Doing this after a swing
is the worst.

121
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,560
We don't do this.

122
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,830
Why are you looking away like this?

123
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,370
I should do this. Am I wrong?

124
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,700
She lacks basic skills for batting.

125
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
Is that so?

126
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,030
Let's move on to the next player.

127
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,590
Entry number five.

128
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,640
There's no one to pick.

129
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,330
I'm bored already.

130
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,880
He's bored already.

131
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,840
He's the assassin on the field
who attacks even his team.

132
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,380
He's Lee Kwang Soo.

133
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,820
(They let out a deep-drawn sigh
as soon as Kwang Soo shows up.)

134
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,840
- He's the worst.
- He looks like a Japanese player.

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,340
We don't warm up like that.

136
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,850
And he needs to get a haircut first.

137
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,350
His back hair. It's too...

138
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,580
He looks like
an amateur Japanese baseball player.

139
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,060
An amateur Japanese baseball player.

140
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,200
Hello.

141
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,930
(It turns out he's
a baseball player from Japan.)

142
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,330
Does your cap have the hair?

143
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,500
It's not a wig.

144
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,740
- You need a haircut.
- It's fake.

145
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,090
No, I can't.

146
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,400
This player has...

147
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,600
a lot of issues about teamwork.

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,740
- Exactly.
- He has a lot of problems.

149
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,250
- He muddies the water.
- Exactly.

150
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,100
He's not so good,

151
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,580
but he negotiates
his salary for a long time.

152
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,840
- He thinks he's popular.
- He thinks he's popular.

153
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,320
All right.

154
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,450
Entry number six.

155
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,580
Her batting average
for romance is 100 percent.

156
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,390
She's Love Frog who throws
a breaking ball for love.

157
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,350
She's Jeon So Min.

158
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,500
(She's a national athlete
for romance.)

159
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,300
I'm sure we should
pass on her today.

160
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,960
- We have to pass on her.
- Pass on her.

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,960
She knows nothing about baseball.

162
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,530
She knows nothing.

163
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,940
- She's not interested in baseball.
- She's here to hit on the owners.

164
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,510
- Look at her.
- She's here to seduce the owners.

165
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,050
Who knows? She might have
dated some baseball players.

166
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,770
- Right.
- Yes.

167
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,010
She might have dated some.

168
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,340
That's possible. She might have
dated baseball players.

169
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,820
- So it's finally time.
- It's the main event.

170
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,760
It's the main event.
This is the beginning.

171
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,350
Lastly, we have monstrous rookies
who are the talk of the town...

172
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,390
- in the baseball world.
- They're different.

173
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,720
Entry number seven.

174
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,700
Everything he does wins
Korea's first titles.

175
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,300
Gosh, this is...

176
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,030
Korean Monster, Ryu Hyun Jin.

177
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,140
(Korean Monster, Ryu Hyun Jin)

178
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,470
(He conquered the Major League
with his skills since his debut.)

179
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,470
("Ryu Hyun Jin Ranked 2nd
for the CY Young Award")

180
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,810
("Ryu Hyun Jin Proved
that he's the Best Pitcher")

181
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,750
(With his outstanding performance,)

182
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,270
(he moved to Toronto Blue Jays.)

183
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,280
("Ryu Hyun Jin Receives
80 Million Dollars")

184
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,320
("Ryu Hyun Jin Moves to Toronto
for 80 Million Dollars for 4 Years")

185
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,620
(He's not just Korean Monster,
but World Monster.)

186
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,910
My goodness.

187
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,330
We are wearing baseball uniforms.

188
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,930
He's not wearing uniforms.

189
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,020
This isn't an award ceremony.

190
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,930
- He's tall.
- He is...

191
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,090
Gosh, he's become handsome.

192
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,430
Hello.

193
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,070
- Hey.
- My gosh.

194
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,030
- You look great.
- Why are you looking so handsome?

195
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,030
Hello.

196
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,600
Like I said before,
you should be tall like him.

197
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,200
Not like Kwang Soo.

198
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,830
- He looks so cool.
- This is how you should look.

199
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,180
- Well...
- He looks amazing.

200
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,700
- Good.
- He's our team.

201
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,620
I'll have him on our team.

202
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,990
Entry number eight.

203
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,190
(There's another monstrous rookie.)

204
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,280
(The cheerful music
raises the expectation.)

205
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,410
What's this song?

206
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,220
He dominates the mound
with his amazing slider.

207
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,090
The so-called, KK.
He's Kim Kwang Hyun.

208
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,460
(He led SK Wyverns to victory
in the Korean Series 4 times.)

209
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,200
(He's the living legend of KBO,
Kim Kwang Hyun.)

210
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,310
(After he conquered
the Korean league,)

211
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,240
(he joined Saint Louis
with uniform number 33.)

212
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,240
(He moved to the Saint Louis
Cardinals in the MLB.)

213
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,750
("The Best MLB Star Picked by
Baseball Card Companies")

214
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,510
("Kim Kwang Hyun Selected as
the Left Hand Pitcher of the Year")

215
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,190
(He will now become the legend
of the Major League.)

216
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,580
- He's a rookie.
- This is so cool.

217
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,350
What are you doing?

218
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,850
This is what he did.

219
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,220
He's the real ace player.

220
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,630
- This is amazing.
- Kwang Hyun, please come on up.

221
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,630
Right?

222
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,430
Nice to meet you.

223
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,830
I'm the team owner.

224
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,940
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

225
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,100
- You're so handsome.
- Hello.

226
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,140
(Suk Jin gives Kwang Hyun
a pat on the back like a coach.)

227
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,510
You look great.

228
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,470
- Please stand here.
- My gosh.

229
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,340
We finally have good players.

230
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,340
- They're finally here.
- Right.

231
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,340
(They've been looking forward
to meet the rookies.)

232
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,010
They are the ace players
for this draft.

233
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,080
- These two.
- They're finally here.

234
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,450
We have Ryu Hyun Jin
and Kim Kwang Hyun.

235
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,280
- Thank you for joining us today.
- Thank you.

236
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,390
(Thank you for joining us.)

237
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,830
Let me explain today's rules then.

238
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,560
- We should begin the draft.
- Okay. Let's go.

239
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,430
This is the Fiery Stove League Race.

240
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,460
Yoo Jae Suk and Yang Se Chan
are team owners.

241
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,440
- That sounds cool.
- And the rest of you are rookies.

242
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,460
He's wearing the coach's uniform.

243
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,770
The team owners were selected
by Ryu Hyun Jin and Kim Kwang Hyun.

244
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,680
They picked
the least favorite members...

245
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,180
for the team owners.

246
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,920
- What?
- They got selected.

247
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
What did you say?

248
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,290
They got selected by them.

249
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,290
- This is very offensive.
- They got selected.

250
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,080
- Well done.
- Good job.

251
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,110
That's good.

252
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,850
So does that mean
we're the worst team owners?

253
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,200
I wondered why
these two were team owners.

254
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,830
- I know.
- I was curious the whole time.

255
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,930
- Now I understand.
- This is ridiculous.

256
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,930
- My gosh.
- Okay. Let's continue.

257
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,940
Okay. Good.

258
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,770
The two teams will get...

259
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,200
different amounts of money
for their teams after each mission.

260
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,460
And the team owners will...

261
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,040
negotiate a salary
with each player in each round...

262
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,100
and pay them accordingly
with the money they won.

263
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,340
There are only two players
whom I want to negotiate with.

264
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,920
I'll kick the rest of them out.

265
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,740
I won't buy the rest of them...

266
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,820
- even if I get paid.
- No.

267
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,210
Aren't we having
a bench-clearing brawl?

268
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,290
- What?
- Bench-clearing.

269
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,380
Why do you want to fight?

270
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,350
If we lose, we should
turn things upside down.

271
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,400
(A player who used to be a bully
and likes to bust up everything)

272
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,530
The team owners will compete
against each other.

273
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,720
And the team owner who earned
more money will win the race...

274
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,130
and receive a prize.

275
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,000
The team owner who loses the race
will receive a penalty.

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,070
The players will compete
against each other as well.

277
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,470
Among 8 players, the top 3
with more money will win...

278
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,910
and receive prizes.

279
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,050
The player with the least money...

280
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,280
will receive a penalty.

281
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,240
(Today's race is both team
and individual competition.)

282
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,550
Now we'll hold the draft,

283
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,480
so each team can allocate
new players to their teams.

284
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,660
- Yes, here we go!
- Let's do this.

285
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,690
(2021 Running League Rookie Draft
begins now!)

286
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,880
Gosh, I'm nervous.

287
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,350
(Team Owner Yu, Team Owner Yang)

288
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,700
We can use only 500 dollars
to negotiate...

289
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,990
the two players' annual salaries.

290
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,700
It's so unrealistic.

291
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,960
It doesn't have
the same value as dollars.

292
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,670
All right.

293
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,440
Each team can allocate four players.

294
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,630
- Okay, four players.
- The rookies...

295
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,950
- must choose a team.
- Four players?

296
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,610
- If I choose one, I go all the way.
- Well, anyway,

297
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,840
I can't say which players...

298
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,150
but I won't spend more than
two dollars for some of them.

299
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,920
(He announced
a salary cap of two dollars.)

300
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,450
- I'm limiting it to a few cents.
- Oh, come on.

301
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,790
I'll spend only a few cents...

302
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,250
so that I can spend all the money
on one particular player.

303
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,560
All right then.

304
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,430
Before the owners
negotiate their salaries,

305
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,860
the players are going to
throw balls at a target...

306
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,900
to show them their abilities.

307
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,170
Oh, I like that.

308
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,800
If needed, the owners can
ask the players anytime...

309
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,940
to test their skills.

310
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,970
(Staring)

311
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,230
Hyun Jin,
he's bulking up these days.

312
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,280
Bulking up?

313
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,700
(They said
there won't be a cross talk.)

314
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,470
- Okay.
- No wonder.

315
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,690
Actually, Sung Jae
agreed to do this...

316
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,110
on one condition today.

317
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,060
He doesn't want a cross talk,
got that?

318
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,210
He won't have conversations.

319
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,690
- He'll only say what he needs to.
- All right.

320
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,380
Only the bust shot and no cross talk
are in the contract.

321
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,620
- So how much weight did you gain?
- What?

322
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,220
(So how much weight did you gain?)

323
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,170
- Why would you ask that?
- Don't ask him that.

324
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,990
- How can you ask him that?
- You can ask him in person.

325
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,300
I'm trying to gain weight.

326
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,860
(Suk Jin's question interrupted
Sung Jae from hosting the show.)

327
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,960
All right then.

328
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
We will begin the draft now.

329
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,130
- You're not going to answer?
- My goodness.

330
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,440
I can't tell you my weight.

331
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,680
- You don't have to talk with him.
- All right.

332
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,910
- Just stop talking about it.
- My weight is a secret.

333
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,780
- You don't have talk with him.
- You're asking too many questions.

334
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,870
You don't have to answer.

335
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,190
Now we'll introduce two players.

336
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,980
The first two candidates are
Kim Jong Kook and Lee Kwang Soo!

337
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,160
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

338
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,790
(Frowning)

339
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,120
I'm competing against a Japanese
player from the Yomiuri Giants.

340
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,900
(A player from a gang and a player
from a neighboring country)

341
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,030
What are your positions?

342
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,700
I'm a batter. I love to hit.

343
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,630
Can we see your batting stance?

344
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,770
- My stance?
- Yes.

345
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,170
(Flinching)

346
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,330
(He grabs the bat
like a gang member.)

347
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,360
What about...

348
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,130
- What about you, Kka Chi?
- Kka Chi?

349
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,180
Yes.

350
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,700
- Jo Kka Chi?
- Well, yes.

351
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,210
(Suddenly he talks about
Kwang Soo's character in a movie.)

352
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,150
- I'm not that Jo Kka Chi.
- No?

353
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,210
- No.
- Isn't it Sul Kka Chi?

354
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,520
Are you talking about Sul Kka Chi?

355
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,480
I played Jo Kka Chi,
not Sul Kka Chi.

356
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,610
(So what's Jo Kka Chi's
baseball position?)

357
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,030
What about you, Kka Chi?

358
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,930
Something like a pitcher.

359
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,090
Something like a pitcher?

360
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,850
- Something like a pitcher?
- What does that mean?

361
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,400
- Can you show us what you can do?
- Yes, show us your pose.

362
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,460
Wait a minute.

363
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,460
Wait.

364
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,230
- Kwang Soo, hold on.
- Yes?

365
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,830
You're supposed to
pull back your left foot.

366
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,440
(Changing the pose in a hurry)

367
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,830
Your left foot. That's it.

368
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
(The foreign player tried
to look cool, but got embarrassed.)

369
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,080
- All right.
- No, I was faking it.

370
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,050
- My goodness.
- I was going to fool them.

371
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,080
All right then.

372
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,740
It was just a fake.

373
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,210
What are you, a fool?

374
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,210
You're like this.

375
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,790
I didn't want you
to know if I'm right or left handed.

376
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,690
So I tried to fool you
by pulling the wrong leg.

377
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,830
(Brazen)

378
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
All right.
You're all rookie players.

379
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,460
So don't point out
the styles of others.

380
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,860
All right. I won't.

381
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,330
Now the owners will
decide their salary range.

382
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,330
The two owners.

383
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,540
But I don't want to leave my team.

384
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,700
I love batting.

385
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,630
- You're giving him that much?
- For me...

386
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,970
- I'm going to pass on him.
- I love batting.

387
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,700
- You're sorting Jong Kook out?
- Yes.

388
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,680
You can't say his name out loud.

389
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,340
- You're sorting Jong Kook out?
- Yes.

390
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,050
- What?
- You can't say his name out loud.

391
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,110
You should whisper.
Why would you say it out loud?

392
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,080
- You're sorting me out?
- No, we're having a meeting here.

393
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,660
All right. I understand.

394
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,560
Now the two owners will announce
the players' salaries.

395
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,590
- 1, 2, 3.
- Right away?

396
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,330
(Kwang Soo 10 cents, 2 dollars,
Jong Kook 50 cents, 1 dollar)

397
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,490
This is our last offer.

398
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,330
(He can't believe this.)

399
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,440
We can't give them
a higher salary than this.

400
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,440
Would you accept their terms?

401
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,600
Mr. Yang's prices
are more than double.

402
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,970
You may choose a team.

403
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,540
They should pick Se Chan.

404
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,950
What should I do?

405
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,950
I can't take 10 cents.

406
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,470
(Holding back their laughter)

407
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,740
10 cents? Are you kidding me?

408
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,380
- He's cruel.
- Maybe the team is poor.

409
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,950
- Gosh.
- 10 cents.

410
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,190
- I feel really bad about this.
- 10 cents? Is he joking?

411
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,080
You can't buy anything
with 10 cents these days.

412
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,190
- Sung Jae.
- You're too mean.

413
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,300
I can't give
more than 10 cents for him.

414
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,120
- He's very stingy.
- It's final.

415
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,900
We have great benefits.
So choose us.

416
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,700
Jong Kook can't choose Mr. Yang
to get only one dollar.

417
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,000
- You're right.
- He offered Kwang Soo two dollars.

418
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,360
- Okay, you brat.
- Look over here.

419
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,130
Brat? I'm the owner of the team.

420
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,700
The salary I'm offering you is
five times bigger than Kwang Soo's.

421
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,840
- All right. I choose you.
- Okay.

422
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
He's a proud man.

423
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,920
So you're getting 50 cents?

424
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,020
- He values me more than Kwang Soo.
- Yes, that's right.

425
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,150
He's worth five times bigger
than Kwang Soo.

426
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,750
I will choose Yang Se Chan's team.

427
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,060
Thank you for joining our team
at 2 dollars.

428
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,530
- I will choose Mr. Yu.
- Okay.

429
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,660
Okay. Thank you.

430
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,060
- This is great.
- This is it.

431
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,590
I offered you a salary that's
five times higher than his.

432
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,900
(Bumping)

433
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,090
- Thank you in advance.
- Thank you.

434
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,960
Now we'll introduce
two more players for you.

435
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,830
Ryu Hyun Jin and Kim Kwang Hyun!

436
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,040
(Ryu Hyun Jin and Kim Kwang Hyun)

437
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,440
- You're calling them right away?
- Here they are.

438
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
(As Sung Jae calls out their names,)

439
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,740
(the team owners instantly stand up
and give a big round of applause.)

440
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,650
- Here they are.
- What's this?

441
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,680
- Thank you in advance.
- Thank you in advance.

442
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,820
- I'm going to spend big money.
- Mr. Ryu.

443
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,950
- I'll spend big.
- Don't spend too much on them!

444
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,710
Don't spend too much on them!

445
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,450
- All right.
- There are still many players.

446
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,560
He's right.

447
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,980
(The owners are ignoring Suk Jin.)

448
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,160
- It's good to see you.
- Let's hear them out.

449
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,950
The money I can spend on them is...

450
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,450
I have more than 400 dollars.

451
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,400
We have two players for you.

452
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,990
Would you like to
see their abilities?

453
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,120
- Sure, sure.
- Of course.

454
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,230
I know what they're good at.

455
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,310
But I still need to
see their skills.

456
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,470
They've already proved
their abilities in Major League.

457
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,000
- But we will have them...
- Can I refuse to do this?

458
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,100
throw balls at a target 7m away.

459
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,340
I can't believe I'm about
to see this here.

460
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,480
They only have one chance
so they must be nervous.

461
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,820
Will you throw a fastball
or a slide ball?

462
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,330
- Whatever you want.
- Okay, then can you...

463
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,720
- throw a change-up ball?
- Sure.

464
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,750
(His specialty, change-up ball)

465
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,750
He's going to hit the target
with a change-up ball?

466
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,930
We're about to see
his change-up ball?

467
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,960
It's a change-up ball.

468
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,630
- Yes, a change-up ball.
- Okay, it's Ryu Hyun Jin!

469
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,910
It's Ryu Hyun Jin!

470
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,630
What was that?

471
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,810
- Hey.
- Wait a minute.

472
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,940
- It didn't hit the center.
- Gosh.

473
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,470
- What was that?
- You didn't hit it.

474
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,650
- Hey.
- Wait a minute.

475
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,110
The ball didn't hit the center.

476
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,920
It was far away from the center.

477
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,450
Kwang Soo, it turns out
we're not that bad.

478
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,820
I told you it's hard to hit it.

479
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,420
Yes, it is. It's too far away.

480
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,580
(This is how they did
a minute ago during the draft.)

481
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,080
(They did their best to throw...)

482
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,590
- What was that?
- Mine hit closer.

483
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,570
My gosh, that was pathetic.

484
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,360
(Korean Monster laughed at them
not knowing what was about to come.)

485
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,310
(Now he's become
the laughing stock.)

486
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,700
- What was that?
- It hit far away!

487
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,130
- It's totally a ball.
- It is a ball.

488
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,370
Anchor Bae, can you say
that it is a ball?

489
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,500
- It's a perfect strike.
- It went over two rows.

490
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,780
- This is a strike?
- Yes, a perfect strike.

491
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,780
(That's a perfect strike?)

492
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,820
- That's a strike?
- Come on.

493
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,550
He's playing favorites with him.

494
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,750
It was a dead ball
if it hit someone.

495
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,250
Anchor Bae,
your suit is about to burst.

496
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,160
Come on, it's a ball.

497
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,660
- That wasn't a strike.
- It's a ball.

498
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,560
- It went way beyond the target.
- That was a ball.

499
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,460
Kim Kwang Hyun,
can we see your slide ball?

500
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,830
- I'll throw a fastball.
- A fastball?

501
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,770
Should I make it fun or serious?

502
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,670
- Throw it seriously.
- Yes, be serious.

503
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,130
(Will Kim Kwang Hyun throw
a serious fastball?)

504
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,730
I told you it's hard to throw.

505
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,280
See?

506
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,000
- See?
- We were better!

507
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,370
(He couldn't even hit the target.)

508
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,320
(What on earth was that?)

509
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,840
- See?
- We were better!

510
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,660
Yes, we were better.

511
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,790
(He threw the ball seriously,
but gave them a big laugh.)

512
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,680
(After Se Chan sees
Kim Kwang Hyun's terrible throw,)

513
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,180
(he writes down a salary for him
right away.)

514
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,030
- What was that?
- Hey.

515
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,390
We were better.

516
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,690
Here's the result.

517
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,090
10 dollars for Ryu Hyun Jin
and 5 dollars for Kim Kwang Hyun.

518
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,240
(Their value plummets.)

519
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,540
Gosh, you're terrible.

520
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,870
It's so funny
how they're so embarrassed.

521
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,370
- There are metal bars behind.
- Yes.

522
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,870
I guess this is good
for the rest of us.

523
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,320
- Yes, you're right.
- We can get some money.

524
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,290
- This isn't over for us.
- My goodness.

525
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,820
(The two owners
are seriously worried.)

526
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,150
Gosh, I was going to
put all the money.

527
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,330
It might be better
to be called up after them.

528
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,590
(The major leaguers
seem humbler than before.)

529
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,190
Okay. Here's my number.

530
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,230
Show us your numbers. 1, 2, 3!

531
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,930
Mine is 165 dollars and 160 dollars.

532
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,090
- 160 dollars and 180 dollars.
- Since they are...

533
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,570
(They don't know how to react
to their poor hospitality.)

534
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,100
Since they're
both famous major league players,

535
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,370
I put a premium for that.

536
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,480
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

537
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,670
Make it 250 dollars.

538
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,140
- Make it 250 dollars.
- My goodness.

539
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,610
Wait a minute. He's the team owner.

540
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,580
A player can't force the team owner.

541
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,340
(He didn't do well as a player
so he wants to be a sports agent?)

542
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,380
What do you think you're doing?

543
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,560
- Make it 250 dollars.
- Excuse me.

544
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,880
Didn't you get 50 cents
when you joined the team?

545
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,920
Didn't you get 50 cents
when you joined the team?

546
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,460
My goodness.

547
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,230
- Just sit down.
- What are you doing?

548
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,190
- I changed my job.
- What?

549
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,890
If I make it 250 dollars,
I won't have any left.

550
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,130
- Mr. 50 Cents, please step aside.
- Go away.

551
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,210
- Mr. 50 Cents.
- Make it 250 dollars.

552
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,710
I could even kick you
out of the team.

553
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,540
This is why I didn't
want to sign him.

554
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,050
Just make it 250 dollars.

555
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,340
If you make it,
I want five percent of that money.

556
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,550
- Jong Kook.
- What?

557
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,940
That pants make you
look like a gang member.

558
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,820
Now the players
will choose the team they want.

559
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,910
(It's time for the players
to choose the team.)

560
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,420
Hyun Jin might feel bad
about the price.

561
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,960
Yes, since his price is lower
than Kwang Hyun's.

562
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,150
Why don't you negotiate?

563
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,000
Wait a minute.

564
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,530
- Mr. Yang.
- Yes.

565
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,330
I think you're trying to get
a player you can control better.

566
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,770
- You're right.
- Right?

567
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,470
- Hyun Jin is older than me, so...
- He wants to control them.

568
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,160
- it'll be harder for me to handle.
- My goodness.

569
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,540
So Kwang Hyun would be better even
if it's my first time seeing him.

570
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,980
Yes, it seemed like you set
their salaries based on that.

571
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,050
You're right. I'd like to
control them easily.

572
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,220
- I want to feel comfortable.
- So what are you going to do?

573
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,480
I will choose Mr. Yang's team.

574
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,080
- Oh, okay.
- Mr. Yang.

575
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,320
- You made up your mind?
- Yes.

576
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,060
And I don't need to negotiate.

577
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,290
That is neat.

578
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,830
He only has 300 dollars,
and he offered more than half.

579
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,420
(Faltering)

580
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,120
Wait. I want to give him
another 10 dollars.

581
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,530
Wait, Kwang Hyun.

582
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,970
- He sounds nice.
- I'll give you another 10 dollars.

583
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,430
Hang on. I get it.

584
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,540
My offer is 190 dollars.

585
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,360
- Why would you give him a raise...
- Hang on a second.

586
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,010
just because he sounds nice?

587
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,400
He's a good negotiator.

588
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,370
I'll add another 50 dollars
and make it 200 dollars.

589
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,440
I guess all we need to do here
is be nice.

590
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,980
I want to give him a compliment.

591
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,520
- I made it 200 dollars.
- Good.

592
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,990
You wrote 10 cents for me,
and now it's 200 dollars?

593
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,020
- How much is it? 190 dollars?
- 190 dollars.

594
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,410
Okay. My offer is 200 dollars.

595
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,490
I'm giving you another 10 dollars.

596
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,880
That's quite high.

597
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,260
I'm satisfied with the amount.

598
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,460
- Really?
- I'll gladly accept the offer.

599
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,500
- Okay. Good.
- Okay.

600
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,000
Kim Kwang Hyun joins Team Yang,

601
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,470
and Ryu Hyun Jin joins Team Yu.

602
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,540
Thank you.

603
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,930
- Our team...
- We should take a photo.

604
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,100
- Let's take a photo together.
- Take a photo?

605
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,630
("Kim Kwang Hyun Joins Team Yang
for 190 Dollars")

606
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,670
("Kim Kwang Hyun is Satisfied
with His Salary of 190 Dollars")

607
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,710
Okay!

608
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,550
- They didn't do it with us.
- We should take a photo too.

609
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,440
You didn't take photos with us.

610
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,840
- 50 Cents, stay out of this.
- I will...

611
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,220
Hey, mister!

612
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,680
- Why did you not do it with us?
- 50 Cents, stay out of this.

613
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,790
Come here.

614
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,120
- It's a secret that I bought you.
- Come here.

615
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,390
Smile. Go ahead and smile.

616
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,070
(The rookie shows his love toward
his team in an aggressive way.)

617
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,730
- Done.
- I'm really disappointed.

618
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,540
I was holding Se Chan's hand
to take a photo, but he was like...

619
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,660
(Grasping his hand)

620
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,160
He pushed my hand away.

621
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,600
The third candidates are...

622
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,630
Song Ji Hyo and Jeon So Min.
Please come on out.

623
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,600
I guess I should pass on them.

624
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,340
Gosh, hang on.

625
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
I have no plan to spend a lot.

626
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,940
Can I ask how much
you know about baseball?

627
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm a cheerleader.

628
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,020
- Really?
- All of a sudden?

629
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,260
She's changing her stance.

630
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,580
She's changing her stance.
It's a new plan.

631
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,560
(She changes her position and
tries to win the owners over.)

632
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Hey.

633
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,690
She's changed her plans.

634
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,770
She's good.

635
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,300
- Okay.
- She's funny.

636
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,860
Hey, it's like...

637
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,970
Ji Hyo, is there anything you can do
regarding baseball?

638
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,040
She is good at drinking beer.

639
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,170
- Right.
- She drinks beer quickly.

640
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,600
She's good at
having a beer with chicken.

641
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,780
Beer killer.

642
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,940
- I once threw the ceremonial pitch.
- I know.

643
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,640
- She threw the ceremonial pitch.
- She did?

644
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,110
I did it twice.

645
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,140
Really?

646
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,820
If you throw it to the center,
it means you're better than them.

647
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,580
Song Ji Hyo is up.

648
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,350
(Ji Hyo is trained with chicken
and beer. How will she throw?)

649
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,490
(Hurling it down to the ground)

650
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,330
Thank you for showing how you hurl
the ball to the ground.

651
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,030
(She flung it to the ground.)

652
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,000
(Maybe she enjoyed
too much chicken and beer.)

653
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,660
Thank you for showing how you hurl
the ball to the ground.

654
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,430
- This happens a lot.
- Right.

655
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,630
- Who's up next?
- It's not easy.

656
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,000
- So Min.
- Yes.

657
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,330
Throw the ball.

658
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,870
Don't pick your nose.

659
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,510
(She tries all the stuff
she's seen before.)

660
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,840
- Her face is really funny.
- What's wrong with your face?

661
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,480
She should be a comedienne.

662
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,850
Good. Hang on.

663
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,880
(She didn't expect herself
to throw a fastball.)

664
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
That was good.

665
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,150
(Flustered)

666
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
What happened?

667
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,530
- That's enough.
- That was good.

668
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,770
What's going on?

669
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,470
She's better than Ryu Hyun Jin.

670
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,130
- So Min.
- She's better than both of them.

671
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,360
What kind of cheerleader
is so good at baseball?

672
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,370
I'm 100 percent sure
she played catch with her boyfriend.

673
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,580
- Let's continue.
- Show us.

674
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,080
- I didn't think about this.
- The problem is,

675
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,840
we have the minimum amount.

676
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,610
- I want to negotiate.
- I should've offered more...

677
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,340
- to Hyun Jin and Kwang Hyun.
- I know.

678
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,880
- Let's start the negotiation.
- Congratulations.

679
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,820
- She joined Team Yang.
- It's a deal.

680
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,030
Now, we'll carry out the last round.

681
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,920
- They are Ji Suk Jin and Haha.
- All right.

682
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,800
- Hello.
- To check their capabilities,

683
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,620
- I want to see them dance.
- First...

684
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,970
(He starts dancing right away.)

685
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,330
I'd like to see you dance.

686
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,000
Good. You're good.

687
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,690
You're really good.

688
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,100
- I don't like him.
- I like him.

689
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,240
He's my style.

690
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,130
(He shows off
his old dance moves too.)

691
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,170
(They show off their talent
to negotiate their salary.)

692
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,480
Excuse me.

693
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,940
My ERA is 0.2.

694
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,370
I should spend all my money anyway.

695
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,750
(They offer high salaries
even though they don't want to.)

696
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,020
It's 58 dollars.

697
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,820
Gosh, it's zero.

698
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,060
I just wrote it because
I have to spend all the money.

699
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,180
I get only 2 dollars
while Suk Jin gets 49.5 dollars?

700
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,180
I'll play as much as 50 cents today.

701
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,800
This is the result of
2021 Running League Rookie Draft.

702
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,270
Team Yoo will take a photo together.

703
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,030
1, 2, and 3.

704
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,160
("Team Yoo Signed New Contracts with
Ryu Hyun Jin and 3 Other Players")

705
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,630
Now it's Team Yang.

706
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,240
- The players of Team Yang are...
- I'll stand in the middle.

707
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,040
- He's being serious.
- Lee Kwang Soo, Kim Kwang Hyun,

708
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,740
Song Ji Hyo, and Haha.

709
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,250
(The owner bought
only the obedient players.)

710
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,840
("Team Yang Signed New Contracts
with Kim Kwang Hyun and 3 players")

711
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,460
This is it for
2021 Running League Rookie Draft.

712
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,610
- I'm Bae Sung Jae. Thank you.
- Thank you.

713
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,420
(We'd like to thank Bae Sung Jae
for the draft and cross talk.)

714
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,560
(All the team owners
and players are satisfied.)

715
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
- Please gather around.
- Okay.

716
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,390
- It's so pretty.
- Jong Kook is not here.

717
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,920
- What?
- Jong Kook isn't here.

718
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,470
I'm going to sell him...

719
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,800
in the next season anyway.

720
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,540
How dare he tell me...

721
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,540
to offer 300 dollars to Hyun Jin?

722
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,170
I'm only as good as 50 cents.

723
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,340
Nice going.

724
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,870
If I got a dollar,
I would've been here on time.

725
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,080
- Good one.
- Nice tantrum.

726
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,790
He's throwing a tantrum. Good one.

727
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,610
- Mr. Loser.
- Mr. Loser.

728
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,910
That was a good one.

729
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,580
- Okay.
- Hey.

730
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,830
How can you be sitting here...

731
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,060
- when your seniors are around?
- Come on, get up.

732
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,390
We have many players
who are more expensive than you.

733
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,800
- Look at him.
- What's wrong with you?

734
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,270
I was paid 50 cents,
so I'm doing only this much.

735
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,270
He got 10 cents,
but he's standing up.

736
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,670
Let's line up
in the order of salary.

737
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,100
With the pandemic, we had to stop...

738
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,280
our daily lives this year, and
we couldn't go to baseball games.

739
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,340
That's really sad.

740
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,140
To make you feel better,
we prepared some snacks...

741
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,720
that we usually eat
at baseball stadiums.

742
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,790
- Good.
- What's all this?

743
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,610
- Hot dogs.
- I'm hungry.

744
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,990
The hot dog looks good.

745
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,350
It looks great.

746
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,190
Hey, this is New York hot dog.

747
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,120
This isn't for product placement.

748
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,920
- It's not for product placement.
- We paid for them.

749
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,360
- It's not product placement, right?
- No.

750
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,430
I was going to eat it
in front of the cameras.

751
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,830
You should put it on here.

752
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,010
- This one?
- The ketchup.

753
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,010
Should I turn it?

754
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,080
You can turn it.

755
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,140
When I went to watch Hyun Jin's
game, I had a beer with a hot dog.

756
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,340
(It reminds them of the old days.)

757
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,870
Jong Kook is like
the fairy of victory.

758
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,940
I won every time Jong Kook
came to watch my game.

759
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,610
- Really?
- It was 100 percent.

760
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,680
This is good.

761
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,410
The staff got us some snacks because
the major-leaguers are here.

762
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,080
Are we really eating it like this?

763
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,000
We will explain the rules
for the next mission while you eat.

764
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,660
The first mission is
Bunt Foot Volleyball.

765
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,930
This is how baseball players are
trained to improve bunt performance.

766
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,860
- Seriously?
- Instead of using a tennis racket,

767
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,710
you will hit the dodge ball
using baseball bats.

768
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,210
If you fail to hit the ball over
the net, you lose a point.

769
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,340
Okay. I get it.

770
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,550
I'll give you some time to practice.

771
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,910
We should send it over the net
within three attempts.

772
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Good.

773
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,880
- Like this?
- That was good.

774
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Nice.

775
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,180
It's still in.

776
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,460
- Hit it.
- Okay!

777
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,830
- Nice shot.
- What?

778
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,460
(He spiked the dodge ball.)

779
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,530
- Yes!
- Nice.

780
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,800
Okay.

781
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,500
Do you have to hit it so hard?

782
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,740
Let's start.

783
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,630
Let's go.

784
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,010
- Let's do this.
- Good luck.

785
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,280
Hold the bat short.

786
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,900
Good.

787
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,140
My ball.

788
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,780
Okay.

789
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,400
- Two.
- Where is it going?

790
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,980
- Hit it.
- Okay.

791
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,580
(Team Yoo lost a point.)

792
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,410
- Okay.
- Nice. It's 1 to 0.

793
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,440
It's okay.

794
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,990
"Nice. It's 1 to 0"? Okay.

795
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,150
- There will be bench-clearing.
- "Nice. It's 1 to 0"?

796
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,850
- "Nice. It's 1 to 0"?
- There might be bench-clearing.

797
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,460
- Hey.
- Okay.

798
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,830
Okay. You gangling fool.

799
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,330
Do it right.

800
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,040
You gangling fool, okay.

801
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,070
Here we go.

802
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,010
Kwang Soo, you shouldn't
touch the black part.

803
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,570
You should hold it like this.

804
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,830
Did he grab the black part?

805
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,310
- That's against the rule.
- No.

806
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,480
Did you grab the black part?

807
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,600
That's a foul.

808
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,550
- I just did it for a moment.
- Don't tell him.

809
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,110
Don't you dare do it again.

810
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,320
Do you have to say that
holding a bat?

811
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,220
- I'm holding a bat for the game.
- He's scary.

812
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,110
- Okay.
- All right. Let's continue.

813
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,380
Okay, go. Let's go.

814
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,030
- Okay. Good.
- That's good.

815
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,350
- Kwang Hyun.
- Nice serve.

816
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,230
- That's it.
- It's coming.

817
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,830
It's okay, it's okay!

818
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,540
It's okay, it's okay!

819
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,400
(Is he passing the ball
to the floor?)

820
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,710
- Hey.
- Jong Kook.

821
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,130
- My gosh.
- Jong Kook!

822
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,580
Darn it!

823
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,040
I can't believe this.

824
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,050
Jong Kook.

825
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,140
(Laughing at him)

826
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,910
Hey, 50 Cents.

827
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,940
50 Cents.

828
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,840
- That 50 Cents.
- What's okay?

829
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,020
(Imitating Jong Kook)

830
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,650
Hey. You should use 49.5 Dollars
instead of 50 Cents.

831
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,190
Gosh, Kwang Soo.

832
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,690
(He's approaching the net.)

833
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,120
Do you think this is a wall?

834
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,830
- All right.
- What is he doing with the bat?

835
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,570
- Mr. 50 Cents.
- Just be as good as your salary.

836
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,770
- 50 Cents...
- Okay.

837
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,980
- All right.
- It wasn't close enough.

838
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,400
Mr. 50 Cents. Go back to your spot.

839
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,050
Jong Kook is so attractive
when he plays the foot volleyball.

840
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,720
- Here we go.
- Go, Kwang Hyun!

841
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,670
What's wrong with you?

842
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,440
- Okay!
- What's wrong with you, Kwang Hyun?

843
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,320
What's wrong with you?

844
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,060
(He hurls himself down.)

845
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,460
- Okay.
- What was that?

846
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,520
What were you doing?

847
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,150
What was that, Kwang Hyun?

848
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,350
What are you doing?

849
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,420
- Why...
- It was a short slapstick comedy.

850
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,500
Good.

851
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,470
- Let's go.
- We can do this.

852
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,390
- That's it.
- Mine.

853
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,470
This one is pretty.

854
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,630
- Good.
- This one is pretty.

855
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,810
- This is a good one.
- Hey.

856
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,240
My goodness.

857
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,930
(He said it was pretty.)

858
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,670
(But he sent the ball
straight to the net.)

859
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,400
(Shouting)

860
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,480
Go back there. Come over here.

861
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,990
(They start to laugh at him.)

862
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,320
(He makes fun of Jong Kook
walking on his knees.)

863
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
So Min, you were supposed to hit it.

864
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,150
(He's hammering with a bat.)

865
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,730
I love Jong Kook
when he plays foot volleyball.

866
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,800
(The player looks humane
when he plays foot volleyball.)

867
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,660
- He's humane.
- He's making a fuss, but he's bad.

868
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,690
Hey, 50 Cents.

869
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,690
He got 50 cents for a reason.

870
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,770
Here I go.

871
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,630
- Make it low.
- Good.

872
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,100
- All right.
- Kwang Hyun.

873
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,010
- Hit it lightly. Good.
- Move over.

874
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,310
(Kwang Soo's serve
is a little too long.)

875
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,440
- It's in.
- It's in.

876
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,780
Move over.

877
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,520
- No.
- We're so lucky.

878
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,180
Move over.

879
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,880
(The ball hit the bat
right in the middle.)

880
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,790
(The ball flew back.)

881
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,850
No.

882
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,990
Hit it.

883
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,830
(And he missed the ball.)

884
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,830
(Team Yang scored another point
thanks to Kwang Hyun.)

885
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,830
What happened?

886
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,390
The ball went in that direction.

887
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,540
- The ball hit his bat.
- It hit his bat. Gosh.

888
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,570
- I didn't expect that.
- I got so lucky.

889
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,900
It hit his bat and came to our side.

890
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,240
Hey, 50 Cents, come out.
Come out of the court.

891
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,430
Will you play?

892
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,600
(As the team lost a few points,
Suk Jin will replace Jong Kook.)

893
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,340
- Okay.
- Haha, it's already a won game.

894
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,600
- Got it.
- We already won.

895
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,220
- We can do this.
- It's hard to hit it.

896
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,820
- Okay. Nice.
- That'll be hard to hit.

897
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,680
- He has good skills.
- Oh, no. Hey.

898
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,080
Kwang Hyun, hit it over the net.

899
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,990
- Good job.
- Hit it over the net.

900
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,580
(He hit the ball backward.)

901
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,180
(Hyun Jin received the ball.)

902
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,680
- No!
- Darn it.

903
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,260
(But Jae Suk failed.)

904
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,420
You should've hit it upward.

905
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,570
We're doing so well.

906
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,800
Then it would've flown over the net.

907
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,120
Okay.

908
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,470
We're doing so well.

909
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,270
- Good job.
- We have such a large skill gap.

910
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,630
- Exactly.
- True.

911
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,100
- Kwang Soo.
- Are you going to do it?

912
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,540
- It's okay. You can keep playing.
- Go and play.

913
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,280
- That's okay.
- We're winning by a huge margin.

914
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,050
That's ridiculous. Hey, hold on.

915
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,710
- Wait. Hold on.
- Gosh.

916
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,610
Kwang Hyun told me to replace him
saying we're winning.

917
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,410
I'm a little offended.

918
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,820
How large is the margin?

919
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,440
It is now a set point.

920
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,880
It'll end if we score a point.

921
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,330
How about Jong Kook replaces So Min?
What do you think?

922
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,790
- Jong Kook.
- Let's...

923
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,150
Let's win this game.

924
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,230
Let's go.

925
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,330
I'll make our team win.

926
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,800
- I'll stand in the front.
- Where will you stand?

927
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,230
I won't go easy on them
from now on.

928
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,830
- Jong Kook, receive the ball.
- I'll defend the attacks.

929
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,000
Jong Kook, will you receive it?

930
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,540
Okay. Stay there. I'll receive it.

931
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,210
Okay. Let's do this.

932
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,630
(It's a set point,
and Haha will serve.)

933
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,810
Okay.

934
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,100
(The ball fell in a good spot.)

935
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,750
(Okay!)

936
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,010
(Why won't you... Darn.)

937
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,410
- Okay.
- Why won't you... Darn.

938
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,110
(They didn't know who should hit it
and ended up missing it.)

939
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,020
Gosh. You should've received it.

940
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,060
- Why did you... Hold on.
- You should've hit it.

941
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,990
- Why do we have such poor teamwork?
- You said you'd hit it.

942
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,260
(Team Yang won Round 1.)

943
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,290
Let's switch sides.

944
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,830
I moved aside
so you could receive it.

945
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,330
- So Min, you play this time.
- Gosh.

946
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,770
- This is driving me nuts.
- I'll sit this one out.

947
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,830
Suk Jin ruined the game.

948
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,830
Here we go.

949
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,360
- Nice!
- Okay. That's good.

950
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,360
(Tossing it to Suk Jin)

951
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,240
- Hit it upward.
- Run, Suk Jin. Move your body.

952
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,840
(Big Nose's feet are
stuck on the floor.)

953
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,580
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- Run. Move your body, will you?

954
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,220
Suk Jin, that was your ball.

955
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,340
You were closer to the ball.

956
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,720
No. She was closer to the ball.

957
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,790
No. You were much closer
to the ball.

958
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,610
He wouldn't even bother running.

959
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,410
- Suk Jin.
- Hey, why didn't you run to it?

960
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,620
- I ran to it.
- Do what you're paid to do.

961
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,800
- Suk Jin. Suk Jin.
- She's so annoying. Hey!

962
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,730
- You should be ready to run.
- Suk Jin, listen.

963
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,090
This is a mess.

964
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,120
Understood.

965
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,240
I'll hit it toward Suk Jin.

966
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,500
No, don't do that.

967
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,330
- Hit it in this direction.
- Good.

968
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,070
- Receive it. That's good.
- Good job.

969
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,540
- Why did you hit it like that?
- So Min.

970
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,900
- Hit it.
- There you go.

971
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
(She hit it backward!)

972
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,840
Okay. He received it. Kwang Hyun.

973
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,910
Hey, wait.

974
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,910
Nice!

975
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,910
(Nice shot!)

976
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,790
Nice!

977
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,260
(He hit it accurately
to make it fall inside the court.)

978
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,610
- Great job.
- That was amazing.

979
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,420
You did a great job.

980
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,680
- Good job, Kwang Hyun.
- That was incredible.

981
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,530
- It was like a scene from a movie.
- It was incredible.

982
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,920
Let's watch it again.

983
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,120
- Okay. He received it. Kwang Hyun.
- Hey, wait.

984
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,330
Nice!

985
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,600
- My goodness.
- He couldn't do any better.

986
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
If this were an actual game,

987
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,330
- he'd be a national team player.
- I can't deny that.

988
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,040
It was incredible.

989
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,240
Listen to me, guys.

990
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,010
However great it may have looked,
they scored only one point.

991
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,940
- True.
- Don't be discouraged.

992
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,610
- 50 Cents.
- They scored only one point.

993
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,220
You should do better than that
because you got paid 50 dollars.

994
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,680
- Suk Jin.
- That's funny.

995
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Don't be disrespectful to her.

996
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,610
- You should've turned around...
- Wait. Hang on.

997
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,730
- and hit the ball.
- Listen, Suk Jin.

998
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,420
- It's okay.
- Yes, sir.

999
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,190
You don't have much time left
to play for our team anyway.

1000
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,530
So do whatever you want.

1001
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,330
(Big Nose will be
kicked out very soon.)

1002
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,040
Go ahead and play the game
however you want.

1003
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,240
- I don't think you'll play...
- I'll do my best.

1004
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,210
- for our team for so long.
- I love Team Yu.

1005
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,600
- Hyun Jin will serve.
- Stay focused.

1006
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,810
We have such poor teamwork, Mr. Yu.

1007
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,550
- Yes, sir.
- Wait. Hyun Jin.

1008
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,080
You're the highest-paid player
on our team. Don't let me down.

1009
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,110
Right. You're doing well, but...

1010
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,680
Understood? Don't let me down.

1011
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,550
Hyun Jin is doing well.

1012
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,820
Hyun Jin is undeniably
the best player on your team.

1013
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
Go.

1014
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,730
(Team Yu's last hope
Hyun Jin will serve.)

1015
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,760
Okay. Good.

1016
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,420
- We need Hyun Jin to step it up.
- Ji Hyo.

1017
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,190
- Nice! Good job.
- Okay.

1018
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,230
- This is your last chance.
- It's my ball.

1019
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,740
(It's my ball!)

1020
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,430
- Gosh.
- All right.

1021
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,210
- It's my ball.
- Come on.

1022
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,900
(The ball hit the net.)

1023
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,480
- What was that?
- Hey!

1024
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,010
- You got paid 200 dollars.
- Gosh, you brat.

1025
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,340
What's wrong with you?

1026
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,080
- What was that? You brat.
- Okay.

1027
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,520
- It was a mistake.
- Hey.

1028
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,050
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1029
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,790
You seem overly passionate
about the team.

1030
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,340
It's not like that.

1031
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,960
- Try to be a bit less passionate.
- All right.

1032
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,880
- I thought you were the team owner.
- I feel bad I can't pay you more.

1033
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,060
- He's acting like the team owner.
- You're overly passionate.

1034
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,420
- You know what I mean, right?
- You should be more passionate...

1035
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,800
- about our team. I'll try.
- Try to think of yourself more.

1036
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,390
- Give me some slack, will you?
- Cheer up.

1037
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,430
- He's actually not that good.
- I'm his fan.

1038
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,590
I bet he will make a mistake.

1039
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,330
- Okay. Toss it.
- Nice.

1040
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,330
Okay. So Min, it's your ball.
Hit it.

1041
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,430
- That's good.
- Okay.

1042
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,340
- Didn't you hit it over the net?
- No, I failed.

1043
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,210
- She's lousy at this.
- Hey.

1044
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,420
She doesn't have basic skills.

1045
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,540
Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu, will you...

1046
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,610
let So Min keep playing?

1047
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,690
I think we need a substitution.
Suk Jin, come out.

1048
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,790
(I think we need a substitution.
Suk Jin, come out.)

1049
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,590
- Wait. You can't...
- You made the right decision.

1050
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,960
- Wait.
- I'm glad you made the decision.

1051
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,630
- You're too distracting.
- Please.

1052
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,590
- Right. He's too distracting.
- Hey!

1053
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,130
She's the one who made a mistake.

1054
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,130
Come on out.

1055
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,630
Will you keep running your team
like this?

1056
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,440
You shouldn't run the team
like this.

1057
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,060
- Suk Jin, step off the court.
- I mean...

1058
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,210
- Leave the court.
- Okay.

1059
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,000
- Can I talk to you briefly?
- Of course, Mr. Yang.

1060
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,130
He called him "Mr. Yang".

1061
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,340
Gosh, seriously.

1062
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,440
Okay. This time, I'll make sure...

1063
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,610
Nice serve.

1064
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,340
(Screaming)

1065
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Move.

1066
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,330
(He hit it with a monstrous scream
and strength.)

1067
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,750
- That was unexpected.
- Good job.

1068
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,360
- That was a back attack.
- It was unexpected.

1069
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,730
- What was that?
- He suddenly screamed and hit it.

1070
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,230
- Great job.
- How was my back attack?

1071
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,360
- That was great.
- It was good, right?

1072
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,730
- Yes.
- My back attack.

1073
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,360
- That was too much.
- Why did you do that?

1074
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,840
- What's wrong with you?
- It was too much.

1075
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,610
- Don't hit it too hard.
- Be careful. You saw that, right?

1076
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,110
- Gosh.
- You saw that, right?

1077
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,230
He has some mental issues.

1078
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,250
He's scaring us.

1079
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,710
He must keep it together
during a game.

1080
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,080
My player has some issues.

1081
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,520
He should improve
his mental strength.

1082
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,080
- I'm sorry.
- They're complaining.

1083
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,040
- We can do this!
- Focus!

1084
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,420
(After he pulled himself together,
the game resumed.)

1085
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,060
- That's good.
- Okay. Good.

1086
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,520
Okay. Good.
Just hit it over the net.

1087
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,230
- Hey!
- Gosh, seriously.

1088
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,230
(Gosh, seriously.)

1089
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,000
- This won't work.
- Okay.

1090
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,130
- Why did you...
- You stand...

1091
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,830
- Why did you...
- You stand in the front.

1092
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,020
Stand in the front.

1093
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,340
- Gosh, I...
- We almost scored a point.

1094
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,790
They're too scary to play with.

1095
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,210
- You idiot.
- Out, out.

1096
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,960
(Out?)

1097
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,000
- Out, out.
- It went out.

1098
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,980
- It went out.
- They're too scary to play with.

1099
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,250
(While Jae Suk was being scolded
for his mistake...)

1100
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,270
Haha.

1101
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,480
Now is the time. Let's do it.

1102
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,710
(He hit the ball toward the wall.)

1103
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,710
(He got caught right away.)

1104
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,110
- It went out.
- What was that?

1105
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,360
- You're so bad at this.
- What did you do?

1106
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,520
- Gosh. Why...
- Don't go.

1107
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,060
- Why can't you do it?
- Don't go.

1108
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,060
That was funny.

1109
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,630
- It went out.
- Why did you do that?

1110
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,690
That was ridiculous.

1111
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,630
I'll do better this time.
I won't be too greedy.

1112
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,630
- You tried to pull a trick.
- I'm sorry.

1113
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,340
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, gosh.

1114
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,230
(Hyun Jin launches
a surprise attack.)

1115
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,670
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, gosh.

1116
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,710
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

1117
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,630
- Gosh, Hyun Jin.
- Hey!

1118
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,650
(He made a mistake
while trying to use the same trick.)

1119
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,380
(It serves you right.)

1120
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,380
(It was even funnier
because he tried a sly strategy.)

1121
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,440
- He made the same mistake.
- My gosh.

1122
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,310
- No need to rush.
- Why...

1123
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,420
Why did he learn sly tricks
from them?

1124
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,460
Gosh. Why did he learn such a thing?

1125
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,710
Incoming.

1126
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,690
Okay.

1127
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,520
- Good. That was great.
- Nice.

1128
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,250
- Up, up. Good.
- Good job.

1129
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,420
(Screaming)

1130
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,920
Why?

1131
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,590
(He screamed again.)

1132
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,770
My goodness.

1133
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,360
- That's enough.
- Mr. Yu!

1134
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,900
- I saw him...
- I barely got a chance...

1135
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,710
- I saw Suk Jin hesitating.
- Gosh, seriously.

1136
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,440
- Hey. Come on.
- I was surprised too.

1137
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,940
- What is wrong with him?
- This is driving me crazy.

1138
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,270
- I'm just passionate...
- Please don't do that.

1139
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,610
- I'm just passionate. That's all.
- It's good to be passionate, but...

1140
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,440
- It's a good thing, but...
- Calm down.

1141
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,380
Okay. I understand.

1142
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,460
- What's the score?
- It's a set point.

1143
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,020
- I see.
- If we score a point, we'll win.

1144
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,880
Yes. The match will end
if you lose in this round.

1145
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,750
- Let's end it.
- Go, Team Yu!

1146
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,630
(Could Team Yoo be able to
win this round?)

1147
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,460
- Gosh.
- That was really good.

1148
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,190
- Haha.
- He received it.

1149
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,730
Here. Hit it, Kwang Soo.

1150
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,810
- Nice.
- Good.

1151
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,810
(He tossed it.)

1152
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,380
(Kwang Hyun ducked quickly.)

1153
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,340
(The ball fell on Team Yu's side
of the court.)

1154
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,900
- Move.
- Kwang Hyun, get up.

1155
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,110
You must pull this off.

1156
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,710
(He hit the ball right in the net.)

1157
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,520
(Jong Kook lost his temper
as the team owner made a mistake.)

1158
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,310
Gosh. Don't be greedy.

1159
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,710
- What a shame.
- Don't be greedy.

1160
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,230
(Team Yang won.)

1161
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,130
- I was surprised.
- Gosh.

1162
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,960
- How did you dodge it?
- You were amazing.

1163
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,330
It was incredible.

1164
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,190
(Screaming)

1165
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,230
It was amazing.

1166
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,690
Why did you do that?

1167
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,840
- Why did you do that?
- Exactly.

1168
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,940
I can't believe you.

1169
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,480
It was a good chance.

1170
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,230
- There was no one to block it.
- You could get it over the net.

1171
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,040
I'm the team owner. Gosh.

1172
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,250
How dare you use violence
against your team owner?

1173
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,080
My gosh. What was that?

1174
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,190
If Jong Kook gets kicked out,
I'll transfer to that team.

1175
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,710
- We almost won.
- He's invincible.

1176
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,790
That team's owner must have
a lot to think about.

1177
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,290
Maybe I should quit
running this stupid team.

1178
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,460
They always argue with one another.

1179
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,330
As a result of the match,

1180
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,590
Team Yang that won the match
will receive 500 dollars.

1181
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,630
Yes!

1182
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,630
And Team Yoo will receive
300 dollars.

1183
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,340
It's time for
the first salary negotiation.

1184
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,610
The team owners...

1185
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:37,210
should decide the order
of the players to meet.

1186
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,610
Also,

1187
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,840
You have 200 dollars left
on top of the money you just got.

1188
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,980
You can use that money.

1189
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,150
700 dollars in total?

1190
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,310
Each player will meet
their team owner,

1191
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,420
and if the negotiation
falls through,

1192
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,960
- meet with the other team owner.
- I see.

1193
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,630
If both teams refuse to draft you,

1194
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,790
you'll be paid half the amount
the first team offered.

1195
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,790
- Really?
- You need to impress us,

1196
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,830
the team owners.

1197
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,230
If you're offered 10 cents,
you'll get paid only 5 cents.

1198
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,090
- That's right.
- Okay. Got it.

1199
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,670
Okay. Then please move to
the negotiation site.

1200
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,630
(The 1st salary negotiation!)

1201
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,610
(Unlike how they may look,
these are the team owners' offices.)

1202
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,040
(The players are waiting
in front of the offices.)

1203
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,940
I have no choice.

1204
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,210
The salary negotiation
will be brutal.

1205
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,590
I wanted to let you know in advance.

1206
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,340
Why did you tell us that
when some of us aren't here?

1207
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,060
To be honest, I'm in a very bad mood
right now.

1208
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,590
How dare you torture me
when I'm your team owner?

1209
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,020
(How dare you torture me
when I'm your team owner?)

1210
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,750
- He did that.
- Gosh. I'm speechless.

1211
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,520
- Drop them from the team.
- I mean...

1212
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,270
I'm the team owner, you know.

1213
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,630
- I bet you're thirsty.
- I mean...

1214
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,690
Please take a sip.

1215
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,940
(He pretends to be loyal.)

1216
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,340
- Hold on.
- I just want to say...

1217
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,460
- Watch your health.
- The team's a mess because of you.

1218
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,610
- I see.
- Is that so?

1219
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,480
For someone worth only 50 cents,

1220
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,750
I showed a lot of love for the team.

1221
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,650
- He...
- Who else is better than me?

1222
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,710
- I know.
- You should give him 50 cents more.

1223
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,920
- That's why he's complaining.
- Jong Kook...

1224
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,940
- It's to save money for others.
- A loyal teammate is worth having.

1225
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,190
- Yes, having you on the team...
- Of course.

1226
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,480
I prevent conflicts
from bubbling over.

1227
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,730
Where's the door?
They're all tied up.

1228
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,630
- I'll make you one!
- Sure, I get it.

1229
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,630
- Let me make one for you.
- Gosh.

1230
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,290
Unbelievable.

1231
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,770
- Let me go over the rules.
- Sure.

1232
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,500
- Each team has its own budget.
- Right.

1233
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,810
The former 200 dollars plus what
you earned in the previous game.

1234
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,730
You may utilize it
at your discretion.

1235
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,860
So they can do whatever they want?

1236
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,340
The teams still need
to be balanced out though.

1237
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,580
Why on earth do they get
so much authority?

1238
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,840
The team owners are
in a league of their own anyway.

1239
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,580
After deciding on the order,

1240
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,420
each player will get
two minutes to negotiate.

1241
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,810
Renew the contract by that time
or the deal is off.

1242
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,520
That means you'll have to negotiate
with the other team owner.

1243
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,290
If a contract with
the other team falls through,

1244
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,650
you'll be forced to resign
with your former team...

1245
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,500
at half the original rate.

1246
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,590
(The final option
is a pay-cut of 50 percent.)

1247
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,420
Could the team owners
offer us less money?

1248
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,670
They could, but then
they'll lose key players.

1249
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,170
Our team owner has
nearly twice his budget.

1250
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,560
(Who will hit the jackpot
in the first salary negotiation?)

1251
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,380
Please begin
your first negotiations.

1252
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,400
You have two minutes.

1253
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,440
- Suk Jin, it's good to see you.
- You too.

1254
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,940
You've been working hard
for this team.

1255
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,750
I only have a love for this team...

1256
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,920
- and...
- Hold on.

1257
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,340
What's your current salary?

1258
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,460
- It's 49.5 dollars.
- 49.5 dollars, I see.

1259
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,330
You got lucky last season,
didn't you?

1260
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,560
So the salary I propose is this.

1261
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,860
Well...

1262
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,360
- May I say something though?
- Sure.

1263
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:13,130
There's a team that wants me.

1264
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,960
(There's a team that wants me.)

1265
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,590
I hope you consider that.

1266
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,000
(Jae Suk snorts
at Suk Jin's intentions.)

1267
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,230
- I hate switching teams.
- Is that so?

1268
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,400
That's not what I want.
I want to set down roots.

1269
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,150
- I grew attached to the team.
- Then...

1270
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:28,170
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk
offers him a new salary.)

1271
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,710
What?

1272
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,920
(20 dollars)

1273
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,610
- I...
- Are you kidding me?

1274
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,810
I cut 50 percent.

1275
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,480
- You cut my salary?
- I guess...

1276
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,090
I could add five more dollars.

1277
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,230
Is this the "maxi"?

1278
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,500
The maximum, you mean?

1279
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,000
What on earth is "maxi"?

1280
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,560
Is that a sausage brand?

1281
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,690
(Suk Jin's lost for words
at the salary proposal.)

1282
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,730
All right, then.

1283
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,400
- Okay, I get it.
- Right.

1284
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,610
- You're not signing the contract?
- I'm disappointed.

1285
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,770
- I won't.
- I see.

1286
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,810
Please get going then.

1287
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,110
You heard my offer,
so you may leave.

1288
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,310
Darn, that's cheap of you. So cheap.

1289
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,340
Hello.

1290
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,650
This is so that I won't
have to look you in the eyes.

1291
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,040
It could sway my decision.

1292
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,840
I understand how it can
weaken someone.

1293
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,480
Yang Se Chan...

1294
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,190
How much do you think
you should receive?

1295
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,590
During my first season as a rookie,

1296
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,110
I started off
at too low of a salary.

1297
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,290
- How much was it?
- Two dollars.

1298
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,750
- Two dollars?
- Yes.

1299
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,130
- If you want to win...
- Yes?

1300
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,770
- You'll have to be more generous.
- Right.

1301
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,860
I have 700 dollars to spend,

1302
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,130
so tell me the amount...

1303
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,400
you think you should receive.

1304
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,730
- About 150 dollars.
- Wait. What did you just say?

1305
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,460
- 150 dollars.
- Well...

1306
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,340
- What?
- 150 dollars.

1307
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,170
- I...
- I'll be loyal forever.

1308
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,940
But even 15 dollars
seems like too much.

1309
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,420
(The air is stiff
around the negotiation table.)

1310
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,270
- Mr. Yang, please hear me out.
- Sure.

1311
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,250
Se Chan, I say this as your friend.

1312
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,480
- But I'm the team owner.
- I say this as your friend.

1313
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,560
Go ahead.

1314
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,290
The amount you offer me...

1315
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,520
will be wired into your account...

1316
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,420
once the next game is over.

1317
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,400
That's absurd!

1318
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,770
Anyway,

1319
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,540
I don't think I can spend
more than 20 dollars on you.

1320
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,670
(20 dollars out of 700?)

1321
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,860
- I mean...
- 20 dollars?

1322
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,770
- I'm afraid so.
- 20 dollars?

1323
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,770
You're going from 2 to 20 dollars,
which is a 1,000 percent raise.

1324
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:08,270
- Here's your last chance. 5, 4...
- 4...

1325
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,840
- 3...
- I'll sign for 100 dollars then.

1326
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,340
- No, even 60 is too much.
- 2, 1.

1327
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,420
Leave.

1328
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,650
(The petty friend explodes.)

1329
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,060
Hold on. He's beating up
his team owner!

1330
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,420
He's beating up the team owner.

1331
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,750
Stop hitting me!

1332
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,830
(Is this how negotiations go?)

1333
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,650
(A dirty negotiation process
you'd never see in the big league)

1334
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,190
He's beating up his team owner!

1335
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,560
He's beating up the team owner.

1336
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,400
He's kicking me!

1337
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,590
(The team owner's wishy-washy
attitude makes him explode.)

1338
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:31,810
You're kicking your team owner.

1339
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,340
(Spitting)

1340
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,840
How crazy must one be
to beat up his team owner?

1341
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,580
(Kwang Soo's negotiation
falls through.)

1342
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,610
What a piece of trash.

1343
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,210
(Each team is looking
at serious pay-cuts.)

1344
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:45,750
30 dollars. So Min, you see...

1345
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,210
I hear that the other team owner...

1346
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,860
- is an ex.
- No way.

1347
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,590
No, there must be
a misunderstanding.

1348
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,790
- Will you sign with this team?
- Sure.

1349
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,520
(So Min signs a contract
at 40 dollars.)

1350
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,630
He cut my salary.

1351
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,630
Since you did a good job,

1352
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,420
I'm going to give you a raise.

1353
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,230
Please sign.

1354
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,770
(He offers 80 dollars to Ji Hyo,
which is a slight increase.)

1355
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:04,840
This I'll remember.

1356
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,040
(She's the first
to receive a raise!)

1357
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,000
I have no intention
of leaving this team.

1358
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,210
- Great.
- Thank you.

1359
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,610
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

1360
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,040
- Haha, it's you.
- Hello.

1361
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,810
- I saw you doing a great job.
- Thanks.

1362
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,920
You see,

1363
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,610
I'm working with a tight budget.

1364
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:21,460
What do you mean?
We earned a lot for you earlier.

1365
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,610
You already sound annoyed.

1366
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,810
Hardly. I find you admirable.

1367
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,190
Let's take a look
at your previous salary.

1368
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,560
It's 58 dollars.

1369
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,000
Next will be a round of quizzes,

1370
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,860
which means
I can't possibly sign you.

1371
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,630
- You see, Mr. Yang...
- Yes?

1372
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm smarter than the majority here.

1373
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,500
- Is that so?
- Of course.

1374
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,210
- I'll ask you a question then.
- Sure.

1375
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,360
- If you answer correctly,
- Yes?

1376
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,130
I'll consider...

1377
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,880
- 100 dollars.
- 100 dollars it is.

1378
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,080
This was once asked on the show.

1379
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,380
What is the full name
of the president of Russia?

1380
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,650
If you get this right...

1381
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,190
(A correct answer will get him
a salary of 150 dollars!)

1382
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,790
- 150 dollars?
- Yes, 150 dollars.

1383
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,520
Yes, because that's an ability
I'll need in the next round.

1384
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,980
(He wants to answer it correctly,
but his lips won't move.)

1385
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,130
You don't know it, do you?

1386
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,230
I do!

1387
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,360
I'm digging the name up
from my memory. The five syllables.

1388
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:05,960
- Putin.
- Right.

1389
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,060
What's his first name?

1390
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,500
(His first name?)

1391
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,170
(His eyes dash from side to side.)

1392
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,360
This is hilarious!

1393
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,210
- What is it?
- Siba...

1394
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,980
Siba... What?

1395
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,500
- Is that your answer?
- No.

1396
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,880
- Then...
- Wait a second.

1397
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,580
- That is incorrect.
- Escobar.

1398
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,020
What?

1399
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,110
Escobar.

1400
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,420
(Haha has a talent for
coming up with foreign names.)

1401
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,040
What's the answer?

1402
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,090
- So...
- What's his name?

1403
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,520
- You're out.
- What is it?

1404
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,560
Did you renew your contract?

1405
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,560
(Haha's lack of knowledge
resulted in a pay-cut.)

1406
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,460
- I forgot my contract.
- He signed one.

1407
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,920
- Jong Kook.
- I'm the team's franchise player...

1408
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,460
who has nothing but love
for his team.

1409
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,770
What's your current salary?

1410
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:39,770
My salary?

1411
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,000
I see you don't remember.

1412
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,860
I don't get how that is possible.

1413
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,540
- Are you here to argue?
- Of course not.

1414
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,310
But it's something
you should remember.

1415
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,500
I mean, just think about it.

1416
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,840
Kwang Soo signed his contract
for two dollars...

1417
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,000
while I did for 50 cents.

1418
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,670
(An annual salary of 50 cents)

1419
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,840
All hope has been
taken away from me.

1420
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,110
Do you know what happens
when one loses hope?

1421
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,690
- Who's most terrifying?
- Hold on.

1422
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,290
The one who has no tomorrow
is the scariest.

1423
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,590
- I mean...
- Why are you so angry all the time?

1424
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,360
- How can I not be?
- Why are you so angry?

1425
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,900
It seems like
the roles are reversed.

1426
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,290
Jong Kook looks like the team owner.

1427
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,630
- You're not the owner, you know.
- How can I not be angry?

1428
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,290
- Why did you grab that?
- Come on.

1429
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,790
- Why did you grab that?
- Mr. Yu,

1430
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:17,810
hear me out.

1431
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,560
- Still...
- Let me be somewhat motivated.

1432
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,340
I'm the team's franchise player.

1433
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,400
A franchise player?

1434
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,540
Aren't I the team's
franchise player?

1435
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,840
- Then...
- I...

1436
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,210
How about 30 dollars?

1437
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,770
- 30 dollars?
- It's a big raise.

1438
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:32,250
What's going on in here?

1439
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,880
You should come out.

1440
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,150
- Hey!
- Your time is up.

1441
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,520
What is he doing? Seriously?

1442
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,290
- What is he doing?
- Kwang Soo...

1443
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,560
Never have I seen...

1444
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,250
He's forcing the team owner
to write a contract.

1445
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,420
(The love for his team
manifested into a forced contract.)

1446
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,460
Hey!

1447
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:45,860
- 80 dollars.
- Hold on.

1448
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,500
I only offered 30 dollars.

1449
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,540
- He forced Jae Suk to write 80.
- 80 dollars is ridiculous.

1450
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,840
He loves his team so much...

1451
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,440
that it made him
want to get revenge on it.

1452
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,340
That's the love he has for his team.

1453
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,670
I mean...

1454
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,170
You can't force me to sign this!

1455
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,270
We're good.

1456
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,710
Okay, 80 dollars.

1457
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,040
(Team Yang's top player
Kim Kwang Hyun enters.)

1458
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,790
- First of all...
- How much do you have left?

1459
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,750
I spent quite a lot already.

1460
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,380
Is there an amount in mind?

1461
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,860
- Your previous salary was 190.
- Yes, 190 dollars.

1462
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,480
Is there an amount
you personally want?

1463
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,750
Not really.

1464
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,960
I'll take what you give me.

1465
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,330
Unbelievable.

1466
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,340
- This team made more money.
- Right.

1467
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,130
We earned 500 dollars
while they only earned 300.

1468
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,440
That's a 200-dollar difference.

1469
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,540
Hyun Jin will be worth
at least 200 dollars.

1470
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:28,770
So to match that...

1471
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,580
- My salary should match his.
- Of course.

1472
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,000
You should receive more, is that it?

1473
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,310
- Yes, about 250 dollars.
- How much?

1474
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,340
- 250 dollars.
- 250 dollars.

1475
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,420
(Brazen)

1476
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:37,420
Still...

1477
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,440
- I'm liking this.
- Still,

1478
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,310
we have 200 dollars more to spare.

1479
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,790
- Hi, Hyun Jin.
- Hello.

1480
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,250
You see...

1481
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,460
A player just now...

1482
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,520
literally stole money...

1483
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,750
from the team's budget.

1484
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,000
Well, that's...

1485
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:54,730
only the team's problem.

1486
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,090
- Then...
- This negotiation...

1487
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,540
involves just me.

1488
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,000
That's good and all,

1489
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,380
but let me tell you this.

1490
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,900
The team isn't in
a good place financially.

1491
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,210
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1492
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,900
How much are you willing
to offer me then?

1493
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,020
Out of all the players,

1494
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,440
you receive the most at 200 dollars.

1495
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,090
By my calculations though,

1496
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,610
I can only offer you...

1497
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,730
about 110 dollars.

1498
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,150
(I can only offer you
about 110 dollars.)

1499
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:21,920
You're cutting my salary?

1500
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:23,630
That's not how I'd call it.

1501
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:24,900
The team isn't doing
so well financially.

1502
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,290
So I'm going from
200 dollars to 110 dollars?

1503
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,670
If you put it like that,

1504
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,860
- it could seem like a pay cut.
- No way.

1505
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,040
You're leaving?

1506
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,980
Wait. Hold on a second. Hyun Jin!

1507
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,000
- Hyun Jin didn't sign on.
- The deal fell through?

1508
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,000
- He left the team.
- Hyun Jin left his team!

1509
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,040
Kwang Hyun,
maybe you should do the same.

1510
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,080
Wait...

1511
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,420
It seems like Jae Suk
didn't manage to sign Hyun Jin.

1512
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,150
Hyun Jin's deal falling through
had them moving fast.

1513
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,250
(Se Chan quickly
offers the desired amount.)

1514
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,290
(I'm good!)

1515
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:53,330
Here.

1516
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,460
- See?
- Got it.

1517
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,400
- I'll sign the contract.
- That's 250 dollars.

1518
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,460
I'll sign it.

1519
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,590
Mr. Yang, Hyun Jin
didn't renew his contract.

1520
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,900
This is your chance
to sign both players.

1521
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,690
- All right.
- Kim Kwang Hyun and Ryu Hyun Jin.

1522
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,230
- Kwang Hyun renewed his contract.
- He sure did.

1523
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,400
(Kwang Hyun signs the contract
for the highest salary yet.)

1524
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,560
- Let's work hard.
- Sure.

1525
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,940
Hyun Jin's deal falling through
had them moving fast.

1526
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,130
- Exactly.
- He immediately signed on.

1527
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,500
- You should head inside.
- What...

1528
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,520
All right.

1529
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:16,340
(Team Yu's budget: 380 dollars)

1530
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,750
What are you doing here?

1531
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,150
My deal with the other team
fell through.

1532
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:20,710
There was a bit of a mishap.

1533
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:21,960
- You refused to sign with them?
- That's right.

1534
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,650
By the looks of it,

1535
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,920
I'm the last one
you can negotiate with.

1536
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,520
Right.
How much did the other team offer?

1537
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,290
He offered me 20 dollars.
That team has 700 dollars.

1538
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,290
He offered me 20 dollars.

1539
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,400
- So I...
- His team has enough money.

1540
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,040
Exactly. I slapped him in the face
and left.

1541
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,500
- I have a short temper.
- 20 dollars...

1542
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,840
I slapped him in the face
and spat in his face.

1543
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,750
- You have a bad personality.
- No, that's not true.

1544
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,250
I'm a little bit short-tempered,
but I'm not a bad person.

1545
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,940
Would you get a haircut
if I draft you?

1546
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,810
(That's... Well...)

1547
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:56,610
- It might bring me bad luck.
- I'll give you five dollars for it.

1548
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,630
(Team Yu's condition is
to maintain a tidy hairstyle.)

1549
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,860
- 5 dollars for a new haircut.
- You'll give me 5 dollars?

1550
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,750
- On top of my salary?
- Yes.

1551
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,590
- Okay.
- Just for a new haircut.

1552
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,420
But I'll only trim it a little bit.

1553
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,630
- I can do that.
- I see.

1554
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:11,560
- Let me think.
- Thank you.

1555
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,770
(Kwang Soo signs a contract
at 33 dollars...)

1556
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,840
(including 5 dollars
for a new haircut.)

1557
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,940
- Did you sign with this team?
- Yes, I did.

1558
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,040
You should bring your contract.

1559
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,840
- Really?
- Jong Kook, come back with yours.

1560
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,920
We need to negotiate again.
80 dollars is too much.

1561
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,480
- 80 dollars?
- That's nonsense.

1562
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,840
What are you talking about?

1563
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,790
I already signed the contract.

1564
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,610
That's not reasonable.
Wait, Kwang Soo. This is yours.

1565
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,730
- Wait.
- Whose is that?

1566
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,420
This is So Min's.
You agreed to pay her 40 dollars.

1567
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,860
Wait. Hold on.

1568
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,560
(Kwang Soo is furious
because of the low salary!)

1569
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,170
I gave you the wrong one. Stop it.

1570
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,730
(He lost his temper
and started a fight as always.)

1571
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,810
(The post-negotiation process is
revealed transparently.)

1572
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,060
Hold on.

1573
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,000
I'll be the last one
to join this team.

1574
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,170
(Suk Jin who hasn't signed
a contract entered.)

1575
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,440
How much did he offer?

1576
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,440
- The thing is...
- I don't have much money left now.

1577
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,610
I paid the other players a lot.

1578
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:55,080
- Pardon?
- How much did he offer?

1579
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,270
Five bills.

1580
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,380
You mean, five dollars?

1581
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,920
- 50 dollars. Yes.
- 50 dollars?

1582
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,810
No. I can never spend 50 dollars
to draft you.

1583
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,790
- But...
- Even if you do well this time...

1584
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,190
I mean... Listen.

1585
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:08,420
I deserve much more than 20 dollars,
you brat.

1586
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,190
I'm the team owner. How dare you?

1587
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,420
Leave now.

1588
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,360
If you keep acting like this,
I'll drag you out.

1589
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,400
How can you say that?

1590
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,290
Do you want to give up
and move to a deserted island?

1591
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,730
Hey, Haha is...

1592
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:19,860
Get out!

1593
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,940
- Get out!
- I won't leave!

1594
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,440
How dare you behave so rudely?

1595
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,710
- Gosh.
- This is absurd.

1596
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,110
How much will you pay me?

1597
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,540
For a mere 10 dollars...

1598
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,520
I was offered 50 dollars.

1599
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,610
Leave!

1600
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,750
- "Leave!"
- "Leave!"

1601
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,980
(The owner's voice resonates
out of his office.)

1602
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,380
- "Leave!"
- You let...

1603
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,360
your greed for money sway you.

1604
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,360
Even 20 dollars is too much for you!

1605
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,790
Please come out.

1606
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,560
- I won't draft you. Leave!
- That's so funny.

1607
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,090
- I don't want to see you. Leave!
- I'll leave of my own accord!

1608
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,690
Leave now.

1609
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,400
I've never seen anyone
that greedy for money like him.

1610
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,940
Gosh. I'm so upset.

1611
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,130
He offered me only 20 dollars
when I used to be paid 50 dollars?

1612
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,770
He's insane.

1613
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,540
- Oh, my.
- Hello.

1614
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,080
We meet again here.

1615
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:03,440
You see, I want to draft
a skilled, trustworthy player.

1616
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,310
I used to be paid 200 dollars.

1617
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:06,520
- 200 dollars?
- Yes.

1618
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,560
200 dollars...

1619
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,590
Mr. Yang, please remember...

1620
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:13,650
that if the deal falls through,
he has to sign with them for half.

1621
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,130
If you offer 10 dollars
on top of the half,

1622
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,860
- you can draft him.
- Really?

1623
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,790
Hyun Jin, what are you doing here?

1624
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,130
Why did you come here?
What's with you?

1625
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,000
- Please leave.
- Hey, listen to me.

1626
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,060
Leave!

1627
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,940
- Did Hyun Jin sign with that team?
- Time's up.

1628
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,150
You should leave now.

1629
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,500
- What?
- Go on.

1630
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,380
- "Go on."
- You should leave now.

1631
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,810
Hyun Jin is in trouble.

1632
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,110
(Hyun Jin failed to sign
with Team Yang as well.)

1633
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,290
What happens to Hyun Jin now?

1634
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,590
Please send them all away.

1635
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,610
Both of them have to sign
a contract...

1636
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,480
for half of what Jae Suk offered.

1637
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,790
And Jae Suk can choose one of them.

1638
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,520
At least one of them has to
join Team Yu...

1639
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,460
for half of what he was
first offered.

1640
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,770
Of course, I choose...
Half of what I offered...

1641
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,270
Then I can draft him at 60 dollars.

1642
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,230
- What?
- Have you made up your mind?

1643
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,360
Yes. I choose Hyun Jin.

1644
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,810
60 dollars?

1645
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,380
- I will quit.
- Who?

1646
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,310
How much did you offer Suk Jin?

1647
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,540
- Suk Jin? I offered 25 dollars.
- Yes.

1648
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,020
Then Suk Jin will transfer to
Team Yang at 12.50 dollars.

1649
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,710
12 dollars and 50 cents?

1650
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,420
I offered him 25 dollars earlier.

1651
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,710
- You should've accepted it.
- Okay.

1652
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,590
It's all been sorted out.
Hyun Jin,

1653
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:21,150
let's forget about any hard feelings
against each other.

1654
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,360
I'll stay on the team.

1655
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,590
He cut my salary. I'm speechless.

1656
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,090
After all I've done?

1657
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:27,730
(The 1st salary negotiation ended
with hurt feelings.)

1658
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:30,230
(Team Yu, 287 dollars,
Team Yang, 322.50 dollars)

1659
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,940
(Hyun Jin, 260, So Min, 90,
Jong Kook, 80.50, Kwang Soo, 35)

1660
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,360
(Kwang Hyun, 440, Ji Hyo, 130,
Haha, 93, Suk Jin, 62)

1661
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,500
Kwang Hyun signed
the largest contract.

1662
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,270
Hyun Jin stormed out
even before the negotiation began.

1663
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,920
Hyun Jin, I think you should
work on that negotiation style.

1664
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,150
Think about it.

1665
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,750
You offered him only 120 dollars
when he used to be paid 200 dollars.

1666
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:48,790
Mister.

1667
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,020
- You're not on our team anymore.
- That's why I'm telling you.

1668
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,650
- He transferred to that team?
- Oh, right. He's on the other team.

1669
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,520
- Yes, he did.
- We drafted him for a low salary.

1670
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,920
Of course, he's an old man.

1671
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,630
I want to ask you about something,
Jong Kook.

1672
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,730
Why do you love your team so much?

1673
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,230
- Me?
- Yes.

1674
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,360
What's the reason?

1675
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,400
Since I belong to this team,

1676
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,270
- I don't need a reason...
- It's unconditional love.

1677
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,810
But he twisted my arm
to make me sign the contract...

1678
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,750
- Pardon?
- for the amount he wanted. Gosh.

1679
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,480
- Did he force you to sign?
- That's not true.

1680
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,420
He wanted to pay me that much,
but he had no justification for it.

1681
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,210
So I helped him a little.

1682
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,540
- He's so scary.
- He was...

1683
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,880
- acting shy.
- I'm speechless.

1684
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,860
- But he was actually happy.
- He wrote the number.

1685
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,250
He wrote it by himself.

1686
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,690
I'm utterly speechless.

1687
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,460
He wrote all those zeroes
of his own accord.

1688
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,460
Also, I'm the franchise player.

1689
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,270
I told you, you're French fries.

1690
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,770
He's the franchise player.

1691
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,630
- On our team...
- Hyun Jin is the franchise player.

1692
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,690
That's not true.

1693
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,040
You know, the same goes for
Mr. Yang.

1694
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,310
- I offered you...
- Hold on a second.

1695
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,540
- Actually, there are...
- Yes?

1696
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,980
so many questions I want to
ask Hyun Jin and Kwang Hyun.

1697
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,710
- Of course.
- Mister, please be quiet.

1698
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,520
I'm very sorry, but...

1699
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,440
Will you stay quiet?
Or should we make you?

1700
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,560
Nice.

1701
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,710
I have a question.
When you play in a Korean league...

1702
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,330
and when you play in MLB,

1703
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,730
do you work harder
in one of the leagues?

1704
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,900
Are you saying
he plays halfheartedly in Korea?

1705
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,590
- That's not what I mean.
- No way.

1706
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,540
- Not halfheartedly.
- Of course, I'm not halfhearted.

1707
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,230
- But maybe...
- He pays more attention?

1708
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:14,270
I don't want to relate it to our
race, but if you get paid more...

1709
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,400
- You feel pressured.
- There's a higher expectation.

1710
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,840
See? I knew it.

1711
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,840
- It's true.
- I knew it.

1712
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,940
I even dived to live up
to his expectation,

1713
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,020
- but he cut my salary.
- Gosh. That's enough.

1714
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,250
- Gosh. He's still holding a grudge.
- He's the type that holds grudges.

1715
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,250
I'm sorry. I didn't...

1716
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,860
Real baseball players
react exactly like this.

1717
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:32,130
- It hurts your feelings.
- If they get a pay cut in winter,

1718
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,480
they don't even look at the staff.

1719
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,330
- Wait.
- Of course.

1720
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:39,170
But why would you react
the same way on this show?

1721
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,230
This isn't a real baseball team.

1722
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,940
Hyun Jin was immersed in
his role too much.

1723
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,440
Honestly, I thought you would
give me a 10 dollar raise.

1724
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,730
Gosh. Don't be so petty.

1725
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,170
I think we'll do something
like "Metal Tray Karaoke Room".

1726
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,340
Through this game, you can check
your common knowledge and teamwork.

1727
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,920
It's Loyal Chinese Idiom.

1728
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,920
What?

1729
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,090
- Chinese idioms?
- I can't do this.

1730
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,310
- I'm done for.
- Chinese idioms?

1731
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:07,460
All members have to participate.
We tell you the meaning.

1732
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,000
- The meaning?
- And you say the idiom.

1733
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,670
But one member can skip
his or her turn.

1734
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,060
For example,

1735
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,090
the question is one crane
among a flock of chickens.

1736
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:19,040
If the first member doesn't know,
he or she can skip the turn.

1737
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,130
The other members should say
"flower", "of", "the", and "flock".

1738
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,980
(Any member can skip a turn,
but it's allowed only once.)

1739
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,250
("Flower", "of", "the",
pass, "flock")

1740
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,940
You should've told us
about this game.

1741
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,670
I wouldn't have drafted
some of them.

1742
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:31,710
That team will fail
because of those in the middle.

1743
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:33,020
These two are hopeless.

1744
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,710
- They're hopeless.
- Ji Hyo...

1745
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,460
Ji Hyo is the third player.
Would that be okay?

1746
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:38,730
We can skip her turn.

1747
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,330
There's no way we'll lose.

1748
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,560
We won't lose.

1749
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,960
There's no way we'll lose.

1750
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,330
We'll start from this side.

1751
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,690
Here's the first question.

1752
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,170
This means you say something
to please someone else...

1753
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,190
or to persuade the person
to do something.

1754
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,000
Let us answer.

1755
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,610
Sweet.

1756
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,110
(Team Yang failed.)

1757
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:58,130
- Let us answer. Sweet.
- Talk.

1758
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,540
- In.
- Pass.

1759
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,270
(What could be the last word?)

1760
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:03,210
- Pass.
- Gosh, you punks.

1761
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,750
(Gosh, you punks.)

1762
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:05,750
(Yelling)

1763
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:06,750
(We almost got it right.)

1764
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:07,810
Darn it.

1765
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,460
- Let us answer.
- Let us answer.

1766
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,460
- Sweet.
- Let us answer.

1767
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,480
- Sweet.
- Talk.

1768
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,520
- In.
- Whisper.

1769
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,650
- Okay.
- Oh, yes.

1770
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,790
(Team Yang won 1 point
thanks to Hyun Jin.)

1771
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,060
We pulled it off.

1772
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:19,920
(He's trying not to
say harsh things.)

1773
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,360
- You see...
- My gosh.

1774
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,130
- It was our plan.
- Wait.

1775
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,170
All right.

1776
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,940
- Are you serious?
- I bought him some time.

1777
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:26,940
We know how this works now.

1778
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,000
- Even Se Chan knew the answer.
- Yes, I knew it.

1779
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,210
- Now, we know. Don't worry.
- He'll skip his turn again.

1780
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,340
Kwang Hyun, did you know
the answer or not?

1781
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,670
Of course, I knew it.

1782
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,090
Here's the second question.

1783
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,110
This literally means there's no one
under the eyes.

1784
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,610
- It means an arrogant, rude...
- Let us answer.

1785
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:45,690
- Go ahead.
- This one is easy.

1786
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,060
- Captain.
- Eyes.

1787
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,460
- Darn.
- Let us answer.

1788
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,420
- Let us answer.
- Go ahead.

1789
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,630
Captain.

1790
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:53,290
Mouth.

1791
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,730
- Gosh.
- Let us answer.

1792
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,190
(Team Yoo remembered
the right answer.)

1793
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,290
- Captain.
- Snobby.

1794
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:58,810
Ego.

1795
00:57:58,810 --> 00:57:59,960
Mouth.

1796
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,000
(Wrong)

1797
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,110
No?

1798
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,880
(Frustrated)

1799
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,810
- Isn't the last word "mouth"?
- Let us answer.

1800
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:06,840
(They got another chance
thanks to Hyun Jin.)

1801
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:08,340
- Let us answer.
- Captain.

1802
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,340
- Snobby.
- Ego.

1803
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,650
- Pass.
- Mania.

1804
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,590
(Team Yang got the right answer!)

1805
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,360
(Thanks to Hyun Jin,
the score is now 0 to 2.)

1806
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,290
It's "captain snobby ego-mania".

1807
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,630
It's "mania", not "mouth".

1808
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,690
(He's so cheerful
that they can't get mad at him.)

1809
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,460
This is driving me nuts.

1810
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,630
Why...

1811
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,500
Do you have any medicine?

1812
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:26,920
Any medicine?

1813
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,000
How about you?

1814
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,460
My chest feels so stuffy.

1815
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,190
(This is so much fun.)

1816
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,810
- I thought we'd win.
- Let's keep going.

1817
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,940
- We could've got both right.
- Listen.

1818
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,380
Everyone.

1819
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,270
- We can do this.
- We can do this.

1820
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:39,880
Team Yang?

1821
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,040
- Let's just relax.
- It's okay.

1822
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,340
Here's the third question.

1823
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,790
This literally means to replace
a bone structure to change a shape.

1824
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,750
It means to become a completely
different person in a good way.

1825
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,090
I'm upset.

1826
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,690
He's upset.

1827
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,000
Let us answer.

1828
00:58:58,670 --> 00:58:59,960
- Pass.
- Make.

1829
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,000
- A.
- Fresh.

1830
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,900
- Skill.
- Okay.

1831
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,940
(Make a fresh skill?)

1832
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,610
- Okay. Let us answer.
- Isn't the last word "skill"?

1833
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:06,860
- Make.
- A.

1834
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:11,910
- Fresh.
- Start.

1835
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,290
- All right.
- We are set.

1836
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:16,560
Do you want to leave the team?

1837
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,760
- For goodness' sake.
- "Skill".

1838
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,620
- Do you want to leave the team?
- "Make a fresh skill."

1839
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,490
This is driving me crazy.

1840
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:25,200
- How could you get it wrong?
- I need medicine.

1841
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:26,600
- I need medicine.
- "Make a fresh skill."

1842
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,390
- Let me answer. Study.
- Despite.

1843
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,640
- The.
- Odds.

1844
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,040
All right!

1845
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,930
Suk Jin used the idiom
so many times.

1846
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:36,910
How did you get me for 12 dollars?

1847
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:39,140
All right. I will raise your salary
the next time.

1848
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,580
Raise my salary the next time.

1849
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,680
I should give him a lot of money.

1850
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,950
- Come on.
- All right.

1851
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,950
- All right.
- I think I am making the team lose.

1852
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,680
- That's not true.
- I should leave the team.

1853
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,060
- Thus, Team Yang won.
- We lost again.

1854
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,450
Team Yang will get 500 dollars
and Team Yoo will get 300 dollars.

1855
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,990
- Now, the last salary negotiation.
- Okay.

1856
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:58,020
Team owners, please make decisions
in your respective room.

1857
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,790
(The second salary negotiation
gives them a headache!)

1858
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:02,100
Now, the last salary negotiation.

1859
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,200
- Okay.
- All right.

1860
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,200
Hello.

1861
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,910
(So Min enters 1st.)

1862
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,180
So Min, how much
did you get earlier?

1863
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,180
- 40 dollars.
- Sit down.

1864
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,370
(There is a high chance
she will receive a salary cut.)

1865
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,410
You know,

1866
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,120
(You know...)

1867
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,850
I just would like to say...

1868
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,810
All right. Take a look first.

1869
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:21,060
- Did you write it down already?
- Yes.

1870
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,790
When did you... Gosh!

1871
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,760
Give me the same amount.

1872
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,290
Don't cut the salary.
I just ask for the same amount.

1873
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,890
Are you going to sign it or not?

1874
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:33,740
(The team owner's stern behavior...)

1875
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,290
(results in a breakdown.)

1876
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:37,100
- Are you leaving?
- You return evil for good.

1877
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,810
Okay. Leave. Leave!

1878
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:41,830
(Hesitant)

1879
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,700
I want to use an idiom,
but I don't know any.

1880
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,310
- You return evil for good.
- Leave.

1881
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,770
- You are too strict.
- Leave.

1882
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,810
- Leave!
- I won't lose!

1883
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,120
(It was her secret weapon.)

1884
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,810
If you treat me this way,

1885
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,890
- I will...
- Leave, leave.

1886
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:57,720
All right. Here I come.

1887
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,450
- I am in a good mood.
- Jong Kook.

1888
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,470
I am not greedy.

1889
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:04,830
Just give me a moderate amount,

1890
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,740
- and I will be loyal.
- I will give you 70 dollars.

1891
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,770
- What?
- 70 dollars.

1892
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:10,600
- It's more than I expected.
- Right?

1893
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,600
(My goodness!)

1894
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,040
- It's because you have done well.
- Really?

1895
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,410
You have a love for the team.

1896
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:18,410
That's good. I am satisfied.

1897
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:21,470
I am very satisfied.
It's nice. Okay.

1898
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,120
I pay handsomely
to those who deserve it.

1899
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,120
How nice is that?

1900
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,160
My goodness.

1901
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,290
That went smoothly.

1902
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,890
- You can go now.
- Okay.

1903
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,850
- Do I take it?
- You take it.

1904
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:34,100
I will take it as proof.

1905
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,160
That wasn't half bad.

1906
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:38,770
There is no reason
to raise this person's salary.

1907
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,870
(He writes down a low salary
and waits.)

1908
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:47,770
All right. Come on in.

1909
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,740
(The long-haired pitcher,
Lee Kwang Soo)

1910
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,580
I will be blunt with you.

1911
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,720
This is my last chance.

1912
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,410
I am at the bottom of the ranking.

1913
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:59,810
If I don't get a higher salary
than Jong Kook, I am over.

1914
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,490
This is the most I can offer.
Take a look.

1915
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,060
(20 dollars?)

1916
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,390
20 dollars?

1917
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:11,370
(He is a player who never gets
the salary he wants.)

1918
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:12,600
- Leave.
- Is that the best you can do?

1919
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,270
Get lost. Get lost.

1920
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:15,390
- 20 dollars?
- Is that the best you can do?

1921
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,310
You don't even deserve
a salary of 20 dollars.

1922
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,510
- Okay.
- Leave! Leave!

1923
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:21,100
Okay. I got it.

1924
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,910
- Hello.
- My goodness.

1925
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:24,950
(He bows in 90 degrees.)

1926
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,270
(Hyun Jin became modest
after the four-word idioms.)

1927
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:30,680
- You became very modest.
- Gosh.

1928
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,910
- You are working hard.
- You became very modest.

1929
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:36,930
The salary negotiation
didn't go well the last time.

1930
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:38,890
You became friendlier.

1931
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,660
I had many struggles.

1932
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,390
- All right.
- Welcome.

1933
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:45,490
You remember how well I did
in the last season, right?

1934
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:47,040
- Yes.
- All right.

1935
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,910
- I am ready to sign the contract.
- What's your name?

1936
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:51,200
Suk Jin.

1937
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,740
What are you doing?

1938
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,640
"Stay healthy."

1939
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,270
- Here.
- What are you doing?

1940
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,120
You can go on your way.

1941
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,080
Take my autograph.

1942
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,120
You can join another team.

1943
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,580
The salary negotiation is over.

1944
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,680
(The salary negotiation ends
before he gets to say anything.)

1945
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:07,790
You use me and discard me.

1946
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:08,950
Don't say it like that.

1947
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,120
Let's go with 170 dollars.

1948
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,160
Gosh. Be more generous.

1949
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,450
I will show you what I can do.

1950
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,790
Okay. It's my duty as a team owner
to keep the players satisfied.

1951
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,770
180 dollars.
Okay. Let's sign the contract.

1952
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,060
All right.

1953
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,910
Let's sign the contract.

1954
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,040
(Jae Suk used a big amount of money
to lift up a player's spirits.)

1955
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,010
- We need to win this time.
- Of course.

1956
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,600
Okay. Take the contract with you.

1957
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,950
(Kwang Soo barges into the room!)

1958
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:34,620
(The long-haired pitcher
was watching in secret.)

1959
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:35,950
(The friendly atmosphere
made him lose his senses.)

1960
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:39,120
How could you give this much
to Hyun Jin...

1961
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,060
when you offered 20 dollars to me?

1962
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,310
(You offered 20 dollars to me.)

1963
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,830
- I mean...
- I will work hard.

1964
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,220
Okay. Okay.

1965
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:48,330
I got Kwang Soo for the price
of five hot dogs.

1966
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:51,770
How is it possible
that I only collected 35 dollars?

1967
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:52,770
(The result
of the 2nd salary negotiation)

1968
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:55,270
(The last mission)

1969
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:56,540
My goodness.

1970
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,970
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1971
01:03:58,410 --> 01:03:59,810
What is this place?

1972
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,410
- What will we do?
- It's a baseball park.

1973
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:04,510
- What is this place?
- Please stand with your teammates.

1974
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:05,510
(What will be the last match?)

1975
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:09,120
This is the last mission
of Stove League.

1976
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,040
We will test the team owners'
skills and strategies...

1977
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,950
with the Rich and Poor Play Ball.

1978
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,020
- Rich and Poor.
- Rich and Poor.

1979
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:18,720
From a regular baseball match,
only the scoring system is tweaked.

1980
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,430
After the batter hits the ball,

1981
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:23,720
he or she can pick up half cones
while advancing.

1982
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,520
When the batter returns
to the home plate,

1983
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,100
the number of half cones
will decide the score.

1984
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,470
- Really?
- Do we need to pick them up?

1985
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:31,040
- Let's pick up one.
- Yellow ones are one point.

1986
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,470
Green ones are 3 points,
red ones are 5 points,

1987
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,510
- and the blue ones are 10 points.
- Where are the blue ones?

1988
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,200
They are right behind the pitcher.

1989
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,510
Are the red ones three points?

1990
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,310
Here it is.

1991
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,790
We will play three innings.

1992
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,520
All players...

1993
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,660
will start off with poor equipment.

1994
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,330
The team owners can use
the team money...

1995
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:54,520
to upgrade the equipment
for the players of their choice.

1996
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:57,020
It's nice to be a team owner.

1997
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,270
Oh, you purchase the equipment.
You should use the money.

1998
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:02,810
You can purchase the equipment
at any time.

1999
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:06,370
The umpire who will help us today
is Song Ho Yeon.

2000
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,810
The pitcher is in 11th grade...

2001
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:11,310
of Hyun Jin's high school,
Dongsan High School.

2002
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:13,370
- Hello.
- Welcome.

2003
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:15,410
- Dongsan High School.
- Thank you.

2004
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:17,850
You can pick the equipment
of your choice.

2005
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:18,850
(They move to the team's dugout
before the game begins!)

2006
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,660
- What should I choose?
- What are these?

2007
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,410
These are bad equipment.

2008
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,850
- How about this?
- What is this?

2009
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,520
- How about this?
- These are the basic equipment.

2010
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,700
It will be easy to use.

2011
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:27,760
What are these?

2012
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,290
- Acupressure shoes.
- Acupressure shoes?

2013
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:31,600
Let's buy shoes.

2014
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,160
- Okay.
- We will buy shoes.

2015
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,790
Let's buy shoes for the key players.

2016
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,910
- Me and...
- Hey.

2017
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,830
- Hey! I might be a key player.
- I don't have money.

2018
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:41,200
I don't have money.

2019
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,010
- Three players.
- Hey!

2020
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,700
- Hold on.
- I don't have money.

2021
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,180
The team isn't well-off.

2022
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,540
- Okay.
- See how they are.

2023
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:50,120
- They don't fit.
- They fit.

2024
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,810
- They don't fit!
- What do you want me to do?

2025
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:54,890
Just wear the swimming fins.

2026
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,490
(Kwang Soo gains swimming fins...)

2027
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,950
(after the team owner
invests 10 dollars.)

2028
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,990
- All right.
- This makes no sense.

2029
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,490
- Just the basics.
- Kwang Soo, that's good.

2030
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,370
How are we supposed
to play baseball this way?

2031
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,640
That's good.

2032
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,560
I will buy the toy bat.

2033
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:10,910
It's 10 dollars.

2034
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:12,810
There is no need to use 10 dollars.

2035
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,540
Save up on the money.

2036
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,410
I think I can hit a tennis ball
with this.

2037
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:18,180
- I will use this.
- The toy bat.

2038
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,310
Do you want one?

2039
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:21,220
These shoes will make me healthy.

2040
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,580
That's...

2041
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,390
- Let's buy shoes.
- Jae Suk.

2042
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,680
- I can't walk in them.
- Me neither.

2043
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,910
Let's buy the 20-dollar shoes.

2044
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:29,080
- That's right. Buy me shoes.
- My goodness.

2045
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:30,660
This is the basic glove.

2046
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,620
- A boxing glove.
- Do we wear it at first?

2047
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,930
This is insane.

2048
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,490
- Do we wear it on one hand?
- That won't do.

2049
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:38,370
How much is the glove?
Let's buy a new one.

2050
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,370
Start with the basic items.

2051
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,270
Can't you buy a glove
for a major leaguer?

2052
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:43,700
Seriously.

2053
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,470
- We can use this one.
- Hyun Jin...

2054
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,370
Let's play ball.

2055
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,810
Hyun Jin can throw the ball.

2056
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:51,540
One toy bat.

2057
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,720
So Min is the first batter.

2058
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,810
I will show everyone.

2059
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,580
- It's important to start well.
- Let's go.

2060
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,520
Make sure you reach the first base.

2061
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,220
So Min, let's go!

2062
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:04,260
- Let's go!
- All right!

2063
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,520
Come forward.

2064
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:09,930
(Hyun Jin will take her on
from the start.)

2065
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:15,100
(The unexpected match,
Hyun Jin versus So MIn)

2066
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,240
Play.

2067
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:22,640
(Will So Min be able
to hit the ball?)

2068
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,740
(She misses big time.)

2069
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,680
(She swung the bat
to hit Hyun Jin's ball.)

2070
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,910
Hyun Jin, go easy on her.

2071
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:33,790
It's her first time
to play baseball.

2072
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,390
(The 1st batter has
no batting eye whatsoever.)

2073
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:36,580
Don't throw so fast.

2074
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,180
(Two strikes)

2075
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,350
- I can't do it!
- Hyun Jin, you threw too hard.

2076
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,560
- What is this?
- I touched the ball.

2077
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,790
Okay.

2078
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:45,790
- Two strikes.
- I touched the ball.

2079
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:46,930
So Min.

2080
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:48,970
Okay.

2081
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:50,040
- Foul.
- Time out!

2082
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,310
Hit by pitch!

2083
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,810
She swung the bat!

2084
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:53,910
(A dead ball)

2085
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,640
What do you mean?
She swung the bat!

2086
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:56,680
What?

2087
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,520
(So Min succeeded to get on base.)

2088
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,080
You did it!

2089
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,790
Did the ball hit her?

2090
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:04,310
She swung the bat!

2091
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,060
No, no. You need to be polite.

2092
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,060
- It will be bad if you get ejected.
- You might get ejected.

2093
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,290
It will be bad if you get ejected.

2094
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:11,620
Are they related?

2095
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,330
The second hitter,

2096
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,020
- Lee Kwang Soo.
- Send the ball far.

2097
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,330
- Okay.
- Pick up any half cones.

2098
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,430
Send the ball far.

2099
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,490
Kwang Soo, send the ball far.

2100
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,330
Time out.

2101
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:22,970
You can't step on the line.

2102
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,140
Step back. Step back.

2103
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,370
But the swimming fins...

2104
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:27,440
You can't step on the line.

2105
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:29,310
- The swimming fins touch the line.
- Step back.

2106
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:30,650
Fold your toes.

2107
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:32,040
Kwang Soo.

2108
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,180
Position your feet differently.

2109
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,180
But to hit the ball...

2110
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,040
- No. You can't step on the line.
- Kwang Soo.

2111
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,440
- Turn them outward.
- Turn them outward.

2112
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,690
My toes aren't touching the line.

2113
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:40,080
That won't do.
You can't step on the line.

2114
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:43,980
- Okay.
- There you go.

2115
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:47,730
- Play.
- Hold on.

2116
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,150
How am I supposed to hit the ball?

2117
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:51,230
I need different shoes!

2118
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:52,790
(Se Chan has no intention
to make more investment.)

2119
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,900
(Kwang Soo finally gets
in position.)

2120
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,470
Okay.

2121
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:01,440
(He misses the ball!)

2122
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,700
Okay. That's good.

2123
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,900
- He can't reach the outside.
- He can't reach the outside.

2124
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,020
He can't reach the outside.

2125
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:07,150
(Hyun Jin found his weakness.)

2126
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:08,180
He can't reach the outside.

2127
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,820
(He sends the ball outward again.)

2128
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,110
- Strike.
- Come on.

2129
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:15,690
- I mean...
- Kwang Soo!

2130
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:17,260
I can't even hit it straight!

2131
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,260
Hold on, hold on.

2132
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,430
Two strikes.

2133
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:22,970
Wait.

2134
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:24,320
Run, run!

2135
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:27,030
- Did he hit it?
- Run, run!

2136
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,530
Run, run! You need to run!

2137
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:30,660
(Kwang Soo gets tagged.)

2138
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:31,900
- You need to run!
- Out!

2139
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:33,370
Run! Suk Jin!

2140
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,730
(At the 2nd base,
So Min gets eliminated.)

2141
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:35,900
- Out!
- Out!

2142
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,110
Good job.

2143
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:38,200
What are we doing?

2144
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:40,910
- So Min, don't you know the rules?
- You didn't tell me to run.

2145
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,070
(The clueless 1st batter
and the slow 2nd batter)

2146
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:44,240
- You need to get the half cones.
- The ball went over.

2147
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,560
- Hey, buy me shoes!
- For goodness' sake.

2148
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:48,360
Wait.

2149
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,280
(At that moment)

2150
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,760
I can't believe I will see this.

2151
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,930
Hyun Jin will pitch
and Kwang Hyun will hit.

2152
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,690
- Let's do this.
- The next batter...

2153
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:56,790
You need to get on the base.

2154
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:00,490
If you are out, we are done.
We have no hope.

2155
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:03,140
(It's the best friend's first time
to go against each other.)

2156
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:08,200
(How will Hyun Jin pitch
against Kwang Hyun?)

2157
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,810
I feel like I am watching TV.

2158
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,650
They are going against each other.

2159
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:15,180
(Pitcher Ryu Hyun Jin
versus Batter Kwang Hyun)

2160
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,940
Kwang Hyun, hit the ball.

2161
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,190
Kwang Hyun, let's go!

2162
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:19,280
(They are desperate
for Kwang Hyun's hit.)

2163
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:22,650
(It's a face-off
that won't happen again.)

2164
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,260
Won't the scratcher break?

2165
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:26,650
See?

2166
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,100
- See?
- Kwang Hyun!

2167
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:30,900
- Kwang Hyun!
- Buy him a bat!

2168
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,030
(Kwang Hyun?)

2169
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:34,030
- Kwang Hyun!
- Buy him a bat!

2170
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,030
I can't hit with this.

2171
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,900
- Buy him a bat.
- You can buy it now.

2172
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,570
- Buy him a bat.
- Kwang Hyun said he will try it.

2173
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,480
Let's buy a frying pan.

2174
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,200
(Hyun Jin succeeded
to seize control of the situation.)

2175
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,280
Good job.

2176
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,240
(The 2nd pitch)

2177
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,570
Run!

2178
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:49,740
(He hits the ball
with the back scratcher.)

2179
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,650
- He did it.
- He hit the ball.

2180
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,390
- Okay!
- Hey!

2181
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,110
(But the ball goes straight
to the pitcher.)

2182
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:57,150
(and he is out at 1st base.)

2183
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,620
- Out!
- Good job.

2184
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:01,230
He is like an iron wall.

2185
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:02,970
Out.

2186
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,660
- Come on.
- Maybe next time.

2187
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,070
You can do it the next time.

2188
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:08,160
- Hurry up.
- Hey.

2189
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,010
- These shoes hurt.
- Hurry up.

2190
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:11,400
- This one.
- Let's buy it.

2191
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,870
(It's Team Yu's turn to attack.)

2192
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,200
Let's buy a bat.

2193
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,700
- This one.
- Let's buy it.

2194
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:16,940
Firstly,

2195
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,850
let's get a 20-dollar bat
for everyone.

2196
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,410
- Okay.
- Okay.

2197
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,610
Why is there a story-telling glove?

2198
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:25,320
- Hey.
- Can you catch a ball with it?

2199
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,450
What is up
with the story-telling glove?

2200
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:29,980
Everyone will wear
the story-telling glove.

2201
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,150
(Se Chan likes
the story-telling glove.)

2202
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:32,860
- The story-telling glove.
- Why should we wear it?

2203
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:34,900
Why should we wear them?

2204
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,660
This is ridiculous.
We can't catch a ball like this.

2205
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,430
Let's take out one.

2206
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:39,770
This is the basic glove.

2207
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,660
Wear the basic glove.

2208
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,610
Why does it have to be me?

2209
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,270
You already have the swimming fins.

2210
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,400
- Hello.
- So Min should take it.

2211
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,830
- Hello, we are animal friends.
- I can't do anything like this.

2212
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:50,150
- It hurts.
- This is...

2213
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:51,570
(Everyone except for Kwang Soo
gets a story-telling glove.)

2214
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:56,150
(After making preparations,
Team Yoo attacks.)

2215
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:57,890
- I am in your care.
- Is Ji Hyo the first batter?

2216
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,610
Here I go.

2217
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:01,060
- Move to the front.
- Okay, okay.

2218
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,390
You can do it, Ji Hyo.

2219
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:03,430
- I can do it.
- You can hit it.

2220
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:07,290
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

2221
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:10,820
(Kwang Hyun will take her on
with a story-telling glove.)

2222
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:14,860
(Will Ji Hyo succeed
to get on the base?)

2223
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,330
Okay, okay! Go! Run!

2224
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,310
(She hit Kwang Hyun's curveball.)

2225
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,310
- Run!
- Run!

2226
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,010
- Run!
- Throw it! Catch it!

2227
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,070
- Out.
- Out.

2228
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,850
- Gosh, it hurts.
- Nice.

2229
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,410
- This is no joke!
- It was a nice hit.

2230
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:34,260
(The acupressure shoes
brought health and elimination.)

2231
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,890
(The bad equipment
is the problem.)

2232
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,860
Ji Hyo would have made it
if it weren't for the shoes.

2233
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,260
Nice pitching!

2234
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,290
- The second batter, Ryu Hyun Jin.
- Here is what I think.

2235
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:46,660
- That's the weak spot.
- That's right.

2236
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,530
(Hyun Jin aims for the one
in the swimming fins.)

2237
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:51,230
That's the weak spot.

2238
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,110
Let's catch him.

2239
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,730
(Who will win in the second match?)

2240
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:56,940
It will go that way. Be careful.

2241
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,570
- Okay!
- Catch it!

2242
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,320
- Okay!
- Kwang Soo! First base!

2243
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,240
- Okay!
- Kwang Soo! First base!

2244
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,760
- Okay!
- Pick up the half cones.

2245
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,650
- Go to the second base.
- Hey!

2246
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:10,820
- Second base.
- Hey!

2247
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:12,690
Catch it.

2248
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:15,260
- Third base.
- Hyun Jin, get the half cones.

2249
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,430
Throw it.

2250
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:19,490
(He bodyslams the base
without any half cones.)

2251
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,070
Catch it!

2252
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:22,830
Throw it!

2253
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,730
Move, you jerk!

2254
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,230
Hey.

2255
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:28,110
- You need to get the half cones!
- He can do it on his way back.

2256
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,870
- I will stay here.
- Okay.

2257
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,040
- Why didn't you get them?
- You need to get the half cones!

2258
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,540
- He missed them.
- You went all the way there.

2259
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:37,910
Listen to the coach!

2260
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:38,980
(Jong Kook ends up teaching baseball
to Hyun Jin.)

2261
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,650
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

2262
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:43,080
These are terrible shoes
for an important moment.

2263
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,730
- Get him out.
- The third batter,

2264
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,150
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Let's go for a double play.

2265
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,260
(Meanwhile)

2266
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,450
Hyun Jin! A stolen base!

2267
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:50,860
Okay. A stolen base.

2268
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:51,990
Good job.

2269
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:53,990
Kwang Hyun.

2270
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:55,140
(They must go for a strikeout
with Suk Jin.)

2271
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,270
Kwang Hyun.

2272
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:59,640
(It's a hit to the left-center gap.)

2273
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:01,440
Come on! Run!

2274
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,980
Suk Jin, what are you doing?

2275
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:09,240
(Limping)

2276
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,350
(Suk Jin is out.)

2277
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,820
For goodness' sake!

2278
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,190
- Hey!
- Why did the atmosphere turn loose?

2279
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:15,320
Why are you so slow?

2280
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,080
Buy me shoes!

2281
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:18,860
Why are you so slow?

2282
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,900
(The oldest member has been asking
for shoes for 20 minutes.)

2283
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,030
The entire stadium
suddenly turned quiet.

2284
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:25,820
- I am in pain.
- He can't run.

2285
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:27,830
- It's funny to see him walk.
- Check the back.

2286
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:28,860
(The oldest player's hit ends
without gains.)

2287
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,610
- Jong Kook!
- Okay.

2288
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:32,140
- You must hit the ball well.
- Okay.

2289
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:34,780
- Kwang Hyun, go for a strikeout.
- Okay.

2290
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,040
Time out. Time out.

2291
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:40,850
We will change the bat.

2292
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:42,870
(Hyun Jin is close
to scoring points.)

2293
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:43,940
Right now?

2294
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,980
- Really?
- Send the ball in the air.

2295
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,650
- Let's go.
- Send the ball in the air.

2296
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,260
- Let's go.
- This is the strategy.

2297
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,430
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

2298
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:52,030
This is bad. This is bad.

2299
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,100
(It will be easy to hit
with a frying pan.)

2300
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,190
Let's move back.

2301
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:58,230
(Will Jae Suk's big investment
pay off?)

2302
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:01,160
A foul ball.

2303
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,310
(He hit it, but...)

2304
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:04,530
A foul ball.

2305
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,970
- My goodness.
- Kwang Hyun!

2306
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:07,230
Go for a strikeout!

2307
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:09,030
Let's get him. Just one more.

2308
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:10,110
(Kwang Hyun increased the speed
since he was nervous.)

2309
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,440
My goodness.

2310
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,480
Thank goodness I hit it.

2311
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,540
We need to do this.
Show them that you can throw.

2312
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,410
- Hit it.
- Kwang Hyun, we need a strike.

2313
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,080
- There you go.
- He hit it!

2314
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,320
Second base!

2315
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,320
(The man in the swimming fins
already made 3 mistakes.)

2316
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,900
(While Kwang Soo struggles,
Jong Kook runs to the 1st base.)

2317
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,820
- Okay!
- Okay.

2318
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,440
(Hyun Jin succeeded
to reach the home base.)

2319
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,870
It's a success!

2320
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:41,400
You should have caught it.

2321
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,680
I couldn't catch it!

2322
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,870
You could have caught it.

2323
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,980
Nice!

2324
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,820
The frying pan did its job.

2325
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:50,320
(Team Yoo scores 3 points.)

2326
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,740
- You are the best.
- Good job.

2327
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,320
The frying pan was the best.

2328
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,760
It would have been cool
to catch the ball.

2329
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,020
I know. It's a shame.

2330
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:59,390
- Jae Suk is good.
- Really?

2331
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:00,730
Kwang Soo, move back.

2332
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:05,360
(It's time to see Kwang Hyun's
crisis management skills.)

2333
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:08,830
- Catch it!
- Catch it!

2334
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,030
- Catch it!
- Catch it!

2335
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,700
There you go.

2336
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:15,700
(The animals
of the story-telling glove helped.)

2337
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:16,940
Okay. Nice defense!

2338
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,280
This broke.

2339
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,540
My hands hurt.

2340
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:20,720
- My hands hurt so much.
- Good work.

2341
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,820
This glove is the worst.

2342
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,190
That's too bad.

2343
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:24,610
- Go.
- You need to hit hard.

2344
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,910
- Seriously.
- How do you hit it?

2345
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:29,360
Here comes the man
who can't reach the outside.

2346
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,450
Hold on.

2347
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:31,620
How far can I go?

2348
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,490
- Hey.
- How far can I go?

2349
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:36,190
He is the man
who can't reach the outside.

2350
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:38,160
Even if I stretch out my arm,
I can only reach up to here.

2351
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:40,660
- I feel bad for him.
- You can do it.

2352
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,860
(Kwang Soo is growing strong due
to the team owner's indifference.)

2353
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,870
Run!

2354
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,400
(He hit the ball!)

2355
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:49,730
Hey, you got him.

2356
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:51,740
For goodness' sake!

2357
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,320
(After taking a few steps,
his anger explodes.)

2358
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,480
Hey.

2359
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,110
(A discord occurs
in just 2 innings.)

2360
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,190
- What?
- You should buy me...

2361
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,430
a bat or shoes!

2362
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,860
- I will buy you shoes.
- Three outs.

2363
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,860
I will buy you shoes.

2364
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:07,860
(Se Chan promises to buy him shoes.)

2365
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:08,930
I feel bad for him.

2366
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:10,230
- I am sorry.
- I feel bad for him.

2367
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:12,030
Se Chan, do you want straw shoes?

2368
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:13,290
- Buy him straw shoes.
- Okay.

2369
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:15,530
A pitcher change.

2370
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:16,610
I'll pitch some balls,

2371
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:18,400
and Hyun Jin must come in
when there's an emergency.

2372
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,310
I think we should get
a frying pan for now.

2373
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,980
Who is next? Is it me?

2374
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,700
- I'll get a frying pan.
- Let's get five frying pans.

2375
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,310
- Let's get 3 for now.
- Let's get 4.

2376
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:26,350
Let's get three.

2377
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:28,440
- Why?
- What is wrong with him?

2378
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,520
If you're out, we won't have
any chances left.

2379
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,450
Throw hard, Jae Suk.

2380
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:34,520
Play.

2381
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,760
- Strike.
- Yes.

2382
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:43,860
(The strike zone is slightly large.
He hit strike to the outer course.)

2383
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,470
How is this a strike
when the ball fell out over here?

2384
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,660
- How is this a strike?
- It's a strike.

2385
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:48,690
- Okay.
- Good.

2386
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:49,900
- I know what it feels like now.
- You're good.

2387
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,310
The ball fell out over here.

2388
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,570
You should follow the ball
and hit it.

2389
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,610
(The long hit
cut through the crowd.)

2390
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,040
- It's a hit.
- Okay, Mr. Yang.

2391
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:05,980
- It's a hit.
- Okay, Mr. Yang.

2392
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,450
- Hurry up. Run.
- Good job.

2393
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,930
- Okay.
- Okay.

2394
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:12,820
- Gosh.
- This is unbelievable.

2395
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,760
(They must send Se Chan
to home base no matter what.)

2396
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,320
We're in trouble.

2397
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,690
(Kim Kwang Hyun is at bat.)

2398
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,330
- Hit a home run.
- Let's go, Kwang Hyun.

2399
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:23,330
(Can Yoo Jae Suk
overcome this crisis?)

2400
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:27,400
He threw a breaking ball.

2401
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:28,730
Did he throw a breaking ball?

2402
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:30,310
- He threw it like this.
- He suddenly threw it.

2403
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:31,980
- Really?
- That's surprising.

2404
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,850
Jae Suk is good at baseball.

2405
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:34,910
(He continues to throw
the 2nd ball.)

2406
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:38,890
- That's good.
- That's it.

2407
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,890
- That's good.
- That's it.

2408
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,390
- Safe.
- Safe.

2409
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,690
(Se Chan touched 2nd base.)

2410
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:48,190
(Ryu Hyun Jin fell down.)

2411
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:49,450
- Safe.
- Hey.

2412
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,120
- You're out.
- Oh, my.

2413
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,360
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

2414
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,970
Hey, do you know how much you cost?

2415
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,290
- Hey.
- Don't do that.

2416
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:58,110
- Don't try to do a slide.
- Hyun Jin.

2417
01:18:58,110 --> 01:18:59,860
- Are you crazy?
- What is wrong with him?

2418
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,110
- Wait a minute.
- That's right.

2419
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:03,680
They crashed into each other,
but everyone ran to Hyun Jin.

2420
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,240
- I even scraped my arm.
- Are you okay?

2421
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:06,400
He's okay.

2422
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,220
Let's take a look at the video
for a moment.

2423
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,680
- Okay.
- Let's take a look at the video.

2424
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,910
- He touched it before the whistle.
- Okay.

2425
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:12,020
- Okay, before the whistle.
- Okay.

2426
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,390
(Se Chan who got 12 points
succeeded at landing on 2nd base.)

2427
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:15,080
Kwang Soo, I'll buy a frying pan.

2428
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,110
Okay.

2429
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:17,650
Kwang Soo.

2430
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,360
- You must get it in this time.
- Okay.

2431
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:20,620
You must get it in this time
unconditionally.

2432
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:23,260
- It has to go in.
- That's right.

2433
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,600
He's like Ma Dong Tak.

2434
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:31,660
- Grab it.
- Suk Jin.

2435
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,770
(It's a neat heavy hit.)

2436
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:34,370
Suk Jin, gosh.

2437
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,850
Grab it.

2438
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,350
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo succeeded
at picking up a 5 point cone.)

2439
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,370
- Safe.
- Gosh.

2440
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,350
(Kwang Soo is safe by a close call.)

2441
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:44,980
- Okay.
- Grab it.

2442
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,520
(Meanwhile, Kwang Hyun and Se Chan
were the lead runners.)

2443
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,390
- Grab it.
- Just get in for now.

2444
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:49,610
Just get in for now.

2445
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:51,060
Get in quickly.

2446
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:52,530
- Safe.
- Safe.

2447
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:54,490
Okay.

2448
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:55,560
Nice.

2449
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,290
(Kwang Soo got 23 points
with only 1 hit.)

2450
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,770
- Nice.
- Nice.

2451
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:01,030
- Lee Kwang Soo.
- What's the score?

2452
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:02,140
Kwang Soo, nice.

2453
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,160
- What's the score?
- He got a lot of points.

2454
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,700
I think he got about 30.

2455
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,230
Kwang Soo, get ready to run.

2456
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:09,140
Okay.

2457
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,240
(Kwang Soo's aiming for extra points
with teasing base running.)

2458
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,310
We need to get Kwang Soo
no matter what so he doesn't go in.

2459
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,070
Jae Suk.

2460
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:18,580
- Gosh.
- Strike.

2461
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:20,450
Jae Suk, you should start
looking over here.

2462
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:23,190
(Jae Suk's really bothered by
the 1st base runner Kwang Soo.)

2463
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:24,390
(He does a motion
to keep Kwang Soo in check.)

2464
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:30,320
What is he doing?

2465
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,190
What is this?

2466
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:33,860
I think you will get hit
in between there.

2467
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,330
- This is...
- It means you shouldn't throw.

2468
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,530
It's not time to throw yet.

2469
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,010
- Oh, my.
- Hey.

2470
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,180
- Grab it.
- He's really good.

2471
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,400
- Grab it.
- Good job.

2472
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,410
Go to third base.

2473
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,180
- Hurry up.
- That's right.

2474
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:50,940
Kwang Hyun, it's your turn.

2475
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,690
Good, frying pans are good.

2476
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:54,390
- I need to change my shoes.
- We need to get going.

2477
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,690
- Hyun Jin must throw this time.
- We need to get going.

2478
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:56,820
Pitcher change.

2479
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,690
I'm in trouble.
I can't help it anymore.

2480
01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:00,290
Hyun Jin, you should throw
instead of me.

2481
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,290
(Kim Kwang Hyun versus Ryu Hyun Jin,
The 3rd match)

2482
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,950
- I need to hit it this time.
- It's a head-on match.

2483
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:03,990
Good.

2484
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,570
I need to hit it this time.

2485
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:06,660
Hey, Hyun Jin.

2486
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,690
(Straw Shoe Kwang Soo
doesn't miss a chance.)

2487
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:10,360
- Gosh.
- He's really good.

2488
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:13,030
He's the best at stealing
in the world.

2489
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:15,610
- He's the best. He's number 1.
- He's number 1 at stealing.

2490
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:22,070
(The ball speed suddenly
became faster.)

2491
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,980
(Gosh...)

2492
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,040
- Nice.
- Good job.

2493
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,110
Good.

2494
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:28,410
We can't give them any more points.

2495
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:29,650
We can't give them points now.

2496
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:32,360
We can't. Hyun Jin,
you must stop him.

2497
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:35,100
- Okay.
- Good.

2498
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,230
Gosh...

2499
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:39,270
- Okay.
- Good.

2500
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,490
(Gosh...)

2501
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,660
(A little league player
suddenly rushes onto the mound.)

2502
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:44,610
You punk...

2503
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:45,640
What are you doing?

2504
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,610
(The bench-clearing expert is
running toward them like a bull.)

2505
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:49,400
- Who won?
- What are you doing?

2506
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,610
(The franchise star exploded like
he was waiting for this moment.)

2507
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:53,200
- I wondered why you weren't coming.
- Go away.

2508
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,110
- Who won?
- What are you doing?

2509
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,390
(Falling down)

2510
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,110
(He approached them to stop them,)

2511
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:01,520
(but he fell down.)

2512
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:04,360
(Unexpected physical contact)

2513
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,060
(The umpire finally got back
to his senses,)

2514
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,060
(and left to stop
the franchise star.)

2515
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,290
- Where?
- You punk.

2516
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:14,330
(They're even venting their personal
feelings unrelated to baseball.)

2517
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:17,700
It's mine. Oh, my.

2518
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,810
(The two groups are playing baseball
to do bench-clearings.)

2519
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,530
- How dare you...
- Okay.

2520
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,280
- I left it.
- Are the bases loaded?

2521
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,680
- Yes, the bases are loaded.
- Bases are loaded.

2522
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,310
- Gosh, the frying pan...
- Play.

2523
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,370
- Why did you fight?
- Let's go.

2524
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:28,820
We just have to get one more.

2525
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:30,940
(Hyun Jin's goal is to strike Haha
out in this desperate situation.)

2526
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:32,820
What are you doing?

2527
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:33,860
He's crazy.

2528
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,060
(Lee Kwang Soo, Has supernatural
powers, The man who rules bases)

2529
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,150
You!

2530
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:40,230
- This is an out.
- Gosh.

2531
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:41,490
- He took the base away with him.
- Safe.

2532
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:43,150
Safe.

2533
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:46,660
Gosh, I can't help it
if this happened then.

2534
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:50,330
Okay.

2535
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:52,610
- Nice.
- Nice.

2536
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,140
Haha, keep your eyes
on the ball to the end.

2537
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,280
- Okay.
- Strike.

2538
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,370
(He succeeded at focusing on
throwing the ball higher.)

2539
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

2540
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,070
What is that?

2541
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:02,910
I ended it with three balls.
I had no other choice.

2542
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:04,080
- He's incredible.
- Yes.

2543
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,520
They got a lot of points, right?

2544
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,410
- What is he doing?
- Gosh.

2545
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:08,450
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

2546
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:09,450
(The end of the second inning,
Yang 23 to Yoo 0)

2547
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:11,890
- I'll also get a frying pan.
- Okay.

2548
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,150
Everyone got a frying pan.

2549
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:16,100
- Do they all have frying pans?
- Yes.

2550
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:18,160
(The victory group pitcher is
Kwang Soo.)

2551
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:21,230
Kwang Soo, who are you nodding to?

2552
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:22,490
(He's staring into the air while
sending a secret code to somewhere.)

2553
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:24,030
Who are you talking to?

2554
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:26,330
Throw it quickly.

2555
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,310
Nice.

2556
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:30,850
(Perfect strike)

2557
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:33,400
Kwang Soo's good at pitching.

2558
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,980
- He's like Kershaw.
- Kwang Soo's ball is too fast.

2559
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,610
- That's so unfair.
- How could you throw a fastball...

2560
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:38,690
to Ji Hyo?

2561
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:41,910
She swung.

2562
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:42,910
(He threw it even faster.)

2563
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:43,980
She swung.

2564
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,120
- Safe.
- That's right.

2565
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,950
(He doesn't care about Ji Hyo. He's
busy showing off his ball speed.)

2566
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:49,900
(Gosh, he's so annoying.)

2567
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,030
Gosh, he threw
a fastball to Ji Hyo.

2568
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,900
That's right, make her frying pan
feel useless.

2569
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:55,970
Make her swing.

2570
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,530
- Nice.
- Nice.

2571
01:23:58,770 --> 01:23:59,770
- Am I out?
- Nice.

2572
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:02,440
- He's just a bully. If that's so...
- Am I out?

2573
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:05,010
He's a bully.

2574
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,350
Make him swing.
Kwang Soo, that's right.

2575
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:08,980
Kim Jong Kook.

2576
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:12,110
Look, he's going to hit it
no matter what.

2577
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:13,440
He's showing us
all of his directions.

2578
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,780
It means that he will throw
toward the inner side.

2579
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:17,230
- Will he throw it to that side?
- Gosh.

2580
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:18,320
Wait a minute.

2581
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,450
(He does a mysterious hand signal
and throws the ball.)

2582
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:21,950
- Gosh.
- Strike.

2583
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:23,150
- What?
- What?

2584
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,530
(Is the ball that flew above
Jong Kook's head a strike?)

2585
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:26,660
Okay.

2586
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:29,330
(Everyone is surprised because they
never saw this strike zone before.)

2587
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:31,200
- Was that a strike?
- Kwang Soo,

2588
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,160
- say thank you.
- Okay.

2589
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:34,400
That's right.

2590
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,610
(Bowing)

2591
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,150
- Gosh.
- Was that a strike?

2592
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:39,310
(Team Yu's franchise started
to get excited.)

2593
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,480
(What?)

2594
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,020
Why?

2595
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,320
Why are you upset?

2596
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,950
Gosh, wait a minute.

2597
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:49,950
(The second physical fight
broke out.)

2598
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:52,690
(This affectionate player is
merciless to dirty players.)

2599
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:53,950
Come back for now, Jong Kook.

2600
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:56,230
- But this is...
- How could you do this to a human?

2601
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:57,770
This is a little...

2602
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:59,360
- unfair.
- This is really unfair.

2603
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,790
He deserved to get hit.

2604
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:02,100
"He deserved to get hit"?

2605
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:03,970
Okay.

2606
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:05,570
It's interesting though.

2607
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:07,010
Let's win this thing.

2608
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:09,230
Kwang Hyun came again.

2609
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,310
We need to win at least once,
Jae Suk.

2610
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,240
- Okay.
- We need to win at least once.

2611
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,520
Gosh.

2612
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,610
Okay.

2613
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:17,820
I'm sorry.

2614
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:19,540
Kim Kwang Hyun!

2615
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,150
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

2616
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,220
- Seriously, that's unfair.
- I'm sorry.

2617
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:25,260
- I thought it was the major league.
- Okay.

2618
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,900
Are you a bully?

2619
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:29,260
We need to strike him out.

2620
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,290
Make a short backswing,
and head to the bottom.

2621
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,190
- Okay.
- That's it.

2622
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:34,330
(He hit it.)

2623
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,030
- End it.
- Stop.

2624
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,030
- End it.
- No.

2625
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:39,400
- It's not over?
- Just push through.

2626
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,810
- They attacked from there.
- To the end?

2627
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:41,900
Okay.

2628
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,180
(Next at bat: So Min,
Haha, and Kwang Soo)

2629
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,440
(2020 Running Series
Innings Change)

2630
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:47,410
Please give a frying pan to So Min.

2631
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,070
Jeon So Min, you can do it!

2632
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:50,070
So Min, let's go.

2633
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,650
This is the last turn.

2634
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:54,950
(If the last pitcher Ji Hyo defends
within 3 points, Team Yoo will win.)

2635
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:56,890
- Run.
- Oh, my.

2636
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,320
(It's a straightforward hit.)

2637
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,860
- Run.
- Run.

2638
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,570
(An exciting swing to continue
the spark of a come-from-behind win)

2639
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:05,600
(But it's a fly out.)

2640
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,400
- Out.
- I hit it really well.

2641
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,440
- You did a good job.
- Let's do it one more time.

2642
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,400
- You did a good job.
- I did a good job.

2643
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,570
- You did a good job.
- This is too hard for me.

2644
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:15,330
- No, you did a good job.
- Ji Hyo's ball won't fall far away.

2645
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:16,900
It's hard. How am I going to hit it?

2646
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,070
(Pitcher Ji Hyo's ball is
hard to predict.)

2647
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:19,200
You can do it.

2648
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:20,740
(Falling down)

2649
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,520
- Strike.
- Mister.

2650
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,940
- Mister, you're being unfair.
- Good.

2651
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:29,020
(The strike zone is like the Pacific
only for Ji Hyo.)

2652
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,150
- I'm being consistent.
- Consistent...

2653
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:33,580
(This is the secret of
her special ending.)

2654
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:34,650
Mister.

2655
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:37,320
He must want to go home quickly.

2656
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,790
He's the best umpire.

2657
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:41,030
How can I hit this?
Who can hit this?

2658
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,270
Play.

2659
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:43,360
(She concentrates and throws again.)

2660
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:44,830
- Gosh.
- Okay.

2661
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:48,610
(He jumped with all his might.)

2662
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,400
(The strike zone is too high for
the little league player.)

2663
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,280
- Okay.
- He's bad.

2664
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,540
A frying pan is too good for him

2665
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:58,520
Why did you give him a frying pan?

2666
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:02,410
Kwang Soo, we need to do it this
time for a come-from-behind win.

2667
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:03,480
That's right.

2668
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,190
Your posture is good.

2669
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:08,950
Wait a minute.

2670
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:10,120
- Foul!
- But...

2671
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,820
(Ji Hyo's ball flew in suddenly.)

2672
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,690
- It's a swing and miss.
- Is it a foul?

2673
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:15,640
- That's not it.
- You hit it.

2674
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,770
- You hit it. Foul.
- I was doing a performance.

2675
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:18,900
- Foul.
- You did a good job.

2676
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,330
The ball hit you
when you were swinging.

2677
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:21,330
- Okay.
- Good.

2678
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:23,370
- Kwang Soo, focus.
- Ji Hyo is actually talented.

2679
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:25,180
(He focuses
and tries again properly.)

2680
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:27,740
(Putting his foot forward)

2681
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:28,870
It's a ball.

2682
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:31,940
(The ball brushed against his foot
that he held out on purpose.)

2683
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:33,110
- Nice.
- Gosh.

2684
01:27:33,190 --> 01:27:34,190
(He's pretending that he got hit
by accident.)

2685
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:35,950
- It's a ball.
- That was good.

2686
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,060
You can do it.

2687
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:38,950
It's okay. Good job, Ji Hyo.

2688
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,260
A slightly annoying person
came out, but...

2689
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,430
(He's stealing cones while crawling
after advancing to 1st base.)

2690
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:44,230
- He's slightly annoying.
- He really is.

2691
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:45,400
- Gosh.
- Here he goes.

2692
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,070
- Don't keep him in check.
- Ji Hyo, just throw the ball.

2693
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:48,070
Leave him alone.

2694
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:51,030
(Ji Hyo missed the ball
just at that moment.)

2695
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:53,030
Hey, that's not it.

2696
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:54,530
(This is his chance.)

2697
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:55,900
Good.

2698
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:56,900
(Team Yang is behind by 3 points.)

2699
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,810
(It's their chance to turn the game
around and earn more points.)

2700
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:04,580
(But the player who is throwing
the ball is Ryu Hyun Jin.)

2701
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:08,360
(A crucial moment came to them
in the 1st half of the 3rd inning.)

2702
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:11,860
(Will they survive with a save and
dream about a come-from-behind win?)

2703
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:14,150
(Or will they end the game with
a misfortunate out count?)

2704
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,030
- Out.
- Safe.

2705
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:17,030
(Both of them touched the base
almost at the same time.)

2706
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:19,190
(What is the decision of
the professional umpire?)

2707
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:21,100
- Out!
- Out!

2708
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:23,270
(The game ended with three outs.)

2709
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:24,660
You're out.

2710
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,660
(He turned in the last out count
with a greedy base running play.)

2711
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,810
Out.

2712
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:28,940
- Okay.
- Go.

2713
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,330
- Go.
- Just go.

2714
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:32,740
- We have two left.
- Okay.

2715
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,150
- Hey.
- Yes.

2716
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,110
(Team Yoo won.)

2717
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:38,110
- This is the ending.
- This is the ending.

2718
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,320
- It's a good ending.
- It's a good ending.

2719
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,360
(Discouraged)

2720
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,360
Okay.

2721
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,260
(Wait, what happened?)

2722
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:46,760
- Kwang Soo, nice ending.
- Hey.

2723
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,490
- I never even won once.
- That's right.

2724
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:51,270
Seriously. I was
the icon of misfortune.

2725
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:53,470
Everyone, according to the result
of the last game,

2726
01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:55,470
- Team Yoo won.
- Okay.

2727
01:28:55,470 --> 01:28:58,660
You will each receive 700 dollars
and 300 dollars.

2728
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:00,640
- 700 dollars?
- That's a large amount.

2729
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,900
- 700 and 300 dollars.
- This is the long-awaited ending.

2730
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:05,850
I'll announce the current amount
of the team owners.

2731
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:09,350
Se Chan has minus 459.7 dollars.

2732
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:10,580
- Minus?
- Yes.

2733
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,280
- He spent a lot of money.
- Minus?

2734
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,360
Yoo Jae Suk has minus 539 dollars.

2735
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,950
- Oh, my.
- Why is it a minus?

2736
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:18,820
- They spent all of their money.
- There's an 80-dollar difference.

2737
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,430
- We spent a lot.
- There's an 80-dollar difference,

2738
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:21,760
and it will end like this.

2739
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:24,160
Divide 700 dollars and 300 dollars
among 5 baseballs...

2740
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,790
however you want.

2741
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:27,900
Can I divide them however I want?

2742
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,270
- You'll have to divide it up.
- After that, take a ball each.

2743
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:30,660
- Okay.
- Right.

2744
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:32,270
- If so, I could beat Jae Suk.
- I think Se Chan...

2745
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:33,570
will put 300 dollars on one ball.

2746
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:34,830
- There's an 80-dollar difference?
- Yes, an 80-dollar difference.

2747
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:36,400
- I think Se Chan will do that.
- Exactly 80 dollars?

2748
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,940
- You just have to beat Se Chan.
- That's right.

2749
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,110
He won't put all of the money...

2750
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:42,940
- on one ball.
- No, he won't.

2751
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,390
You should just put
all 300 dollars on 1 ball.

2752
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:46,110
- Yes.
- Just put 300 dollars on 1 ball.

2753
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,480
- 300 dollars and the rest are 0.
- Make it 300 and the rest 0.

2754
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,220
- It's for you.
- What's the current score?

2755
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,760
If Kwang Soo picks 300 dollars,
it will be a come-from-behind win.

2756
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:54,760
I got 100 dollars.

2757
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:57,470
Why did you give all of the money
to rich people?

2758
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:58,990
Hey, gosh.

2759
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:00,660
Me?

2760
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,330
- Zero.
- Me...

2761
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,270
- Zero.
- Wait a minute.

2762
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:07,530
- I can't believe it.
- Please!

2763
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:09,230
- Please!
- Please!

2764
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:11,650
(Current number of cases:
1. If Kwang Soo picked 300 dollars,)

2765
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:14,020
(he will be exempt from the penalty
by avoiding the last place.)

2766
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:15,480
- I only wore pants today.
- It's one of the two.

2767
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,680
(2. If Se Chan picked 300 dollars,
the entire team will be exempt.)

2768
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:19,390
Okay, one...

2769
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:20,760
(Se Chan only thought about himself
amid the cold negotiation.)

2770
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,820
Two...

2771
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:23,020
(Kwang Soo dreamed of exemption
while receiving the lowest salary.)

2772
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,030
Three.

2773
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:25,950
(Only the person who picked
300 dollars will be exempt.)

2774
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:28,150
(What will be the result?)

2775
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:30,150
Okay!

2776
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:31,160
(Lee Kwang Soo acquired
300 dollars.)

2777
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:33,400
(The misfortunate Team Owner Yang
will receive a penalty.)

2778
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,660
Jae Suk won.

2779
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:36,100
(Team Owner Yoo Jae Suk's
come-from-behind win)

2780
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,140
Jae Suk won.

2781
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,360
Jae Suk is really lucky today.

2782
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,530
(He covers his mouth
as he's overwhelmed.)

2783
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:42,180
- It was so close.
- So Min was amazing.

2784
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:43,440
I was almost there.

2785
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:46,150
- Kwang Soo won.
- The result is dramatic.

2786
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:49,020
Ryu Hyun Jin won with 641 dollars.

2787
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,040
(Ryu Hyun Jin won with 641 dollars.)

2788
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,440
Kim Kwang Hyun is in 2nd place
with 640 dollars.

2789
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,940
- Is there a 1-dollar difference?
- There's a 1-dollar difference.

2790
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,360
- Third place is...
- It could be Kwang Soo.

2791
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,390
Song Ji Hyo.

2792
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:58,150
(The last person to receive a prize
as 3rd place is Ji Hyo.)

2793
01:30:58,530 --> 01:31:01,860
Yang Se Chan lost as a team owner.

2794
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,560
- Yes.
- I spent too much money.

2795
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,490
So the person who will receive
the penalty as last place is...

2796
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:07,660
Jeon So Min.

2797
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,530
- Is that it?
- The ex-lovers got together.

2798
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:13,140
- 5 dollars and...
- They suit each other so well.

2799
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,830
Will the two of us
receive the penalty?

2800
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:19,740
So Ryu Hyun Jin, Kim Kwang Hyun, and
Song Ji Hyo will receive prizes.

2801
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,540
They are the highest grade
abalone sets.

2802
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,280
- Are they abalones?
- They're really big.

2803
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,320
The penalty is...

2804
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,580
organizing the remaining cones
and baseballs.

2805
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:28,020
- Gosh.
- Okay.

2806
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,320
It's perfect. The two of you can
do it in a romantic way.

2807
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:33,950
If I had picked 300 dollars,
I wouldn't have been in last place.

2808
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:35,430
That was so close, So Min.

2809
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:38,100
If I was on the same team
as So Min, I would have lost.

2810
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,320
Everyone on my team lost today.

2811
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:42,730
Gosh.

2812
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:43,730
(After picking up balls for
15 minutes, they were done.)

2813
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:46,400
(We would like to thank
major leaguers Ryu Hyun Jin and...)

2814
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,530
(Kim Kwang Hyun for doing their best
without sparing themselves.)
