1
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,180
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Kook Jong.

2
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,960
Me? I didn't write a lot.

3
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,020
It's okay. Make it short.

4
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,060
Gosh, I think this is too formal.

5
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,230
"With the global fandom
beyond Korea,"

6
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,860
"Running Man has become the center
of Korean variety shows."

7
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,590
He must be shy.
He seems anxious now.

8
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,030
"It's the gateway
to becoming a star."

9
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,530
"Through talks and games
that attract viewers of all ages,"

10
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,010
"Korea's representative variety show
spreads K-Culture."

11
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,240
This is real.
He is serious about this. I love it.

12
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,150
It sounds like SBS wrote it.

13
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,850
We also need things like this.

14
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,080
"Yoo Jae Suk. His nickname
is 'Unchanging Goofball'."

15
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,250
Is that all you wrote?

16
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,880
The thing is...

17
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,910
- I wrote the others first.
- I love it.

18
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,150
- I was going to come back to this.
- I like it anyway.

19
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,260
- You like it.
- I do.

20
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,120
- "Unchanging Goofball".
- Good.

21
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,590
"Ji Suk Jin. The Lynx
of talk shows called 'Ji-rasoni'."

22
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,930
"He's burning the last embers
of his variety show career."

23
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,870
- Good.
- Hey.

24
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,160
When will your last passion
come to an end?

25
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,870
Last? It's not like...

26
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,540
- "The Last Leaf".
- It's like eternal youth.

27
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,700
- Good luck.
- Go, Ji Suk Jin!

28
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,480
"Kim Jong Kook. 'Anyang Tantrum'
who throws a tantrum when he's mad."

29
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,800
He admits it too.

30
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,150
"He's a singer. He sings well
and has many hit songs."

31
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,620
"But he's better known
as an entertainer now."

32
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,770
Okay.

33
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,490
- That was about him.
- Gosh.

34
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,410
"Haha. Short Guy, Small Guy,"

35
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,180
"Haha PD,
A Guy Who's Short but Happy".

36
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,910
"He's an indispensable
seasoning in Running Man."

37
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,630
"But he's more focused
on his YouTube these days."

38
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,550
Is he a seasoning?

39
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,290
- Seasoning.
- "Lee Kwang Soo."

40
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,130
"Just Crazy, Forever Star Butler."

41
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,400
Why do you keep saying
"Star Butler"?

42
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,540
"He's ugly, but he finds it
hard to accept the fact."

43
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,570
(He's ugly, but he finds it
hard to accept the fact.)

44
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,160
"His fans spoiled him."

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
What?

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
(His fans spoiled him.)

47
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,130
(What's that?)

48
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,880
- Exactly. His fans spoiled him.
- That can't be my introduction.

49
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,070
It's the fans.

50
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,680
They didn't spoil me.

51
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,180
They say he's handsome,
so he thinks he's handsome.

52
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,540
"He finds it hard
to accept the fact." It's hilarious.

53
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,410
- My gosh.
- He can't accept it.

54
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,710
- This is crazy.
- "Yang Se Chan."

55
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,910
"Yechani, Yang Sebastian,
and Gum Angel."

56
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,130
Good. I like my nicknames.

57
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,820
"Kim Jong Kook's favorite doll."

58
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,080
"But he badmouths me
behind my back."

59
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,350
"He's pretending to be innocent, but
once there's proof, I'll kill him."

60
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,690
(He's pretending to be innocent, but
once there's proof, I'll kill him.)

61
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,240
This is a declaration of war.

62
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,570
(It's a declaration of war
under the mask of an introduction.)

63
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,070
I didn't badmouth you.

64
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,710
- Who's up next?
- I made it short.

65
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,130
- It's simple.
- Good.

66
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,180
Make it short.

67
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,630
I was serious about
the production objective though.

68
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,770
This stuff can last a while.

69
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,850
"It's spreading to the whole world
beyond Korea? No, to outer space."

70
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,570
"The members make up
for each other's deficiencies."

71
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,190
"The piller of Korean variety shows
that the whole family can enjoy."

72
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,190
- Okay.
- Good.

73
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,690
"Piller?" Does it say "piller"?

74
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,560
- "Piller?"
- What?

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,950
(Piller?)

76
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,530
It's "pillar", you punk.

77
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,850
- It's a typo.
- It's not a typo.

78
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,390
You also said "piller".

79
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,570
(He confidently pronounced it
as "piller".)

80
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,970
- It's a typo.
- It's not acorn jelly.

81
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,540
It's not a dialect.

82
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,540
It's "pillar". Do you even know
what a pillar is?

83
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,310
- What?
- Do you know what it means?

84
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,810
It's like a support.

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,480
That's it. Just move on.

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,070
- Please change the spelling.
- It's okay.

87
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,510
If Kwang Soo wins,
you should go with this.

88
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,570
Member introductions.
"Ji Suk Jin. I'm still vigorous."

89
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,250
(I'm still vigorous.)

90
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,260
"Yoo Jae Suk."

91
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,660
(They love it.)

92
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,660
"Bring it on."

93
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,130
"I will stay ranked eighth
by looks no matter who comes."

94
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,350
(He's in first place from the end.)

95
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,760
- I love it.
- He's crazy.

96
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,470
"Kim Jong Kook.
My heart is like a soy sauce dish."

97
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,540
(My heart is like a soy sauce dish.)

98
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,630
Are you saying he's petty?

99
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,970
(The soy sauce dish will
teach you a lesson.)

100
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,980
- Good.
- "Haha. Old Fossil".

101
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,700
"Come to me
if you want to get an earful."

102
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
I'm talking now!

103
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,670
- Good.
- "Song Ji Hyo."

104
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,670
"Go ahead and text me."

105
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,250
"I'll ignore it anyway."

106
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,410
(Go ahead and text me.
I'll ignore it anyway.)

107
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,640
I love it.

108
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,950
(It's a short but powerful blow.)

109
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,530
"Jeon So Min. It's me who made
Running Man PG-15."

110
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,450
"I'll make it Rated R in 2021."

111
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,290
(She will raise the viewer rating
as well as the age limit.)

112
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,790
- Good.
- "Yang Se Chan."

113
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,320
- "Poop".
- Hey!

114
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,360
(He just wrote one word, "poop".)

115
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,860
What's that?

116
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,470
I lost my concentration
toward the end.

117
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,570
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just one word.

118
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,810
- I lost my concentration.
- It's funny though.

119
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,810
- I like it.
- How could he say that?

120
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,510
I like it. It's short and good.

121
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,540
"Lee Kwang Soo. We didn't know..."

122
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,350
"how charming he was."

123
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,590
Gosh, I hate him.

124
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,410
(It's true that
his fans spoiled him.)

125
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,640
It makes me want to vomit.

126
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,690
Mine is short too.

127
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,320
The production objective.
"Variety shows are..."

128
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
"disappearing these days."

129
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,730
"Running Man is Korea's favorite
variety show that's been..."

130
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,260
"on Sunday nights
for over 10 years."

131
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,320
"The members play games and clear
missions with various guest stars,"

132
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,970
"as they go around
to different places."

133
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,790
"Among various fun factors,"

134
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,760
"this show only
focuses on laughter."

135
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,470
This is the true
production objective.

136
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,540
I hope this will go on the website.

137
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,430
This is how Jae Suk thinks
of Running Man.

138
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,280
The writers are giving him
a big hand.

139
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,540
Why are you clapping your hands?

140
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,480
"We only care about laughter."

141
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,080
(We only care about laughter.)

142
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,370
- Cool.
- Right.

143
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,680
It's not like
you're submitting a report.

144
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,810
"Ji Suk Jin. He was going to leave
the team in the first year."

145
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,660
("Ji Suk Jin was going to leave
the team in the first year.")

146
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,250
"But now he says
Running Man is the best."

147
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,590
(Knocked out)

148
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,660
That's just a message to him.

149
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,360
- "His behavior is frowned upon..."
- That's just a message to him.

150
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,490
- Hey.
- That's basically a letter.

151
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,290
That's just something
we say among ourselves.

152
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,930
This is my introduction. It's mine.

153
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,410
It's like...

154
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,430
It's like an article
for the tabloids.

155
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,100
Yes, that's right. The tabloids.

156
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,000
It's just how I feel about him.

157
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,410
"His behavior
is frowned upon by many."

158
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,150
- It's excessive.
- It's totally for the tabloids.

159
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,720
- You praise the show excessively.
- He's right.

160
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,810
- I'm not excessive.
- And everyone hates it.

161
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,980
My goodness.

162
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,020
"Yoo Jae Suk."

163
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,620
"The official prankster
of Running Man, Yooruce Willis."

164
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,730
- Okay.
- Ji Suk Jin.

165
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,850
"Kim Jong Kook."

166
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,230
"Called 'Kim Nipple' during summer
and 'Enema Kim' in other seasons."

167
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,700
"Also known as 'Go Large'
and won the Grand Award in 2020."

168
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,290
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

169
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,790
(The other members praise
the Grand Award winner again.)

170
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,470
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

171
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,540
(Suk Jin is pretty annoyed.)

172
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,000
How long do we have to
congratulate him for the award?

173
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,410
"Song Ji Hyo. Real name is
Cheon Seong Im, Cheon Su Yeon."

174
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,520
"Nickname is 'Jeoktoma'."

175
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,950
"We can't say that she gets
along well with the members,"

176
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,350
"but we also can't say
that she doesn't."

177
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,980
"To cut a long story short,
Ji Hyo is funny these days."

178
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,460
Next is...

179
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,960
"Haha. He's the dad of three kids.
He's officially an old fossil now."

180
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,230
- "But he still doesn't know it."
- Why am I an old fossil?

181
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,700
"He doesn't want to admit it."

182
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,560
"Recently, he sent me
half-dried herring".

183
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,840
(Recently, he sent me
half-dried herring.)

184
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,230
Is it necessary to write about that
in his introduction?

185
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,840
I wanted to write about
things the viewers don't know.

186
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,910
Who is "me" in the introduction?

187
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,280
- That's me.
- It's you?

188
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,210
- You can't write about yourself.
- All right.

189
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,280
"Lee Kwang Soo. He can grow taller
but he doesn't try harder."

190
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,480
(Lee Kwang Soo. He can grow taller
but he doesn't try harder.)

191
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,540
You keep saying that.

192
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,980
- Then try harder.
- Yes, drink some milk.

193
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,310
- He's right.
- Why won't you try harder?

194
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,960
- Drink milk and play basketball.
- What are you talking about?

195
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,750
Next is Jeon So Min.

196
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,600
"I've seen her for a while
and she really is crazy."

197
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,560
"Yang Se Chan. Yang Se Hyeong's
brother. Has handsome gums."

198
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,790
"It seems he has a girlfriend."

199
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,160
(Suspicious of his private life
"It seems he has a girlfriend.")

200
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,860
- I don't.
- That's all I have.

201
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,100
- Okay.
- Okay.

202
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
It was good.

203
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,210
- It was very neat.
- It was, wasn't it?

204
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,140
I thought it'd be better
to write a lot about the show.

205
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,980
You wrote a lot. It's very long.

206
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,980
"A show that makes the entire
country, and beyond, run as one."

207
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,220
She's actually right.

208
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,240
"Running Man carries out
missions like we only live today."

209
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,980
"Eight members with different colors
go through many troubles..."

210
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,530
"to deliver a great deal of joy
and extraordinary entertainment."

211
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,850
She used all the fancy words
she knows.

212
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,460
"Stay tuned for the charm of
the eight members..."

213
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,900
"which we will show you anywhere
and in any situation."

214
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,770
- Ji Hyo, I love that. "Stay tuned".
- "Stay tuned!"

215
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,930
- Stay tuned.
- Okay.

216
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,430
Next is...

217
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,430
Who's the thug?

218
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,140
- "Kim Thug."
- Okay, "Kim Thug".

219
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,340
"You'll be sorry if you judge him
only by his muscles."

220
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,210
"No one can catch up
to his good sense and witty words."

221
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,800
- "All Mighty of all higher beings."
- She's right.

222
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,040
"He likes to reveal
his adorable side sometimes."

223
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,240
"He is unexpectedly charming."

224
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,480
- You're so right.
- Yes.

225
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,180
You know exactly who I am.

226
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,610
(What did she write about Haha?)

227
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,610
"Small business owner."

228
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,350
(President Ha,
small business owner in Mapo-gu)

229
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,890
"President Ha,
small business owner in Mapo-gu."

230
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,900
That is funny.

231
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,550
(His name is "President Ha,
small business owner in Mapo-gu.")

232
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,420
"How capable and resourceful is he?"

233
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,660
"He's capable of both running
a business and running on the show."

234
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,660
"President Ha is a greedy man
who wants it all!"

235
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,040
Do you think it's appropriate...

236
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,660
to write that
in the member introduction?

237
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,280
You can't write about
his personal business.

238
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,740
"He's capable
of running a business."

239
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,540
- Well, he does a lot of things.
- Hey.

240
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,040
It's my business.

241
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,850
- I wrote "a small business owner."
- She can't compliment him...

242
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,310
for running his business well
in the member introduction.

243
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,660
- What about Song Ji Hyo?
- "Song Ji Hyo."

244
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,390
Well, I wasn't sure
what I should say.

245
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,330
So I wrote, "Finally, she's
trying to step out into the world."

246
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,550
Maybe that's how you feel.

247
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,250
"She's learning how fun
it is to be out in the world."

248
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,960
"Song Ji Hyo
is stepping out into the world."

249
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,030
Congratulations!

250
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,660
(Song Ji Hyo
is stepping out into the world.)

251
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,340
Yes, you should
communicate with others.

252
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
You're finally
stepping out into the world?

253
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,360
Finally.

254
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,430
Song Communication.

255
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,410
Okay, Song Jeoktoma!

256
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,480
- Song Jeoktoma.
- Yes, come on out. And call me.

257
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,670
Let's have a meal together.

258
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,040
We're supposed to be
social distancing.

259
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,150
(We're supposed to be
social distancing.)

260
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,650
(Quickly apologizing)

261
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,250
- Suk Jin.
- In spirit only.

262
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,020
- Be with her in spirit only.
- Sure.

263
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,480
- In spirit only. My apologies.
- All right.

264
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,600
Next is Ji Suk Jin.

265
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,300
(Can't wait to hear what she says.
Next is Ji Suk Jin.)

266
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,520
"He doesn't know himself."

267
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,470
"He's the Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong
who pretends to love his family."

268
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,340
(He's the Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong
who pretends to love his family.)

269
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,730
(Find yourself
falling for his charm.)

270
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,000
I love it.

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,680
- "The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong."
- Today...

272
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,870
Ji Hyo is stepping out
into the world.

273
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,000
"The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong."

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,100
It was great.

275
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,850
"Find yourself
falling for his charm."

276
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,140
"The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong."

277
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,220
What's that?

278
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,690
- It's kind of ambiguous.
- Hugh Grant.

279
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,060
I'm not offended
but can't say I'm pleased.

280
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,090
It's good since it's Hugh Grant.

281
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,590
Hugh Grant is amazing.

282
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,100
Yes, it's good that
she compared me to him.

283
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,650
We got two amazing nicknames today.

284
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,570
- "The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong."
- And "Mr. Dirty Mustache".

285
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,070
- Yes, "Mr. Dirty Mustache".
- That's right.

286
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,600
"The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong"
is funny.

287
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,840
All right.

288
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,470
Hello, everyone.

289
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,600
- Hi.
- The production objective.

290
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,080
"The funniest show ever in Korea
and in any country in the world."

291
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,810
"The only show you can enjoy
both the old and the new."

292
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,270
"You can bite, chew, and taste.
We are the real deal."

293
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,680
"The one and only
semi-real variety show."

294
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,850
- "Semi-real variety show".
- "Semi-real".

295
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,920
- It's a bit more than half.
- Actually, it's 100 percent real.

296
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,510
- "The dealer of semi-real variety".
- "semi-real".

297
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,190
"We guarantee
your laughter, longevity,"

298
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,850
"love life, marriage,"

299
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,230
"and success in life."

300
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,760
Shouldn't it be "the leader",
not "the dealer"?

301
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,170
Oh, right. It's "the leader".

302
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,840
(The dealer of semi-real variety!)

303
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,700
(The leader of semi-real variety!)

304
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,130
- Wait a minute.
- It's "the leader".

305
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,630
- He's right.
- Wait a minute.

306
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,870
- What is "a dealer"?
- My goodness.

307
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,580
How can you make such a mistake?

308
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,000
How hard is it to make
a PowerPoint? Am I right?

309
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,640
- No, no. It's a typo.
- What is "the dealer"?

310
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,870
It's "the leader".

311
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,240
I knew the correct word.

312
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,350
I wrote "piller" as a typo too.

313
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,060
I thought it was written correctly.

314
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,480
"Piller" was a typo.

315
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,780
I confused "the leader"
with "the dealer".

316
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,250
- Whatever. That's what you wrote.
- It's "the leader".

317
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,800
- It's "the leader," everyone.
- Okay, what's next?

318
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,930
- Let's move on.
- I knew the actual word.

319
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,830
Next is Ji Suk Jin,
known as "The Senior".

320
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,340
- Gosh, it says "Ji Seok Ji".
- What's "Ji Seok Ji"?

321
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,230
- Gosh.
- You can't fix it now.

322
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,630
She can't fix it.

323
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,710
What's "Ji Seok Ji"?

324
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,100
She can't fix it now.

325
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,370
No, she can't.

326
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,340
- If she wins, I'll be "Seok Ji"?
- Sure.

327
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,050
You're "Ji Seok Ji"
even if you say it backwards.

328
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,500
It's the same
even if you say it backwards.

329
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,350
"The lucky charm, the adorable,
the youngest Jeon So Min."

330
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,190
"No one knows who she really is."

331
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,690
"Running Man unveils
her mysterious charm."

332
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,090
(Flinching)

333
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,780
"She's good at acting,
comedy, writing, and cooking."

334
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,560
"The perfect entertainer
this generation wants."

335
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,560
"The best entertainer.
How much more can she be charming?"

336
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,650
"We're lucky to have her!"

337
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,990
(We're lucky to have her!)

338
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,600
(And she doesn't forget
to strike a pose as she prepared.)

339
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,360
- It's Suk Jin's turn.
- I think...

340
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,710
everyone's good enough
to be picked.

341
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,580
- Yes, everyone's good.
- Right.

342
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,600
- They're not bad.
- If I win,

343
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,480
- mine will be posted, right?
- Yes.

344
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,550
All right.

345
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,000
The production objective.

346
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
"The new hearth of Running Man,"

347
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,010
- "Ji Suk Jin leads the new show."
- "Hearth"?

348
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,050
"The new hearth of Running Man,
Ji Suk Jin leads the new show."

349
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,780
- "Hearth"?
- Running Man.

350
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,980
- Wait.
- What?

351
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,220
- Are you nervous?
- No.

352
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,120
(Got something to mock)

353
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,430
- Well, I think...
- I'm not nervous.

354
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,120
it's been a long time since he was
in the center of attention.

355
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,120
You said,
"The new hearth of Running Man."

356
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,890
(He's so nervous
that his heart is about to burst!)

357
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,670
- "Every week, Ji Suk Jin..."
- Don't be nervous.

358
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,760
"fights against the seven losers."

359
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,340
Don't be so nervous.

360
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,670
All right.

361
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,900
Just hang in there.

362
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,440
Hugh Grant!

363
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,030
(Cheering for
"The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong")

364
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,370
- Hugh...
- Please be quiet.

365
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,080
"He can't be fooled,
but he pretends that he is."

366
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,450
"His name tag can't been ripped..."

367
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,950
"but he lets them rip it off."

368
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,240
The word spacing is terrible.

369
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,920
It's not "can't been ripped".
It's "can't be ripped".

370
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,720
Other words are wrong too.

371
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,980
- Just let it go.
- I can't believe him.

372
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,750
His grammar is terrible.

373
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,880
Just let it go.

374
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,990
"I sacrifice myself to giving hope
to the younger members."

375
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,330
"I is the Giving Tree,
Captain Ji."

376
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,890
Shouldn't it be "am" not "is"?

377
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,200
"I is"?

378
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,340
"To giving hope"?

379
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,070
He wrote, "to giving hope".

380
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,170
It's because...

381
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,270
the keyboard arrangement
is different from my generation.

382
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,270
Is it a regional dialect?

383
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,310
Your generation didn't even
have a keyboard.

384
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,980
- "The Giving Tree, Captain Ji."
- What's wrong with you?

385
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,770
"It's not just
a variety show anymore."

386
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,820
What's wrong with him?

387
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,380
"In the endless cold
betrayal betrayal..."

388
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,450
Why did you write "betrayal" twice?

389
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,610
What does that mean?

390
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,980
(In the endless cold
betrayal betrayal...)

391
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,090
My goodness.

392
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,120
You're unprepared.

393
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,460
Why would you write
"betrayal" twice?

394
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,120
My goodness. This is making me cry.

395
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,860
- Gosh, this is so funny.
- That's not it.

396
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,300
- Gosh.
- This is...

397
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,800
He was surprised too.

398
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,070
"Endless cold betrayal betrayal..."

399
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,730
(He froze up
when he read the second "betrayal".)

400
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,440
- He was like a broken record.
- Wait a minute.

401
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,530
I'm sorry
that I wrote the word twice.

402
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,770
Okay, member introductions.

403
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,710
What's this? "Jan Seo Min"?

404
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,550
I'm so sorry.

405
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,050
- My goodness.
- Why so many typos?

406
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,550
- Suk Jin.
- "Any litle?"

407
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,510
- It's just the order.
- It's "Any little thing."

408
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,720
"Any little thing can make her
go crazy. No one can control her."

409
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,090
- "The biggest fool on the show."
- Why did he make so many mistakes?

410
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,350
"Buckteeth Se Chan"

411
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,560
"The ugliest."

412
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,800
"He's all talk but no sincerity."

413
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,670
It's witless.

414
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,170
(Don't mock him with facts.)

415
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,700
(Pretending that he hears nothing)

416
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,760
Song Ji Hyo. "Zoned-out Girl."

417
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,310
I named her "Zoned-out Girl."

418
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,440
(Boring!)

419
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,730
It's not witty.

420
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,480
"Zoned-out Girl,"
the next "Young Gu".

421
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,980
- "Running Man's new fool."
- Wake up, Haha.

422
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,220
We're still filming.

423
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,140
(Haha, wake up.)

424
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,450
(Fell asleep listening to
Suk Jin's boring story)

425
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,320
Wait a minute. Wake up, Haha.

426
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,420
Jae Suk, Jae Suk!

427
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,620
- Jae Suk!
- We're filming.

428
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,650
Jae Suk, wake up!

429
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk
gives a perfect performance.)

430
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,060
Jae Suk, wake up.

431
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,600
- What?
- We're still filming.

432
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,700
Okay. Look alive, guys!

433
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,730
I fell asleep.

434
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,490
Hang in there, guys.
He's almost done.

435
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,800
- Gosh, I fell asleep.
- He's no fun.

436
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,440
- Okay. "Lee Kwang Soo."
- He's not done yet?

437
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,180
"Now he's 350cm tall."

438
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,210
- "He entered the Guinness Book."
- It's already morning.

439
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,740
- Haha!
- "How tall will he get?"

440
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,640
Okay, next.

441
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,420
- This is exhausting.
- "Kim Jong Kook."

442
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,280
- Another typo?
- "The starter of the new rase."

443
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,650
- There's another typo.
- "Experienced much muscle loss."

444
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,010
"He suddenly lost so much muscle."

445
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,960
"His thighs are as slim as
Suk Jin's arms now."

446
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,430
"Now he's the weakest member
of Running Man."

447
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,850
It's like the principal
is giving a speech.

448
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,930
- Suk Jin.
- What?

449
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,990
- What?
- Your face turned red.

450
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,340
No, no. I'm fine.

451
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,670
It's not funny at all.

452
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,710
- Suk Jin.
- Just keep your mouth shut.

453
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,180
- It's really not funny.
- Don't say a word.

454
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,270
- "It's really not funny."
- Next is Haha.

455
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,500
(Teasing)

456
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,640
I laughed so much my stomach hurts.

457
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,320
I'm talking about Haha, you punk.

458
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,510
Suk Jin, are you upset?

459
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,850
Yes, I am upset, you punk!

460
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,820
- He's embarrassed.
- Are you all right?

461
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,880
I'm fine.

462
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,380
- Okay, next page.
- My mouth hurts.

463
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,880
Gosh, my cheekbones hurt.

464
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,280
"Ji Suk Jin,
known as 'Ji-rasoni'."

465
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,120
- "He's there."
- Suk Jin.

466
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,560
Suk Jin noticed it.

467
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,860
He just scanned the entire room.

468
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,700
- Hey.
- He sensed it.

469
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,730
Stay quiet.

470
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,390
"There is no need
for further explanation."

471
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,860
- Is that it?
- "Yoo Jae Suk."

472
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,900
It says dirty.

473
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
"Yoo Jae Suk announced
his retirement this year."

474
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,940
"This is his last work."

475
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,270
- "Pay attention to him."
- He's Ji Grant.

476
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,000
Give me a white towel.

477
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,270
- We don't have a white towel.
- Get him one.

478
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,550
Get me a white towel.

479
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,450
Suk Jin is about to cry.

480
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,880
It's hilarious.

481
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,950
Gosh, it was so funny.

482
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,190
Suk Jin, is it over?

483
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,480
(Swearing)

484
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,510
What?

485
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,750
(He says bad words
half-seriously, half-jokingly.)

486
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,060
Why are you swearing?

487
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,730
(Ji-rasoni finally loses
his temper after 11 years.)

488
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,430
- Why are you swearing?
- Why are you taking it off?

489
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,470
(Swearing)

490
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,990
- Why are you swearing at us?
- Why are you upset?

491
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,300
Why?

492
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,970
What's wrong?

493
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,170
- Fine. Do what you want!
- Come here.

494
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,180
- It's so funny.
- Suk Jin.

495
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,000
- Come here.
- Suk Jin.

496
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,270
- Don't be upset.
- Suk Jin.

497
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,320
(Suk Jin sulks
for the first time in 11 years.)

498
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
(Now he finally shows
his humane qualities.)

499
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,420
Why are you swearing?

500
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,020
All right. You can watch
Suk Jin swear on YouTube.

501
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,850
It's called "Spicy Version
Ji Suk Jin".

502
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,890
It's so funny.

503
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,360
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

504
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,940
I laughed a lot.

505
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,760
It's hilarious.

506
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,340
It's killing me.

507
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,940
This is so funny.

508
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,840
I want you guys to pick...

509
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,050
the worst introduction each.

510
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,350
- Can I say it?
- Hey.

511
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,950
- Don't do that.
- You're really mean!

512
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,510
(You're really mean!)

513
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,850
- There's no need to say.
- Do you really not know?

514
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,110
No need to say it.

515
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,610
- Why do you even ask?
- Do you really not know?

516
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,520
You should pick the worst one.

517
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,120
- 1, 2, 3.
- I can't pick.

518
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,560
Who picked Suk Jin?

519
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,750
- Me.
- Me.

520
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,470
- Me too.
- Four people.

521
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,100
- 5 people.
- There are 5.

522
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,470
(5 out of 8 people)

523
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,170
Jae Suk, Se Chan, and Kwang Soo
got one vote each.

524
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,500
And Suk Jin got five votes.

525
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,270
Like I said, today's special is
Running Man Rewritten.

526
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,180
The winner's content will be posted
on our website.

527
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,450
I'll have mine go on the website.

528
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,270
We have two kinds of roulette here.

529
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,690
The first one has your names on it,
and we will spin it at the end.

530
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,220
It has 40 spots
with 5 name tags each.

531
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,830
We will spin it
to decide the winner.

532
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,060
And the other roulette
is about benefits.

533
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,730
The winners of each mission
will spin this roulette...

534
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,990
and win the benefit they pick.

535
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,070
According to the roulette,
you will have more...

536
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,340
or less name tags on the roulette.

537
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,030
And you will get paid
as much as the number...

538
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,230
of your name tags on the roulette.

539
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,440
- Really?
- Good.

540
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,180
If you have more name tags on
the roulette, you'll get more money.

541
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,540
It increases the amount of money.

542
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,070
We will start the first mission
once you get changed.

543
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,840
(They will start the mission
after getting changed.)

544
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,120
- What is this?
- What's that?

545
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,360
What is this thing?

546
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,750
It's getting more advanced.

547
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,190
I'm really curious.
Who comes up with games like this?

548
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,430
This is amazing.

549
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,970
- My goodness.
- There's flour. Is this flour?

550
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,700
What? Is that flour?

551
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,590
- I think this one is better.
- What's that thing?

552
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,970
- Are they marbles?
- Marbles.

553
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,230
It might break my head.

554
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,140
- It can't break your head.
- This is the worst.

555
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,440
I might break my head.

556
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,530
This one is...

557
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,150
It's like jelly.
It's called frogspawn.

558
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,740
- That's just...
- It's not hard.

559
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,810
How can someone be so untrusting
of our production crew?

560
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,980
A member like that...

561
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,150
I can't believe this.

562
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,080
You should have a meeting
and rule him out.

563
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,660
The production crew wouldn't put
metal marbles in there.

564
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,980
Hey, stop it.

565
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,250
I saw Suk Jin punch the wall
in the restroom earlier.

566
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,490
- I almost cried now.
- Why?

567
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,320
Suk Jin just kicked me,
but it didn't hurt at all.

568
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Come on.

569
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,940
(It's like an old parent's whip
doesn't hurt at all.)

570
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,760
- Jae Suk, that's so sad.
- Hey.

571
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,730
I just kicked you gently.

572
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,730
- I just kicked you gently.
- What should I do?

573
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,800
Kook Jong, it makes my heart ache.

574
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,610
I know how you feel.

575
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,650
(When everyone worries
about Big Nose...)

576
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,040
This camera is only for me.

577
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,840
- Hey, it's not for you.
- It's not for you.

578
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,310
It's for all of us.
It's for a full shot.

579
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,750
Jong Kook should
be on the camera too.

580
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,390
This is for a full shot. Lean back.

581
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,580
We can be on the camera too.

582
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,290
- Don't block the camera.
- She's right.

583
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,430
My goodness.

584
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,700
We're rewriting the production
objective for the year 2021.

585
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,260
So we prepared missions
that require a good hunch...

586
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,610
and good wit which are
necessary skills for Running Man.

587
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,330
This is what I'm good at.

588
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,540
I have a good hunch.

589
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,180
Goofball is acting up again.

590
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,010
- What are you good at?
- Goofball is acting up again.

591
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,680
I really want to see you
do something well.

592
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,150
- A good hunch and what?
- I'm good at this.

593
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,280
I'm sure you will be covered
in a floury mess in 10 minutes.

594
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,580
- Hey, stay quiet.
- I'm pretty sure.

595
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,810
I can imagine that.

596
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,780
The first mission is...

597
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,230
Know How It Feels to Run.

598
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,820
You will give it a try one by one.

599
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,060
You will lie on the cart
and stamp your feet once...

600
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,060
to get as close as possible
to the wall.

601
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,830
And you will see...

602
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,640
the yellow zone, green zone,
and red zone here.

603
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,380
- And the cart has an arrow.
- There's an arrow.

604
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,480
If the arrow stops on red,
the water balloon will burst.

605
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
(Red: Water balloon)

606
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,340
If it stops on green,
the marble balloon will burst.

607
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,810
If it stops on yellow, you succeed.

608
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,120
If you fail to control the speed
and bump into the wall,

609
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,460
the bell will ring,

610
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,080
and the whipped cream balloon
will burst.

611
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,250
(If the cart hits the wall,
the cream balloon will burst.)

612
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,050
That's the worst.

613
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,820
It'd be better to try it later.

614
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,320
- No.
- No. That's not true.

615
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,830
Why are they being like that to me?

616
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,200
- Why?
- You two should sit apart.

617
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,760
- But why?
- Just sit apart.

618
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,000
Why do you think
it'd be better to try later?

619
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
- That's not true.
- Why is that?

620
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,480
What?

621
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,840
I mean, I can see
how hard it should be...

622
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,270
- Kim Grand Award. You're right.
- All right.

623
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,570
- I know. Why would it be better?
- This is crazy.

624
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,780
Only the 1st and 2nd places will...

625
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,510
- get to spin the roulette.
- Only the 1st and 2nd places?

626
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,120
- Okay.
- The order is important here.

627
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,230
Who will go first?

628
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,690
Suk Jin said he'd go first.

629
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,050
- Really?
- When did I say that?

630
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,230
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- He told me that.

631
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,820
- When did I say that?
- Before we got in here.

632
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,170
- When did I?
- You did.

633
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,670
- I didn't say that.
- He said that.

634
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,990
It would be disadvantageous
for me to go first.

635
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,500
- Will you go first?
- Jam Hugh!

636
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,730
Do I get any advantages?

637
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,680
- Advantages?
- Any advantages?

638
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,880
- I need something.
- Show us what to do.

639
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,610
- You're the oldest one here.
- I'll go first then.

640
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,150
- Okay.
- Are you serious?

641
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,040
(Jae Suk gives it a try bravely.)

642
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,120
He's cool.

643
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,650
I will give you
a chance to practice.

644
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,890
- A chance to practice?
- Okay.

645
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,980
I'll go first then.

646
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,050
I'll do it.

647
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,120
I want to go first.

648
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,730
(Jam Hugh hesitated
and lost his chance to practice.)

649
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,250
Hey, this is... It goes like this.

650
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,970
- I get a practice round, right?
- Yes, you do.

651
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,560
Let me push it back for you.

652
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,670
Look at this.

653
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,870
This is more sensitive
than I thought.

654
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
This is for practice.

655
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,110
- It's a practice.
- You can practice it only once.

656
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,140
Right.

657
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,000
It's red.

658
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,680
- It doesn't slide well.
- It's water.

659
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,540
- It's red.
- You should push it hard.

660
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,570
In this case,
the water balloon bursts.

661
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,510
If it were a real round,
the water balloon would've burst.

662
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,510
(If it were a real round,
the water balloon would've burst.)

663
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,010
Did you get the hang of it?

664
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,120
He has no idea.

665
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
(He has no idea.)

666
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,020
You should stop on yellow.

667
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,080
Are you trying it now?

668
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,480
No. I'll do it later.

669
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,200
- Why?
- I'm not doing this.

670
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,750
- Why?
- You practiced it already.

671
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,470
No. I'll do it later.

672
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,970
Why?

673
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,990
I think we should decide
the order again.

674
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,400
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

675
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,640
(I'll go first.)

676
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
- Do you want to go first?
- Yes.

677
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,170
- I knew it. He's Kim Grand Award.
- Kim Grand Award.

678
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,710
Kim Grand Award steps up.

679
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,740
He's setting a good example
after winning the Grand Award.

680
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,570
A gangster to a Grand Award winner.

681
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,950
He's "Protein Monster".

682
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,810
He's the Grand Award winner indeed.

683
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,340
His heart is like a soy sauce dish.

684
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,280
- You're amazing.
- Since it's the new year,

685
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,810
- You're the best.
- I should change my life pattern.

686
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,020
- I should stop waiting.
- That sounds good.

687
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,230
So I should stop there.

688
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,860
I can look at it, right?

689
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,170
- You can practice once.
- Yes. This is a practice.

690
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,200
(Kim Grand Award gets
to practice it once.)

691
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,790
(Booing)

692
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,790
- What was that?
- Why?

693
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,610
- Soy sauce dish.
- Soy sauce dish.

694
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,880
(He was being cowardly
as he pushed the cart.)

695
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
The practice is over.

696
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,230
- You should start now.
- Start.

697
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,950
- You should start now.
- Here I go.

698
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,110
Can I start?

699
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,480
- It should be twice as hard.
- It slows down quickly.

700
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,770
(Will he clear his name...)

701
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,010
(and show the dignity
of a Grand Award winner?)

702
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,810
It's water.

703
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,430
- Is it marbles?
- Okay.

704
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,360
(Falling)

705
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,860
This is the best one.

706
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,550
What was that? It wasn't so bad.

707
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,400
It just feels bad.

708
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,590
It just hurts your feelings.

709
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,760
He did a good job though.

710
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,030
- This is pretty.
- Okay.

711
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,640
- Feel them.
- Didn't I succeed?

712
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,940
- No.
- These are the marbles.

713
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,410
Who's up next?

714
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,910
- I'll go next.
- I'll go next.

715
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,570
- I'll go next.
- I'll go next.

716
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,070
I'm ready now, so I'll go first.

717
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,920
You should stomp your feet hard.

718
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,950
You're right.

719
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,480
Jae Suk, you should
start immediately.

720
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,550
(He's tried it before,
so he gets ready quickly.)

721
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,510
- All right. Here I go.
- Let's go.

722
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,480
Will he make it to
the whipped cream?

723
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,550
Let's go.

724
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,320
(Jae Suk got the hang of it
after his practice. What about now?)

725
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,020
(He commits a foul.)

726
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,370
(With Kwang Soo's assist,)

727
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,870
(the cart hits the wall.)

728
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,140
Oh no.

729
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,870
(He just committed a foul
by force of habit.)

730
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,380
Gosh, this is...

731
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,140
What's that?

732
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,300
- Oh no.
- Gosh, this is...

733
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,720
(The grasshopper is
covered with whipped cream.)

734
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,770
(That's ugly.)

735
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,080
You pushed it too hard.

736
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,340
What's that?

737
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,010
You pushed it too hard.

738
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,620
(The whipped cream pack
is good for skin-brightening.)

739
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,160
You can't do that already.

740
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,280
What should the rest
of the members do now?

741
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,520
(I think someone just pushed me.)

742
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,660
- You can't do that already.
- Are you all right?

743
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,970
(The victim is quiet while
the assailant has a lot to say.)

744
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,900
You shouldn't have
pushed it too hard.

745
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,260
It splattered all over.

746
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,590
It was too hard.

747
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,560
What should the rest
of the members do now?

748
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,180
- Hey.
- You pushed it too hard.

749
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,110
Didn't someone kick the cart?

750
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,110
You pushed it too hard.

751
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,800
You should've done it in moderation.

752
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,540
I mean, I thought...

753
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,980
I pushed it at the speed of Mach.

754
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,980
(He slid into outer space
through the stratosphere.)

755
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,310
- You just pushed it too hard.
- It exceeded the speed of sound.

756
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,960
(He experienced the speed of light.)

757
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,580
- It was fast, wasn't it?
- He's really strong.

758
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,980
Didn't someone push it?

759
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,130
- It just feels that way.
- You have strong legs.

760
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,200
Gosh, I'm afraid to go next.

761
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Suk Jin.

762
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,940
We shouldn't commit
a foul anymore.

763
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,730
- "Anymore"?
- We can't play the game this way.

764
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,110
We can't play the game.

765
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,330
- No one should stand close.
- We should play the game.

766
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,680
I think someone kicked me.

767
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,710
Me?

768
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,950
Ji Hyo, did someone kick me?

769
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,380
No. You just pushed it yourself.

770
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,570
Is it just my feeling?

771
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,510
- It's your feeling.
- You just feel that way.

772
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,650
I think someone kicked it.

773
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,890
No, you pushed it too hard.

774
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,150
- Really?
- It was really hard.

775
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,550
- Did I push it too hard?
- Yes.

776
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,010
So you mean it's my fault.

777
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,890
How many times
do you have to ask that?

778
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,580
Next up is Suk Jin.

779
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,250
I feel sad as I see him
lie down on here.

780
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,060
Eternal youth.

781
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,430
I hope you live young forever.

782
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,760
You need to kick a little hard
to succeed.

783
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,140
- Okay. Got it.
- Okay.

784
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,830
It's hard to reach the wall. See?

785
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,030
(Will he succeed just like this?)

786
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,610
(Pushing the cart)

787
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,040
(Rapid acceleration)

788
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,410
Oh, no. That was so close.

789
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,950
(He couldn't hold back
and cheated again.)

790
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,780
Oh, no. That was so close.

791
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,240
(Whipped cream fell.)

792
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,580
He almost succeeded.

793
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,050
- Is this how we'll play this game?
- Come on, Jae Suk.

794
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,520
- Really?
- What's the point?

795
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
I'll just volunteer to get
the whipped cream on my face.

796
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,990
That's a shame.

797
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,750
I didn't know it was
a downward slope from here.

798
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,260
Oh, I think you're right.

799
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,020
It must be sloped here.

800
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,760
- It's flat. Trust me.
- It seems...

801
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,790
Did you push me?

802
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,800
No, I didn't push you.
I was standing over here.

803
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,030
- Really?
- You kicked too hard.

804
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,030
Hold on. We can't...

805
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,710
Let's all sit on the cart
from now on.

806
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,710
- Right. That's a good idea.
- Someone pushed me, right?

807
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,110
- Hey, someone...
- This isn't fair.

808
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,810
- He did kick hard.
- Did someone push me?

809
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,650
- No one pushed you.
- Suk Jin.

810
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,010
- Are you sure?
- Sorry?

811
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,690
- You kicked hard, Suk Jin.
- Did someone push me?

812
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,890
By the way, my hunch was right.

813
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,860
I didn't know why,
but I wanted to go first.

814
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,780
- Exactly.
- Isn't it strange?

815
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,790
- Right? It's strange.
- He kicked too hard.

816
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,730
Did no one push me?
I think someone pushed me.

817
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,870
I can't get mad
because I'm not sure.

818
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,990
Suk Jin, you never lose
your temper.

819
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,000
That's true.

820
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
True.

821
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,500
- He never gets angry. It's amazing.
- Exactly.

822
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,070
- I wonder why.
- Why do you not feel anger?

823
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,300
If I were him, I would've
gotten angry earlier at the opening.

824
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,340
Suk Jin would never get angry
over things like that.

825
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,650
- You see...
- He has a big heart.

826
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,070
- It's not that I hold back...
- Let's keep provoking him.

827
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,740
- my anger. I don't feel anger.
- Let's make him angry.

828
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,920
He has such a big heart.

829
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,250
He plays along with any jokes.
He's great.

830
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,160
I would've thrown my coat
and made a scene.

831
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,980
He's so cool. I would've sworn
harshly at everyone.

832
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,790
- He's a man with good manners.
- Indeed.

833
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,130
- He really has a big heart.
- Absolutely.

834
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,060
- You know I didn't get angry.
- Of course, we know.

835
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,900
- I wasn't angry earlier.
- He's so cool.

836
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,760
(He never swears or throws his coat
on the floor because he's angry.)

837
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,330
(He never kicks a chair
because he's angry.)

838
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,770
I just did it to make you laugh.

839
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,230
- I know.
- He should publish a book.

840
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,340
- Are Suk Jin and Jae Suk out?
- Yes.

841
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,150
- Hang on.
- Can't you give us another chance?

842
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,840
It's because you guys tried it
in the beginning.

843
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,040
You can give us
a disadvantage instead.

844
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,840
- Deduct our score, for example.
- Sit down, will you?

845
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,510
Jae Suk, we'll give you
another chance if you want.

846
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,050
- I'll try again.
- Because there was cheating.

847
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,390
Didn't anyone really do anything
when I tried it?

848
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,730
- No.
- No one did anything.

849
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,930
- Be honest with me.
- You should kick hard, Se Chan.

850
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,090
Are you serious or what?

851
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,490
Honestly, I'm not sure.

852
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,790
There wasn't cheating.

853
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,430
I guess there was.
There was cheating.

854
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,730
I didn't see anything.

855
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,730
If Bo Pil says he didn't see it,
he didn't see it.

856
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,140
Next up is Song Jeoktoma.

857
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,000
Here comes Song Jeoktoma.

858
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,980
She said,
"Here comes Song Jeoktoma."

859
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,000
She called herself Song Jeoktoma.

860
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,450
- That's good, Song Jeoktoma.
- She's so funny these days.

861
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,310
- Song Jeoktoma, good job.
- Where? Here?

862
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,310
Right, Song Jeoktoma. Let's go.

863
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,580
Push it hard, Ji Hyo.

864
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,320
- Hard? Should I push it hard?
- Yes.

865
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,050
- Ji Hyo, this isn't a practice run.
- Okay.

866
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,130
(Song Jeoktoma who runs forward
carries everyone's expectation.)

867
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,430
- Go, Song Jeoktoma!
- Ji Hyo, kick hard.

868
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,900
- Here goes Song Jeoktoma.
- Kick hard.

869
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
(Song Jeoktoma runs!)

870
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,440
(Where will Song Jeoktoma arrive?)

871
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,670
- Gosh.
- Oh, boy.

872
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,500
She'll stop at the water balloon.
She's the first.

873
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,530
She got the water balloon.

874
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,740
Gosh.

875
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,340
- Song Jeoktoma.
- It's a water balloon.

876
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,180
(The water fell right on her belly.)

877
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,920
- Hey, Song Jeoktoma.
- The water fell on her belly.

878
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,040
- On her belly.
- That was funny.

879
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,420
- Gosh. My belly...
- I told you to kick hard.

880
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,080
- It fell on her belly.
- Song Jeoktoma.

881
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,420
- It fell on her belly.
- It hit her belly.

882
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,580
- It hit my belly.
- I know.

883
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,050
- Did you hear the sound?
- Song Jeoktoma.

884
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,430
It fell right on my belly.

885
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,700
Good job.

886
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,760
(Following Ji Hyo,
Se Chan, Haha, and So Min tried!)

887
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,790
No way.

888
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,230
(Only Se Chan reached
the yellow zone.)

889
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,640
(Haha stopped in the green zone
and came in 2nd.)

890
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,700
Did he succeed?

891
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,640
If Kwang Soo succeeds,

892
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,610
the 1st and 2nd places
may be changed.

893
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,330
(He's lying down on the cart
bending his knees.)

894
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,530
It feels...

895
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,410
- Kwang Soo, go down a little.
- Go down.

896
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,610
- Go down.
- A little more.

897
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,380
Kwang Soo, go down. Go down.

898
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,540
- Hey, stop it.
- Go down.

899
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,120
- I'm just giving him a signal.
- That's enough.

900
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,810
- I'm just giving him a signal.
- Stop it.

901
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,620
- To tell him to go down.
- Stop it.

902
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,160
- That's enough.
- Darn it.

903
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,820
- Okay. You're almost there.
- Stop it.

904
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,820
You're almost there. Okay.

905
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,320
- Kwang Soo, come up a little.
- What?

906
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,750
Move up a little.

907
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,200
- Go back down.
- Gosh. What are you doing?

908
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,440
- Go down.
- We're trying to help you.

909
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,410
- So you won't hurt your head.
- Exactly.

910
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,730
- They're helping you.
- You should trust us.

911
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,530
- All right.
- Kick harder than you think.

912
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,710
Whenever you're ready.

913
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,070
- Trust me.
- Kwang Soo, kick hard.

914
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,180
(If he succeeds, he and Se Chan
will get to spin the wheel.)

915
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,610
I have a feeling that he'll succeed.

916
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,180
- Me too.
- I think he'll do a good job.

917
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,270
You may begin.

918
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,280
(Stretching out his legs)

919
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,420
- That's good.
- Because he has long legs,

920
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,480
he's at an advantage.

921
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,420
Look at him.
Because he has long legs...

922
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,580
He looks so ugly.
His face is annoying.

923
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,780
My gosh.

924
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,590
Kwang Soo has
a well-proportioned body.

925
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,820
(How well could he do using his
optimal physical condition?)

926
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,970
(Kwang Soo started moving
by kicking the board hard.)

927
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,530
(Will he continue the momentum
and succeed?)

928
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,950
Goodbye.

929
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,650
(Whipped cream fell on his face.)

930
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,950
(The whipped cream hit the mark.)

931
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,120
How could it fall right on his face?

932
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,580
It fell right on the target.

933
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,780
That was perfect.

934
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,250
- It was placed in the right spot.
- Nice.

935
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,580
- Good shot.
- Kwang Soo, go back to your seat.

936
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,860
Good shot.

937
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,250
You did such a great job, Kwang Soo.

938
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,320
- Go on.
- I did that, right?

939
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,790
- Yes. You did it perfectly.
- Yes. No one touched you.

940
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,520
- I'm next.
- Now...

941
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,140
Oh, right. Jae Suk will try again.
Okay.

942
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,530
- Right.
- We'll give you another chance.

943
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,170
- Of course.
- It wouldn't be fair.

944
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,060
- We won't touch you.
- Right.

945
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,500
He's a cool guy.

946
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,910
Here. You should wear a nose clip.

947
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,240
Hey, I don't need it.

948
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,740
- Hey, that's okay.
- Really?

949
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,010
- You're such a weakling.
- But if whipped cream...

950
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,540
- Stop it.
- Your nose will run.

951
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,620
- Your nose will run.
- I don't care.

952
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,920
Jae Suk, go down.

953
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,310
- After the shoot, he'll say,
- Go down.

954
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,580
- "The cream keeps coming out."
- Go down already.

955
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,730
- Go down. Come on.
- Hurry up and go down.

956
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,130
- Go down. Put your head on it.
- Your head.

957
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,900
- Go down more.
- A little more.

958
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,320
- Okay.
- Good.

959
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,020
- Okay.
- Watch me.

960
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,430
- Are you ready?
- Go, Jae Suk.

961
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,630
Show everyone your accuracy.

962
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,330
- Watch how I do this.
- That's great.

963
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,030
Let's go. Oh, my.
He looks so skillful.

964
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,730
- I think he's calculating.
- Watch me.

965
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,000
- Watch me closely.
- Is he calculating?

966
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,180
- Watch me.
- He's playing with the cart.

967
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,070
- Watch this. Watch how I do this.
- He's playing with it.

968
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,500
- Here he goes.
- Watch me.

969
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,950
Let's go. Bounce off of it.
1, 2, 3. Go.

970
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,770
Here I go.

971
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,840
(Here I go.)

972
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,420
(How well will Korea's best MC
who focuses on laugh do?)

973
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,390
- Come on.
- What's that, Jae Suk?

974
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,160
- Come on.
- That's disappointing.

975
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,790
(Calm and quiet)

976
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,430
What's this? It's neither funny
nor impressive.

977
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,320
- That's disappointing.
- Try again.

978
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,260
- What was that?
- Gosh.

979
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,530
- He's the Grand Award winner.
- He said...

980
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,830
(He only pursued laughter,
but he failed to make people laugh.)

981
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm so disappointed.

982
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,770
- Neither whipped cream nor success.
- It's hard to get what you want.

983
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,950
It was boring.

984
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,500
Why did he have to try again
if he would make it so boring?

985
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,980
He's disappointed in himself.

986
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,540
- Gosh.
- I'm so upset right now.

987
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,980
- Oh, man.
- It wasn't funny or impressive.

988
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,890
- Jae Suk failed.
- Is someone in there?

989
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,160
Bo Pil, edit this part out.

990
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,520
(The 1st mission ended
as he asked to edit his part out.)

991
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,700
Gosh. That was disappointing.

992
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,630
I'll announce the result.

993
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,400
- Se Chan is in the first place.
- Oh, yes!

994
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,260
- Haha is in second place.
- All right!

995
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,590
Let's move to the next location
to continue the second mission.

996
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,830
- Okay.
- It was disappointing.

997
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,610
- Shall I call your stylist?
- Hey, can you...

998
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,040
Can you bring
a fresh team uniform...

999
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,720
and a T-shirt to wear under it?

1000
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,450
Because it's wet. Hurry up.
Thank you. Okay.

1001
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,420
- It's sticky.
- Do we have extra uniforms?

1002
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,750
I'll call your stylist again
to tell her to come back.

1003
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,690
- What did you say?
- Come again?

1004
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,130
- Who pushed you?
- I heard that you pushed me.

1005
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,020
- Yes, I pushed you at the end.
- I know.

1006
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,990
Who pushed me? Was it Kwang Soo?

1007
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,060
Yes, Kwang Soo did it.

1008
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,870
(They're passing time again
confirming the truth.)

1009
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,900
It looks like your stylists...

1010
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,730
stepped out together
and are coming back now.

1011
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,230
- They'll be back in 5 minutes.
- 5 minutes?

1012
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,540
- Really? We should wait then.
- Yes.

1013
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,720
(So they started to wait again.)

1014
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,270
- I didn't know.
- I was surprised...

1015
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,240
Or would you like to continue
dressing like that?

1016
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,510
Like this?

1017
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,620
(Like this?)

1018
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,120
Hey... My gosh.

1019
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,960
- I wouldn't mind, but...
- Don't they look pitiful?

1020
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
- Hey!
- Don't we look awful?

1021
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,520
- You guys look great.
- Wearing this stained shirt?

1022
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,900
- But you look great in it.
- Answer me.

1023
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,970
- My gosh. We...
- Then can I borrow a towel?

1024
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,790
- To cover the neckline?
- Okay. All right. Let's do this.

1025
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,170
- You guys look great.
- Let's do this.

1026
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,940
- You look great.
- Those shows you direct.

1027
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,640
I'll see how successful
they will be.

1028
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,710
It's not like that.

1029
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,230
You want me to be on the show
when it has yellow stains?

1030
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,040
You're on Running Man,
so put on your running shirt.

1031
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,800
- "Running Shirt Man".
- Gosh.

1032
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,540
- "Running Shirt Man".
- Did you throw up while lying down?

1033
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,420
- Why is your shirt clean?
- The clothes are here.

1034
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,480
They're here.

1035
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,890
Where have you been?

1036
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,780
- Why hasn't my stylist come yet?
- I brought you fresh clothes.

1037
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,050
Where have you been?

1038
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,080
I'm worried.

1039
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,520
Could I be the only one
without fresh clothes?

1040
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,730
Suk Jin, you should...

1041
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,320
I'll change my clothes
so we can start the shoot.

1042
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,590
- Wait.
- Run, Jae Suk.

1043
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,020
Let's hurry up
before Suk Jin's stylist comes.

1044
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,030
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Change your clothes.

1045
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,200
- Hurry up and give me the shirt.
- I look like a beggar.

1046
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,140
Let's hurry up.

1047
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,710
I should hurry up to prevent
Suk Jin from changing his clothes.

1048
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,230
This is driving me crazy.

1049
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,000
- Hurry up!
- What did you do?

1050
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,980
(He opened the door
and got surprised.)

1051
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,450
- Come here.
- Ji Hyo is in there?

1052
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,150
What is wrong with you?

1053
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,420
- Ji Hyo is in that room, Jae Suk.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

1054
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,980
Jae Suk, why did you come in?

1055
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,820
- You're unbelievable.
- You startled me.

1056
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,230
- What's wrong with you?
- Goofball.

1057
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,160
- Are you out of your mind?
- You punk!

1058
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,900
- Beat him up!
- Come here.

1059
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,700
We should teach him a lesson.

1060
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,200
- She had her clothes on.
- We'll punish you.

1061
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,790
- Why did you do that?
- Playful Child.

1062
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,700
- He screamed after a long time.
- I'm relieved, Ji Hyo.

1063
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,170
- He startled me.
- Ji Hyo, I'm relieved.

1064
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,330
- You startled me.
- She had finished changing clothes.

1065
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,030
- Gosh, seriously.
- He hasn't screamed like that...

1066
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,570
- in a while.
- He screamed when he opened it.

1067
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,650
(Screaming)

1068
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,950
What did you do?

1069
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,010
(Goofball may be playful,
but he has a pure heart.)

1070
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,720
I was the one who should be
screaming, but he screamed.

1071
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,920
(It was so funny.)

1072
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,960
(Meanwhile...)

1073
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,780
- Gosh, Goofball.
- What is taking my stylist so long?

1074
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,520
Suk Jin, why are you wearing
a cartridge belt during a shoot?

1075
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,430
- Oh, this is...
- Let's begin the shoot.

1076
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,170
- I need to change my clothes too.
- He's wearing a cartridge belt.

1077
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,260
- Kwang Soo, isn't that my shirt?
- My stylist, where are you?

1078
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,530
(The white T-shirt war
between Kwang Soo and Suk Jin)

1079
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,900
Suk Jin, your uniform just arrived.

1080
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,030
What is it?
This is what I wore earlier.

1081
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,710
- Just put it on.
- My stylist!

1082
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,650
Just put it on, Suk Jin.
We'll begin the shoot now.

1083
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,510
- Where are you, my stylist?
- Let's go.

1084
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,340
- Where are you?
- Let's begin.

1085
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,440
- Wait. I haven't changed...
- Good. The semi-real variety show.

1086
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,610
- That's great.
- This is a semi-real variety show.

1087
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,510
This is unfair.
You guys changed your clothes.

1088
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,010
- That's why I told you to wear it.
- My stylist!

1089
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,630
- The next mission is...
- Excuse me.

1090
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,820
(The next mission is...)

1091
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,530
(Suk Jin got surprised.)

1092
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:42,630
- Hey...
- The semi-real variety show!

1093
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,360
- This...
- Suk Jin, wait.

1094
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,740
- This is true entertainment.
- Nice.

1095
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,900
- Nicely done.
- Right?

1096
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,090
This is of a similar color.

1097
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,670
It's Chan Hee's.

1098
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,260
- But...
- There you go.

1099
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,800
Unbelievable.

1100
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,780
(An edgy style is accomplished
thanks to his friend Chan Hee.)

1101
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,150
I love it.

1102
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,940
- But...
- I love it.

1103
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,440
I look like an old man
who lives alone.

1104
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,510
I love it.

1105
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,940
- Live forever, Suk Jin.
- Nice.

1106
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,090
What's that?

1107
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,090
- It suits you.
- Live forever, Suk Jin.

1108
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,210
It suits him, doesn't it?

1109
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,460
It's time to spin the wheel
for the first time.

1110
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,550
Se Chan and Haha,
you will spin the wheel.

1111
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,400
If the wheel...

1112
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,300
lands on the section
labeled "swap name",

1113
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,570
you'll swap others' names for yours
on the big wheel.

1114
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,110
The one that says
"absorb all seven names"...

1115
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,880
means that you can swap out
one of their names each...

1116
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,010
for your own.

1117
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,050
Land on "2 left and 2 right
of the selected",

1118
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,650
and you'll be able...

1119
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,820
to swap the name
in which the big wheel lands on...

1120
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,170
as well as 2 on its left
and 2 on its right.

1121
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,210
Some will land you
at a disadvantage though.

1122
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,010
If you're told to add the name
of the worst member,

1123
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,920
the worst member
you selected earlier today...

1124
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,630
will have his or her name
replaced with yours.

1125
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,090
Suk Jin, stop trying to look good.

1126
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,030
- Wear it like you did earlier.
- Why?

1127
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,070
Why did you make it look cool?

1128
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,670
I had it on backward earlier.

1129
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,130
The tag was on the outside.

1130
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,880
- Gosh.
- Are you all right?

1131
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,670
- Are you okay?
- No, and it's no thanks to you.

1132
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,980
I can still smell the whipped cream.

1133
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,710
You should just head home today.

1134
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,820
I will if you do.

1135
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,940
- Go home.
- Haha, you're up first.

1136
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,050
Okay, let's do this.

1137
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,280
- Here we go.
- Sure.

1138
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:16,530
(Haha can win the chance to change
up to seven slots with his name.)

1139
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,130
(It can elevate
one's chance of winning.)

1140
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,420
Let it be the worst one.

1141
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,820
(It can elevate
one's chance of winning.)

1142
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,030
Okay, here we go.

1143
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,400
No way. Not that one.

1144
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,690
(Which will it land on?)

1145
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,860
Is it mine?

1146
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,490
(He gets to change
three slots in his name.)

1147
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,360
Three slots in my name!

1148
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,880
(Everyone's disappointed.)

1149
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,170
- How boring.
- Could it be more boring?

1150
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,940
- He got one of the best ones.
- How bland.

1151
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,440
Swap out the names
of the ones you hate.

1152
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,340
- You've gotten all boring.
- The one you hate.

1153
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,980
Yes, the one I hate.

1154
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,590
Why would that be me?

1155
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,380
You called me Mr. Dirty Mustache.

1156
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,550
- He's right.
- Darn it.

1157
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,420
Mr. Dirty Mustache!

1158
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,630
- Yes, take out Se Chan's name.
- Right.

1159
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,300
- Take out Se Chan's name.
- He called me B-rated.

1160
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,170
There's one over here.

1161
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,920
- No, it's better over here.
- Of course.

1162
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,360
- Why are you taking out my name?
- Of course, he should.

1163
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Se Chan, go!

1164
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,010
- Go.
- Let's go.

1165
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,760
Nice!

1166
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,240
Go round and round.

1167
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,440
Land on the one with seven slots.

1168
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,570
That's what you'd expect
from a comedian.

1169
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,420
Go round and round.

1170
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,670
(Every moment is exaggerated.)

1171
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,780
Did you see that?

1172
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,490
- He's just like Se Hyeong.
- You're more like Boom.

1173
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,550
(Which slot will it land on?)

1174
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,090
- No, not that one.
- Just one slot!

1175
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,150
(He gets to change one slot
which is even more boring.)

1176
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,260
He only gets to change one slot.

1177
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,800
- This is what I get for winning?
- Nice.

1178
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,420
Take one of Haha's slots.

1179
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,740
But it's better to have
my name up here.

1180
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,740
Why would you take my slot?

1181
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,990
Of course, he should.

1182
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,740
Suk Jin's the one you hate.

1183
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,840
- Right.
- Take both off.

1184
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,210
Why would you take my slot?

1185
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,630
- Take Haha's.
- He has the most right now.

1186
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,070
Haha has the most.

1187
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,440
- Is this you being angry?
- Of course not.

1188
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,610
"Of course not."

1189
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,010
That was never the case.

1190
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,320
- I'll take this one.
- That's the correct choice.

1191
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,420
Don't listen to others
and go with your gut.

1192
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,610
- Okay.
- All right. Nicely done.

1193
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,650
(Se Chan takes the slot
that Suk Jin currently occupied.)

1194
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,380
- How are we supposed to sit?
- What's this?

1195
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,690
We should sit in two rows.

1196
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,260
Here's the last game.

1197
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,820
Just like the previous games,

1198
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,960
this one will require your wits,

1199
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,030
your concentration, and gut feeling.

1200
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,260
- Again?
- Concentration too?

1201
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,030
This is
the Joint Responsibility Quiz.

1202
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,530
- Joint Responsibility Quiz?
- A quiz?

1203
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,960
- A quiz?
- I'm doomed.

1204
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,530
- Gosh...
- Okay!

1205
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,940
- Hold on.
- All right!

1206
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,900
Don't touch me.

1207
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,010
I'll make him be more active.

1208
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,650
Okay!

1209
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,710
He's showing more excitement now.

1210
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,780
- That's the spirit.
- Let's do this.

1211
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,710
None of this makes me angry.

1212
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,960
- Okay!
- Get him excited.

1213
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,960
- I'll get him to be more active.
- All right.

1214
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,490
(Playing the air guitar)

1215
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,990
Like this.

1216
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,730
(Suk Jin becomes a human guitar.)

1217
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,760
(Big Brother Big Nose
turns 60 soon.)

1218
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,800
That tickles!

1219
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,340
Suk Jin's loving it.

1220
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,670
That tickles!

1221
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,130
(Big Nose enjoys his new character.)

1222
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,670
- There. You're all good.
- You can sit back up.

1223
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,900
- You're to stay later on.
- All right.

1224
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,070
Why are you only
saying that to me though?

1225
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,280
Jong Kook can just go.

1226
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,550
The last game...

1227
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,940
will be played in groups of 2.

1228
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
You and your partner
will answer the questions...

1229
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,940
given by the staff.

1230
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,610
Get it right
and you'll earn 10 points.

1231
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,490
The team with the highest score
will win this game...

1232
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,530
and get a chance to spin the wheel.

1233
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,460
I should at least
get a chance to spin it.

1234
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,050
Team play is required, right?

1235
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,260
So we must answer one each.

1236
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,760
I won't be favored then.

1237
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,400
You can't discuss with your partner,

1238
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,590
so choose your partner wisely.

1239
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,440
- We'll select the teams then.
- Sure.

1240
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,340
We ranked you...

1241
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,800
by how well you did
on the quizzes...

1242
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,900
throughout 2020 on Running Man.

1243
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,150
- Really?
- You never know.

1244
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,150
I'll reveal the ranking
starting from up top,

1245
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,740
so raise your hand if you wish
to partner up with that person.

1246
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,240
The person will choose
who he or she wants as a partner.

1247
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
- Okay.
- Good.

1248
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,190
Let me reveal
who had the highest score.

1249
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,690
I should raise my hand every time.

1250
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,280
Getting the most answers
on quizzes in 2020 was...

1251
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,650
It has to be Jae Suk.

1252
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,800
(2020 Running Man Quiz, 1st place)

1253
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,460
(Here are the candidates.)

1254
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,240
(Hyeongseoljigong...)

1255
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,940
(Something complex)

1256
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,460
(A complex area?)

1257
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,510
(He's demonstrating
hyeongseoljigong right now.)

1258
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,070
I mean...

1259
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,880
(During the proverb quiz)

1260
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,110
(Quail eggs)

1261
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,940
(Pure and innocent)

1262
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,590
(And you'll make it out alive.)

1263
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,280
(Be a nutjob?)

1264
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,150
(Despite their lack of knowledge,)

1265
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,030
(we still saw hope in 2020.)

1266
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,320
Getting the most answers
on quizzes in 2020 was...

1267
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,630
It has to be Jae Suk.

1268
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:14,800
- It's Yoo Jae Suk.
- Okay.

1269
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,860
Me!

1270
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,090
- It's Yoo Jae Suk.
- Okay.

1271
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,400
(Everyone raises their hand.)

1272
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,670
Everyone raised their hand.

1273
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,740
Suk Jin...

1274
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,860
- Everyone raised their hand.
- Me.

1275
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,170
(Reluctantly)

1276
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,340
Suk Jin reluctantly
raised his hand.

1277
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,240
Suk Jin raised his hand too late.

1278
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,380
That can happen, you know.

1279
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,510
He was late to raise his hand.

1280
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,440
Suk Jin raised his hand late.

1281
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,280
- That can happen, you know.
- It can't.

1282
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,740
- Suk Jin, lower your hand.
- Lower it.

1283
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,110
- Lower your hand.
- We all raised ours instantly.

1284
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,420
I raised it before
hearing your name.

1285
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,610
Our team will be too hard to beat.

1286
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,050
- We shouldn't team up.
- Exactly.

1287
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,920
Jong Kook is on the smarter side,

1288
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,090
- so we shouldn't team up.
- But...

1289
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,650
I'll probably win
if I team up with Jong Kook.

1290
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,260
- That's a high possibility.
- We'll be unbeatable.

1291
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,400
You should take him then.

1292
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,690
- 1 or 2...
- It makes better sense.

1293
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,740
Take me or Ms. Toma.

1294
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,070
Ms. Toma or...

1295
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,110
I should team up Ssaebssaeb,

1296
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,010
- Ms. Toma, or...
- Kwang Soo.

1297
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,840
- I'm not as bad as them.
- Or Haha.

1298
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,340
- But...
- I'm not as bad as them.

1299
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,800
There's also Haha.

1300
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,240
- What about So Min?
- He's not as bad.

1301
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,780
- And Haha.
- He's not as bad.

1302
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,550
It'll be either
Ssaebssaeb or Kwang Soo.

1303
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,420
Kwang Soo isn't as bad,

1304
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,380
- so take Empty Head.
- Empty Head?

1305
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,860
- How cool of you.
- Empty!

1306
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,280
I love your confidence.

1307
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,420
Shouldn't you take me with you?

1308
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,130
Team up with me,

1309
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,800
and if I get to swap five slots...

1310
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,420
(If I get to swap five slots...)

1311
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,730
Three?

1312
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,730
(Quiet!)

1313
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,670
Take Se Chan instead.

1314
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,990
I was wrong just now.

1315
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,460
(Jong Kook's touch
had him lower his hand.)

1316
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,440
I need to take a short break.

1317
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,940
I need to rest a bit.

1318
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,240
Okay, raise your hand!

1319
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,820
- 1, 2, 3.
- Me!

1320
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,480
- I'll take Se Chan then.
- Okay!

1321
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,940
Why didn't you raise your hand?

1322
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,110
- Why can't you raise your hand?
- You should've raised it.

1323
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,780
- Kwang Soo...
- Call me Kim Jong Kook.

1324
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,380
- I choose Se Chan.
- Okay.

1325
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,420
(Pouty Mouth Brothers unite!)

1326
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,050
I want to team up with Suk Jin.

1327
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,760
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

1328
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,130
I want to team up with Suk Jin too.

1329
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,230
I want to team up with Suk Jin.

1330
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,260
I want Suk Jin as my partner.

1331
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,190
(Big Nose thinks about
who he should pick.)

1332
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,260
In second place...

1333
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,570
is Jong Kook.

1334
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,110
(Embarrassed)

1335
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,130
Why did you stand up?

1336
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,010
Why on earth did you stand up?

1337
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,300
- Sit back down.
- His legs must be numb.

1338
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,740
I don't understand why you stood up.

1339
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,980
Director Choi.

1340
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,340
- Sit back down.
- Are you sure he's in second place?

1341
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,210
We counted all of the questions.

1342
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,210
- But...
- This is hilarious.

1343
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,650
Why did you stand up?

1344
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,320
In third place...

1345
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,860
- is So Min.
- What?

1346
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,030
- I'm in third place?
- Really?

1347
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,280
Are you sure
you counted this correctly?

1348
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,920
- I'm in third place?
- Are you kidding me?

1349
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,460
- Me?
- Hold on.

1350
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:30,030
I remember her getting
a lot of them correct.

1351
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,360
- Suk Jin's in fourth place.
- That's not so bad.

1352
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,570
Haha's in fifth place.

1353
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,300
In sixth place is Kwang Soo.

1354
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,300
In seventh place is Ji Hyo.

1355
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,710
And in eighth place is Se Chan.

1356
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,440
Why? I already knew.

1357
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,670
Se Chan's in eighth place?

1358
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,110
Jae Suk, isn't it obvious?

1359
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,800
Don't pretend to be okay with this.

1360
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,610
- What do you mean? I'm fine.
- You're upset with the result.

1361
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,320
Why am I in third place though?

1362
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,210
- I...
- Se Chan, my gosh.

1363
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,920
- I...
- So raise your hand if you want...

1364
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,380
to team up with Jong Kook.

1365
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,420
(Those who wish to be on Jong Kook's
team will raise their hand.)

1366
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,780
If you want
to team up with Jong Kook.

1367
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,050
(He's in demand.)

1368
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,650
- Because...
- Teaming up with me though...

1369
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,030
- Suk Jin.
- We'll be a tough team to beat.

1370
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,130
Don't choose those
of a higher ranking.

1371
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,170
Come on.

1372
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,820
He's right. Don't choose
anyone of a higher ranking.

1373
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,630
- Then...
- Choose someone in the bottom.

1374
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,710
The one in third place
should give others a chance.

1375
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,170
- I'll swap for you.
- Hold on.

1376
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,440
- Choose one of these two.
- Exactly.

1377
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,710
Either Kwang Soo or Ji Hyo.

1378
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,210
These two are my only choice?

1379
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,210
Kwang Soo or Ji Hyo.

1380
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,800
Choosing Ji Hyo will humiliate me.

1381
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,610
Jong Kook, I got Jeoktoma right.

1382
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,710
(She makes him know that
she got Jeoktoma right.)

1383
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:23,820
- Jeoktoma?
- Jeoktoma!

1384
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,550
That's what you're bragging about?

1385
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,760
- Why can't I?
- "I got Jeoktoma right."

1386
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,880
That happened weeks ago though.

1387
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,630
Team up with Mr. Mullet.

1388
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,230
- Okay, I'll take him.
- Okay!

1389
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,530
It's a good choice.

1390
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,460
Please put on your vests
and sit in rows.

1391
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,070
All right.

1392
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,190
- Let's go.
- All right.

1393
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,670
Out of the many categories,

1394
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,960
- I'll reveal the first one.
- Sure.

1395
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,630
The first...

1396
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,880
- will be the song quiz.
- Yes!

1397
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,400
- I love quizzes like these.
- You're good at this, right?

1398
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,480
Yes, I am.

1399
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,110
- I'll count on you then.
- Two songs will play...

1400
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,610
and you will name
the artists and titles respectively.

1401
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:59,460
You will hear three seconds
of the first song's intro...

1402
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,010
and then three seconds
of the second song's outro.

1403
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,190
- The outro of the second song?
- Yes.

1404
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,190
The intro and outro will be...

1405
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,360
from two different songs.

1406
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,990
When you say that you'll answer,

1407
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,730
I'll choose the one
who'll answer first.

1408
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:12,900
- Randomly?
- Yes.

1409
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,900
You will name the two songs...

1410
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,460
- in that order.
- Okay.

1411
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,860
Artist or title?

1412
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,110
The first one is to name
the first song.

1413
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,710
(The Pirate Roulette Game
seems to have a purpose.)

1414
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,110
- It must have a purpose.
- It seems that way.

1415
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,380
We don't know...

1416
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,480
- who he'll pick first.
- All right!

1417
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,510
The first song must be named first.

1418
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,920
Here's the first song.

1419
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,990
(The first round begins.)

1420
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:31,990
Cue.

1421
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,150
(The intro of song A)

1422
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,590
(The outro of song B)

1423
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:35,860
- Let me answer!
- Okay.

1424
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,550
(The intro of song A)

1425
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:38,920
(The outro of song B)

1426
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,650
(The two partners must name
song A and song B correctly.)

1427
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,360
- I don't know the second song.
- Let me answer.

1428
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,460
Ji Hyo.

1429
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,530
"Beautiful Restriction"
by Kim Jong Seo.

1430
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,960
PSY's... You know, this dance...

1431
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,340
- Wrong.
- Let me answer.

1432
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,760
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1433
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,480
- We were faster.
- Let me answer.

1434
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,530
What's the song title, Ji Hyo?

1435
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,110
- We were faster.
- Let me answer.

1436
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,070
"Beautiful Restriction"
by Kim Jong Seo.

1437
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,280
"New Face" by PSY.

1438
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,070
- Let me answer.
- Wrong? Really?

1439
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,480
"New Face" by PSY.

1440
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,150
(Is it not "New Face"?)

1441
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,690
"Gangnam Style" by PSY.

1442
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,610
- Let me answer.
- Wrong?

1443
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,050
("Gangnam Style" by PSY)

1444
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,730
- Kim... You said the wrong one.
- Let me answer.

1445
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,400
"Beautiful Restriction"
by Kim Jong Seo.

1446
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,860
(Team Yellow got a chance to say
the right answer they said.)

1447
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,190
"Beautiful Restriction"
by Kim Jong Seo.

1448
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:17,760
PSY's "Gangnam Style".

1449
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,920
- No?
- Let me answer.

1450
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,360
Is the first song wrong?
No, I'm sure it's the one.

1451
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,960
No. We all got the first song right.

1452
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:23,740
We got it right.

1453
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,480
(I'm so lucky)

1454
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,280
(To have found you)

1455
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,840
(He's starting to dance.)

1456
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,150
The song was so popular.

1457
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,570
(He hummed the latter part.)

1458
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,840
We used to sing this song
whenever we went to a club.

1459
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,340
- We sang it so many times.
- Hold on.

1460
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,490
- The song ends like that.
- Exactly.

1461
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,010
- We danced to the song too.
- Yes, we did.

1462
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:42,190
- That's why.
<i>- A strange woman</i>

1463
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,380
- I think it's PSY's "New Face".
- I think so too.

1464
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,860
(The outro of "New Face")

1465
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,630
(The outros of Song B and "New Face"
are slightly different!)

1466
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,590
(The outro of Song B)

1467
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,300
- Let me answer.
- Isn't it "Gangnam Style"?

1468
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,300
Haha, you go first.

1469
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,740
PSY's "Face".

1470
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,800
- What?
- What's that song?

1471
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,260
You should've said
Kim Jong Seo's song.

1472
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,840
- Is it an old song?
- Let me answer.

1473
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,240
"Beautiful Restriction"
by Kim Jong Seo.

1474
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,610
PSY's...

1475
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,110
- "Hwitturu Matturu".
- "Hwitturu..." Gosh.

1476
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,280
Let me answer.

1477
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:09,650
(Whenever he puts out bait,
Kwang Soo takes it.)

1478
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:10,840
- Hey.
- Wait.

1479
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,050
Let me answer.

1480
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,420
(At that moment,
Suk Jin raised his hand again.)

1481
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,760
"Beautiful Restriction"
by Kim Jong Seo.

1482
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,760
What's the point
when I don't know the second song?

1483
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,820
Can we hear it again?

1484
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,550
- Let's hear it again.
- We need to hear it again.

1485
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,800
(Song B still remains a mystery.)

1486
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,400
(The songs will be played again.)

1487
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,460
- No.
- This is driving me nuts.

1488
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,900
(The songs are being played.)

1489
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,300
- I think it's the correct answer.
- Jae Suk.

1490
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,030
Let me answer.

1491
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,980
- Jae Suk.
- I heard off-beats.

1492
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:37,280
Let me answer.

1493
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,840
Do you know the answer?
Let me answer.

1494
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,940
Se Chan goes first.

1495
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,280
"Beautiful Restriction"
by Kim Jong Seo.

1496
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,740
PSY's "New Face".

1497
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,110
(He said "New Face" again.)

1498
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,210
What are you doing?

1499
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,010
Why did you even raise your hand
when you didn't know the answer?

1500
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,880
How many times did they tell us
it wasn't the answer?

1501
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,820
- Why did you do that?
- Why did you say the same song?

1502
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,860
If you didn't know the answer...

1503
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,860
They already told us
it wasn't the answer.

1504
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,320
I thought you knew the second song.

1505
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,760
- But he let me answer first.
- Hey.

1506
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,860
I still think
it's the correct answer.

1507
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,460
- Try to guess the song.
- I have no idea.

1508
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,490
It has been changed.

1509
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:03,630
- What are you two doing?
- They're discussing.

1510
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:04,710
That's not allowed.

1511
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,740
(They got caught right away.)

1512
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,300
- You shouldn't do that.
- Is it not allowed?

1513
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,900
- Hey, what are you doing nay?
- You knew that.

1514
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,150
"What are you doing nay?"

1515
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,980
(Hey, what are you doing nay?)

1516
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,320
- "What are you doing nay?"
- I mean, what are you doing now?

1517
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,190
- Pardon?
- You must've lost your mind.

1518
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,860
- "You must've lost your mind"?
- What did you say?

1519
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,110
Don't be disrespectful
to your senior comedian.

1520
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,590
- Why would you...
- You were whispering to each other.

1521
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,630
- Why would you speak thoughtlessly?
- I didn't speak thoughtlessly.

1522
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,320
Suk Jin, you've crossed the line.

1523
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,650
How dare you?

1524
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:29,920
(Playing with his glasses)

1525
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,670
(It's the best way
to stop a squabble.)

1526
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,260
- He played with my glasses.
- Come here.

1527
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,190
I hate it the most.
How dare you do that?

1528
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,210
- You've crossed the line.
- I hate it the most.

1529
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,300
- Is that so?
- How could you...

1530
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,400
(Jae Suk stopped the squabble
by touching his glasses.)

1531
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,070
- If you...
- Please sit down.

1532
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,880
- You lose points if you discuss.
- I was so surprised.

1533
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,740
- They shouldn't get to answer.
- Let me answer.

1534
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,010
From now on, if any team gets
caught discussing,

1535
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,110
- the team will lose points.
- Understood.

1536
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,650
We're not allowed to whisper
to each other in any case?

1537
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,840
- Correct.
- Let's just say it out loud.

1538
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,150
It's obvious.

1539
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,780
You really shouldn't do that.

1540
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,460
- Here goes Level Four.
- I'll go first.

1541
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,420
- You should.
- He picks the one to go first.

1542
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,690
(The songs are being played.)

1543
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:02,760
Let me answer.

1544
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:04,230
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1545
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,800
- Let me answer.
- Kwang Soo, you go first.

1546
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,190
- But we were faster.
- Kwang Soo, you go first.

1547
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,440
- Me?
- Yes.

1548
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,400
- 3, 2,
- Kim Jong Seo's...

1549
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,440
One.

1550
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,510
- Okay.
- "Beautiful Restriction".

1551
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,570
Let me answer.

1552
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,300
Okay. Jae Suk, you go first.

1553
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,650
"Beautiful Restriction"
by Kim Jong Seo.

1554
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,940
"Up and Down" by EXID.

1555
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,380
- Okay!
- Okay!

1556
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,480
Let's get ready to dance.

1557
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,990
(They're dancing a girl group's
dance excitedly.)

1558
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:25,840
Gosh. Hey.

1559
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,610
- That's not how they dance.
- What is this?

1560
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,280
- This is...
- What is this?

1561
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,880
- What is this?
- That's not how they dance.

1562
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,880
It sounded like "New Face" earlier.

1563
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,960
(Team Yellow Green
gained 10 points.)

1564
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,800
This is their dance move.

1565
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,130
(Song A is "Beautiful Restriction"
by Kim Jong Seo.)

1566
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,690
(I am so lucky)

1567
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,130
(With the legendary song
from 1996 as background music,)

1568
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:46,980
(he's doing his frivolous
celebratory move.)

1569
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,010
He's annoying.

1570
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,010
(He expresses the joy
through silly dance moves.)

1571
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,150
Gosh, I'm so upset.

1572
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,570
Gosh. He's so...

1573
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,670
- That was good. Great.
- We did great.

1574
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,240
(So the top and bottom duo
gained the 1st 10 points.)

1575
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,420
<i>Up, down, up, up, and down</i>

1576
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,320
I thought it was
"Like a Cat" by AOA.

1577
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,550
Here goes the second question.

1578
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,820
Aren't there
any common knowledge questions?

1579
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,280
- Level 1 of the 2nd question.
- Here we go.

1580
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,550
I love this game. It's fun.

1581
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:06,690
(The intro of Song A)

1582
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,820
(The outro of Song B)

1583
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,230
- I love this game. It's fun.
- Let's do this.

1584
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,960
(The songs are being played.)

1585
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,030
Let me answer.

1586
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,010
- Jong Kook, you go first.
- I know the first song.

1587
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,240
Sharp's...

1588
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,170
3, 2, 1.

1589
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,570
- Let me answer.
- I don't know the second song.

1590
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,670
(Time's over.)

1591
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,400
- Okay.
- Jae Suk first.

1592
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,840
"Tell Me, Tell Me" by Sharp.

1593
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,510
(Imitating the sound)

1594
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,690
- I don't know the second one.
- Let me answer.

1595
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,010
- Gosh. That startled me.
- What's this?

1596
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,380
(At that moment...)

1597
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,710
(Some objects fell from upstairs!)

1598
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,860
- What's that?
- Let me answer.

1599
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,030
- I don't know the second song.
- What's that?

1600
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,490
(3 mysterious balloons fell
without warning.)

1601
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,730
- What's going on?
- What is that?

1602
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,530
(Confused)

1603
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:43,800
<i>- Happy birthday</i>
- What's this?

1604
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,190
(They're singing the birthday song?)

1605
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:46,230
<i>- To you</i>
- Wait.

1606
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,460
Is there something
inside the balloon?

1607
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,840
- What is it?
- That was so sudden.

1608
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:54,300
(Jong Kook popped a balloon
and found something.)

1609
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,800
He found something inside of it.

1610
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,550
There's something in the balloons.

1611
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,050
- He found something inside.
- What is it?

1612
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,170
What is it? What is this for?

1613
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,440
- What is this for?
- Can we just stick it in there?

1614
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,780
(The pirate roulette was placed
before the mission began.)

1615
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,650
(The quick-witted Jong Kook
found it suspicious.)

1616
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,590
- What is this for?
- Can we just stick it in there?

1617
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,130
Hey, wait. Wait.

1618
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,420
(Ji Hyo popped a balloon late...)

1619
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,800
(and found a sword too.)

1620
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,300
It doesn't fit in the slot. Come on.

1621
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,840
What? It doesn't fit in the slot.

1622
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,460
I think we got the wrong swords.

1623
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,630
There are real swords too.

1624
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,530
See? I popped the balloon
as soon as it fell.

1625
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,110
- I'm sure it's the right one.
- Right.

1626
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:29,480
(There are real and fake swords
hidden in balloons that fall!)

1627
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,670
(Se Chan picked up the real sword
that Ji Hyo dropped.)

1628
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,670
- I popped it right away.
- It's a real one.

1629
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:35,780
- I'm sure it's the right one.
- Right.

1630
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,190
- You can't try several times.
- You can do it just once.

1631
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:38,320
You have just one chance.

1632
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,820
I thought... I found one...

1633
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,710
- I didn't know... I thought...
- It doesn't fit, right?

1634
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,190
- You have just one chance.
- Does yours fit in the slot?

1635
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,380
- Does it fit?
- It doesn't fit, right?

1636
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,190
It fits in the slot.

1637
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,860
Okay. Stop it. Hey, you punk.

1638
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,070
- Gosh, seriously.
- Gosh, you.

1639
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,490
Okay. Stop it. Hey, you punk.

1640
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:52,860
(Kwang Soo broke it.)

1641
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,940
(The one with a fake sword
caused trouble.)

1642
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,170
You little...

1643
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,530
- I'll stick mine in it.
- Okay.

1644
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,030
If it pops out,
do I get something?

1645
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,130
Then you'll win.

1646
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,210
Stick it in and see what happens.

1647
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:02,340
- Do we get a hint?
- Maybe there's a hint.

1648
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,710
Please. Please come out.

1649
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,570
- Please.
- Maybe there's a hint.

1650
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:06,570
(Will Jae Suk's sword
make the pirate pop out?)

1651
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:07,670
Will it pop out?

1652
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:10,320
(Anxious)

1653
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,110
It won't pop out anyway.
Just get it over with.

1654
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,690
- Please pop out.
- He's right.

1655
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,610
- We didn't put in many swords.
- So this is how it works.

1656
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,150
- Gosh.
- I told you so.

1657
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,530
So we need to stick a real sword
in the right slot.

1658
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:20,990
The person who makes it pop out
will win.

1659
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,590
- Okay.
- The quiz doesn't matter.

1660
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,670
(Finding a real sword is
the key point.)

1661
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:27,030
- They tricked us.
- This is so difficult.

1662
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,570
You get 10 points
when you get 1 question right,

1663
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,860
and you get 50 points
when the pirate pops out.

1664
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,530
This is a faster way to win.

1665
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,800
Oh, boy. I should find out
what the second song is.

1666
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,150
- Now,
- They must be waiting upstairs.

1667
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:39,440
we'll play Level Two.

1668
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,110
Wait. I'm sorry.

1669
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,110
- I think someone just farted.
- What?

1670
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,550
- Why are you looking at me?
- Gosh, Suk Jin.

1671
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:46,880
- Why are you looking at me?
- Hang on a second.

1672
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,610
It can't be just a fart.

1673
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,030
Do you have a diaper
by any chance?

1674
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,230
I'm serious.

1675
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,760
- I mean...
- You guys...

1676
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,590
- Due to extreme nervousness...
- You guys...

1677
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,360
- He must be embarrassed.
- He was laughing to hide it.

1678
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,030
- Honestly, I don't think...
- Don't try to set me up.

1679
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,300
- it was you.
- Okay.

1680
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,360
The breeze is coming from that side.

1681
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,130
It wasn't me.

1682
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,300
- Was it really not you?
- No.

1683
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,670
- What are you doing?
- Gosh.

1684
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,710
It wasn't me.

1685
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:10,940
(She tries to submit evidence.)

1686
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,070
- Ji Hyo, what's wrong with you?
- I didn't do it.

1687
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,210
You've been saying I smell bad
since last week, but it wasn't me.

1688
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,440
- It wasn't you?
- Trust me. I didn't do it.

1689
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,440
By the way, you've become
so good at improvising.

1690
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,490
It wasn't me.

1691
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,550
(Precious Sisters saved their skin
with Ji Hyo's wit.)

1692
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:24,590
Let's move on. Play the music.

1693
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:27,550
(The songs are being played.)

1694
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,190
(Glancing up)

1695
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:32,320
(Everyone seems to know Song A.)

1696
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,460
Let me answer.

1697
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,240
- Kwang Soo first.
- All right.

1698
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,300
- This must be the correct answer.
- I know this song.

1699
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,570
(It's important to guess Song B.)

1700
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,800
- This must be the correct answer.
- I know this song.

1701
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,710
- I know this song too.
- I listen to it very often.

1702
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:41,900
"Tell Me, Tell Me" by Sharp.

1703
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,240
"One Man" by Kim Jong Kook.

1704
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,650
Okay!

1705
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,070
- This is...
- I can't believe this.

1706
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,570
- This is unfair.
- I recognized it right away.

1707
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:48,570
I did great, right?

1708
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,610
(Song B with the familiar outro
is "One Man".)

1709
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,960
(It's Jong Kook's hit ballad song
that won women's hearts in 2004.)

1710
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,490
(This is the outro they just heard.)

1711
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,030
- You can't play his song.
- He's right.

1712
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,260
What's wrong with playing my song?

1713
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,760
- Play my song too. "I Know".
- What's wrong with it?

1714
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,170
It was advantageous for him.

1715
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,280
Your song wasn't a hit song,
but mine was.

1716
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,240
- What does that have to do with it?
- No wonder it sounded familiar.

1717
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,480
Exactly.

1718
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,820
(Balloons fall right then.)

1719
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,190
(As soon as the balloons fell,)

1720
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,420
It's a fake sword.

1721
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,880
(everyone started fighting
to get a balloon.)

1722
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,280
(Find a real sword.)

1723
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,380
(Meanwhile, So Min got lucky
and picked up a real sword.)

1724
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,960
(She's going straight to the pirate
roulette to stick the sword in.)

1725
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,360
(He threw a sword in the air!)

1726
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,730
- It's a fake one too.
- Hey, why did you do that?

1727
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,360
(He spread fake swords
to confuse the other members.)

1728
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,400
- It's a fake one.
- Is it a fake sword?

1729
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,400
- I didn't find any.
- Like I said,

1730
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,800
don't get too excited
when you find a sword. Okay. Good.

1731
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,010
This is a fake sword, right?

1732
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,110
It didn't pop out.

1733
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,800
She stuck it right into the slot.

1734
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,670
(Song Jeoktoma pulled it off.)

1735
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,340
I did it. I made it pop out.

1736
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,610
- We made it.
- This is unfair.

1737
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,710
- I'm so excited.
- This is so pointless.

1738
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:02,360
It's not bad.

1739
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,530
We're doing all right.

1740
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:04,630
We won 50 points.

1741
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,820
- Nice.
- Oh, man.

1742
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,460
Let's take our time.

1743
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,550
Song Jeoktoma is the best.

1744
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,090
- What a shame.
- Song Jeoktoma made it.

1745
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,090
You see, this is like dog training.

1746
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:13,940
I can't help but look up.

1747
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:16,460
Just like Pavlov's dogs drooled
when they heard the bell ringing.

1748
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,570
- Like dog training.
- It'd be funny...

1749
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,960
if they throw balloons
in front of us.

1750
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,780
I don't understand.
What was the point...

1751
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,240
of ranking us for our quiz?

1752
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,050
It's pointless.

1753
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,280
You didn't choose him
for the quiz anyway.

1754
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,050
Jae Suk.

1755
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,550
You chose me for the quiz, right?

1756
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,610
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1757
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:33,990
We won a lot of points
thanks to the game.

1758
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,010
(He helps to boost morale
rather than solving quizzes.)

1759
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,460
Please sit down.
You're blocking Kwang Soo.

1760
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,360
Was he hidden from view
all this time?

1761
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,260
- I didn't know.
- Sit up straight.

1762
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,990
No wonder. I couldn't see anything.

1763
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:46,940
Kwang Soo is better suited
for group shots anyway.

1764
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,960
Come on!

1765
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,110
There's no such thing.

1766
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,630
Here comes the next quiz.

1767
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,070
Play the music.

1768
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,070
(The third set of songs
is being played.)

1769
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,550
(The intro of song A)

1770
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,340
(The outro of song B)

1771
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:04,510
(Ta-da)

1772
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,380
- Hang on.
- I know the first one.

1773
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:07,690
Then answer it.

1774
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:11,260
(Jae Suk always
hits the nail on the head.)

1775
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,130
I'm not sure about the first song.
Hold on.

1776
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,460
Can you play it longer?

1777
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:17,900
Level three. Play the music.

1778
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:24,340
(Music playing)

1779
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,960
I know this song!

1780
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:27,940
You do? I know the second song.

1781
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,740
- I know the song.
- All right. I know the second song.

1782
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,340
- I know the 2nd song too.
- I know the 2nd song too.

1783
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,710
- You know the 2nd one?
- We got the 2nd song.

1784
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,920
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1785
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:36,340
"I Have a Girlfriend"
by Park Jin Young.

1786
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,510
("I Have a Girlfriend"
by Park Jin Young)

1787
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,780
- "A Winter Story" by DJ DOC.
- Let me answer!

1788
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,360
- "A Winter Story"?
- Let me answer. I was faster, no?

1789
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,420
Go ahead, Jong Kook.

1790
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,420
"I Have a Girlfriend"
by Park Jin Young.

1791
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,050
"Eve's Warning" by Park Mi Kyung.

1792
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,550
That's not it. Let me answer!

1793
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,550
- Park Jin...
- Haha, go first.

1794
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:52,400
Park Jin Young's
"That House Is Mine".

1795
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,400
Let me answer.

1796
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,300
- What kind of song is that?
- "My House Is Yours".

1797
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,210
- Let me answer.
- I thought he knew.

1798
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,530
"Your Baby Is Mine Too".

1799
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,070
- All right.
- Let me answer!

1800
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,240
- Let me answer!
- Se Chan, go first.

1801
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,760
- You'll all be surprised.
- Hurry up.

1802
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,510
- 5, 4, 3,
- It's Rain's...

1803
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:19,700
- 2, 1.
- "How to Avoid the Sun".

1804
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,780
- 3, 2, 1.
- Let me answer.

1805
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,010
"Eve's Warning" by Park Mi Kyung.

1806
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,220
- That's it! Jae Suk!
- You gave them too much time.

1807
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,340
- They were too slow!
- That was fantastic.

1808
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,050
Come on.

1809
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,660
(They're showing
an unsightly ceremony again.)

1810
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,720
Don't throw the balloons just yet!
Watch our performance first.

1811
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,760
(Don't throw the balloons just yet!
Watch our performance first.)

1812
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,030
(The audience turned their backs
on the stage.)

1813
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,030
(Desperate movements
to attract their audience)

1814
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:41,300
Give them to us now!

1815
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,870
- Watch us, Suk Jin.
- Throw them now!

1816
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,490
- Throw them now!
- Watch us, Suk Jin.

1817
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:47,510
(Responding to their performance
without even watching)

1818
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,780
- Gosh.
- That one was...

1819
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,570
- Seriously.
- You counted for too long.

1820
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:56,550
- Give us a break.
- You're playing favorites.

1821
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,570
- Don't count the second one.
- We didn't discuss at all.

1822
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,410
- Let's not count it. It's absurd.
- You went too easy on them.

1823
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,180
- Don't count it.
- Who didn't know the answer?

1824
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,680
Then let's have the Grand Award
winners play rock-paper-scissors.

1825
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,820
- With whom?
- The Grand Award winners.

1826
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,220
Gosh, you want me to play
rock-paper-scissors with him?

1827
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,430
So if I win against Jong Kook,
everything will be settled?

1828
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,050
That's not it. Listen.

1829
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,800
If Jong Kook loses,
let's not argue against it anymore.

1830
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,030
- Okay.
- Make sure to win, Jae Suk.

1831
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,390
- All right. <i>Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1832
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,970
- All right!
- It's the best of three.

1833
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,840
- Come on! Stop it!
- We lined up behind him.

1834
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,240
- All right!
- It's the best of three.

1835
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,240
(The class of the Grand Award winner
who goes back on his word)

1836
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,300
- Stop it.
- He said they lined up.

1837
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,700
We even lined up!

1838
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,510
- Goodness.
- Yangsebari, come here.

1839
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:27,550
(Yangsebari, come here.)

1840
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:29,200
- At least two people should play.
- I'm sorry,

1841
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,050
- but did you win the Grand Award?
- No...

1842
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,780
- Then he's not qualified to play.
- That's not it.

1843
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:33,780
He's just a research subject.

1844
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,280
I'm one to get vaccinated first.

1845
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,490
You're the first one
to get vaccinated?

1846
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:38,320
- If you want to play, come closer.
- You have to win one more round.

1847
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,410
If you want to play, come closer.

1848
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,760
- If you want to play, come closer.
- You have to win one more round.

1849
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,430
- Why do you want to play it?
- You must come closer.

1850
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,120
Why do you suddenly
want to play rock-paper-scissors?

1851
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,590
Come closer if you want to play.

1852
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,030
- Just play one more round for him!
- I mean...

1853
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,800
- If you want to play...
- Come this way.

1854
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,700
- I mean, if you want to play...
- If you want to play, come closer.

1855
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,930
If you want to play,
swallow your pride and come closer.

1856
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,530
I'm going to you.

1857
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,740
If you want to play, follow us.

1858
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:57,510
- He can win it, you know.
- It's so funny...

1859
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:58,740
- He can win it.
- Suk Jin is following them.

1860
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,930
- Let's play it.
- Okay.

1861
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,010
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1862
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,510
- All right, I won. I won!
- Darn it.

1863
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,070
He lost. Goodness.

1864
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,510
All right, I won against him.

1865
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,320
- He even threw away his pride.
- How annoying.

1866
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,120
The protruding mouth brothers
are getting ahead!

1867
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,510
- Okay.
- Just give it to them.

1868
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,890
- But this is absurd.
- Just give it to them.

1869
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:16,780
- Here come the next quiz.
- Okay.

1870
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,050
Kwang Soo, you have to listen
to the rules.

1871
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,800
Kwang Soo, you're in charge
of the balloons.

1872
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,220
- Okay.
- This time,

1873
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,820
you'll be playing
the Guess Who Quiz.

1874
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,640
We'll show you a picture
of a foreign celebrity.

1875
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,200
You'll have to guess
their full name.

1876
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,340
- Gosh, this is...
- Okay.

1877
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,700
You have to take turns
saying syllable by syllable.

1878
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:30,930
We have to say the syllables?

1879
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,300
For instance,
if I tell Haha to go first...

1880
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,570
(Bill Gates)

1881
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:35,800
That's how you should
say the answer.

1882
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,800
(Correct)

1883
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,680
(As soon as they heard
it's about foreign celebrities,)

1884
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,010
(they gave up.)

1885
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,410
For instance,
if I tell Haha to go first...

1886
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,660
Let's catch the balloons instead.

1887
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,180
- Gosh, this is hard.
- It is.

1888
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,120
- We have to say the full name?
- Yes, that's right.

1889
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,950
- We excluded the middle name.
- Okay.

1890
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,820
- There's a middle name too?
- Yes.

1891
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,200
(There's a middle name too?)

1892
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,720
- Okay.
- Here comes the first question.

1893
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,930
If you call your answer,
I'll tell whom to go first.

1894
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:59,490
Then you'll have to say
the syllables right away.

1895
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:01,030
- Say it right away.
- We have to call to answer first.

1896
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:02,340
- I'll do that.
- Let's begin.

1897
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:07,110
(Joe Biden)

1898
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:10,110
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead, Haha.

1899
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,320
- You know who he is.
- Mister...

1900
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,570
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead, Jae Suk.

1901
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:13,780
- Jo.
- E.

1902
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,590
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead, Kwang Soo.

1903
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:16,820
- Joe.
- B.

1904
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,820
- Kwang Soo.
- Ji.

1905
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,180
- Darn it!
- Let me answer!

1906
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,490
Go ahead, Se Chan.

1907
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,660
- Joe.
- B.

1908
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,090
- I.
- Den.

1909
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,390
Darn it, you punk!

1910
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,300
- We stole their answer!
- Darn it!

1911
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,530
- It's Joe Biden!
- "Joe Ji"?

1912
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:31,390
(They missed the balloons because
they're busy dancing frivolously.)

1913
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:32,430
"Joe Ji".

1914
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,430
- What's happening? We missed them.
- What's happening?

1915
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:35,910
- Darn it.
- That's our target.

1916
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,300
- That's ours!
- Did you get them?

1917
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,470
(A kick that has nothing
to do with the balloons)

1918
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:41,570
- Kwang Soo, we got it.
- What was that?

1919
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:43,410
- Have you lost your mind?
- We got it.

1920
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,950
- Give them to me. Hand it over.
- No.

1921
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,280
(Kwang Soo became a wreck while
giving the swords to Jong Kook.)

1922
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:49,510
(Jong Kook even uses his teeth.)

1923
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:51,660
- Okay.
- Kwang Soo got the chance.

1924
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,950
He even used his teeth.

1925
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,530
- Hold on.
- Hey, we got it.

1926
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:55,930
Who put their hands in my underwear?

1927
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,820
Someone hit me from behind
regardless of the balloons.

1928
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:59,320
We have to give it a try.
Hand me one.

1929
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,220
It was already over.
Why did they hit me?

1930
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,970
Gosh, how unlucky of me.

1931
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,140
- Are you upset right now?
- No, I am not upset.

1932
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:09,110
I forgive you
for not getting Joe Biden.

1933
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,160
- I got this for us.
- Yes, you did.

1934
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,370
- I forgive you.
- The pirate will pop up.

1935
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,570
It's a relief that
you're contributing to our team.

1936
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:14,610
- All right.
- This is worth 50 points.

1937
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:15,700
- You can stick one in.
- Okay.

1938
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,720
I forgive you
for not getting Joe Biden.

1939
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,910
- Gosh.
- I think it will pop up.

1940
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,680
- You have one, right? Let's go.
- Yes, I have one.

1941
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,010
- It'll be a relief if they fail.
- Give it a go.

1942
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:24,320
Go ahead, trust your gut.

1943
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,220
- Have you forgotten who you are?
- No, I'll give it a go.

1944
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,660
You're Lee Kwang Soo,
for goodness' sake.

1945
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,050
I should've caught one.

1946
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:30,390
Just stick one in indifferently.

1947
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,120
He's timid with things like this.

1948
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,030
- That's it. Just stick one in.
- He has no luck with it.

1949
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:36,220
- Just stick it in.
- It didn't pop up! Okay!

1950
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,490
- Darn it.
- That was...

1951
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:41,240
- That was cheap of you.
- Let's go, Kwang Soo.

1952
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,470
- All right.
- I'll catch the next one.

1953
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:43,640
- Let's move on.
- This is too much.

1954
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,300
- Well done.
- This is too hard.

1955
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,010
I... We...

1956
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,180
I knew he was Biden, but I didn't
know his last name was Joe.

1957
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,570
We weren't in a good position
to catch the balloons.

1958
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,410
Hey, his last name is not Joe.

1959
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:54,510
There's no such last name as Joe.

1960
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,640
Then what about Joe?
His last name is Biden?

1961
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,050
Then is Michael Jordan's
last name "Ma"?

1962
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:00,410
Do you even know who he is?

1963
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,620
Do you even watch the news?

1964
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,620
- I mean...
- Then is his name Biden Joe?

1965
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,030
I know he's the president of the US.

1966
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:06,030
- That's right.
- He's the president-elect.

1967
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,300
You all know
who Joe Biden is, right?

1968
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,530
I knew who he was, but I didn't know
his last name was Joe.

1969
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,840
I didn't know his last name was Joe.

1970
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,410
That's not it.
His first name is Joe.

1971
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,910
- Biden is his last name.
- Oh, it's the other way around.

1972
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,370
- Okay, I got it.
- "The other way around"?

1973
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:21,410
(It's the other way around
for westerners.)

1974
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:23,510
Why would you pronounce it
like that?

1975
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:25,910
You should memorize
the name of the US president.

1976
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,590
- President Joe.
- President Joe, got it.

1977
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:28,620
"President Joe".

1978
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,550
- Then how do we call him?
- It's not President Joe.

1979
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:32,820
- It's President Biden.
- Biden? Okay.

1980
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,180
Let's settle with that.

1981
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,320
Here's the next question.

1982
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,590
There are two ways
of reading his name.

1983
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:38,620
We'll accept both.

1984
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:39,820
Of course you should.

1985
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:41,800
All right. 1, 2, 3.

1986
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,070
(Abraham Lincoln)

1987
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,800
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1988
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,970
- Kwang Soo, go ahead.
- A.

1989
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:49,740
- "A".
- Let me answer!

1990
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:50,740
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead.

1991
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,930
- A.
- B.

1992
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,410
- Let me answer!
- Why?

1993
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,910
- A.
- B?

1994
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:56,240
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1995
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,280
A.

1996
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,120
- Bu.
- Let me answer!

1997
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,510
- I got it!
- What?

1998
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,010
- A.
- Why is it wrong?

1999
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:03,510
- "A".
- B.

2000
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,090
- Ra.
- Ham.

2001
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,220
- Lin.
- Coln.

2002
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,590
- Correct.
- All right!

2003
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:08,930
But I said the same thing!

2004
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:10,220
I said "A" also.

2005
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:11,800
- He didn't say that!
- That wasn't correct.

2006
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,220
- He didn't say it.
- A, "A".

2007
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,430
A, "A".

2008
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:15,570
You can't pronounce it like that.

2009
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,970
You pronounce it that way!

2010
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:18,340
It's just another way of saying it!

2011
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,740
- You have to say either...
- Abraham, Abraham.

2012
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,010
"A"!

2013
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:23,640
Do you have a daughter in the US?

2014
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,640
He probably said it
with a Texan accent.

2015
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,640
My accent is a little Texan.

2016
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,800
According to the Korean dictionary,
there are two ways of saying it.

2017
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,240
Why did you pronounce it that way,
you punk?

2018
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,090
- Good job.
- Okay.

2019
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,990
- You know,
- We did a good job.

2020
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:38,260
Kwang Soo and I thought...

2021
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,320
- Who did you think he was?
- We were like,

2022
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,760
"Is he Einstein?"

2023
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,860
- Einstein.
- I couldn't see the photo well.

2024
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,360
- Me neither.
- I couldn't see the photo well.

2025
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:48,200
It's confusing
since it's a black and white photo.

2026
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:49,530
Empty Head.

2027
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,700
The next person.

2028
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,410
- There must be one Korean in there.
- 1, 2, 3.

2029
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:55,930
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2030
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:56,970
Jong Kook.

2031
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:01,280
(Albert Einstein)

2032
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,280
- E.
- In.

2033
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:05,680
- Let me answer.
- Se Chan.

2034
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:07,120
- 3, 2.
- What?

2035
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,490
- Let me answer.
- He wouldn't know the first name.

2036
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,390
- E.
- In.

2037
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:12,510
- It's incorrect.
- Let me answer.

2038
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:13,680
Al.

2039
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:15,760
E.

2040
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,220
- Let me answer.
- Ji Hyo.

2041
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:18,530
Al.

2042
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:19,930
F.

2043
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:20,970
Me!

2044
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,390
- Let me answer.
- Haha.

2045
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,590
- Al.
- Ber.

2046
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:25,070
- Ji.
- Let me answer.

2047
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,840
Jae Suk.

2048
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,070
- Al.
- Ber.

2049
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,530
- T.
- Loan.

2050
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:31,510
- My goodness.
- Let me answer.

2051
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:33,910
(Albert Loan)

2052
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,780
(My goodness.)

2053
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,780
(Empty Head's wrong answer
makes Jae Suk sigh.)

2054
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:41,120
(The 9th financial sector,
Empty Head's Albert Loan)

2055
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,620
- Jong Kook.
- Al.

2056
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,390
- Ber.
- T.

2057
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:45,950
- E.
- In.

2058
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:46,950
- S.
- Te.

2059
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:47,990
- In.
- Okay.

2060
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:49,030
For goodness' sake.

2061
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,950
What in the world is Albert Loan?

2062
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:53,260
(What in the world is Albert Loan?)

2063
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,470
Albert.

2064
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:55,760
Do you think...

2065
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,430
he is from the financial circle?

2066
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,140
(The balloons drop.)

2067
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,340
- Okay. Grab it.
- Here.

2068
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,510
- We sat down.
- We sat down.

2069
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:04,780
- We sat down.
- We get to go.

2070
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:06,410
- Here I go.
- Come on, Se Chan.

2071
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:07,470
What is it?

2072
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:08,640
The chance is high this time.

2073
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,410
- It will come up.
- There are four slots left.

2074
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:11,550
It didn't pop up.

2075
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:12,680
It was shaken up earlier.

2076
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,840
This is driving me crazy.

2077
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,450
Push in another one.
We need to win 50 points.

2078
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,220
- Please let them fail.
- The last one.

2079
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:19,660
- Please let them fail.
- How many knives are left?

2080
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,180
- None?
- Let's get over this.

2081
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,950
- There are 7 slots.
- 1 out of 7.

2082
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,220
Then the probability is
only 15 percent.

2083
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,050
(Will they be able to win 50 points
with the last knife?)

2084
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,200
Then the probability is
only 15 percent.

2085
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:32,370
- Okay!
- That was insane.

2086
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:37,740
(They succeeded to win 50 points!)

2087
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:38,930
That's so annoying.

2088
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,570
- I didn't want to see that.
- That's so annoying.

2089
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:41,800
Nice!

2090
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,070
- Nice!
- That's so annoying.

2091
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:44,510
We won with Albert Loan.

2092
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:47,740
Albert Loan sounds like
a stock item.

2093
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,820
That's so annoying.

2094
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:49,990
Is it a biotech stock?

2095
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,050
Nice!

2096
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:54,120
- You changed the seats, right?
- Yes.

2097
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,430
Do you want to change the seats?

2098
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:56,530
- Okay.
- Do you want to do it?

2099
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,700
- Yes.
- All right.

2100
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,220
Let's change the seats. Move.

2101
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,300
Stay there.

2102
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,160
- They changed the seats.
- Kim Grand Award,

2103
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,890
- change seats with him.
- All right then.

2104
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:05,760
Why did you listen to him
when you didn't listen to me?

2105
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:07,970
- He is a senior.
- For goodness' sake.

2106
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:09,300
- A junior who won the Grand Award.
- Come on.

2107
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,180
Jong Kook didn't even budge
when he kicked him.

2108
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,340
You won't budge?

2109
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,640
He is a junior
who won the Grand Award.

2110
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,180
So you won't budge.

2111
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,280
It looks like you won, Suk Jin.

2112
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:19,050
I am dusting the cushion.

2113
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:21,680
(With the cushion, he touches
the Protein Monster's face.)

2114
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,090
He is provoking Jong Kook.

2115
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,890
(He provokes Jong Kook
in the most timid way possible.)

2116
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,320
Thank you for sitting still.

2117
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,050
(Thank you for sitting still.)

2118
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:32,220
(He quickly thanks Jong Kook
after provoking him.)

2119
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,720
We are set.

2120
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,970
It will be funny if we end it here.

2121
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:37,300
Don't air my apology.

2122
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,340
I wondered what I should do...

2123
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:41,110
if you got up. Thank you.

2124
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:43,410
Suk Jin hit him
with his hands trembling.

2125
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,680
(The man who gives people
hand tremors smiles.)

2126
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,870
- All right.
- Let's go.

2127
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,970
This time, you will have a quiz
on capital cities.

2128
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:51,570
- Capital cities.
- Capital cities?

2129
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:52,680
- Yes. Capital cities.
- Okay.

2130
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:54,120
I am good with capitals.

2131
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,890
- Let's go.
- When I give you the country name,

2132
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:57,820
- say a syllable...
- Let's go.

2133
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:58,860
- each.
- Come on.

2134
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,620
The first country is...

2135
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,930
- Mongolia.
- Let me answer.

2136
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,050
- U.
- Lan.

2137
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:06,590
- Ba.
- To.

2138
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,220
(Will they succeed?)

2139
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,390
- To.
- R.

2140
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:11,640
- Isn't it "Ulaanbaatar"?
- Is it correct?

2141
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:14,930
(They get the correct answer
right away.)

2142
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,870
- Ulan Bator.
- It was too easy.

2143
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:17,910
Is it "Ulan Bator"?

2144
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,030
Is it?

2145
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:21,010
- Ulan Bator.
- It was too easy.

2146
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:22,140
Is it "Ulan Bator"?

2147
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,240
"Ulan Bator" is a correct way
of saying it.

2148
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,470
- Is it "Ulan Bator"?
- Yes.

2149
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,550
Jae Suk, we got it right!

2150
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:27,680
Is it "Ulan Bator"?

2151
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:29,680
I have good pronunciation.

2152
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,740
Ulan Bator.

2153
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,010
- That was great.
- It was a clean answer.

2154
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:35,320
(It looks like he is ready to get
permanent residency in Mongolia.)

2155
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:37,390
How could he be so annoying?

2156
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:39,430
- That was so much fun.
- The next capital.

2157
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:40,530
(The next question)

2158
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:43,160
- Iraq.
- Let me answer.

2159
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:45,070
Haha.

2160
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:46,200
(The answer is Baghdad.)

2161
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,660
- Let me answer.
- Kwang Soo.

2162
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,240
- What?
- For goodness' sake.

2163
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:52,570
"What?"

2164
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:54,640
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2165
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,840
- Se Chan.
- Ja.

2166
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:57,280
No, no.

2167
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,370
- Let me answer.
- Iraq.

2168
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:00,550
B.

2169
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:04,450
(You should know now.)

2170
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,860
- Io.
- Let me answer.

2171
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:06,990
Bio.

2172
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,030
- Ba.
- Gh.

2173
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,030
- Da.
- D.

2174
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,180
Nice!

2175
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:13,320
(Kwang Soo,
I can't believe you said "Bio".)

2176
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,430
Nice!

2177
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:15,990
- We are on a roll today, Jae Suk.
- Bio!

2178
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,260
Here come
the protruding mouth brothers!

2179
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,970
- Let's go! Nice!
- Nice!

2180
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,610
- It was amazing.
- We are getting everything right.

2181
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:24,910
I was the master of the quiz.

2182
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,370
Jae Suk,

2183
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,910
I am no longer Empty Head
when I am with you.

2184
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:31,410
Kwang Soo's answer was so funny.

2185
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,340
He said "Bio".

2186
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:34,780
- Seriously.
- My goodness.

2187
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:35,910
Baghdad.

2188
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:37,090
The Iraq War.

2189
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:38,910
I remembered the Iraq War.

2190
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:40,410
You are doing great today.

2191
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:41,680
I wasn't Empty Head.

2192
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:43,360
Bio.

2193
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:44,800
Here comes the next question.

2194
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,320
Don't you know
"Baghdad and the 50 Thieves"?

2195
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:49,200
That's Ali Baba.

2196
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:51,660
It isn't
"Baghdad and the 50 Thieves".

2197
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,340
It's "Ali Baba and the 50 Thieves".

2198
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,300
(Even Suk Jin couldn't avoid
the Empty Head Syndrome.)

2199
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,410
The next capital.

2200
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:57,930
(The next question)

2201
01:10:57,930 --> 01:10:58,930
The next capital.

2202
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:00,030
Se Chan is really good at this.

2203
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:01,340
- Norway.
- Let me answer.

2204
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,800
- Haha.
- Van.

2205
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,200
Das.

2206
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,570
("Vandas" is incorrect.)

2207
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:07,120
- Let me answer.
- Se Chan.

2208
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:08,490
I don't know.

2209
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,220
Let me answer.

2210
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:11,260
- Suk Jin.
- My goodness.

2211
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:12,320
Let me answer.

2212
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,450
Suk Jin.

2213
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:14,930
- Van.
- Hel.

2214
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:16,450
Sing.

2215
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:18,860
- That's a movie.
- Isn't "Van Helsing" a movie?

2216
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,820
- Is it a movie?
- Isn't it a movie? Let me answer.

2217
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,030
- Se Chan.
- Wasn't it something like that?

2218
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:23,090
Van.

2219
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:24,590
(Annoyed)

2220
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:25,990
- Is it incorrect?
- Are you going to be like that?

2221
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,260
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2222
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,260
Jong Kook, go ahead.

2223
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,370
- O.
- Sl.

2224
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,540
Ram.

2225
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:32,880
- What?
- Let me answer.

2226
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:34,840
You said it's Oslram.

2227
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:36,300
- Se Chan.
- What?

2228
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,640
- O.
- Sl.

2229
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,470
- Bi.
- For goodness' sake.

2230
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:40,880
("Oslbi" is incorrect.)

2231
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,640
(Sighing)

2232
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,510
(Empty Head's stupid answers are
more harmful than acid rain.)

2233
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,620
Oslbi.

2234
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,790
(He said "Oslbi".)

2235
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:49,960
Oslbi.

2236
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,500
Oslbi.

2237
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,590
- Hey. Hey.
- Oslbi.

2238
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:55,070
What kind of an answer is "Oslbi"?

2239
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:56,130
Let me answer.

2240
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:57,460
- Oslbi.
- Give me a chance. Let me answer.

2241
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:58,670
- Let me answer.
- Haha, go ahead.

2242
01:11:58,670 --> 01:11:59,670
- O.
- Sl.

2243
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,700
- O.
- Yes.

2244
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:03,570
- Okay.
- It was Oslo.

2245
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,610
- It's okay.
- It's okay to make a mistake.

2246
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,430
- "Oslbi" was a funny answer.
- Oslo.

2247
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:11,750
<i>When Oslbi falls
early in the morning</i>

2248
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:14,120
<i>- Three umbrellas walk
- Side by side</i>

2249
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,790
I knew it was Oslo.

2250
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,290
Here they come.

2251
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:19,320
(Balloons fall at that moment.)

2252
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,860
- All of them popped.
- For goodness' sake.

2253
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:22,250
All of them are fake!

2254
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,660
Okay, okay. I sat down!

2255
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,000
(Okay, okay. I sat down!)

2256
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,200
All right.

2257
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,750
- You can't do that.
- You can't do that.

2258
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,460
- We sat down.
- We sat down.

2259
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,260
- Hold on.
- So Min.

2260
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,130
- So Min.
- So Min.

2261
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:34,460
- We sat down.
- I received a tip-off...

2262
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,240
about the bad odor that came...

2263
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,330
- when the balloons popped.
- No, no.

2264
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:39,000
No, seriously.
When the balloons popped...

2265
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,040
No!

2266
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,470
(When the balloons
popped earlier...)

2267
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,250
Jae Suk,
why do I smell something sour...

2268
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:47,280
after the balloons popped?

2269
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:48,750
No, seriously.

2270
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,380
- When the balloons popped,
- No!

2271
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:51,860
- I smelled something sour.
- No.

2272
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,990
- So Min.
- It really wasn't me.

2273
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:54,180
- So Min.
- It wasn't me.

2274
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:56,050
- So Min.
- It wasn't me.

2275
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,420
- My goodness.
- I smelled something sour.

2276
01:12:58,530 --> 01:12:59,660
We sat down.

2277
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,130
- Hurry up.
- We need to catch the culprit.

2278
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,960
There's someone who smells sour
among us.

2279
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:04,260
Okay. Let's try this slot.

2280
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,430
Yes!

2281
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,460
(Team Red fails to get 50 points!)

2282
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,070
This is the last question
on capitals.

2283
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,670
- Hungary.
- Let me answer.

2284
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:12,170
(What's the capital of Hungary?)

2285
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:14,970
(Suk Jin yelled out,
but Haha looks uncertain.)

2286
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:16,450
- Haha.
- Bu.

2287
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:17,610
- Da.
- Pe.

2288
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:18,640
- S.
- T.

2289
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,540
("Budapest" is correct.)

2290
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:23,010
My goodness.

2291
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,180
- The balloons...
- What?

2292
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,320
Where are the balloons?

2293
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,490
(The last set of balloons fall.)

2294
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,790
(It's a ruckus.)

2295
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:30,420
Hey, these are fake.

2296
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:31,790
No.

2297
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:33,700
Jae Suk!

2298
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,420
I figured it out.

2299
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,070
It's the smell of someone's feet.
I figured it out.

2300
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:38,370
I figured it out.

2301
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,130
(So Min proposes a theory that
it's the smell of someone's feet.)

2302
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:42,330
- Someone has stinky feet.
- It's the smell of someone's feet.

2303
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:43,410
- Someone has stinky feet.
- Throw it.

2304
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:44,580
Haha!

2305
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:45,670
It popped out!

2306
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:51,140
(He made the pirate pop out.)

2307
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,210
Did it pop out?

2308
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,580
(The pirate that popped out
and Team Yellow won 50 points.)

2309
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:57,010
We were fighting.

2310
01:13:57,210 --> 01:13:58,960
Seriously.

2311
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:00,920
Okay, okay.

2312
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,220
Find the person who has stinky feet.

2313
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,420
- Who is it?
- It isn't me.

2314
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:04,660
- Find the person.
- Who is it?

2315
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:05,660
- It isn't me.
- It isn't me.

2316
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,720
- Ji Hyo.
- It isn't me.

2317
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,830
Ji Hyo's feet were stinky last week.

2318
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:10,760
It isn't me.
It wasn't me last week either.

2319
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,130
Let's have Bo Pil smell our feet
for fairness.

2320
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:16,330
(Bo Pil becomes the judge
of stinky feet.)

2321
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,130
That's right.

2322
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:21,130
- That's right.
- That's right.

2323
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:22,640
That's right. Bo Pil.

2324
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,120
- Gosh.
- No!

2325
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:26,670
- Stinky feet.
- Really?

2326
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,290
(The member with the stinky feet
gets caught.)

2327
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:33,860
- Good job.
- Come here.

2328
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:35,220
Come here.

2329
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,580
- For goodness' sake.
- Gosh.

2330
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,550
(He was the root of the sour smell.)

2331
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,200
- For goodness' sake.
- Gosh.

2332
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,420
(The aged smell of his stinky feet
is on another level.)

2333
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:45,670
Hey, it smells like fart.

2334
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:48,130
(His socks get removed.)

2335
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,170
- Take them off.
- Hey.

2336
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:51,210
Throw them outside.

2337
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:52,880
(Sniffing)

2338
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,000
Hey.

2339
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,950
- It was Se Chan.
- It was you.

2340
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,410
No wonder the sour smell...

2341
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,950
kept circling me.

2342
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:01,920
(They finally found
the source of the smell.)

2343
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,750
I wondered where it was coming from.

2344
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:04,990
It was coming from my feet.

2345
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:06,580
- I am sorry.
- Hey.

2346
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,180
Don't you wash your feet?

2347
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:09,290
Wash your feet!

2348
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:10,550
- Gosh.
- It wasn't me.

2349
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:11,660
So Min and Ji Hyo, I am sorry.

2350
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,890
- It was the smell of his feet.
- That was funny.

2351
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:15,420
I suspected you guys
for a short while.

2352
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,570
It wasn't us.

2353
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:18,260
I came to my senses.

2354
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,540
- His feet don't stink now.
- Hey.

2355
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,610
My goodness.

2356
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:23,500
There we go.

2357
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,930
Please sit down.

2358
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,970
The result is out.

2359
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:30,250
Haha and Suk Jin placed last
with 30 points.

2360
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,620
So Min and Ji Hyo
placed 3rd with 90 points.

2361
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:35,210
The other 2 teams are co-winners
with 130 points.

2362
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:37,380
The two teams will have a question
of the Guess Who Quiz.

2363
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:40,920
We got a lot of questions right.

2364
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,660
We got a lot of questions right too.

2365
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,130
For goodness' sake.
Don't be like that, Jae Suk.

2366
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:47,160
You should know better.

2367
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,920
You have won a good award.

2368
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,740
- You will lose, so sit down.
- Sit down.

2369
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,740
All right. I will be objective
with this question.

2370
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

2371
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,070
Guess Who Quiz.

2372
01:15:57,070 --> 01:16:00,880
(Mark Ruffalo)

2373
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Let's go.

2374
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Let me answer.

2375
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,080
Kwang Soo.

2376
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,840
(If they get it right,
Team Yellow will win.)

2377
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,990
(Mark Ruffalo)

2378
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,640
- Let me answer.
- Kwang Soo.

2379
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,750
Hul.

2380
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:13,990
(He was thinking about Hulk.)

2381
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,130
Does that work?

2382
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:16,720
No, he has a name.

2383
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,330
His name is... Hold on.

2384
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:19,750
(The Korean Hulk can't think
of the actor's name.)

2385
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,200
- I don't remember.
- Let me answer.

2386
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,500
Mar.

2387
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:24,930
- Let me answer.
- Is it right?

2388
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:26,040
- Kwang Soo.
- Mar.

2389
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:27,370
- K.
- Wal.

2390
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:28,570
Come on.

2391
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:30,370
- Let me answer.
- I got it.

2392
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:31,500
- Let me answer.
- Jae Suk.

2393
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,710
- Mar.
- K.

2394
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,000
- I don't know.
- I will answer. Let me answer.

2395
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,340
- Do I go 1st?
- Kwang Soo should go 1st.

2396
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:38,170
- Mar.
- You should have let me go first.

2397
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,820
K.

2398
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,210
Long.

2399
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:42,990
Let me answer.

2400
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:44,140
Kwang Soo, go first.

2401
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,160
Mar.

2402
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,360
Is he going first again?

2403
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,750
- You should give us a chance!
- Hey!

2404
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,550
- Mar.
- Mark.

2405
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,750
- Back.
- Again.

2406
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,670
- Let me answer. Mar.
- K.

2407
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,200
Ru.

2408
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,370
- Pa.
- Let me answer.

2409
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:01,870
- Let me answer.
- I figured it out.

2410
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:03,300
- Mar.
- K.

2411
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,430
- Ru.
- Hey.

2412
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,110
(They messed up the order again.)

2413
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:08,780
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

2414
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:10,380
- He doesn't know the answer.
- Kwang Soo should have gone first.

2415
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,640
- Seriously.
- Phi.

2416
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,950
Phi.

2417
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:14,510
- Is it Mark Loan? No, no.
- Mark Loan?

2418
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:17,080
Why do you like loans so much?

2419
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,210
- Mark Loan?
- Mark.

2420
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:19,460
It sounds like macaron.

2421
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,510
Let me answer.

2422
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,960
- Mar.
- K.

2423
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,720
- Ru.
- E.

2424
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,920
Let me answer.

2425
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,420
- We are set.
- What's the answer?

2426
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,860
- Mar.
- K.

2427
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,130
- Ru.
- Ffa.

2428
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:30,500
- Lo.
- Okay.

2429
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,830
Okay!

2430
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:33,130
I knew the name.

2431
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,070
- Ruffalo.
- Ruffalo.

2432
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:36,110
Mark Ruffalo.

2433
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:38,780
- We did it. Okay.
- Mark Ruffalo.

2434
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:41,110
- Jong Kook and Kwang Soo won.
- Okay!

2435
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:45,170
- Mark Ruffalo.
- Decide who will spin first.

2436
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:46,320
Okay.

2437
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,540
- Mark Ruffalo.
- We fought well.

2438
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,320
Ruffalo.

2439
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,380
(The two Empty Heads'
quiz battle ends.)

2440
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:53,620
Who will spin the roulette first?

2441
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:55,530
(The benefit roulette lets you add
your name on the main roulette.)

2442
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:56,630
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook spun
the benefit roulette.)

2443
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,130
If you add it...

2444
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,660
(The current number of name tags
on the roulette)

2445
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:01,720
(Kwang Soo, Haha, Se Chan, Ji Hyo,)

2446
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,720
(Jae Suk, So Min,
Jong Kook, Suk Jin)

2447
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,870
It's time to spin the roulette
one last time.

2448
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:07,370
The chosen one will have
his or her comment on each member...

2449
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:09,040
and project objective
on the website.

2450
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,330
- So this is the final decision.
- Yes.

2451
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:13,300
The chosen one will also receive
the prize money...

2452
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,300
of 100 dollars per name tag
on the roulette.

2453
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,540
It will be like a writer's pay.

2454
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,470
(Since Kwang Soo has 8 name tags,
he could win 800 dollars.)

2455
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:20,620
(Haha, Se Chan, Ji Hyo,
Jae Suk, So Min)

2456
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:22,120
I have a chance.

2457
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,490
I have a few name tags on there.

2458
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:27,010
(Suk Jin and Jong Kook have
3 name tags each!)

2459
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,660
Why don't we have a staff member
spin the roulette?

2460
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:32,630
Then Sun Myung should spin it.

2461
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:33,660
- Sun Myung.
- Yes.

2462
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:36,030
- This is the last roulette.
- Spin it hard.

2463
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:37,790
Sun Myung, let's see it.

2464
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:38,870
Here it goes.

2465
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:40,370
- Sun Myung!
- Sun Myung!

2466
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:43,000
- Let's go.
- You followed me a lot.

2467
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,330
Get mine.

2468
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,110
It all depends on luck.

2469
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:48,750
That's right.

2470
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,800
All right! It's me!

2471
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,540
It's me!

2472
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:56,340
It's me!

2473
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,250
(Will it be Suk Jin or Jae Suk?)

2474
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,820
- It's me!
- Is it Jae Suk?

2475
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,330
Jae Suk.

2476
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:03,550
(Jae Suk got chosen!)

2477
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:04,920
- What is this?
- Hey!

2478
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:07,130
- What is this?
- Hey!

2479
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,000
He didn't put his name tag once.

2480
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:11,330
He didn't put his name tag once.

2481
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:14,130
(He got chosen
with 4 name tags on the roulette.)

2482
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:16,610
- This is absurd. I feel cheated!
- How did this happen?

2483
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:19,780
(Jae Suk's production objective
and comments will go up.)

2484
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:20,930
This is ridiculous.

2485
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:22,000
I feel so dejected.

2486
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Sun Myung, thank you.

2487
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,210
I feel so dejected.

2488
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:25,840
How did this happen?

2489
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,250
This show must be
Yoo Jae Suk's Running Man.

2490
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:29,340
It suits the production objective.

2491
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,950
It's 100 dollars per name tag,

2492
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:33,790
so he will receive 400 dollars
in gift cards.

2493
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,180
Jae Suk's production objective
and comments...

2494
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,250
will go up on the website.
If you want to add something...

2495
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,370
I will combine
what everyone wrote...

2496
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:44,330
- and use the comments I like.
- Okay.

2497
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:45,740
- My production objective was nice.
- What?

2498
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,260
- My production objective.
- All right.

2499
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:48,570
Please use "Mr. Dirty Mustache".

2500
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,260
I will add it. Don't worry.

2501
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,380
Se Chan's feet continue to stink
even without the socks.

2502
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,000
He needs to wash them.

2503
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,780
Come here for a second.
I will wash your feet.

2504
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:57,800
No.

2505
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,680
- You are a celebrity.
- My shoes...

2506
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,320
(We introduce Running Man
in Jae Suk's own words.)

2507
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,710
Variety shows are disappearing
these days.

2508
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,960
Running Man is Korea's favorite
variety show that's been...

2509
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,860
on Sunday nights for over 10 years.

2510
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,090
The members play games and clear
missions with various guest stars,

2511
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:19,200
as they go around
to different places.

2512
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,000
Among various fun factors,

2513
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,870
this show only focuses on laughter.

2514
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,930
Open your eyes.
Fun on a big scale will come.

2515
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:28,110
Open your mouth.
Laughter on a big scale will come.

2516
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:31,170
Open your heart.
A great lesson will come.

2517
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:32,450
(The photos Jae Suk chose...)

2518
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:34,040
(and the comments are
on the website as well.)

2519
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,180
Yoo Jae Suk. The Unchanging Goofball
of variety shows.

2520
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:38,550
He is the pride of Running Man.

2521
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:40,820
Ji Suk Jin.
The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong...

2522
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,160
who pretends to love his family.

2523
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,290
Kim Jong Kook.
In summer, he is Kim Nipple.

2524
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,830
In other seasons, he is Enema Kim.

2525
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:48,130
Haha. Mr. Dirty Mustache
who is the worst at acting young...

2526
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:50,530
among celebrities
who were born in 1979.

2527
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:53,540
Song Ji Hyo. Her real name is
Cheon Seong Im, Cheon Su Yeon.

2528
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:54,700
