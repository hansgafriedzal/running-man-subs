1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,920
(Running High School is known
to have unique students.)

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,590
- Are we all friends?
- Are we supposed to be friends?

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,030
- Hello.
- My goodness.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,240
Hey, Ji Hyo.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
(Today, Running High School
has school activities.)

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,760
Hello.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,760
(Running High School's beauty,
Ji Hyo is the first one to come.)

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,260
Ji Hyo, wait for me.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,640
Hurry up and come, Se Chan.

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,410
Ji Hyo. Why are you alone?

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,600
(Se Chan doesn't seem like a student
who's ready to study.)

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,320
- Hey.
- Hello, Haha.

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
Are you ready?

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,010
He's our leader. Leader Ha.

15
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,640
- Let's warm up.
- Okay.

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,960
All right then.

17
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,120
We're Dirty Mustache.

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,320
Let's play the music.
1, 2, 3, and 4.

19
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,300
(Dirty Mustache's masterpiece,
"Jauji Jangjijiji")

20
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,970
(It's a school band
made up of pretty Ji Hyo...)

21
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,590
(and the visually unpleasant
Se Chan and Haha.)

22
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,300
(Empty Head: The youngest
member of the band)

23
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,560
(Song Jeoktoma: Vocalist,
Dirty Mustache: Leader)

24
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,340
Good. You've still got it.

25
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,230
- You're our main vocalist for sure.
- She's amazing.

26
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,630
(They've been performing
only this song for 3 years.)

27
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,410
- You're our main vocalist.
- Shut it!

28
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,080
- Hello.
- I can't believe you guys.

29
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,410
- Are you a returning student?
- No, I'm not.

30
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,180
You punks.

31
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,910
- You're here.
- What's that?

32
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,380
- He's just a gangster.
- Why do you have a dumbbell?

33
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,190
You punk.

34
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,550
My gosh.

35
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,730
- Behave yourselves.
- We're friends.

36
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,180
Are we friends, you punk?

37
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,380
I repeated the same year
for five years.

38
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,050
- Five years?
- What?

39
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,650
- He's lying.
- It's a lie. It was for 10 years.

40
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,130
You repeated the same year
for 10 years.

41
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,230
- It was five years.
- Hey.

42
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,570
They are my friends.

43
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,600
- Sure.
- What?

44
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,540
Ji Hyo.

45
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,960
What?

46
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,630
You're pretty.

47
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,480
Ji Hyo, you look passionate today.

48
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,570
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- The main vocalist of our band.

49
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,380
(As the boys get interested
in Jo Hyo with a pretty face)

50
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,910
You have your own style? I see.

51
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,680
- Hey.
- What is it?

52
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,710
(She turned on the music.)

53
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,490
What? We're the dance team.

54
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,550
You're the dance team?

55
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,850
Gosh, what are you doing?

56
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,190
(The school band
gets ready as well!)

57
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,960
(The dance team members
show terrible dance moves!)

58
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,070
(This dancer specializes
in the Im Ha Ryong dance.)

59
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,240
Is this a school for troublemakers?

60
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,710
It's a school for troublemakers.

61
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,710
(No discipline at all)

62
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,480
(Dancing machines!)

63
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,980
So Min's very flexible.

64
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,350
This is a school for troublemakers.

65
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,210
Come on. We're the dance team.
You should be better.

66
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,880
(Tiger Moth, the tenacious one,
Big Nose, the founder of the team,)

67
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,050
What is that?

68
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,280
(and Protein Monster,
the protector of the members)

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,550
- This is not a school.
- The setting is weird.

70
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,330
I haven't done this in a long time.

71
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,330
(Strange dance team)

72
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,590
My goodness,
our dance team is really...

73
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,120
(Blowing a whistle)

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,200
What was that?

75
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,240
What is it?

76
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
- What is it?
- What is it?

77
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,560
- Turn off the music.
- Quiet down!

78
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,500
- Turn off the music.
- It's the Apgujeong Whistle.

79
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,870
What are you, a zebra?

80
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,210
Turn off the music.

81
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,110
- He's turning it off himself.
- Yes, you do that.

82
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,150
(Which club are they?)

83
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,810
- Student guidance club?
- Who are you guys?

84
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,620
What's with the noise
so early in the morning?

85
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,520
(Yoo Jae Suk, the top student,
the leader of student guidance club)

86
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,810
(Lee Kwang Soo, the informer
of student guidance club)

87
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,120
- They're the student guidance club.
- My gosh, student guidance club.

88
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,250
What's with your hair?
Are you out of your mind?

89
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,490
- What's with your mullet?
- Your mullet is weird too.

90
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,750
- Get a haircut.
- Yes, get a haircut.

91
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,400
- Gosh. Hello, sir.
- Hello, teacher.

92
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,170
- Good to see you, sir.
- Gosh, You're not a teacher?

93
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,430
I'm not a teacher.

94
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm a friend of yours.

95
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
- Aren't you the vice-principal?
- I'm a friend of yours.

96
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,210
Who told you to dance?

97
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,470
I apologize, sir.

98
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,080
- Hey.
- We'll control them.

99
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,240
But we're the dance team.

100
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,370
- What?
- We're the dance team.

101
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,270
But you can't dance
in front of the school.

102
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,520
You like to dance too.

103
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,580
I know you're the dance team, but...

104
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,310
Actually, he...

105
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,920
- failed the audition for our club.
- You're really good.

106
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,710
- He failed the audition.
- What's with that move?

107
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,990
He's doing this
because he failed the audition.

108
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,250
How can a student dance like that?

109
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,550
You're really good at this move.

110
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,990
(She learned the travel bus groove
at an early age.)

111
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,700
She's our best dancer.

112
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,800
Hey.

113
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,090
I can smell cigarettes
on your breath.

114
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,300
- Hey, leave him alone.
- Come here.

115
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
- Hey.
- Let him be.

116
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,580
- Give me your hands!
- Let him be!

117
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,930
- Hey!
- Give me your hands.

118
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,610
- I didn't smoke!
- Give me your hands.

119
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,080
- Just give me your hands.
- Hey.

120
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,180
(Ouch!)

121
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,710
(Slip)

122
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,120
How could you smoke
when you're a student?

123
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,390
- I didn't smoke!
- Are you out of your mind?

124
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,150
I said I didn't smoke.

125
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,050
I know you're much
older than we are.

126
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,250
- That's right.
- But you're still a student.

127
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,050
- You should listen to us.
- Hey.

128
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,800
- What?
- Actually, the cigarette smell...

129
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,560
is from Song Ji Hyo.

130
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,590
Gosh, that hurts.

131
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,770
They're tied to my real hair!
It hurts when you pull!

132
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,210
It hurts!

133
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,370
(The fluorescent hair
is tied to his real hair!)

134
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,460
It's tied to your hair?

135
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,840
- Hey.
- It hurts!

136
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,930
I'm sorry.

137
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,270
- Gosh, it really hurt.
- He didn't know.

138
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,900
- I'm sorry.
- Wasn't it attached to the hat?

139
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,370
What's wrong with you?

140
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,470
Wait a minute.

141
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,810
Which club are you from?

142
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,190
- Me?
- Dance team. We're the dance team.

143
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,250
The dance team.

144
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,780
- Why are you holding a dumbbell?
- This?

145
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,980
He's just a bully.

146
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,630
- You're a bully?
- Not a dance team member.

147
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,980
He looks like a bully
no matter what he wears.

148
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,720
He always looks like a bully.

149
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,330
As a member of
the student guidance club...

150
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,090
you should go
talk some sense into him.

151
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,630
Yes, talk some sense into him.

152
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,700
Or you could hit him.

153
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,860
(Staring at him)

154
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,070
- Talk to him.
- What?

155
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,100
(The leader of the student guidance
club never meddles in.)

156
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,900
- You were saying?
- Talk to him.

157
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,440
Just let me hit you once.

158
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,450
Then when it's all over,

159
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,010
I'll wire 50 dollars
to your account.

160
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,340
(Intimidated by the bully
from the dance team)

161
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,950
<i>Step by step</i>

162
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,950
- What?
- Who is it?

163
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,390
<i>- Oh, baby</i>
- Who is it?

164
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,710
Who's that?

165
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,890
Gosh, who's that?

166
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,560
Some more bullies are here.

167
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,590
<i>- Step by step</i>
- What is this?

168
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,220
<i>Oh, baby</i>

169
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,420
(Defconn, the heavyweight dancer
of the dance team)

170
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,160
He's a dance team member.

171
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,860
- Hello.
- Loyalty!

172
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,900
Loyalty!

173
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,660
(Kim Bo Sung, student guidance club
member who lives and die by loyalty)

174
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,160
Loyalty!

175
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,230
- Hello.
- Loyalty!

176
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,100
Loyalty!

177
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,880
- Loyalty!
- That hurts.

178
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,900
(50 percent of his conversation
is made up of "loyalty".)

179
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,950
That hurts!

180
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,010
I'm sorry.

181
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,150
Brother.

182
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,020
- How have you been?
- How have you been?

183
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,340
I've been good.

184
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

185
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,760
- Hello.
- It's good to see you.

186
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,150
Why do you look so nasty?

187
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,260
I'm a dance team member.

188
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,920
- Dance team?
- You're a dance team member?

189
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,280
- We're the dance team.
- You're one of us.

190
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,700
- Yes, you're one of us.
- Okay, good.

191
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,000
- I'm on student guidance club.
- You are?

192
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,020
Move.

193
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,270
You're a student guidance club
member and you have sideburns?

194
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,460
You have a problem with it?

195
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,570
You have a problem with it?

196
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,340
(Throwing his bag without notice)

197
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,030
He's serious. This isn't acting.

198
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,970
- Hey.
- What was that?

199
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,010
(You can't predict
what he's feeling.)

200
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,340
Gosh, he just turned violent.

201
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,510
Brother.

202
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,950
He reacts right away.

203
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,380
Yes, he does.

204
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,280
He doesn't give you notice.

205
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,980
How come a student guidance club
member has such a long mullet?

206
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,350
Yes, he has such a long
mullet and sideburns.

207
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,980
Student guidance club members
should set good examples.

208
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,480
How could you both have long hair?

209
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,920
Hey, quiet down.

210
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,830
- It's Gyu Jin.
- Hey, Gyu Jin.

211
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,500
Gyu Jin's here again?

212
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,770
Quiet down.

213
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,860
(Shin Gyu Jin
who paints a big picture!)

214
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,900
(On Comedy Big League...)

215
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,460
("Yang Se Chan,
when you're alone on Running Man,")

216
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,230
("you're not able to
paint a big picture either!")

217
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,070
(He gives Se Chan harsh criticism.)

218
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,580
(And when he was on Running Man
to paint a big picture,)

219
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,970
(he failed to paint a big picture.
Not even a rough sketch.)

220
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,410
(So he returned to the base.)

221
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,210
(Have you ever been on Running Man?)

222
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,420
(Then Shin Gyu Jin shows off
that he was on Running Man!)

223
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,830
Gosh, it's Gyu Jin.

224
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,830
- Then...
- Oh, he's here.

225
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,220
Gyu Jin's here again?

226
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,400
Gosh, it's Gyu Jin.

227
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,330
I thought his role was gone,
but he's back again.

228
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,900
(Shin Gyu Jin, the dean of students
is very nervous right now.)

229
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,230
- Hey, Gyu Jin.
- It's been months.

230
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,210
My goodness. Look at these brats.

231
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,010
Gosh, he really is like a teacher.

232
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,880
- What's wrong with you?
- He's like a real teacher.

233
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,040
It's been a while since we saw you.
Why do you look so haggard?

234
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,400
Hey, hey. Be quiet.

235
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,880
- But...
- Quiet down.

236
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,380
Don't you think you're the same as
the prison guard you played before?

237
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,650
- He's the dean of students.
- Which prison guard?

238
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,820
I don't know what you're
talking about.

239
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,410
- His acting is amazing.
- So today...

240
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,780
What happened to your skin?

241
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,920
It's rotten.

242
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,690
It's because
I didn't sleep well last night.

243
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,500
- Maybe the teacher's nervous.
- Were you nervous about today?

244
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,270
Why can't he sleep the day before
coming on Running Man?

245
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,290
Well, that's not what's important.

246
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,360
I am here today for a reason.

247
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,230
I'm here because today is
the day of dress inspection.

248
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,510
The dress inspection?

249
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,650
- He's checking our outfits?
- So everyone...

250
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,470
put all your personal belongings
on the floor.

251
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,540
Put your hands on your heads
and stand still.

252
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,650
- Personal belongings?
- Hurry up.

253
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,190
I don't want to hear you grumbling.

254
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,840
- Put everything on the ground.
- My goodness.

255
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,210
- Come on.
- Stop grumbling.

256
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,850
- Sir!
- First thing in the morning?

257
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,920
- This is too much.
- You can't do this to us.

258
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,060
Hey, hey.

259
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,650
This school is set in the 1980s,
so we have corporal punishment.

260
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,850
Corporal punishment?

261
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,160
We're in the 1980s?

262
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,130
- We're in the 1980s?
- He can hit us.

263
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,900
- Yes, they hit students back then.
- You're right. They did.

264
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,660
We got hit by the teachers
in the old days.

265
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,340
Okay, then.

266
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,960
- My goodness.
- Okay.

267
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,400
My goodness.

268
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,470
What is this?

269
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,670
Are you a gangster?

270
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,650
It's my father's.

271
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,970
- Your father?
- What's with the accent?

272
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,410
- "What does your father do?"
- Why is he using a weird accent?

273
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,110
Your father?

274
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,090
My goodness.

275
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,410
(The dean of students looks pleased
to role-play like he expected.)

276
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,590
Come here.

277
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,190
What does your father do?

278
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,460
(Confident)

279
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,830
What does your father do?

280
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,060
My father is a gangster.

281
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,420
A gangster?

282
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,900
(A gangster?)

283
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,340
- He doesn't know what to say.
- He can't improvise.

284
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,960
(He doesn't know how to improvise
after his first line.)

285
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,170
- So your father's a gangster?
- He can't improvise.

286
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,940
(What should I say?)

287
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,130
- Gosh.
- So your father's a gangster?

288
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,340
- Yes, take off your watch.
- I've seen this somewhere.

289
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,780
Sir, you saw him last week.

290
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,780
- What's wrong with him?
- The teacher is too nice.

291
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,590
Your hairstyle isn't appropriate
as a student.

292
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,510
Well, it's because
I'm a band member.

293
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,710
Do you need to have long hair
to be in the band?

294
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,030
- But I got permission.
- From who?

295
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,560
- From you.
- From me?

296
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,960
- Yes.
- It's my first day at this school.

297
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,220
So you're new here.

298
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,700
You get three penalty points.

299
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,130
My goodness.
You didn't pay for these, did you?

300
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,440
(Did you pay for this?)

301
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,410
This belongs to Dream.

302
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,630
This belongs to Dream.

303
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,080
- Gosh.
- Don't mess with Dream.

304
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,410
It's the only thing
you can't mess with.

305
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,950
- He has a child.
- You can't mess with his kid.

306
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,950
I'm sorry.

307
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,970
(I'm sorry.)

308
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,010
The teacher is too kind.

309
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,980
He has no backbone.

310
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,380
- Gosh, what's wrong with him?
- So kind.

311
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,850
It's so easy to convince him.

312
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,350
- Anyway, you get penalty points.
- All right.

313
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,720
- Remember that.
- Yes, sir.

314
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,980
Who's next?

315
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,430
- Hello, sir.
- It's been a while.

316
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,430
Yes, it has. You know me, don't you?

317
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,620
- Yes.
- Right.

318
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,220
- From his previous school?
- Yes, maybe.

319
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,440
Yes, I met him
at the previous school I went to.

320
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,170
- I just transferred to this school.
- You're a new student here?

321
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,910
Gosh, look at yourself.

322
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,860
- What do I do with you?
- What do you mean?

323
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,680
The shape of your hat is ruined!

324
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,230
Make it right.

325
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,950
(His unnatural acting
suddenly kills the mood.)

326
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,420
It's becoming slightly corny.

327
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,580
- "Make it right?"
- It's like a boring comedy show.

328
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,290
All right,
what do you want me to do?

329
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,350
- All right.
- Yes.

330
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,850
Let me see.

331
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,720
Doesn't your mom iron your uniform?

332
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,660
He doesn't know what to say.

333
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,350
Anybody would think that
his inner shirt is inappropriate.

334
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,800
- That's right. The scarf.
- His scarf is inappropriate.

335
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,070
Are you playing favorites with him?

336
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,570
Se Chan,
you don't get any penalty points.

337
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,230
- Oh, thank you.
- What?

338
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,070
- Thank you, sir.
- What was that?

339
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,180
- I'll be good to you tomorrow.
- Good, good.

340
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,580
- Are you two meeting tomorrow?
- No, we're not.

341
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,210
You're filming
Comedy Big League tomorrow, right?

342
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,050
- You brat!
- Gosh, you can't do this.

343
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,740
This darn world runs on
regionalism and kinship.

344
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,950
No, we're not.

345
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,210
Actually,

346
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,920
you can't call it that.
They have school ties.

347
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,950
He's right.

348
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,510
- Well, whatever it is...
- Suk Jin.

349
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,380
This isn't about
regionalism and kinship.

350
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,530
This is about school ties.

351
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,620
I can work with regionalism
but not kinship.

352
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,030
Now quiet down.

353
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,590
Ji Hyo is next.

354
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,120
Gosh, what do I do with you?

355
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,070
- Inside your uniform.
- She worked hard to look nice.

356
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,570
- You tried too hard to look nice.
- Seriously.

357
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,500
So you wore
a colorful turtleneck sweater.

358
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,340
Yes, but I did because
it was too cold.

359
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,940
(Talking in a cute voice)

360
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,100
Of course you did.

361
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,780
- My goodness, what?
- What on earth are you doing?

362
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,740
- Sir!
- What can you say? She was cold!

363
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,740
It's so cold these days.

364
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,350
All right, Ji Hyo.

365
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,790
Let me see your hair.

366
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,660
What is this? Isn't it
inappropriate for a student?

367
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,030
- It's funky style.
- You can't get a perm.

368
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,620
- I went to a beauty salon today.
- Yes.

369
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,700
And they told me it suits my style.

370
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,890
Yes, it does.

371
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,890
My goodness.

372
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,070
- What's he doing? It's ridiculous.
- You do look nice.

373
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,300
You should point out her problems.

374
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,230
- Is this your bag?
- Yes.

375
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,670
Let me check it.

376
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,780
- Hang on.
- Gosh, that...

377
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,370
- Please be careful.
- Why?

378
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,950
Nothing.

379
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,240
Am I not supposed to open it?

380
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,610
You can open it.

381
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,210
We're going to start it
from the Lunar New Year.

382
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,320
What is this?

383
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
I'm in the school band.

384
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,790
I carry a microphone around with me
so I can practice all the time.

385
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,960
Are you the vocalist?

386
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,460
- Sure.
- Actually, this is a lighter.

387
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,330
Hey, stay quiet.

388
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,390
I'll give you one penalty point.

389
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,430
You are spreading false information.

390
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,700
You get one penalty point.

391
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,730
Anyway, you have too many
colorful pins in your hair,

392
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,340
- so you get one penalty point.
- Good.

393
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,500
All right. One point.

394
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,580
Who's next?

395
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,180
I'm in the student guidance club.

396
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,640
How dare you
look down at your teacher?

397
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,340
- I'm in the student guidance club.
- All right. Student guidance?

398
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,920
- Sir, he has very long hair.
- But he doesn't shower.

399
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,060
- He's so filthy.
- You should cut his hair.

400
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,660
- Gosh.
- If you cut my hair,

401
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,120
- I'm okay with that.
- What?

402
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,220
Get him some scissors.

403
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,560
- I'm okay with that.
- What?

404
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,530
(Is he really cutting
Kwang Soo's hair?)

405
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,200
Do you not know
the school regulations?

406
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,800
If you want to cut my hair,
I'll let you do that.

407
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,260
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

408
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,460
(The student with the long hair
is so into the skit.)

409
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,230
If he wants to cut it,
I have to follow him.

410
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,840
- Here you are, sir.
- It's longer than I thought.

411
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,440
- Really?
- Is he serious?

412
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,580
Isn't this a skit?
Are we doing this for real?

413
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,000
We have no choice though.

414
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,280
- What?
- We have no choice.

415
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,370
The movie shoot is over.

416
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,340
- Here you are, sir.
- Really?

417
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,510
Cut it short please.

418
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,950
- It's too long.
- I know.

419
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,880
Isn't this a skit?
Are we doing this for real?

420
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,160
Cut it short please.

421
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,330
Sir, if you cut it...

422
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,090
Gosh, I think you've been
growing your hair for years.

423
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,930
- Yes. You can cut it.
- Are you okay with that?

424
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,930
- Sure.
- I think he's cutting it for real.

425
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,120
- He's really doing it.
- He's cutting the hair.

426
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,340
- I'm cutting it for real.
- I mean... Sure.

427
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,760
I'm not familiar with stuff like
this. I'm cutting it for real.

428
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,940
- Hey, he's doing it for real.
- This isn't a joke.

429
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,370
Are you sure about this?

430
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,630
- Sir.
- It's okay to cut it.

431
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,870
Go ahead and cut it.

432
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,500
He should get a haircut anyway.

433
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,970
Stop hesitating and cut it.

434
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,280
But the problem is...

435
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,510
If you get your hair cut,

436
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,090
Bo Sung will have to do the same.

437
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,480
(If you get your hair cut,
Bo Sung will have to do the same.)

438
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,920
(Me?)

439
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,930
- Bo Sung should do that too.
- So...

440
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,160
You should just get penalty points.

441
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,990
- All right.
- You should get penalty points.

442
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,060
- I get it.
- Just cut it.

443
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,120
Give me that.

444
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,090
So I will just...

445
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,490
- Give him penalty points.
- I'll give you five penalty points.

446
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,570
- Okay.
- This isn't acceptable.

447
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,940
All right. Next.

448
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,810
He's here. He's a member
of the student guidance club.

449
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,180
Gosh, his bag is like...

450
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,180
Hang on.

451
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,340
What is this?

452
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,340
Leather gloves.

453
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,080
- What are these?
- Gloves.

454
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
I know they are gloves.
But what's with the bumps?

455
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,450
In case of emergency...

456
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,790
- You're a student.
- It's called LA.

457
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,430
The loyalty of an angel.

458
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,290
(The loyalty of an angel)

459
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,700
- I always protect the weak.
- I see.

460
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,430
I protect the underprivileged.

461
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,220
- It's the student guidance club.
- Right.

462
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,590
You should give him
penalty points for his hair.

463
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,630
- Oh, his hair.
- He has long hair.

464
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,130
This is too long. What do you think?

465
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,080
You can cut it if you want.

466
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,780
Hang on. No, I won't...

467
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,600
I don't think I have to cut it.

468
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,180
You have very thin hair.

469
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,710
(I don't think I have to cut it.
You have very thin hair.)

470
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,210
(The angel's hair is very thin.)

471
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,510
You're being too serious.

472
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,350
- I mean...
- Sir, don't make fun of his hair.

473
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,350
- It's humiliating.
- Don't make fun of his thin hair.

474
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,380
- You should keep it to yourself.
- That's so mean.

475
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,620
You should show him something.

476
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,700
(He starts to swing chain sticks.)

477
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,800
He's your teacher.

478
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,360
(Swinging them hard)

479
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,700
(Stepping back)

480
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,440
Why are you swinging them at school?

481
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,210
- He hit his head.
- Tidy your hair.

482
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,680
He got hit in the head.

483
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,500
- Are you all right?
- It didn't go well.

484
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,950
Why are you swinging them now?

485
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,780
About your sunglasses.
Are those prescribed?

486
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,920
- Say yes.
- No, they're not.

487
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,980
They're not prescribed?

488
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,420
Then you should get penalty points.

489
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
- He's so nice that he can't lie.
- He's nice.

490
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,980
- He can't lie.
- He doesn't know what to say.

491
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,330
He just can't lie.

492
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,830
- Just say anything.
- He's so innocent.

493
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,430
- He just can't lie.
- He has such innocent eyes.

494
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,760
We're just doing a skit now.

495
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,030
He's got the eyes of a deer.

496
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,460
Go ahead and say a lie.

497
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,730
He didn't get
that many penalty points though.

498
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,810
- Hang on.
- Yes?

499
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,440
- Nice to meet you.
- Three penalty points.

500
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,470
Already?

501
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,000
I didn't do anything. Why?

502
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,140
You have a tough-looking face.

503
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,140
- What's wrong?
- And...

504
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,470
I was born this way.
What should I do?

505
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,970
And I understand you are
a growing student,

506
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,480
- but you should shave your face.
- What is Bo Sung doing?

507
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,790
What is he doing behind there?

508
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,380
Look at Bo Sung.

509
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,980
(The master martial artist doesn't
know the right time and place.)

510
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,930
- Why are you swinging those?
- What's wrong with you?

511
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,380
I didn't do it right earlier.

512
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,930
- Why do you keep swinging them?
- He has regrets.

513
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,990
All right. Next.

514
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,890
- I will check your uniform anyway.
- Okay.

515
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,670
But your headphones are
not connected to anything.

516
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,490
- They are in my bag.
- Those are hearing aids.

517
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,210
- Really?
- Hearing aids?

518
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,940
Hang on. The gold necklace...

519
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,630
It's a health necklace.

520
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,710
This is a health necklace.

521
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,730
Is it germanium?

522
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,680
Sir, he drives an electric car.

523
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,050
Why are you saying that?

524
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,510
- Why?
- We're doing this seriously.

525
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,740
- Why can't I say that?
- He cares about the environment.

526
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,320
- He cares about the environment.
- I do.

527
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,920
He's driving
an electric car already.

528
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,160
Really?

529
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,790
- You want to protect the earth.
- I do.

530
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,830
Next.

531
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,850
All right.

532
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,390
- They finally met.
- All right.

533
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,030
He's here.

534
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,030
(Hesitant)

535
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,030
(What should I do?)

536
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,960
- What is he going to do?
- I've been waiting for this moment.

537
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,260
- Gosh, this is...
- He wouldn't budge.

538
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,210
- Hey, kid.
- "Kid"?

539
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,680
Do you want to pick a fight with me?

540
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,910
Why is your posture so...

541
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,600
What's wrong with my posture?

542
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,140
- You look aggressive.
- Sir, he is...

543
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,340
addicted to protein.

544
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,510
He is?

545
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,640
- Sir.
- Yes?

546
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,110
Make sure you don't
run into me on the street.

547
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,830
(Make sure you don't
run into me on the street.)

548
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,930
(The protein addict
provokes his teacher.)

549
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,390
He's saying that to his teacher?

550
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,300
(He takes up
the protein addict's challenge...)

551
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
(without a backup plan.)

552
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,860
- He's taking off his watch.
- Sir.

553
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,330
He finally took off his watch.

554
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,860
- Get down.
- Get down.

555
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,310
Get down.

556
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,410
Go ahead and get down.

557
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,100
- Oh dear.
- You should punish him.

558
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,730
- You should hit him for real.
- It's okay. Go ahead.

559
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,840
- Get down.
- Get down.

560
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,410
You can do this for real.

561
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,680
Let's do this for real.

562
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,410
- All right.
- He's got a broad back.

563
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,940
You sound very rude to your teacher.

564
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,220
There you go.

565
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,260
(He sounds firm,
but his eyelids are fluttering.)

566
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,420
(Things are getting extreme,
but no one's trying to stop him.)

567
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,330
All right. There you go.

568
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,830
- Sir.
- Hang on.

569
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
(Hitting gently)

570
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,230
- The sound...
- Hang on.

571
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,090
- Wait, sir.
- What was that?

572
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,470
He's terrified.

573
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,540
What was that?

574
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,240
- My gosh. Sir.
- What are you doing?

575
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,370
You should be strict.

576
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,200
- I mean...
- You're the dean of students.

577
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,370
You're the dean.

578
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,980
It should have some impact.

579
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,670
- Why did you...
- It was just a gentle pat.

580
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,050
Anyway.

581
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,880
- Give him penalty points.
- Okay.

582
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,290
Just relax your chest.

583
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,410
I didn't tighten my chest.

584
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,560
You are threatening
enough already.

585
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,230
- So...
- He's intimidated.

586
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,260
You can't button up your jacket,
so you get one penalty point.

587
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,570
What about his fierce glare, sir?

588
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,270
- The defiant glare.
- What? You're still aggressive.

589
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,300
- He should get down again.
- He deserves five points.

590
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,810
I should look you in the eyes
when you talk.

591
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,400
His glare deserves
five penalty points.

592
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,340
- It deserves 5 points.
- He should get 15 points.

593
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,280
The teacher's authority is damaged.

594
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,550
You have to establish it already.

595
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,750
Sir, show us what you've got.

596
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,370
- Sir.
- You can do this.

597
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,790
How many penalty points?

598
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,140
- You're right.
- How many penalty points?

599
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,880
- Teacher.
- Teacher.

600
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,330
- Tell him to lie down.
- Teacher.

601
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,880
(The rookie comedian gets
carried away by their cheering.)

602
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,690
The teacher's authority
has been damaged.

603
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,850
- Get down.
- Show us what you can do.

604
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,500
- This is your last chance.
- Get down!

605
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,800
(Reckless)

606
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,430
(At this moment...)

607
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,660
- Tell him to get down.
- I'll get punished instead of him.

608
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,160
- Bo Sung.
- Go ahead and hit him.

609
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,400
(The angel of loyalty
steps up suddenly.)

610
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,640
Bo Sung.

611
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,400
Go ahead and hit him.

612
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,520
Teach him a lesson.

613
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
- You are a loyal friend.
- Loyalty.

614
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,990
- He's loyal.
- I'm loyal.

615
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,680
(The loyalty of an angel
protects even the strong.)

616
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,750
Hit him hard.

617
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,820
Hard?

618
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,350
- I'll hit you just once.
- He's so cool.

619
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,730
- There you go.
- You can hit me 10 times.

620
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,850
- I'll hit you just once.
- Loyalty.

621
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,150
- All right.
- Loyalty.

622
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,330
He's so loyal.

623
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
(Making a fuss)

624
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,930
(He got carried away
and lost control of his power.)

625
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,100
Hey, he's in his 50s.

626
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,510
Hey, Gyu Jin.

627
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,870
(It's so hard to be
an angel of loyalty.)

628
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,100
Bo Sung is...

629
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,370
Why did you hit me so hard?

630
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,680
(Why did you volunteer to get hit?)

631
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,990
Why did you hit me so hard?

632
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,380
- I was...
- You hit him gently earlier.

633
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,990
You are very loyal.

634
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,880
You know what?
What's really hilarious is...

635
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,890
that there was a puff of dust
from Bo Sung's pants.

636
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,090
Let me tell you why I got hit
instead of him.

637
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,770
He's really loyal.

638
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,310
In the show, "My Little Old Boy"...

639
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,630
If you don't want to get hit again,
just come here.

640
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,040
He gave me a padded vest.

641
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,870
- Just come here.
- He gave me...

642
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,700
- a padded vest as a gift.
- That's enough.

643
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,100
I'm a giver, actually. Not a taker.

644
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,340
He gave me a padded vest.

645
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,820
- All right. Next.
- It's in my car.

646
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,220
If you do something wrong again,

647
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,150
Bo Sung will get hit again.

648
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,520
- Okay.
- Behave yourself.

649
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,530
- Okay.
- Do you understand?

650
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,850
- Yes.
- Loyalty!

651
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,350
- Loyalty!
- Bo Sung is so cool.

652
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,800
He's a loyal friend.

653
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,000
He's the man of loyalty.

654
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,860
- Hello, sir.
- All right. You're very polite.

655
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,840
- The turtleneck sweater.
- Yes.

656
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,270
- One penalty point.
- I'm wearing it because it's cold.

657
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,040
Is that because it's cold?

658
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,010
You should try to endure it.

659
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,540
(He sounds shy but firm.)

660
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,940
- One point.
- So Min, that doesn't work for him.

661
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,520
- So Min, your wink doesn't work.
- Don't fall for her tricks.

662
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,220
He's as firm as a rock.

663
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,610
What is this thing?

664
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,320
The kids in the dance club
won't hang out with me...

665
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,380
if I don't wear these.

666
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,230
- She sounds annoyed.
- No, I'm not.

667
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,060
You should care
about your dance skills instead.

668
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,830
(She already has dance skills.)

669
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,090
She's a good dancer.

670
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,270
She does dance well.

671
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,500
- She's a good dancer.
- She's good.

672
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,890
- She dances well.
- You've got good dance skills.

673
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,100
- Right.
- You dance well.

674
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,240
- I go to school for...
- She's really good.

675
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,280
She's good.

676
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,540
This is how she comes to school.

677
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
(Please don't give me
penalty points.)

678
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,100
- Is this your jacket?
- No, this isn't mine.

679
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,610
- It's yours.
- You can throw this away.

680
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,220
- This belongs to Suk Jin.
- Is it mine?

681
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,990
I think it's Bo Sung's.

682
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,610
- Isn't this yours?
- Sir, I saw Bo Sung was wearing it.

683
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,790
That belongs to Bo Sung.

684
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,090
Right. It's Bo Sung's.

685
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,180
- Teacher.
- This is yours.

686
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,730
- It's not mine.
- It's yours. Put it on.

687
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,260
- This is yours.
- No.

688
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,800
I've never seen this before.

689
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,030
I saw that too.

690
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,770
- I saw him wearing it.
- It fits him perfectly.

691
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,660
- It really isn't mine.
- It looks good on him.

692
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,070
- It's not mine.
- He's genuinely flustered.

693
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,470
- It's not mine.
- He doesn't want to be punished.

694
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,280
I'll let it slide just this once.
Now...

695
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,580
Let me think. I think that's enough.

696
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,580
I got too many penalty points.

697
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,310
- Thank you, Teacher.
- Why did I get so many?

698
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,640
- I got too many...
- You got 12 points?

699
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,250
- I got too many penalty points.
- You got six points?

700
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,110
- Se Chan got no penalty points.
- He got 18 points.

701
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,520
Why didn't you
get any penalty points?

702
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,990
- I don't know.
- Exactly. Why didn't he get any?

703
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,150
- Gosh, seriously.
- I don't understand.

704
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,830
Today, we'll find the best club
in Running High School.

705
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,190
It's The Burning 18 Again.

706
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,620
- "The Burning 18"?
- The Burning 18 Again.

707
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,620
You'll be divided into three groups,

708
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,660
which are the student guidance club,
dance club, and band club.

709
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,270
The club that gains
the most club fund will win.

710
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,470
All the members of the winning club
will receive a scholarship.

711
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,870
- All right.
- Great.

712
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,310
Meanwhile, regardless of
the club fund,

713
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,050
there's a penalty point system.

714
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,480
The three students who get
the most penalty points...

715
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,110
will stay after the shoot
to carry out an annoying penalty.

716
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,560
I hate annoying penalties.

717
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,880
I hate it the most.

718
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,760
- That's what I hate the most.
- I hate it too.

719
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,090
As for the penalty points,
just like he did earlier,

720
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,120
the dean of students will watch you
during the missions,

721
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,860
and announce the final results
at the end of the show.

722
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,470
During the club activity time
after each class,

723
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,130
you will have a chance
to steal another club's fund.

724
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,130
Okay.

725
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,630
If you give school support donations
to the dean of students,

726
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,780
your individual penalty points
will be deducted.

727
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,310
- So use this chance wisely.
- It won't be easy.

728
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,400
School support donation? Gosh.

729
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,980
Each club's fund will determine
the winning team.

730
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,320
- Let's go to the first classroom.
- Okay.

731
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,380
- Okay.
- Yes.

732
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,340
(They will move to the classroom
for the 1st class!)

733
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,350
(This is where Running High School's
classes will officially begin.)

734
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,030
(The club name is written
in front of each seat.)

735
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,560
- The dance club is the best!
- We're the dance club.

736
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,730
The dance, dance, dance club.

737
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,000
(The dance club members are
the 1st to arrive.)

738
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,240
(Stay with me)

739
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,660
(Forever)

740
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,660
Haha, the song suits you.

741
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,860
He looks like the singer too.

742
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,370
Right. He does look like the singer.

743
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,100
He looks a bit like Lee Moon Sae
if you cover his eyes.

744
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,480
Not just a little bit.
My nickname was Lee Moon Sae.

745
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,670
- Really?
- Little Lee Moon Sae.

746
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,750
Some people confuse me with him.

747
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,840
Mr. Shin, are you going to
be with us throughout the shoot?

748
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Yes, Ms. Jeon, to the end.

749
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,910
I see.

750
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,110
He spoke formally to her.

751
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,590
Don't you have a meeting today?

752
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,380
- Oh, yes, I do,
- Yes.

753
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,800
but I play in the same comedy skit
with Mr. Yang.

754
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,760
I see you speak very politely
in real life.

755
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,160
- I didn't influence the decision.
- Is that so?

756
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,660
(Glancing)

757
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,570
(Jae Suk looked aside
and suddenly started giggling.)

758
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,100
(Why is he laughing suddenly?)

759
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,480
The stock prices of all the other
companies are going up...

760
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,430
except for the ones Suk Jin bought.

761
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,940
- What could be the reason?
- Suk Jin.

762
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,780
Why won't they go up
when the market is so rosy?

763
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,720
- Well, I guess...
- It's hard to believe.

764
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,520
And why did he get the blue sign?

765
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,650
He needs a red one.

766
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,090
- He's wearing red socks.
- You see,

767
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,350
I'm not joking. Only the ones
he bought won't go up.

768
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,620
- What's the reason?
- Why is that?

769
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,450
I don't know. I don't understand.
Why...

770
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,090
The first class is the subject
that you guys are worst at.

771
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,770
It's a moral education class.

772
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,510
- Gosh.
- What? I'm good at it.

773
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,100
- I'm really confident in it.
- Don't you know that?

774
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,100
My name is Moralconn.

775
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,580
I'm such a moral person.

776
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,740
- Moralconn?
- I'm Moralconn.

777
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,200
My nickname is Kim Moral.

778
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
The result of this class...

779
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,940
won't just determine...

780
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,640
- your club funds.
- Okay.

781
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,090
After the mission ends, Mr. Shin
will announce your penalty points.

782
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,450
You will get penalty points...

783
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,110
if you don't contribute
to the team's success...

784
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,560
or if you don't make people laugh.

785
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,180
All those things will be considered.

786
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,230
- We have to be funny too?
- Really?

787
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,760
Then do we gain an advantage
if we do something really funny?

788
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,230
- Of course, you do.
- Is that so?

789
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,390
(As soon as they heard the answer,
they started acting funny.)

790
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,040
(Imitating guitar sound)

791
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,360
(Imitating guitar sound)

792
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,660
What song is this?

793
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,130
- I don't know.
- All you guys do is scream.

794
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,740
- That's not funny at all.
- Exactly.

795
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,640
<i>- Respect, respect, be respectful
- Be respectful</i>

796
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,750
Do it with Ji Hyo.

797
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
- Respect, respect
- She can do it well too.

798
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,580
It ended when I took my mic out.

799
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,790
(Shouting together)

800
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,380
Hey, Ji Hyo. That doesn't suit you.

801
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,450
That's not true. What makes you
think so? I can pull it off.

802
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,450
Let's go, Song Jeoktoma.

803
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,920
(Let's go, Song Jeoktoma.
Giddy-up!)

804
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,500
(Imitating a running horse)

805
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,830
Ji Hyo is doing it reluctantly.

806
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,660
She didn't know what to do.
You didn't know, Song Jeoktoma.

807
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,070
- That was tacky.
- "Let's go, Song Jeoktoma."

808
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,360
- You say that first next time.
- By the way,

809
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,770
I want to join the band club.

810
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,040
Right? Didn't it make you
feel excited?

811
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,160
- They seem so energetic.
- Defconn.

812
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,570
- Let's do it too, Defconn.
- They give off a good vibe.

813
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,170
- That was exciting.
- We can do it too.

814
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,780
- We're the dance club.
- They're so cheerful.

815
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,140
You're right. We can do it.

816
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,080
- Suk Jin is a dance club member,
- We're the dance club.

817
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,370
but he's sitting
with his arms crossed.

818
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,480
- Dancers don't cross their arms.
- Exactly.

819
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,790
- Are you really in the dance club?
- Yes, I am.

820
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,560
- He just showed up one day.
- Oh, he just...

821
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
He joined the club
of his own accord.

822
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,760
Ji Suk Jin is in the dance club.

823
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
- Oh, that was what he meant?
- Yes.

824
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,330
- He joined us of his own accord.
- Loyalty!

825
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,850
Bo Sung, loyalty!

826
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,300
- Loyalty!
- Let's say "Guidance" instead.

827
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,690
Guidance!

828
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,270
- Good job.
- That's so him.

829
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,470
He's like a machine.
He does everything he's asked to do.

830
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,860
- He's like a machine.
- Are you really a human?

831
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,860
Aren't you a robot?

832
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,240
In the first class, you will learn
to be considerate of one another.

833
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,370
It's Break Up Strawberries
with Loyalty.

834
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,940
- Loyalty!
- Break Up Strawberries?

835
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,940
The strawberry game.

836
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,220
(You have to break up the syllables
of "strawberry" to the given beat.)

837
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,790
(1, St-raw-ber-ry)

838
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,650
(2, Straw-berry-straw-berry)

839
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,120
(3, Straw-berry
-strawberry-strawberry)

840
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,760
(4, Strawberry-strawberry
-strawberry-strawberry)

841
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,560
(They've played it before.
How well will they do this time?)

842
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,850
My goodness.

843
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,850
(You understand the rules, right?)

844
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,770
I don't think Bo Sung can
play this game.

845
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,660
It must be difficult for Bo Sung,

846
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,630
but Jae Suk is also
really bad at this game.

847
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,470
- We'll play the strawberry game?
- Yes.

848
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,310
- This is driving me nuts.
<i>- Strawberry-strawberry</i>

849
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,470
I'm worried about Bo Sung.

850
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,200
However, this time,
we'll have a team match.

851
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,370
For example, one of you said,
"Band, three."

852
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,340
The first member must begin.

853
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,670
If he says, "St-raw-ber-ry",

854
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,640
the other members have to
say twice more.

855
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,840
(St-raw-ber-ry, St-raw-ber-ry)

856
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,650
(St-raw-ber-ry)

857
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,260
And then you can attack
the other team.

858
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,350
(Student guidance club, 4!)

859
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,090
- I get it.
- The first member...

860
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,380
It's like the loyalty game.

861
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,390
It's a sort of loyalty game.

862
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,500
If someone says, "Dance, four",

863
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,470
Jong Kook will begin
as he's the first member.

864
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,070
I say, "St-raw-ber-ry".

865
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,930
- And you say, "St-raw-ber-ry".
- Oh, I get it.

866
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,570
- He says, "St-raw-ber-ry".
<i>- St-raw-ber-ry</i>

867
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,810
- I say, "St-raw-ber-ry".
- That's four.

868
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,370
Then I attack the other team.
Or he can say strawberry twice.

869
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,580
- And you say it twice too.
- I see. I get it now.

870
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,670
What does this game have to do
with moral education?

871
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,080
It's like the loyalty game.

872
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
It's a sort of loyalty game.

873
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,840
Can one person do it all at once
and attack the other team?

874
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Yes.

875
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,220
But the maximum number
for 1 person is 4.

876
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,340
Correct. You can say it
up to four times.

877
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,850
- Let's do some practice.
<i>- St-raw-ber-ry</i>

878
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,260
I'll attack you.

879
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,150
Bo Sung, three.

880
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,030
- St-raw...
- No. You're already out.

881
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,030
He just wants to get his penalty
points deducted.

882
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,830
- My gosh.
<i>- Straw-berry-strawberry-strawberry</i>

883
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,630

- Let's try it one more time.

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,570
- Bo Sung, three.

- Bo Sung.

890
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,870
It's so difficult for me.

891
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,370
I'll be honest.

892
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,220
I bet the student guidance club
will do worst among us.

893
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,550
Kwang Soo, it's hard to master
in one day.

894
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,350
Then there's no way we can win.

895
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,720
Team leaders,

896
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,260
play rock-paper-scissors
to decide the order.

897
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,450
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

898
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,150
Won't anyone
from that team come out?

899
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,300
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

900
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,560
Bo Sung, play rock-paper-scissors.

901
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,360
No, not with me.

902
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,800
Please keep it together.

903
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,240
- I'm confused.
- He can't keep it together.

904
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,500
- You don't play it with me.
- Okay. Here we go.

905
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,310
<i>- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors</i>
- Oh, yes.

- She's playing the game too.

907
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,480
(He got excited
when no one won.)

908
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,870
- She's playing the game too.
- Oh, right.

909
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,870
He can't even play this game. How
will he play the strawberry game?

I really don't want to
let that team win.

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,780
(Okay. That was good.)

927
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,200
You chose seven. That was brilliant.

928
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,080
- 7!
- 7 was a good choice.

929
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,170
That was unexpected.

930
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,780
Haha, I didn't know
how many times you said it.

00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,520
- But... I mean...
- Oh, yes!

932
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,560
Jae Suk, we needed to do
some warm-up first.

933
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,850
You should've called a number
between 1 to 4.

934
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,090
- But you called seven.
- I don't care.

935
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,120
- Seven was a good choice.
- It was difficult.

936

- Why don't you...
- You two...

938
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,260
Bo Sung, just say it once.
Or maybe twice?

939
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,070

Seriously?

1023
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,440
(He ignores the standard beat.)

1024
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,220
- Suk Jin!
- He wasn't wrong though.

1025
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,590
He only twisted the beat a little.

1026
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,750
- It was him being laid-back.
- That's not allowed.

1027
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,750
<i>St-raw-ber-ry</i>

1028
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,760
- That's not allowed.
- See?

1029
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,060
- Seriously?
- I got confused.

1030
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,490
- How can you get this wrong?
- I mean...

1031
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,620
You said two.

1032
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,190
- Only one.
- We agreed to do one each.

1033
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,420
- 1 each.
- Why did I hear 2?

1034
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,270
- Unbelievable.
- Seriously?

1035
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,890
- Hey.
- Do it properly, will you?

1036
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,970
- You got it wrong too, you know.
- What?

1037
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,160
You got it wrong earlier too.

1038
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,810
- Hey, you.
- Did you just hit me?

1039
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,930
- What do you think you're doing?
- Seriously?

1040
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,370
- I'm sorry.
- Listen to the teacher.

1041
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,930
- The teacher's here.
- The teacher's with us.

1042
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,580
Hear me out though, sir.

1043
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,980
We're all allowed to make mistakes.

1044
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,200
You made a mistake
on an easy one though.

1045
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,370
- Jong Kook!
- Yes?

1046
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,640
You've been
making too many mistakes.

1047
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,870
Me?

1048
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,990
You...

1049
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,490
Bo Sung, get out here.

1050
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,680
- He's already limping.
- But...

1051
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,910
Why him?

1052
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,880
- Can't you see he's limping?
- Just let him be.

1053
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,800
- Get on the floor.
- Hold on.

1054
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,120
I'm not kidding when I say
Bo Sung's on the older side.

1055
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,270
Bo Sung, you can get up now.
I talked to the teacher.

1056
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,390
- You can get up now.
- That's right.

1057
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,570
(He gets a pass
thanks to his old age.)

1058
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,160
Jong Kook. Make a mistake...

1059
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,840
- and Bo Sung will get punished.
- got it.

1060
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,630
- Don't intimidate others.
- Got it, sir.

1061
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,480
- All right.
- Let's go.

1062
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,100
Okay, let's get this party started!

1063
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,480
- Let's party.
- Begin the party.

1064
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,220
- Let's party.
- I'd love to join that club.

1065
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,940
We can be just as festive, you know.

1066
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,290
Let's have fun too.

1067
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,640
- As if.
- Just do one. Don't get confused.

1068
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,850
- All right.
- Why don't we swap seats?

1069
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,990
Just do it once.

1070
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,120
<i>St-raw-ber-ry
</i>That's all you have to say.

1071
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,180
Just the one.

1072
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,330
Before we begin,

1073
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,160
when they call our group,

1074
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,090
start by saying "Loyalty" first.

1075
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,270
Let's do this.

1076
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,270
(The familiar word
has him all confused.)

1077
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,310
What are you doing?

1078
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,770
- He's messing with me, right?
- Of course.

1079
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,770
- Right?
- Just say "St-raw-ber-ry".

1080
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,900
Are you kidding me?

1081
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,040
Bo Sung...

1082
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,050
Bo Sung was actually considering it.

1083
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,340
Se Chan told Bo Sung...

1084
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,550
to say "Loyalty"
before playing the game.

1085
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,090
And Bo Sung actually considered it.

1086
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,410
(The innocent man
almost fell for the trick.)

1087
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,720
Don't say it, okay?

1088
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,490
- Got it.
- All right?

1089
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,790
- Don't confuse me.
- Got it.

1090
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,180
- Don't overdo it.
- Got it.

1091
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,650
- We'll start with Haha.
- Haha goes first.

1092
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,390
- Let's do this.
- 1, 2,

1093
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,730
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,770

and missed his beat.)

1098
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,270
You had me all confused.

1099
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,780
The beat was off.

1100
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,100

1101
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,840

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,680
Okay, let's make them lose.

1106
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,180
We can't seem to go
back and forth though.

1107
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,060
And go.

1108

00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,840
Was the beat off?

1119
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,010
When Suk Jin was told
to do better himself,

1120
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,100
he stepped backward saying,

1121
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,410
"What do you mean?"

1122
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,640
- Do better yourself?
- What...

1123
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,410

- Stay behind after school.

1126
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,990
- Get out here.
- Shut it.

1127
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,320
- Are you kidding me?
- Bo Sung!

1128
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,530

00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,530

1131
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,600
Get back here.

1132
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,320
- Why...
- Why are you twirling that?

1133
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,870
- This...
- Why are you angry at me though?

1134
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,070
Is this even real?

1135
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,370
Well,

1136
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,100
he gave me his jacket, right?

1137
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,760
So you were defending me?

1138
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,970
- That's right.
- You were being loyal.

1139
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,180
- Loyalty!

1140
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,850
I should give him one too then.

1141

00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,820
Let's not play this game!

1188
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,840
Why can't you focus?

1189
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,760
- But he...
- Let's sit back down.

1190
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,740
Didn't you play games like this
on "2 Days and 1 Night"?

1191
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,100
Not games like this.

1192
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,340
This is driving me crazy.

1193
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,530
- Right.
- It's your turn.

1194
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,340
- Just give us a game console.
- Suk Jin, take his seat.

1195
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,740
Can't we play games
like Street Fighter?

1196
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,850
- Change seats.
- Okay, we'll change seats.

1197
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,570
The smartest member should go first.

1198
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,220
Can you be this bad?

1199
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,280
I wouldn't be as bad as you though.

1200
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,490
You're all so bad.

1201
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,530
- Suk Jin, do well.
- Don't you worry.

1202
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,660
Don't worry.

1203
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,390
- He'll be all right.
- I'm not bad, you know.

1204
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,320
- Are you sure?
- 1, 2,

1205
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,890
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

1206
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,390
<i>- I like strawberries
</i>- Why though?

1207
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,760
<i>- I like straw-berries
</i>- Why though?

1208
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,100
- I like them all.
- But why?

1209
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,600
- I just do.
- Why?

1210
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,800
- I just like them all.
- Why?

1211
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,160
- I just do.
- But why?

1212
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,180
- Sweet, tasty, and sour.
- What about apples?

1213
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,510
<i>What about apples?</i>

1214
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,780
<i>Apples?</i>

1215
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,200
<i>Apples are tasty but expensive</i>

1216
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,780
(He was robbed of his timing.)

1217
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,780
- Just do it already!
- Strawberries...

1218
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,280
<i>How about grapes?</i>

1219
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
<i>I hate the seeds!</i>

1220
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,950
<i>Strawberry seeds
burst pleasantly in your mouth</i>

1221
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,220
<i>How about grapes?</i>

1222
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:22,490
<i>Then what about muscat?</i>

1223
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,600
<i>Muscat!</i>

1224
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,820
<i>Expensive!</i>

1225
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,570
<i>- How about grapes?
- It's 25 dollars for 3 clusters</i>

1226
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,600
<i>- Muscat!</i>
- What about geobong?

1227
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
<i>What if it's made into juice?</i>

1228
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,640
<i>In order to make juice,
we need a juicer</i>

1229
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,180
<i>Which means I need 50 dollars
to buy the juicer</i>

1230
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,570
<i>I need 50 dollars to buy the juicer</i>

1231
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,350
<i>I have no money, no money at all</i>

1232
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,990
<i>I have no money</i>

1233
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,590
<i>- I'd rather have strawberries!
</i>- Game...

1234
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,180
- Let's change the game to this.
- 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.

1235
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,550
<i>- I like strawberries
- How about apples?</i>

1236
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,050
(Wasn't it over?)

1237
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,490
<i>How about apples?</i>

1238
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,660
<i>Apples are only good in the morning</i>

1239
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,890
(Apples are only good
in the morning?)

1240
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,430
<i>- I like strawberries
- How about kiwis?</i>

1241
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,660
(The questions continue.)

1242
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,470
<i>New Zealand kiwis are the best</i>

1243
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,700
I like kiwis.

1244
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,640
<i>4 kiwis at the price of 10 dollars</i>

1245
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,470
<i>When on sale,
you can get 6 for 10 dollars</i>

1246
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,640
- How...
- When on sale?

1247
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,950
Why are they more expensive
when on sale?

1248
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,850
- When on sale?
- Why though?

1249
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,280
- They're more expensive on sale.
- How's that possible?

1250
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,780
I'm proud of you.

1251
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,180
Why aren't you starting the game?

1252
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,280
(He brings out
his nunchucks again.)

1253
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,530
Just start the game!

1254
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,620
You startled us.

1255
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,760
Why would you run out like that?

1256
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,070
This isn't how you act here.

1257
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,390
- No?
- Of course not.

1258
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,760
He's the one you should be angry at.

1259
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,340
So shut it!

1260
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,870
- Okay, fine.
- It's so funny that I'm crying.

1261
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,100
The game just won't start.

1262
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,200
I'll make sure that Suk Jin
can never start the game.

1263
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,430
I love the strategy.

1264
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,070
Shut it. Just shut it!

1265
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,320
- I'm proud of you.
- He keeps answering me though.

1266
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,870
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

1267
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,350
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

1268
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,010
- Band, four.
<i>- Straw-berry-straw-berry</i>

1269
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,390
<i>Straw-berry-straw-berry</i>

1270
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,030
<i>Straw-berry-strawberry-strawberry</i>

1271
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,390
Why?

1272
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,530
What I said made four.

1273
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,160
- Really?
- Then you should've attacked.

1274
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,930
Right, I should've.

1275
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,070
I was going to,
but you beat me to it.

1276
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,070
- Really?
- You idiot!

1277
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,490
Even Dream could do better.

1278
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,740
What did you just say?

1279
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,600
(Dream's father explodes.)

1280
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,680
(Swearing)

1281
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,100
(Jong Kook gets up.)

1282
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,410
You...

1283
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,910
Did it end with you?

1284
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,370
Yes, I said enough to make four.

1285
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,780
Bo Sung...

1286
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,280
- Bo Sung took out his nunchucks.
- Hold on.

1287
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,550
- He...
- Did you see that?

1288
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,260
Why do you keep
taking out your nunchucks?

1289
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,260
(His nunchucks appear every time
someone challenges Jong Kook.)

1290
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,430
Why do you keep
pulling out your nunchucks?

1291
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,490
We're one unit, you know.

1292
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,700
What kind of winter jacket
did you give him?

1293
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,490
(Could he be loyal
to the padded jacket?)

1294
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,840
- Loyalty.
- Loyalty!

1295
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,890
All right.

1296
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,010
The three teams are at a tie.

1297
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,030
All right, then.

1298
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,200
We only need to get it right once.

1299
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,740
It's all about who you attack.

1300
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,470
Just one.
We only need to get it right once.

1301
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,570
Right.

1302
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,740
The dance club will be called.

1303
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,720
(The band club gets ready
once again.)

1304
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,970
(Haha, the vocal drummer)

1305
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,140
(Yang Se Chan, backup vocals)

1306
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,820
(A cappella instrumental band)

1307
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,320
<i>- Strawberries
</i>- Are you hearing this?

1308
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,890
<i>Strawberries, strawberries</i>

1309
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,780
<i>When will they be in season?</i>

1310
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,450
(Song Ji Hyo, main vocalist)

1311
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,490
When will you begin the game?

1312
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,490
(Song Jeoktoma's dance break)

1313
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,570
- Ji Hyo doesn't want to do it.
- She hates it.

1314
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,740
- She...
- Did you see her?

1315
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,700
Just get on with the game!

1316
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,530
<i>Stop fooling around
and begin the game!</i>

1317
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,030
Ji Hyo would probably want
to be in the student guidance club.

1318
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,800
- We're just as strict, you know.
- The student guidance club.

1319
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,220
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

1320
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,220
- Student guidance, five.
- Straw...

1321
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,680
- Student guidance, five.
<i>- St-raw-ber-ry</i>

1322
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,280
- Why would you say it?
- Hold on.

1323
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,390
(He called
the student guidance club, but...)

1324
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,260
Why would you say it instead?

1325
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,200
- Why...
- Suk Jin, why?

1326
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,160
I killed 2 birds with 1 stone.

1327
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,300
Why would you say it...

1328
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,870
when he targeted
the student guidance club?

1329
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,930
The two clubs start with
a completely different letter.

1330
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,600
- Why didn't you target us?
- S and D, right?

1331
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,760
Before...

1332
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,910
- I'm not even angry anymore.
- But...

1333
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,530
Were you hearing things?

1334
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,450
Why would you answer...

1335
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,780
when he targeted the other team?

1336
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,970
I'm sorry.

1337
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,350
Would you like
to go first this time?

1338
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,590
Nice.

1339
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,720
- But...
- Just know...

1340
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,910
that this isn't an easy position.

1341
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,510
All you have to do is say one.

1342
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,780
- Just one.
- It's not easy at all.

1343
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,680
- All you have to do is say one.
- Then take the seat.

1344
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,280
Just do one each.

1345
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,430
We're the dance club,
so let's dance beforehand.

1346
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,700
- I'd rather not.
- But we're the dance club!

1347
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,890
But we're the dance club.

1348
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,490
- What kind of dance club...
- Why...

1349
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:23,990
(She's dancing alone in the end.)

1350
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,470
<i>- I like strawberries
</i>- She's dancing alone.

1351
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,510
<i>- I like strawberries
</i>- Hold on a second.

1352
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,510
Hang on.

1353
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,570
This is practically
a school talent show.

1354
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,200
- Let's dance together.
- You guys...

1355
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,280
- They look like the parents.
- You let her dance alone.

1356
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,010
This is not So Min's talent show.

1357
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,680
- Why would she dance alone?
- Let's dance together.

1358
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,910
<i>Strawberries, strawberries
</i>Let's dance together.

1359
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,590
- Why won't any of you do it?
- Okay. Let's do it.

1360
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,260
- Let's do it.
- Jong Kook won't even listen.

1361
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,030
- I'm so upset because of him.
<i>- Strawberries, strawberries</i>

1362
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,760
- I'm not in the mood for dancing.
<i>- Straw-straw</i>

1363
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,890
<i>- Straw
</i>- I'm so upset.

1364
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,760
(He got excited
without grasping the situation.)

1365
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,760
<i>- Strawberries
- How about pineapples?</i>

1366
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,910
<i>Pineapples have so many spikes</i>

1367
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,930
<i>- Strawberries are the best
- Then what about shine muscat?</i>

1368
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,280
(This is crazy.)

1369
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,140
(They begin the game
before it goes on longer.)

1370
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,320
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

1371
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,870
Student guidance, eight.

1372
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:11,950
<i>Guidance-guidance-guidance</i>

1373
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:12,990
(Jae Suk was taken aback.)

1374
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,620
Give me another chance.
Let me do it over again.

1375
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,890
- I was preoccupied.
- Only Bo Sung must be at ease.

1376
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,090
I was preoccupied.

1377
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,850
- The dance club!
- Bo Sung's position is the best.

1378
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,660
- You should focus on the game.
- I know.

1379
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,700
We're the winning team now.

1380
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,870
- Nice.
- It's hard.

1381
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,620
- We must not be in last place.
- We can do this.

1382
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,990
Bo Sung will begin the game.

1383
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,370
- Okay.
- You can attack another team.

1384
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,570
- Attack?
- Attack.

1385
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,030
Attack the band club, Bo Sung.

1386
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,740
- Okay.
- Attack the student guidance club.

1387
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,180
- Okay.
- No, attack the band club.

1388
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,010
Why did you say okay?
We're the student guidance club.

1389
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,950
- Hey!
- Don't say "student guidance".

1390
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,140
- Never do that.
- Never say "student guidance".

1391
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,510
Got it. Understood.

1392
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,180
(Se Chan could have tricked
Bo Sung again.)

1393
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,240
Do you want us to play
the cymbals?

1394
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,320
- Should we be ambitious?
<i>- Straw-berry</i>

1395
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,780
(Imitating cymbals)

1396
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,990
(The band club's performance
before the final round)

1397
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,700
<i>Here goes Jae Suk</i>

1398
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,620
(Dancing)

1399
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,660
- Come on.
<i>- Here goes Jae Suk</i>

1400
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,140
We're the dance club,
but we never dance.

1401
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,340
(The other members
won't even budge.)

1402
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,260
(Chug, chug, puff, puff)

1403
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,910
(Chug, chug, puff, puff,
chug, chug, puff, puff)

1404
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,300
(The strawberry train is
about to leave.)

1405
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,410
(How exciting.)

1406
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,720
(A cheer captain got on the train
out of the blue.)

1407
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,140
When are you going to begin?
Hurry up.

1408
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,590
<i>- Strawberries, strawberries
- Strawberries, strawberries</i>

1409
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,620
(The final chant is
getting close to the climax!)

1410
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,950
- 1, 2. 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

1411
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,350
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

1412
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,490
(Bo Sung will begin the round.)

1413
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
Student guidance, eight.

1414
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,240
(Student guidance, 8!)

1415
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Student guidance, eight.

1416
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,740
(The most hilarious finale)

1417
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,870
What just happened?

1418
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,510
- You should've continued.
- You should've said it.

1419
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,820
- Why didn't you say it?
- You should've said strawberries.

1420
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,450
- No. They failed.
- You should've continued.

1421
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,970
- We won.
- No. Hang on.

1422
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,590
- This isn't fair.
- It's all because of him.

1423
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,990
- I mean, he...
- My gosh.

1424
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,660
- Just admit it.
- No, it's not fair.

1425
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,180
You should've said it
because he called your team.

1426
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,120
I told you that we're
the student guidance club.

1427
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,550
- No, it's okay.
- You could've continued.

1428
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,030
- It's okay, Bo Sung.
- No, we couldn't.

1429
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,950
- You could've said strawberries.
- The game would've continued...

1430
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:04,970
if you had said it.

1431
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,890
- It's either dance or band.
- We would've accepted it.

1432
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,140
Exactly. We would've continued
the game if they said it.

1433
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,410
The band club won the game.

1434
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,870
(The band club came in 1st.)

1435
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,340
The dance club is in second place,

1436
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,570
and the student guidance club is
in third place.

1437
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,640
It's not so bad.

1438
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,600
You will receive the club funds
in a little while.

1439
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,140
- Let's go.
- It's over. It was nice.

1440
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,370
- It's over.
- That was funny.

1441
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,320
- Good job, everyone.
- Thank you, Sir.

1442
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,120
(It's time to announce
the penalty points.)

1443
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,760
Some of you got penalty points
while playing the game.

1444
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,780
- Why five points?
- What?

1445
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,930
Why did I get penalty points?

1446
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,990
Yoo Jae Suk got five points.

1447
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,450
- Great.
- And...

1448
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:36,620
- Why did Defconn get 3 points?
- Why did I get 5 points?

1449
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,600
Why did I get three points?

1450
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,300
First, Jae Suk did such a poor job
playing the game.

1451
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,700
(He got penalty points
because he was bad at the game.)

1452
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,300
- That's true.
- He can't deny it.

1453
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,430
I gave him five points because
he ruined the flow of the game.

1454
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,180
Then what about me?

1455
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,410
Se Chan, you were too sly.

1456
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,410
That's true.

1457
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,570
You were too sly.

1458
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,140
- So I gave you three points.
- What about me?

1459
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,720
Defconn, you failed to keep
your appearance neat and tidy.

1460
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,950
But he was like this
from the beginning.

1461
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:01,950
Aren't you just teasing him?

1462
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,910
- My appearance has nothing to do...
- He keeps saying it.

1463
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,530
Does that mean he'll get
penalty points in every mission?

1464
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,220
Will he get penalty points
every single time?

1465
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,700
You could cover yourself a little.

1466
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,720
- Cover what?
- How? What should I do?

1467
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,870
Aren't you just teasing him?

1468
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,300
Now, I'll explain to you
about the club activity...

1469
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,910
- after the lunch break.
- Okay.

1470
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,370
- Each club will receive funds.
- Yes.

1471
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,740
After that, go to your club rooms,

1472
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,450
and hide the money
in different places in the rooms.

1473
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,890
However, you must hide
all the money you receive.

1474
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,680
You shouldn't keep any of it.

1475
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,350
You're not allowed
to hide the money...

1476
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,050
- on your bodies.
- Got it.

1477
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,220
Next, choose one member
from your club.

1478
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,320
To find the money?

1479
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,720
That person will be blindfolded...

1480
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,820
Blindfolded?

1481
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,490
and will guard the club room.

1482
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,340
As for the other club members...

1483
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,300
They have to go to
the other club rooms...

1484
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,840
and find the money
hidden in the rooms.

1485
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,910
You can hit them
with a toy hammer.

1486
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:58,950
- That means you're out.
- Exactly.

1487
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,740
- If you get hit by the toy hammer,
- Yes.

1488
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,470
- you're automatically out.
- Oh, I see.

1489
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,850
The total amount of the money
you steal...

1490
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,390
and the money you keep safe
will be your club fund.

1491
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:14,600
Also, if you think you got
too many penalty points,

1492
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,300
you can give me
school support donations,

1493
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,390
and I'll deduct 1 point
for 10 cents.

1494
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,430
- 10 cents?
- So...

1495
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,570
if you want to get a deduction,
come to see me quietly.

1496
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:25,870
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1497
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,470
- I'll give you your club funds now.
- How much is it?

1498
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,070
The club in first place...

1499
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:33,370
- Only 1 dollar?
- 50 cents, 70 cents, and 1 dollar.

1500
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,070
- How much?
- 50 cents.

1501
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,180
Now, you may go to
your club rooms.

1502
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,720
We should hide our money well
and find their money well.

1503
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,260
The dance club!

1504
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,510
The dance, dance, dance club.

1505
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,220
(The club rooms are decorated
just like the old days!)

1506
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,930
All right. Let's hide our money.

1507
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,820
Let's go.

1508
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,890
(No mullets)

1509
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,490
- Think about where to hide it.
- Okay.

1510
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,340
We shouldn't hide it where they can
see upon the entrance.

1511
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,660
(The band club members actually
started their club activity.)

1512
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,870
(I like it so much)

1513
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,430
(Americano)

1514
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,240
(I like it)

1515
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,140
(What should I do?)

1516
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:11,490
I only try to make myself look cool.

1517
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,660
That's all I care about.
Even when I'm so bad at singing.

1518
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:18,390
(They started playing a song
inspired by the strawberry game.)

1519
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,760
(They're too busy
making themselves look cool.)

1520
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,600
(It looks like a religious meeting
to worship strawberries.)

1521
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,470
Gosh, those punks.

1522
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,890
They're so loud.

1523
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:30,890
(They're annoying the other teams
by making noise.)

1524
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,700
I want to perform
in front of people.

1525
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,840
Like a busker.
Although I'm a lousy singer.

1526
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,200
Did you enjoy my song?

1527
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,280
(He's only trying to look cool.)

1528
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:42,740
Well, I think I haven't even done
half of it yet.

1529
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,990
- Are you ready to have fun?
- Yes!

1530
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,390
Next, I'm going to sing a song
by the singer you all love...

1531
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:52,950
- Do you know Jason Mraz?
- Yes.

1532
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,100
I'll sing "I'm Yours".

1533
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,120
(He'll really sing
such a romantic song?)

1534
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,760
("I'm Yours".)

1535
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,820
Give me the beat.

1536
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,200
(Here comes the beat.)

1537
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,240
(Singing gibberish)

1538
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,800
(Half air, half scat)

1539
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:14,010
(He turned the song
into a scat song without lyrics.)

1540
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,350
I don't know the lyrics.

1541
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,820
(Bas, bo, okay)

1542
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,050
(Singing gibberish)

1543
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:24,620
(His weakness is
his poor English proficiency.)

1544
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,030
(I'm yours)

1545
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,890
You may start hiding your money.

1546
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:30,950
We should start hiding the money?

1547
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,700
(The other clubs started
hiding their money!)

1548
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,100
Roll it and put it inside
so they can't see it.

1549
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:41,410
(Jae Suk is leading the team
as if he has a lot of experience.)

1550
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,470
Okay.

1551
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,140
(Where should I hide it?)

1552
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,570
But you see...

1553
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:48,050
Jae Suk, wouldn't hiding it here
stall for time?

1554
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,140
- They'll find it easily.
- Really?

1555
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,350
- That's not good enough.
- Is that so?

1556
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,720
(While pretending to be
helping them, Kwang Soo...)

1557
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,180
It might take them a long time.

1558
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,260
They might waste their time here.

1559
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,780
(He's taking out the money he hid
while looking at them.)

1560
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,760
(Kwang Soo stole the money
while Jae Suk was looking away.)

1561
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,950
How about under the cushion?

1562
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:07,100
(He's planning to use it
to get his penalty points deducted.)

1563
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,870
(Jae Suk and Bo Sung
didn't notice it.)

1564
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:12,740
How about under the cushion?

1565
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,600
- Shall we hide it under there?
- I'm not sure.

1566
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,970
(While the members of the 3 clubs
are busy hiding their money...)

1567
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,350
(Looking around)

1568
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:22,470
Here you go.

1569
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:24,850
(Haha gave
a school support donation.)

1570
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,890
You got a lot of penalty points.

1571
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:29,050
The team in 2nd place
received 70 cents,

1572
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,490
- so get three points deducted.
- Okay.

1573
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,720
- Ji Hyo, we'll be fine, right?
- Okay.

1574
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,030
Here.

1575
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,660
(Haha got 3 points deducted
thanks to his loyal club members.)

1576
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,570
You will leave your club rooms
in 10 seconds.

1577
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,340
You can kill them
with that toy hammer, right?

1578
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,640
- Of course, I can.
- Okay.

1579
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,070
- I can hit them with my fist.
- 10,

1580
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,700
9, 8...

1581
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,240
- Grab them first.
- Can I grab them?

1582
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,850
- 6, 5...
- Keep our money safe.

1583
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,410
- Keep our money safe.
- Okay.

1584
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,820
- Three.
- Loyalty!

1585
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,950
- Two.
- Loyalty!

1586
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,180
- 1.
- 1.

1587
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,450
Loyalty!

1588
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,320
- The loyalty of an angel.
- Find their money.

1589
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,010
- Here we go. We can do it.
- Let's go!

1590
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,390
- Good luck, guys.
- Jong Kook, good luck.

1591
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,760
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo are going
straight to the dance club room.)

1592
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:11,760
(Solemn)

1593
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,390
Are you going to tell me
if someone comes in?

1594
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,430
(He already got scared
by how he looks.)

1595
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,800
(It means he won't let anyone
steal even 10 cents.)

1596
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,370
(Jong Kook's
impenetrable defense...)

1597
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,100
(scared them and made them
walk out for now.)

1598
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,640
Gosh, I'm so scared.

1599
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,640
(She's terrified.)

1600
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,550
I'm so scared of him
that I can't live anymore.

1601
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,850
(Bo Sung is swinging the hammer
in the air.)

1602
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:31,990
Loyalty!

1603
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,410
The loyalty of an angel.

1604
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,390
(However...)

1605
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,010
(The loyal man can't notice
people coming in.)

1606
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,160
(They came into the room
without any problems.)

1607
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:44,260
(Loyalty! Loyalty!)

1608
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,970
(Relaxed and worry-free)

1609
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,100
(The dance club members are
targeting the loyal man.)

1610
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,160
Has it begun?

1611
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,370
Yes, it's begun.

1612
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,300
(Following the dance club members,)

1613
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,010
(Kwang Soo came into
the student guidance club room.)

1614
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,950
(Kwang Soo left the room
with Jae Suk earlier.)

1615
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:08,320
(After giving the money he stole
as a school support donation,)

1616
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:12,590
(he boldly came back
to his club room.)

1617
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:17,120
(He quickly took out the money
hidden in the tissue box.)

1618
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,990
Loyalty!

1619
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,660
(He starts stealing
money for his club.)

1620
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,910
(Right then,
Defconn spots Kwang Soo.)

1621
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,010
It's not here.

1622
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,910
(Betraying Kwang Soo captured.)

1623
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:34,200
- Did you find it?
- Loyalty!

1624
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,850
(Bo Sung approaches them
after hearing the noise.)

1625
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,320
- What's this? Who is it?
- It's me.

1626
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,640
- Who is this?
- Kwang Soo is out.

1627
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,280
How can I be killed
by my own team member?

1628
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,410
- You can!
- Kwang Soo is out.

1629
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,780
I can kill my team member?

1630
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,090
- You can.
- So why are you here?

1631
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,280
- But...
- Why are you here?

1632
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,760
To protect you, of course!

1633
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,760
- Why would you protect me?
- What's this?

1634
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,100
Kwang Soo, you're out.
Come this way.

1635
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,990
- No, I found this.
- Darn it.

1636
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:53,570
Kwang Soo, come here.

1637
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:56,990
Stand here.

1638
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,240
Stand against the wall.

1639
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,260
You...

1640
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,680
I told you
to stand against the wall.

1641
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,510
(He pays the school support donation
even when he's caught.)

1642
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:04,910
- Stand against the wall.
- How dare you steal from us?

1643
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,100
That's not it.

1644
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,470
Stand against the wall
with your hands up.

1645
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,570
You have one minute left.

1646
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,720
(Jae Suk snuck into the band club
to find Kwang Soo's money.)

1647
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,850
(Scared)

1648
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,090
(Haha couldn't catch anyone
as he was busy making a fuss.)

1649
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,050
Let's go, guidance club!

1650
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,450
He's right there!

1651
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,620
To your right! Over there!

1652
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,430
- He's right there!
- Time's up.

1653
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,990
Time's up, everyone.

1654
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:30,390
(There's already 60 cents
for the school support donation?)

1655
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,140
- Is it over?
- It's over.

1656
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,740
- I couldn't find any.
- Right?

1657
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,870
- I couldn't find any.
- I know.

1658
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,140
(Who else paid the support donation
besides Kwang Soo and Haha?)

1659
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,050
- What are we playing this time?
- It's table tennis!

1660
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,200
Wow, it's going to be so fun!

1661
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,240
Let's play a game.

1662
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,510
I'm really good at table tennis.

1663
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,620
- There he is! The king of...
- Come on!

1664
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,640
(The table is surrounded
by the bluffers already.)

1665
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,780
- This is what I'm talking about!
- Yes, I love table tennis.

1666
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,050
The 1988 Olympics generation.

1667
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:53,350
We are the 1988 Olympics generation.

1668
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:54,550
(They begin their practice rally.)

1669
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,490
It's a rally.

1670
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,470
(Swinging)

1671
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,890
Bo Sung is not that good.

1672
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:02,930
- You're bad at it.
- You're pretty bad at it.

1673
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,200
- Bo Sung's not a good player.
- He's worse than I thought.

1674
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,340
How strange. I'm usually good.

1675
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,300
No, wait a minute. Let me try again.

1676
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,370
Let me try again.

1677
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,600
Come on.
He can't hit a backhand smash.

1678
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,910
Which sports are you good at?

1679
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:16,910
(Which sports are you good at?)

1680
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,010
- There you go.
- Give him a chance.

1681
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,740
- Bo Sung...
- My gosh.

1682
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,260
- Bo Sung.
- You can't just hit randomly.

1683
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,850
- He's so bad.
- That's not how you hit.

1684
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,590
Are you playing
badminton or something?

1685
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:27,590
(Will Bo Sung be able to
take a part in this mission?)

1686
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,350
Let me tell you the rules
of the final mission.

1687
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:32,660
According to the result
of the moral education class,

1688
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,470
the band club won 1 dollar
as they won 1st place.

1689
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,260
- They won 1 dollar?
- The dance club won...

1690
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,760
- 70 cents as they won 2nd place.
- Okay!

1691
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,300
The student guidance club won
50 cents as they came in 3rd.

1692
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,870
Now, tell us
how much you have in total.

1693
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,140
- We have 60 cents.
- 60 cents.

1694
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,240
We have 60 cents.

1695
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:50,140
Someone took our 10 cents.

1696
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,910
- We also have 60 cents.
- We have 50 cents.

1697
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,390
- We have 60 cents.
- That's right.

1698
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,220
- 60?
- Because he found 10 cents.

1699
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,450
We have 30 cents.

1700
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,010
(The student guidance club
has 30 cents.)

1701
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,890
We must win this mission.

1702
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,200
The second class, our last one,
is a PE class.

1703
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,660
- All right, PE!
- I love it!

1704
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,820
- That's ours to win.
- We're actually a sports club.

1705
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,070
You'll be playing table tennis
to expand your territory.

1706
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:12,740
Expand our territory? What's that?

1707
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:17,200
Unlike the standard table tennis,
three people will play on each side.

1708
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,910
Each club can designate a member
to receive a penalty point.

1709
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,780
In return, you can add two squares
to the other team's table.

1710
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:27,510
That means the other team
will have a harder time winning.

1711
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,550
Oh, we must be using these.

1712
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:30,680
- We'll be using these.
- Really?

1713
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,780
- I think so.
- Oh, this one?

1714
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,180
- Really?
- We can add more space here.

1715
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,990
I've never played a game of
table tennis like this.

1716
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:36,930
We'll have more space to hit.

1717
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,800
(To buy a part of their territory,
one of them has to sacrifice.)

1718
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,870
But you must choose a member
to receive a penalty point.

1719
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,200
- It's like hopscotch.
- We need to buy a lot then.

1720
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,930
You can purchase their territory
anytime you want.

1721
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:50,470
Each team will play against
different teams...

1722
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:51,640
to decide the final winner.

1723
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,600
If every team has a win and a loss,
we'll decide the winner by points.

1724
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,350
The teacher will be watching you
in this class as well.

1725
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,950
- Okay!
- All right.

1726
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,890
- Let's play against the dance club.
- That sounds great.

1727
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,160
Okay, bring it on.

1728
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,820
- We want to buy their territory.
- Okay!

1729
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:04,850
(Student guidance club
versus band club)

1730
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,490
Where shall we place it?
Shall we place two at the back?

1731
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:09,990
Since we must win,

1732
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,120
- we need to buy a lot.
- We'll be buying penalty points.

1733
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:14,700
We'll be giving 2 pieces
for 1 penalty point.

1734
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,140
Then we'll buy around 20 pieces
with Bo Sung's penalty points.

1735
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,140
(We'll buy around 20 pieces
with Bo Sung's penalty points.)

1736
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,410
(With my penalty points?)

1737
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:21,640
We can only buy up to 20?

1738
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,600
- Shall we buy 10 pieces first?
- 10?

1739
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,640
- We can win this.
- It'll be fine if we win.

1740
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,780
- It'll be fine if we win.
- It'll be fine if we win.

1741
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,370
- Really?
- It's our last chance.

1742
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,350
If you approve it, then you'll be
getting the punishment.

1743
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:33,590
No, Bo Sung.
Don't be tricked by them.

1744
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,450
They should also get
the penalty points equally.

1745
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:37,910
- You said you can take a lot.
- He's being a jerk.

1746
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,890
- Is he?
- He's a total jerk.

1747
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,280
It's time to flex your muscles.

1748
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,300
He's a total jerk.

1749
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,620
- You need to flex your muscles.
- Yes, I got 17.

1750
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,200
(He flexes his muscles right away.)

1751
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:46,720
- You have 17?
- Yes, I got 17.

1752
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,260
It doesn't even hurt that much.

1753
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,600
- He's a jerk.
- Bo Sung, you're...

1754
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,760
- We must win so that...
- Come here, Bo Sung.

1755
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,410
- You need to divide the points.
- Kwang Soo has 17 points.

1756
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,100
Then we have Bo Sung receive...

1757
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:00,600
2 penalty points.
We'll buy 4 pieces.

1758
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,600
Only four?

1759
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,870
- Let's buy more later.
- We need at least eight.

1760
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:03,950
Let's buy four first.

1761
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:05,910
- Kwang Soo, are we set?
- Bo Sung, let's use one more point.

1762
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,910
- Sure, that's fine.
- Thank you so much!

1763
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,180
(Sure, go ahead.)

1764
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:12,260
Kwang Soo, place it here.

1765
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,280
Shall we place one here
so that it can get in their way?

1766
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,030
- Okay, let's place one there.
- Sir.

1767
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,550
We'll be placing them like this.

1768
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,220
Se Chan, how about we put ours
on the side?

1769
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,760
- Sure, let's put them here.
- Let's put them on the side.

1770
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,030
Then we can go after their side.

1771
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,470
That's a good idea.

1772
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,970
- You're expanding both sides?
- That's how you'll place them?

1773
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,410
- That won't help anyway.
- Let me warn you all.

1774
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:31,870
We won't be this petty.
We'll win with our skills.

1775
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,570
- We'll use our skills.
- Move.

1776
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:36,320
Don't we have to play
the standard game first?

1777
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,850
- Of course!
- They placed them too early.

1778
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,410
It's because they're bad
at table tennis.

1779
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,320
Whose penalty points are you using?

1780
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,390
We'll be using Se Chan's.

1781
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,390
(We'll be using Se Chan's.)

1782
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,390
What are you talking about? You said
we'll play rock-paper-scissors.

1783
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,390
But you have no penalty points.

1784
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:49,450
Let's use your points first,

1785
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,120
- then we'll take turns.
- Okay.

1786
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,490
- You're using 3 points?
- Yes, 3 points. Okay.

1787
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,260
You should shout out "my ball".

1788
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,490
Say "my ball"
when you want to hit the ball.

1789
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:56,990
Can we start now?

1790
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:58,160
Let's play a round to decide
who serves first.

1791
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,300
Okay, let's do that.

1792
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,640
- Bo Sung took off his sunglasses.
- He did.

1793
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,010
- Now, he's...
- Bo Sung took off his sunglasses.

1794
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,640
- Show us what you got now.
- Okay, sure.

1795
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,850
All right, this is a game
to decide who serves first.

1796
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,120
(The game to decide
the first server starts.)

1797
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,120
There's no need to rush.
There you go.

1798
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,850
(The ball stably goes
back and forth.)

1799
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:16,780
Slowly. There you go.

1800
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,850
(They keep hitting
to Jae Suk's side.)

1801
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,820
Haha is pretty good.

1802
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,990
- All right!
- Nice!

1803
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,390
(Se Chan missed it.)

1804
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:25,390
- Nice!
- Jae Suk is our ace.

1805
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,200
All right, we're doing great!

1806
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,470
- I'm more serious than ever.
- This is an important match.

1807
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,070
Let Bo Sung join in too.

1808
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,510
- Let's go, Bo Sung!
- Let's go!

1809
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,800
- Show us what you got.
- Sure.

1810
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,640
- He's so ugly.
- Hit it, Haha.

1811
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,740
- Okay!
- Yes!

1812
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,300
(He's so ugly.)

1813
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,870
- Hit it, Haha.
- Okay!

1814
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:43,120
He was so ugly... Isn't it cheating
to make an ugly face?

1815
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,490
You're supposed to throw the ball
before you serve.

1816
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:46,510
- But he did this.
- That's not how you serve.

1817
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,990
- If you do that...
- No, it doesn't matter.

1818
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,990
This should be allowed though.

1819
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:51,890
Since this is a variety show,
you should throw it a little.

1820
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:52,890
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

1821
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:54,450
You should serve, Bo Sung.

1822
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:56,390
It's okay as long as
you pass the ball to the other side.

1823
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,990
Bo Sung, show us a fiery serve.
Shoot a sharp serve.

1824
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:58,990
You can do it!

1825
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,470
(Okay...)

1826
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:02,970
You need to throw the ball.

1827
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:04,930
- Wait a minute.
- Wait!

1828
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:06,100
He needs to throw the ball!

1829
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,300
- You can do it!
- You need to throw the ball.

1830
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,870
(Using a table-adhering,
magical serving method)

1831
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:13,200
He needs to throw the ball!
What was that?

1832
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,300
- He did it.
- What was that about?

1833
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,320
- What's wrong with it?
- You can't serve like that.

1834
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,910
You should go easy on the guests.

1835
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,320
Go easy on the guests.

1836
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,390
- This is a legit way to serve.
- It's his first time playing.

1837
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:23,010
- This is allowed!
- We can serve like that?

1838
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,180
- This is allowed then?
- Yes.

1839
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,450
- Okay.
- This is allowed.

1840
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:26,850
(It's Bo Sung's serve again.)

1841
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,620
You should receive it.

1842
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,030
- Nice!
- You should receive it.

1843
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,890
(Bo Sung got them again.)

1844
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,800
- How did he do that?
- This shouldn't be allowed.

1845
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,990
(Scoring 2 points
with a table-adhering serve)

1846
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,760
- How do you do that?
- All right.

1847
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,640
- How does he serve like that?
- You just push the ball forward.

1848
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,800
- It's allowed.
- What is that?

1849
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,010
Push the ball forward.

1850
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:45,410
That's a slider.

1851
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:47,240
- No, that's a curveball.
- How does he do that?

1852
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,780
You're good. You should serve.

1853
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:49,870
You want me to serve again?

1854
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,280
He serves weirdly.

1855
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,090
- His ball is slow,
- He hits there.

1856
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,220
- but it doesn't stop.
- It's better for us if they win.

1857
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,090
- Okay!
- All right.

1858
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:58,720
(There you go!)

1859
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,160
- Okay!
- All right.

1860
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:02,350
- He should serve again.
- It's weird.

1861
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,350
- He's so...
- We need one more point.

1862
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:05,870
- We need one more point.
- That's right.

1863
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,430
Let me tell you the official rules
as a professional player.

1864
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:09,990
- You should...
- Suk Jin, move.

1865
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:10,990
The ball needs to leave your hand.

1866
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:12,300
- Move, move.
- Hey!

1867
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,300
Go away.

1868
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,510
- Hey! Bo Sung...
- Move.

1869
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,200
- Move!
- The ball needs to leave your hand!

1870
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,410
- All right.
- Let's play now.

1871
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:20,010
- The ball needs to leave your hand.
- He can't serve from there.

1872
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,300
- He should step back.
- He should step back.

1873
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,680
- There you go.
- The ball hit the net.

1874
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,850
(Se Chan's smash)

1875
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,780
Okay!

1876
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,220
Okay!

1877
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,260
(Se Chan hit the ball
right at the territory they bought.)

1878
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,320
- There you go.
- Okay!

1879
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,120
Well done, Se Chan!

1880
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,800
- You're good.
- Let's bring back the momentum.

1881
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,120
- There you go.
- I want to play too.

1882
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:40,990
- Okay!
- Okay!

1883
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:42,470
Don't hit the ball to Se Chan.

1884
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,760
- Okay, I got it.
- You shouldn't give it to Se Chan.

1885
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,510
- What about it?
- Hit it quickly.

1886
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,800
(The band club
sustains the momentum.)

1887
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,100
(Okay!)

1888
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,640
Smash it. Okay!

1889
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,010
(He succeeds
in hitting 3 smashes in a row.)

1890
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,180
- Okay!
- Hold on! Time out.

1891
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,620
- Let us use your penalty points.
- We turned the tables on you.

1892
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,780
- We turned the tables on you.
- Hang on.

1893
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,220
- Let us buy more territory.
- In an instant.

1894
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,620
- Let us buy two more pieces.
- Let us buy more territory.

1895
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,410
How could you get...

1896
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,260
- smashed instantly?
- Se Chan is quite good.

1897
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:07,090
Se Chan. Se Chan is really good.

1898
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,390
Give me the ball.

1899
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:09,390
(Clenching their teeth)

1900
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:11,490
We're buying more territory.

1901
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,660
Whose penalty points are you using?

1902
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,870
Bo Sung's.

1903
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:14,890
Stop bullying Bo Sung!

1904
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,930
- It's okay.
- We're using Bo Sung's points.

1905
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:18,370
Why would you let them
take advantage of you, Bo Sung?

1906
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:21,260
I'm ruined already.
We need to win first.

1907
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,510
It'll be fine if we win, Bo Sung.

1908
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:23,510
We're all set.

1909
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:24,640
Let's play now.

1910
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,200
We must get this.

1911
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,410
Why don't you take turns to serve?
Only one person is playing.

1912
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:31,120
- Let Ji Hyo play too.
- Okay, Ji Hyo.

1913
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,410
- Let her play.
- But I'm not good.

1914
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,220
- It's okay. The ball...
- It's okay if you're bad.

1915
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:35,680
needs to hit our table first
and theirs.

1916
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,390
- So this is how you play.
- It needs to hit our table first.

1917
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:38,550
- There you go. That's how you play.
- Spike!

1918
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,260
No, that doesn't count!

1919
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,760
(A powerful return)

1920
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,700
- Hey.
- That was...

1921
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,820
You can't do that.

1922
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,760
All right. We won.

1923
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,970
- We won.
- That's so mean.

1924
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,300
- Kwang Soo must be upset!
- We won.

1925
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,700
- We won.
- Good job.

1926
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,930
They lost.

1927
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,740
- That little...
- Kwang Soo must be upset.

1928
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,570
- Kwang Soo is upset.
- Okay!

1929
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,740
- He's so annoying.
- Ji Hyo must be hurt.

1930
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:03,870
- He's so annoying.
- Okay!

1931
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:04,910
Kwang Soo.

1932
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,390
I'll throw the ball, you serve.

1933
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,820
(Whispering)

1934
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,390
Who should hit the ball? Me or you?

1935
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,990
Jae Suk, let Bo Sung join in too.

1936
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,260
(A team play of their own)

1937
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,800
Let him join in too!

1938
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,030
Why would you leave him out?

1939
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:20,570
- It's not like that.
- Let him join in too.

1940
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,390
Are you only using Bo Sung
for penalty points?

1941
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:23,840
- Let him join in too.
- No.

1942
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,990
Bo Sung, I'm sorry.

1943
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,140
They only use Bo Sung
for penalty points.

1944
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,010
- Yes.
- Go.

1945
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,280
Okay.

1946
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,950
That's it. It went in.

1947
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,590
(He even scored a point.)

1948
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,620
- Wait a minute.
- It went in.

1949
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,090
- It went in.
- It went in.

1950
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,950
- But he hit it from here.
- It went in.

1951
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:52,220
But Bo Sung just did it
without discussing it with us.

1952
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,430
- It went in.
- We were planning something else.

1953
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:54,890
- But...
- He's sly.

1954
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:56,100
- It went in.
- That's nice.

1955
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,530
What you did had
no sense of loyalty.

1956
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,870
- Let's stack them.
- This won't do.

1957
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,570
It's too large.

1958
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,410
There won't be any outs this way.

1959
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,350
Just use mine then.
How many points is that total?

1960
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,550
- Yes.
- Do you have five penalty points?

1961
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,850
How many are you stacking?

1962
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:12,010
- Is Bo Sung buying more?
- You have to buy them.

1963
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,320
- With whose points?
- Are you buying them?

1964
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,850
- With Kwang Soo's points.
- Wait a minute, I...

1965
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,260
- You can't add to my points.
- I'll do it.

1966
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,030
- I didn't agree.
- Okay.

1967
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,890
- We'll add to Kwang Soo's points.
- I have 17 points.

1968
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:24,160
- Just buy two.
- What?

1969
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,070
- You're buying them with my points?
- Yes.

1970
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:27,370
- Wait, I didn't agree.
- Let's add 9 and 2 more.

1971
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,260
It's funny though.

1972
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:30,530
It expanded up to there.

1973
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,870
You should hit an unexpected ball.

1974
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:34,070
- We don't know who'll hit a serve.
- I'll hit it.

1975
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,600
- Come.
- Go.

1976
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:39,700
(A copy and paste
table tennis ball show)

1977
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:42,320
Pin the ball down.

1978
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,550
- He's out.
- He's out.

1979
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:44,950
- He was too greedy.
- He should have succeeded.

1980
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,740
- He has to succeed to survive.
- That's right.

1981
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,780
I also want to try that.

1982
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,120
- Okay.
- My shoulders hurt.

1983
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,990
- Let's go to the finals. It's fun.
- Let's go.

1984
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:56,450
You will go to the finals?
Oh, my. What is happening?

1985
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,370
(What?)

1986
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,640
(Their ambush failed.)

1987
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,430
- That was really fast.
- It's the finals.

1988
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:06,370
- You shouldn't have said anything.
- They won.

1989
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:09,340
- It was the finals.
- We won because of that.

1990
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,680
- If you were going to feint...
- I'm sorry.

1991
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,550
- If you going for an ambush...
- You shouldn't have said anything.

1992
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,680
If a team scores one more point,
the game will be over.

1993
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,180
It's okay as long as we win, right?

1994
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,010
- Kim Bo Sung, you can do it!
- Yes.

1995
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:20,090
(They reconfirm their determination
since victory is before their eyes.)

1996
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:22,590
(Se Chan's serve)

1997
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,450
- Hit it lightly.
- Is it the match point?

1998
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,820
- Okay.
- That's good.

1999
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,220
(Se Chan passed the ball
toward Kwang Soo.)

2000
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,570
- Oh, my.
- Nice!

2001
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,440
(He hurrahed as a reflex.)

2002
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:51,670
- What did he just do?
- What did he just do?

2003
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:52,670
(Kwang Soo avoided the ball, but it
settled safely on their territory.)

2004
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,900
- The band club won the first round.
- We won.

2005
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,840
(The penalty point donator is
feeling bitter.)

2006
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,880
- They won because of this.
- We lost.

2007
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,050
I couldn't hit the ball
because of this.

2008
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:05,050
(This result was caused by expanding
territory only on one side.)

2009
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,780
- Good job.
- We did a really good job.

2010
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,360
Let's try a rally.

2011
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:12,190
- Good.
- Let's do a rally.

2012
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:14,530
- Let's do it once.
- Please let me play.

2013
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:16,990
- Okay, wait a minute.
- Wait a minute.

2014
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:19,820
- Wait a minute.
- If we have some extra time,

2015
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,740
- we will let you play.
- Gosh.

2016
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,170
- I...
- Do you want to put this in here?

2017
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,860
I will give up five of
my penalty points to play.

2018
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,240
(They're preoccupied
with playing table tennis.)

2019
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,470
- Gosh, So Min.
- Jong Kook.

2020
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:32,450
I will give up five of
my penalty points to play.

2021
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,570
I want to play.

2022
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,450
- I also want to play.
- You're good.

2023
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:37,320
- I will give you five points.
- Everyone...

2024
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,780
- I also want to play!
- Everyone...

2025
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,840
- I'm good.
- Let's play one more time.

2026
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,110
I also want to play!

2027
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:45,920
- So Min, play.
- Okay.

2028
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,150
- I'll give you five points.
- Okay, let's go.

2029
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,630
- Join in.
- And...

2030
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,800
Please decide who she will play
against for the first round.

2031
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,420
You Small Fries should come out.

2032
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,400
- Yes, student guidance club.
- Small fries, come out.

2033
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:59,010
- That'll be a real match.
- So Min, you should go first.

2034
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,670
- Give up 1 point each.
- I'll buy So Min's 5 points.

2035
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:04,780
We will serve.

2036
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,070
Okay, go first.

2037
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,610
- Show them an unexpected ball.
- Bo Sung.

2038
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,280
- His ball is really unexpected.
- It really is.

2039
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,150
- It's hard to block.
- I'll block it.

2040
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,320
I can block it.

2041
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,740
(Big Nose who is about
the same age is confident.)

2042
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:17,920
(The unexpected ball sets off.)

2043
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,030
You can block it like this.

2044
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,150
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

2045
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,760
You can block it like this.

2046
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,030
(His arm was too short.)

2047
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,170
- He got caught.
- It was too long.

2048
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:31,900
- He got caught.
- Gosh.

2049
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,530
- Hey!
- Don't laugh.

2050
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,030
He's really so annoying.

2051
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,570
Okay, good.

2052
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:37,700
Okay.

2053
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,300
Okay.

2054
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,880
It's okay.

2055
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,490
- He's really enjoying it.
- It's okay.

2056
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:47,220
Don't be affected by him.

2057
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,880
- Don't be affected by him.
- I'm not affected at all.

2058
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,510
Good job.

2059
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,050
(The dance club lost a point.)

2060
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,820
- He's not teasing you.
- Did you see that, Jong Kook?

2061
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:58,030
- Not at all. It didn't bother me.
- Hey.

2062
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:59,800
- He's not scoffing at you.
- No.

2063
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,090
(Bo Sung continues to serve.)

2064
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,570
- That's right!
- Gosh.

2065
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,740
(He's too short again.)

2066
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,800
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2067
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,700
- There's a distance, so it's okay.
- Okay.

2068
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,070
- We can't let them off now.
- Spread some more territory.

2069
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,170
- You also have Jeon So Min.
- Okay.

2070
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:18,380
- So Min.
- That's right.

2071
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,880
- So Min.
- Okay.

2072
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,110
It's okay.

2073
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,920
- It's okay.
- I was warming up.

2074
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,030
- So Min, just sit down.
- It's okay.

2075
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:26,380
- No, I was warming up.
- Come to the center.

2076
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:27,550
- Good job.
- It's funny to see...

2077
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:28,590
So Min make a vain effort.

2078
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,400
We just have to score
five more points with this spirit.

2079
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,700
(The student guidance club is
in high spirits now.)

2080
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,800
We scored a lot of points.

2081
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:39,030
- Wait a minute. Time out.
- We scored a lot of points.

2082
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,800
Jong Kook kept pushing me with
his arm to tell me to leave.

2083
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,450
- He told me to leave.
- No, So Min. You are completely...

2084
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:47,200
(Stealthily)

2085
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,320
(He stealthily pushed her again.)

2086
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:54,110
- Just be in charge of the corner.
- I kept moving to the center,

2087
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,320
- and you said, "Leave."
- Just be in charge of the corner.

2088
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,690
Just the two of them are playing.

2089
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,260
- Where should I stop?
- No, right here.

2090
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,820
- It's a match.
- Right here. That's good.

2091
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,400
(Guest "Dae Buk Gon" is
also excluded from the match.)

2092
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,470
It's a really important match,
So Min.

2093
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:12,800
Wait a minute.

2094
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:16,240
Both of them have a sense of
pride when it comes to table tennis.

2095
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,940
- Can you hit from the side?
- Yes?

2096
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,280
- From the side?
- This is perfect.

2097
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,970
If the ball crosses the net,
it's yours, okay?

2098
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,880
- Okay, I understand.
- How can I hit it from here?

2099
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,550
If the ball crosses the net,
it's yours.

2100
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,920
Wait a minute.

2101
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:29,950
- What?
- Okay.

2102
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:31,320
Suk Jin, why did you take
your jacket off?

2103
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,260
You said you were the representative
of something.

2104
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,950
- What do you represent?
- Gosh.

2105
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:38,400
- I'll stay back later. You...
- Are you losing?

2106
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,630
- Let's play like doubles.
- Try it. No.

2107
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:43,030
- No.
- I'm also here.

2108
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,260
- I'm also here.
- But...

2109
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,570
- No, I'm also here.
- He said it was a doubles game.

2110
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:50,530
- The audio isn't being recorded.
- No, but...

2111
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:52,050
Where is my mic?

2112
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,840
- Your mic...
- My mic doesn't matter right now.

2113
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:57,050
I added territory here
with my five points.

2114
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:58,490
I have a share.

2115
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:00,990
I think we will lose
when I didn't even play.

2116
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,380
No, I'm sorry, Defconn.
It's an important moment right now.

2117
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,380
(The members become this serious
when they play ball games.)

2118
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,530
Be careful of feinting.

2119
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,820
- Gosh.
- Stop saying "Gosh" and just...

2120
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,050
- That's good!
- Gosh.

2121
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,530
Stop saying "Gosh" and just...

2122
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,170
(Gosh...)

2123
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:16,530
- Look at that.
- Hey.

2124
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:17,970
Add more territory.

2125
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:21,670
- No, it's okay.
- It's okay.

2126
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,340
Hey, we can't reach it!

2127
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:27,340
(He teases with all his might.)

2128
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,050
(Ignoring his taunts
isn't as easy as it seems.)

2129
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:34,880
(He exaggerates with all his might.)

2130
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,820
That's it.

2131
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,920
(His face turned red.)

2132
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,700
(Jong Kook becomes full of humanity
whenever he plays ball games.)

2133
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:46,590
I'll try it once
and then you should try it.

2134
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,720
- It's because we both...
- Okay.

2135
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,960
- try to do it at the same time.
- I got it. Let's try that.

2136
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,790
(The outskirt table tennis player
penetrated the center.)

2137
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:55,610
(Meanwhile, she's doing an intense
simulation in the center.)

2138
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:57,210
She's really incredible.

2139
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:00,210
So Min is really incredible.
She tries endlessly.

2140
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:02,340
- She's like a weed.
- She's really incredible.

2141
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,970
- She won't die no matter what.
- Jeon So Min is incredible.

2142
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:06,690
Spread some more territory.

2143
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:08,410
They can reach it, but we can't.

2144
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,510
- It's disadvantageous for us.
- We can't reach the short ones.

2145
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:12,380
Anyway, are you angry?

2146
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,790
I'm not angry at all.

2147
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:18,090
- Angry? I'm smiling right now.
- You look angry.

2148
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:20,620
- But after you came here...
- I'm not angry at all.

2149
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,620
(While the eldest brother was
putting his anger aside...)

2150
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:23,330
Bring that over here.

2151
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,570
(The guest is buying
territory quietly.)

2152
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,780
Excuse me... Anyway...

2153
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,330
- Just do it.
- We should also...

2154
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,280
- I'll receive short serves here.
- Okay.

2155
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,970
- Okay.
- Okay, that's good.

2156
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:35,470
Hit a serve toward here.

2157
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:38,470
- Defconn, aren't you going to play?
- Why won't you let him join in?

2158
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,950
- Jong Kook.
- Look after the guests!

2159
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:42,820
Defconn is sullen.

2160
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,380
Suk Jin, let him play.
Let him play.

2161
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,750
- Defconn.
- What's the point of playing now?

2162
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,620
What's the point of playing now
when you have ruined the match?

2163
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:49,750
You can be in charge of reactions.

2164
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,090
- Reactions, my foot!
- Reactions.

2165
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,330
(Reactions?)

2166
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:53,920
I will never visit this show again!

2167
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:57,760
I will never visit
this lousy show again!

2168
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,240
(This guest curses the show
on his first visit.)

2169
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,940
- We need to win.
- Come on.

2170
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:03,370
How dare you treat a guest
like this?

2171
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:05,780
It's the producer's job
to tell the members to switch!

2172
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,370
- Defconn.
- You seem younger than me too!

2173
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,450
I am sorry.

2174
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:11,210
I apologize for my outburst.

2175
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:13,010
You can play in the next round.

2176
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,750
- All right. Okay.
- All right.

2177
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,620
Suk Jin told him
to show reactions and go home.

2178
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,420
"Defconn, show reactions
and go home."

2179
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,750
(Defconn's mood improves
since he can play the next time.)

2180
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,250
We have the worst teamwork.

2181
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,620
You agree, right?

2182
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,290
Everyone is playing individually.

2183
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,370
Also, Suk Jin is trying to play...

2184
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,070
all by himself.

2185
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,870
- I could do this alone.
- He is like Nolbu.

2186
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:33,960
(Like Nolbu, he is declaring
that he would rather play alone.)

2187
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,410
- You need to win.
- All right.

2188
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:38,610
You need to do better.

2189
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:39,910
- That's right.
- For goodness' sake.

2190
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:41,450
Stay there until the ball comes.

2191
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:42,670
- Think of it as doubles.
- Jong Kook.

2192
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,150
- Okay, okay.
- Tell me when to come in.

2193
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:45,150
- Let's go.
- No, no.

2194
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,150
I could do this.

2195
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:47,620
- Come on.
- Stay there.

2196
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,460
- So Min, stay there.
- Here it comes.

2197
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:50,510
Here it comes.

2198
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,190
There you go.

2199
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,420
- He sent it over.
- Hey.

2200
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:54,860
(Jong Kook's two backhands in a row)

2201
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:55,960
There you go.

2202
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,250
(Kwang Soo hits it again.)

2203
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,000
- Hey!
- What was that?

2204
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,590
(The match ends
because of Suk Jin's mistake.)

2205
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:03,900
For goodness' sake.

2206
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,800
Take it off. All of it.

2207
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,610
- What was that?
- Suk Jin.

2208
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,080
- Loyalty!
- We won.

2209
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,650
The last match is between
the dance club and the band club.

2210
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:13,870
Let's go!

2211
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,320
(The result
of band club versus dance club)

2212
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:16,620
- All right.
- We won thanks to you.

2213
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:19,910
Since all three teams have
1 win and 1 loss,

2214
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:21,340
we got the rankings by the points.

2215
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:24,050
By earning 1 more point,
the 1st place winner became...

2216
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,220
the student guidance club.

2217
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,120
- Okay!
- Really?

2218
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,750
Why? Did they place first?

2219
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,090
- Student guidance club?
- Didn't we place first?

2220
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:33,160
The band club placed second.

2221
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,330
Is it us?

2222
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:35,740
The dance club placed 3rd
with 25 points.

2223
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,940
- Did they place last?
- Did we place last?

2224
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,910
- This is great.
- The 1st place gets 2 dollars.

2225
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,910
- 2 dollars?
- Then 1.50 dollars and 1 dollar.

2226
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,080
Two dollars?

2227
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,130
(They need to protect this money
in order to win!)

2228
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:47,000
You did well with PE.

2229
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:50,210
During PE, I watched everyone...

2230
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:53,040
- and assigned penalty points.
- Really?

2231
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,290
- Suk Jin, three points.
- Why?

2232
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,250
Despite being the oldest member,
you neglected the guests.

2233
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,920
- It's true.
- It's true.

2234
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,030
It's the oldest member's fault.

2235
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,720
He told me to show reactions
and go home.

2236
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,420
- It's the oldest member's fault.
- I heard it.

2237
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,960
- Three points.
- It's the oldest member's fault.

2238
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,240
Jong Kook, seven points.

2239
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,290
What?

2240
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,740
Seven points.

2241
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,960
You used your strength to push
your fellow club member.

2242
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:15,970
He pushed me.

2243
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,330
I saw you do that twice,

2244
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,950
so I gave you seven points.

2245
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:21,470
Se Chan, where does he live?

2246
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:23,970
- Him? He lives in Yeonhui-dong.
- Yeonhui-dong?

2247
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,170
He lives close.

2248
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,040
Jae Suk, 3 points. Haha, 3 points.

2249
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,690
They tried to make
the club members lose points.

2250
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:33,080
- Bo Sung.
- Yes?

2251
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:35,290
Kwang Soo is the most dangerous one.

2252
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:38,400
I think he came in earlier
and stole club funds.

2253
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,160
- Our club funds?
- That's right.

2254
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:43,590
This time, we should have
Kwang Soo stay here...

2255
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:45,070
in a blindfolded state.

2256
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,110
Okay.

2257
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:47,760
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

2258
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,800
You will be blindfolded this time.

2259
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,370
You should do it this time.

2260
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:51,370
(Freezing)

2261
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:53,950
You should do it this time.

2262
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,080
- I can do it, but...
- You should do it.

2263
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,370
Isn't Bo Sung the best at this role?

2264
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:01,490
No, no. I tried it earlier.
It was so suffocating.

2265
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:03,490
You got caught too early on
the last time.

2266
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:06,220
- It was so suffocating.
- But...

2267
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,290
I think you got caught on purpose
the last time.

2268
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:10,550
Isn't that right?

2269
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,860
Be honest.

2270
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,290
Jae Suk.

2271
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:15,760
Let's forget about the past
and start over...

2272
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,130
- Forget about the past?
- You took all the money, right?

2273
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:20,070
Kwang Soo, you are exactly
how you seem on TV.

2274
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,570
(Bo Sung won't be fooled this time.)

2275
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:23,940
I am very disappointed in you.

2276
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,250
- Give us one each.
- I expected more from you.

2277
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,840
(He pays up 20 cents.)

2278
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:30,870
I will give you one each,

2279
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:32,080
but the hammer...

2280
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,150
You need to hold the hammer.

2281
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,710
(Either way, Kwang Soo is it.)

2282
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,510
If you don't hold the hammer,
you will steal the money again.

2283
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:38,380
- Rock-paper-scissors...
- No, no.

2284
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,580
Kwang Soo will be it.

2285
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:41,750
Please hide the club funds.

2286
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,050
Kwang Soo, wait outside.

2287
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,960
- What?
- Come on.

2288
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,200
How will I find it
with my eyes covered?

2289
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,960
- Wait outside.
- Wait outside.

2290
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:50,540
- I am a club member too.
- Wait outside.

2291
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,700
- Wait outside.
- Wait outside?

2292
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,130
- Wait outside.
- We should hide the funds together.

2293
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,740
Wait outside. Wait outside.

2294
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,870
I mean... This is driving me crazy.

2295
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:58,710
13. 15.

2296
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,670
- How many do you have?
- I have six.

2297
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:02,580
We have 21.

2298
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,750
We are in first place.

2299
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,620
We shouldn't turn in money.

2300
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,620
- We shouldn't turn in money.
- No.

2301
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,120
- You should be it.
- I will be it.

2302
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,290
- Again?
- I have done it before.

2303
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,360
- Let's go! Good luck!
- Let's go!

2304
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,660
(They try to turn the tables
with Operation: Kim Jong Kook.)

2305
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,920
Put it in the same spot.

2306
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:19,160
1, 2, 3, 4.

2307
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,090
(The band club
finished hiding the money early on.)

2308
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:24,500
("Hot Issue" by 4MINUTE)

2309
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,940
(It's a total cacophony
that hurts the listener's ears.)

2310
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:32,710
(The band club gives a ceremony
to celebrate their victory.)

2311
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:35,300
Let's begin. Let's go.

2312
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,450
(After the performance, it's time
to search the other rooms.)

2313
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,620
The last club activity will begin.

2314
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,790
(The last search starts.)

2315
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:44,320
(So Min searches
the student guidance club's room!)

2316
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:47,490
(The student guidance club
took 2 dollars,)

2317
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:50,160
(but the money is
nowhere to be seen.)

2318
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,460
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo is protecting
the band club's room.)

2319
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:57,160
(Se Chan enters.)

2320
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:02,000
(Se Chan said they should save up
and win.)

2321
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,800
(He is stealing from his own club.)

2322
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:08,470
What?

2323
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:12,410
(He goes to all the hiding spots
he remembers.)

2324
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,410
(Haha enters as well.)

2325
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:18,360
(Haha approaches
with a thief's facial expression.)

2326
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,550
(He steals a small amount of money
and runs away.)

2327
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:24,620
(Dazed)

2328
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,870
(Thus, the band club faces
a crisis.)

2329
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:33,740
(But Se Chan and Haha aren't
the only ones.)

2330
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:34,960
(The students grow bold.)

2331
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,740
We are getting
a lot of school support donations.

2332
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:39,340
(Which club will save the club funds
and emerge as the winner?)

2333
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,280
I will announce the result.

2334
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,280
Show us the remaining club funds.

2335
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,190
We have a thief...

2336
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:47,710
within the club.

2337
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:49,910
- They are unbelievable.
- I saw it with my own eyes.

2338
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:51,990
Se Chan stole from his own team.

2339
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,050
- Good job.
- Hey.

2340
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,050
- Don't be ridiculous.
- That's the band club.

2341
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,500
- The band club.
- You are unbelievable.

2342
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,830
Haha is the worst.

2343
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:01,460
- Haha is the worst.
- No, Se Chan is.

2344
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,260
Do you know what Se Chan is like?

2345
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,760
- He steals from the staff members.
- Ji Hyo is annoyed.

2346
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,800
- Don't be ridiculous.
- If a cell phone goes missing,

2347
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,280
it's his fault.

2348
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,830
- All right.
- We left a lot of money.

2349
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:12,910
Earlier...

2350
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,340
(The dance club's
final amount is...)

2351
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,170
- 15.
- 9 and 6, right?

2352
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:17,340
- 15.
- 15.

2353
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,670
15.

2354
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,950
- 15.
- 15?

2355
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,410
Kwang Soo. Where is one?

2356
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:23,620
(It's the student guidance
club's turn.)

2357
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,660
One.

2358
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,330
- I didn't donate it.
- You didn't donate it?

2359
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:28,620
(Kwang Soo was it
for the 2nd round.)

2360
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,290
(If they have less
than 1.50 dollars,)

2361
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:33,460
(the dance club will win.)

2362
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:34,960
We have two.

2363
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:37,090
- 2?
- 2?

2364
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,440
- That's 20 cents.
- Didn't you hide the funds?

2365
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,370
(What happened?)

2366
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:45,540
We have the result
of the club activity.

2367
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,340
With 1.50 dollars,
the dance club won...

2368
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,040
and acquired the scholarship.

2369
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,470
(The dance club wins
with 1.50 dollars!)

2370
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:52,340
- We won.
- Look at this, Defconn.

2371
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,540
We won in the end.

2372
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,040
- That's right.
- We won.

2373
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:57,320
- I did my best.
- These are gift certificates.

2374
01:16:57,410 --> 01:16:58,580
Are those actual gift certificates?

2375
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,660
Who gets the penalty
is unrelated, right?

2376
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:04,360
Okay. It's my goal to avoid
the penalty.

2377
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,070
Kwang Soo might avoid the penalty.

2378
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:08,160
- The penalty...
- That's right. You never know.

2379
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:10,630
This team submitted 15
for the school support donation.

2380
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:12,660
- 10 should have been enough.
- Seriously.

2381
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:14,210
You never know.

2382
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:15,800
(Which 3 members will get chosen
for an annoying penalty?)

2383
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,330
Did you enjoy the classes?

2384
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,000
Yes, we did.

2385
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,150
I will reveal...

2386
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,780
how many penalty points
each student received...

2387
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:25,540
during the classes.

2388
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,290
Check your points.

2389
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:29,510
- 22 points?
- 13 points?

2390
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,160
I didn't do that badly.

2391
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:35,120
(These three members are likely
to get the penalty.)

2392
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,250
- But this isn't important.
- Why not?

2393
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:40,720
- The rankings changed.
- Of course.

2394
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,790
There are students who submitted
lots of school support donations.

2395
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,590
Because of those students,

2396
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:47,210
the rankings changed a lot.

2397
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,080
You know
that the bottom three students...

2398
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,970
have to stay behind
and carry out a penalty, right?

2399
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:53,150
- Yes.
- We know.

2400
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:54,410
The penalty...

2401
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:58,010
involves composing
a written apology...

2402
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,820
- on a sheet of 400-letter paper.
- I hate that.

2403
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,410
- Really?
- That's insane.

2404
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:02,990
- I hate that.
- You have to write it.

2405
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:04,120
The written apology...

2406
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,490
will go up on
Running Man's social media account.

2407
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:09,050
- What?
- You have to fill up the paper.

2408
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,500
- I hate it.
- But it's my first time here.

2409
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,790
This student received
the least amount of penalty points.

2410
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,160
To be honest,
we didn't do anything wrong.

2411
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,870
The first place.

2412
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:20,410
I will announce
the changed rankings.

2413
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:22,800
The 1st place has 2 penalty points.

2414
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,210
Two points?

2415
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,040
Jae Suk.

2416
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,780
He stole 20.

2417
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:35,380
(During the 2nd club activity)

2418
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:39,990
(The duo got to work as soon as
Kwang soo put on a blindfold.)

2419
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,830
(They stole their own club money.)

2420
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,120
Bo Sung, you are out.

2421
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,960
(While Bo Sung showed his loyal side
and held Kwang Soo back,)

2422
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,160
(Jae Suk stole 200 dollars.)

2423
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,330
I will donate.

2424
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,330
That's 10, right?

2425
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:55,210
I will donate for Bo Sung.

2426
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:56,910
(Half of it went to Bo Sung!)

2427
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:57,910
(Both Jae Suk and Bo Sung lost
10 penalty points.)

2428
01:18:57,910 --> 01:19:00,000
I trust Jae Suk wholeheartedly.

2429
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,540
It's loyalty.

2430
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,340
- 10.
- 10?

2431
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:05,840
(Jae Suk placed 1st
and became Bo Sung's savior.)

2432
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,990
The second place is...

2433
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:08,580
Ji Hyo. Then come Haha, Se Chan,

2434
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,210
Bo Sung, and Defconn.

2435
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:11,410
(Ji Hyo, Haha, Se Chan,
Bo Sung, and Defconn are exempt.)

2436
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,690
Now comes seventh place.

2437
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:17,530
This person is the last one
to be exempt, right?

2438
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:18,920
That's right.

2439
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,420
The last one to be exempt is...

2440
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:22,830
I bet it's Suk Jin.

2441
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:24,000
I didn't have
that many penalty points.

2442
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:26,370
Please. I am sorry. Please.

2443
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:31,210
(One member survived at 7th place.)

2444
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:32,670
So Min!

2445
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:34,210
(So Min is exempt at 7th place.)

2446
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:35,410
I was a good student!

2447
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:37,280
- I was a good student!
- That means you didn't donate.

2448
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,470
I didn't donate.

2449
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:40,120
- Seriously.
- You are a good person.

2450
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,340
Of course I am. Trust me.

2451
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,160
- That means you didn't donate.
- I didn't donate. Seriously.

2452
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,790
The 8th place is Jong Kook
with 16 points.

2453
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:50,050
You did it.

2454
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:51,220
No, I got the penalty.

2455
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,700
The 9th place is Suk Jin
with 17 points.

2456
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,570
The last place is Kwang Soo
with 18 points.

2457
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,440
Do I still have 18 points?

2458
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:59,500
(He still has 18 points.)

2459
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,040
In any case,
you did well with the classes.

2460
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,000
Everyone can go home...

2461
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,800
- except for the bottom three.
- Thank you.

2462
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:08,750
- Okay.
- Running Man, let's go!

2463
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,470
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Loyalty!

2464
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:12,320
You really need to compose
a written apology.

2465
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,540
I will do it with seriousness.

2466
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,820
How could you steal
during the first club activity?

2467
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,580
(He regrets the day.)

2468
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:17,580
This is insane.

2469
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,880
Sometimes, I cheated.

2470
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,330
I should have attacked
my own team...

2471
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:26,290
- to collect money.
- I should have survived...

2472
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:30,000
- by betraying the others.
- Jong Kook kept me from doing it.

2473
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:36,370
If I ever have a child...

2474
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:38,470
- A child... Gosh.
- A child... Hey!

2475
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,800
I will teach him or her
at a young age...

2476
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,580
to survive...

2477
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:44,910
You are confusing me.

2478
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:46,540
Jong Kook, be quiet.

2479
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:48,150
I messed up because of you.

2480
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:49,790
You are confusing me.
"At a young age..."

2481
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:51,660
- And...
- My dad said, "Be honest."

2482
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,460
"Be honest." Hey.

2483
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:54,750
Hey.

2484
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,330
For goodness' sake.

2485
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:57,400
Come on!

2486
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:00,760
- I only wrote five lines.
- I am sorry. I am sorry.

2487
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:01,870
(You can check them out
on Running Man's SNS account.)

2488
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:03,290
You should walk in the snow.

2489
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:04,590
(Deep in the snowy mountain,)

2490
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:06,260
(the members seem to be isolated.)

2491
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,300
I really don't have it. I don't.

2492
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,500
(They seem to be
looking for something.)

2493
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,970
(Big sister, help me!)

2494
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,410
(Do I have a big sister?)

2495
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:16,780
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin lost.

2496
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,150
(The strong sister, Kim Jae Hwa)

2497
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:20,380
(The cheerful sister, Cha Chung Hwa)

2498
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,690
(The ambitious sister, Shin Dong Mi)

2499
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,080
(How dare you challenge
the Shin family?)

2500
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,530
(Will there be a fight
between the Shin and Cha families?)

2501
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:31,330
(The love between
the siblings shine.)

2502
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,400
(They get the right
to distribute the allowance.)

2503
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,370
(The siblings' love
is put to test.)

2504
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,960
(The younger siblings
become obsessed with the allowance.)

2505
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,570
- It's a war.
- It's a war.

2506
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:43,300
(What will become
of the three families?)

2507
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:45,870
(The Charismatic Sisters,
The Ugly Siblings)
