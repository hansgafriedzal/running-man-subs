1
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,120
(The stockholders of E Biotechnology
are devastated.)

2
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,160
(Lee Kwang Soo's account balance)

3
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,390
(The tall investor's rate of return
is minus 36 percent.)

4
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,790
(He heads to the Information
Exchange again.)

5
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,690
(He bought Level 1 Information
about I Chemical.)

6
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,900
(The government announces plans
to fight fine dust.)

7
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,900
(How is this related to I Chemical?)

8
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,810
(He asks Jae Suk
when he doesn't know.)

9
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,010
(Still hurting from E Bio)

10
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,580
- It's real.
- What is it?

11
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,950
(He forgot
about the bad memories...)

12
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,180
(and hears the information.)

13
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,020
(Let's go with it.)

14
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,120
(He keeps repeating himself.)

15
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,130
I will invest everything
in I Chemical.

16
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,160
(With Kwang Soo's information,
he invests in I Chemical.)

17
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
(Yoo Jae Suk's account balance)

18
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,800
(He followed Jae Suk
and invested in I Chemical.)

19
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,310
(If I remember correctly,
biotechnology rose in 2017.)

20
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,380
(Based on his experience, Suk Jin
kept his eye on biotechnology.)

21
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,810
F Biotechnology.

22
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,310
(Then he invested
in F Biotechnology.)

23
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,210
(Other investors invested
in F Biotechnology too.)

24
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,220
(Jong Kook invested
all his money in G Foods.)

25
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,950
(The novice investor Ji Hyo...)

26
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,300
(heard the word "shipbuilding"
and invested all her money in it.)

27
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,800
(I changed at the last moment.
I went all-in.)

28
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,610
(The investors start to feel nervous
with only a few years left.)

29
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,200
That's dangerous, but investors
like him end up making it big.

30
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,580
It's true...

31
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,280
that biotechnology
will rise in 2017.

32
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,380
But this is risky. Biotechnology...

33
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,910
Jong Kook, what about chemical?
It's good, isn't it?

34
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,580
(Will it be chemical
or biotechnology?)

35
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,580
(Or will it be foods?)

36
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,490
- It's closed.
- Please.

37
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,800
- Please.
- Please. Just one year.

38
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,220
(Ji Hyo kept going back and forth
until the end, but finally decided.)

39
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,240
(Anxious)

40
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,970
Once I earn the principal amount,

41
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,860
- I'll keep the cash.
- Please.

42
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,610
I just want to earn back
the principal.

43
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,000
Hey, you should buy land...

44
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,300
- with the money.
- I should do that.

45
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,780
- That would be better.
- You should buy an estate.

46
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,850
Jeju Island.

47
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,540
- Aewol in Jeju Island.
- It's almost time.

48
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,480
If you invest in real estate
in Aewol, Jeju Island,

49
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,280
- you will go from rags to riches.
- Hey.

50
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
- Buy land in Jeju Island.
- Go to Aewol.

51
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,980
Once I get the principal back,

52
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,480
- I'll go to Jeju Island.
- I'm really nervous now.

53
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,600
(What will be the investors' fates
as they all hope for a big break?)

54
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,970
I have no confidence.

55
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,000
Happy New Year!

56
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
(Kwang Soo and Jae Suk
invested in I Chemical.)

57
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,760
(And many others invested
in F Biotechnology.)

58
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,750
(The stock prices of 2017
are revealed.)

59
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,470
- Biotechnology!
- G Foods.

60
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,750
Please. Biotechnology.

61
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,180
- Yes!
- Biotechnology!

62
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,190
(The 2017 Stock Market)

63
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,120
(F Biotechnology,
G Foods, I Chemical)

64
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,480
(The stock prices of F Biotechnology
and G Foods rose sharply.)

65
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,060
(Ji Suk Jin's account balance)

66
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,030
With no information...

67
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,820
What did I tell you
about biotechnology?

68
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,000
You were right about that.

69
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,060
Biotechnology.

70
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,160
I bought the G Foods' stocks, right?

71
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,840
(Jae Suk also succeeded
in making a profit.)

72
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,100
Biotechnology!

73
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,120
Biotechnology!

74
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,410
I went all-in on F Biotechnology
at the last minute!

75
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,720
(Se Chan is a super-wealthy investor
who will soon have 100,000 dollars.)

76
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,430
I made profits too.

77
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,480
(So Min's stock price rose
by 233 percent too!)

78
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,000
I knew biotechnology stock prices
would rise.

79
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,100
I made the right call.

80
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,130
G Foods.

81
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,130
I invested all of my money
in G Foods.

82
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,530
- Biotechnology!
- G Foods.

83
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,870
- G Foods.
- Biotechnology!

84
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,600
I succeeded without any information.

85
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,310
How did the stock price
for biotechnology rise so much?

86
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,310
(How did the stock price
for biotechnology rise so much?)

87
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,210
Gosh, G Foods...

88
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,910
Gosh, really...

89
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,280
The G Foods stock price rose
by 220 percent.

90
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Did you invest in G Foods, Se Chan?

91
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,750
I had profits,
but it doesn't feel good...

92
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,130
because other stock prices rose
so much.

93
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,960
F Biotechnology is no joke.

94
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,290
(Everyone had a jackpot this year
except for Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.)

95
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,220
- It feels real!
- I will cash out now.

96
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,400
- I will cash out now.
- Let's go for a drink today.

97
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,000
- It's on me.
- This is a great day.

98
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's on me.

99
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,440
It's on me!

100
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,730
Congratulations.

101
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,600
I invested in foods
and biotechnology.

102
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,230
- You guys are small-time investors.
- I told you...

103
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,500
- that biotechnology will rise.
- Se Chan.

104
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,680
It's on me.

105
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,540
Let's check out
the current asset ranking.

106
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,020
Okay.

107
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,470
I bet I moved up a lot.

108
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,590
(He was at the very bottom
the last time.)

109
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,720
I am in second place.

110
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,660
Gosh, the ranking changed a lot
this time.

111
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,590
- I am still in third place.
- Okay! I beat Ji Hyo!

112
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,660
Okay! I beat Ji Hyo!

113
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,960
(It's most likely
that Ji Hyo will get the penalty.)

114
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,700
- I am still in third place.
- Let's move up.

115
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,160
- Am I in 5th place?
- I am in 2nd place.

116
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,200
I am going up.

117
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,830
Jae Suk is one place above me.

118
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,530
Gosh, this is...

119
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,290
Not many years are left.

120
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,600
We have three years to go.

121
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
(With 3 years remaining,
the 2nd investment ends.)

122
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,410
Se Chan is incredible.

123
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,970
Let's move on to the last mission.

124
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,280
Se Chan started with 500 dollars
and nearly reached 100,000 dollars.

125
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,320
- Se Chan has 100,000 dollars.
- That makes no sense.

126
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,520
It all depends on luck.

127
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,020
- Hey.
- I am bragging.

128
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,220
It all depends on luck.

129
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,850
- We have three more chances.
- When will I get more money?

130
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,460
I need to get good information now.

131
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,760
You need to play the game well.

132
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,050
Information is key.

133
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,400
Now,

134
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,970
it's time for the last mission
to win information points.

135
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,600
For those of you who are thirsty
for information points,

136
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,840
we will play the game
that we played as the first mission.

137
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,370
We will have another round
of Debate Battle as a bonus game.

138
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,300
- Let's begin the last mission.
- Okay.

139
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,470
(This is what Debate Battle is.)

140
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,150
(The production crew will give
a topic for debate.)

141
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,110
(Will Jong Kook be able to
get married within 3 years?)

142
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,180
(A: He can, B: He can't)

143
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,590
(The members will have a draw
for A or B.)

144
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,180
(They must come up
with plausible reasons...)

145
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,460
(and persuade the staff members.)

146
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,160
(The team that persuaded
more staff members wins.)

147
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,790
If you win, you will receive
three information points.

148
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,100
- The topic.
- What is it?

149
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,300
Is face reading science or not?

150
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,800
- That's the topic.
- Face reading is science.

151
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,840
Let's have a draw.

152
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,870
I hope I get A.

153
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,340
(A: It's science,
B: It isn't science)

154
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,370
- Okay.
- What?

155
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,870
I got B.

156
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,170
If you have B, sit over here.
If you have A, sit over there.

157
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,220
- I have B.
- I have A.

158
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,540
Face reading is science.

159
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,910
It isn't science.
You can't judge someone by his face.

160
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,220
Face reading is science.
I say that...

161
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,760
because I took an elective course
in university.

162
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
- There is a course.
- Then it's undeniable.

163
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,600
There is an official curriculum...

164
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,850
because it's science.

165
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,100
Give us...

166
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,570
something important you learned
from the course.

167
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,970
Something that
would convince people.

168
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,160
For example, this part shows
marital compatibility.

169
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,640
- What?
- Marital compatibility.

170
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,800
- If there is a mole...
- She is a face reader.

171
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
(She is a face reader.)

172
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,710
- For example...
- She is a face reader.

173
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,650
- "Am I destined to be a king?"
- "Tell me, face reader."

174
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,780
People who have
a mole or a scar here...

175
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,220
get treatments to have it removed.

176
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,390
Doing so will increase
your marital compatibility.

177
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,110
It might also help you
to marry well...

178
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,320
- or meet someone nice.
- But such information...

179
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,780
comes from accumulated data.

180
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,980
I like these big words.

181
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,550
It shows the probability
that comes...

182
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,830
- from many people's appearance.
- Data?

183
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,420
- Data or probability is science.
- That's science.

184
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,030
Probability isn't
necessarily science.

185
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,530
It's chemistry.

186
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,210
Isn't he picking a fight?

187
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,270
No!

188
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,530
(His oppressive tone creates
a controversy.)

189
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,670
- Please don't misunderstand.
- Excuse me?

190
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,210
He isn't picking a fight.

191
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,800
- That's his usual tone!
- Excuse me?

192
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,470
- I am not picking a fight!
- That's his usual tone!

193
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,650
That's his usual tone.

194
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,020
- Isn't he picking a fight?
- Jae Suk.

195
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,320
That's his usual tone.

196
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,610
- While there is that approach...
- I mean...

197
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,660
- Listen.
- Are you pointing a spoon at me?

198
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,120
- You punk!
- All right.

199
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,890
- Are you pointing a spoon at me?
- "You punk"?

200
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,330
Listen.

201
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,600
- Didn't they say you look unlucky?
- They did.

202
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,970
But he isn't unlucky, is he?

203
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,290
- Seriously.
- He is the luckiest man.

204
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,600
- Look at him.
- Suk Jin.

205
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,100
- Let me tell you this.
- Tell them.

206
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,600
- Tell them my story.
- This is important.

207
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,710
There are old sayings...

208
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,410
about how big ears are associated...

209
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,670
- with a long and successful life...
- Long life.

210
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,450
and how a big nose is associated
with good fortune.

211
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,540
There are such sayings.

212
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,350
But my ears aren't that big,

213
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,020
Suk Jin's ears are big.

214
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,610
- My goodness.
- Hold on.

215
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,260
- Suk Jin.
- Don't be like that.

216
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,680
- I mean...
- Aren't we on the same side?

217
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,350
What are you trying to say?

218
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,790
Give us a concise summary
of your words.

219
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,830
- I do have bigger ears.
- I mean...

220
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,830
- What about it?
- So you have good fortune...

221
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,840
- and Suk Jin doesn't?
- I didn't say that.

222
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,160
- I didn't say that.
- Earlier,

223
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,510
you said
that face reading is based...

224
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,800
- on probability and data.
- Yes.

225
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,170
Most scientific fields
draw conclusions...

226
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,850
- from probability and data.
- That's right.

227
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,350
- Listen.
- I have...

228
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,470
- one complaint about the way...
- Okay.

229
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,740
you participate in the debate.

230
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,410
Your tone is aggravating.

231
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,610
Come on.

232
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,160
(Jae Suk takes an issue
with his attitude.)

233
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,260
- Your tone is aggravating.
- Listen.

234
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,850
I am talking in a reasonable
and persuasive manner.

235
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,160
Reasonable? You punk!
How dare you point a finger at me?

236
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,720
You little...

237
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,970
Hold on.

238
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,720
(Jong Kook explodes.)

239
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,570
Hold on.

240
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,340
What are you doing?

241
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,730
- Why did you swear?
- Why did you swear?

242
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,940
What was that?

243
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,680
I am sorry.
I admit that I made a mistake.

244
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,770
He officially apologized.

245
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,950
- Listen.
- This is unbelievable.

246
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,000
(The desire for information points
made him lose his senses.)

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,110
It was so scary.

248
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,010
Let me say this again.

249
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,480
Here is what I think.
Even if you have bad looks,

250
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,820
you can improve them with effort.

251
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,350
- You can change them.
- That's right.

252
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,850
Thus,

253
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,590
- face reading...
- It's nothing more.

254
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,700
isn't science.

255
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,020
I am sure some people
have seen this on social media.

256
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,700
- People who look similar...
- All right.

257
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,040
- Don't talk about social media.
- This is important!

258
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,990
- This is really important!
- All right.

259
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,360
- Tell the story.
- This isn't the time...

260
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,870
- to talk about social media.
- This story can persuade everyone.

261
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,180
This story can persuade everyone.

262
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,350
This isn't the time
to talk about social media.

263
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,770
You don't even have
a social media account.

264
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,320
How could you shut me down
like this?

265
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,850
Listen. Your looks...

266
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,880
are passed down...

267
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,020
- from your parents.
- Stop it.

268
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,300
They are related to the environment
you're brought up in.

269
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,350
There is a saying,

270
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,990
"You live as you look."

271
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,800
- It's about face reading.
- Yes.

272
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,300
- "You live as you look."
- Yes.

273
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,890
- A simple way of explaining it.
- However,

274
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,000
as you live,

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,600
you see so many people
who don't live as they look.

276
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,400
Look at me. I am like that.

277
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,270
- Se Chan is like that.
- Look at his face.

278
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,400
- But you live as you look.
- That's right.

279
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,110
You are well-known
to represent that saying.

280
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,110
Why did he rope me into this?

281
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,140
Why?

282
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,350
- Why did he rope me into this?
- I don't live as I look.

283
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,120
- You live as you look.
- That's not true.

284
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,880
Listen. Look at Se Chan's face.

285
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,490
- Does he look like a good student?
- No, he doesn't.

286
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,760
(It's a heavy blow.)

287
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,860
Hey, that's...

288
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,300
Isn't that a personal attack?

289
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,840
You should watch what you say.

290
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,230
- Doesn't he look dumb?
- Speak for yourself!

291
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,570
You have the same look!

292
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,080
Are you belittling him?

293
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,730
- Are you belittling him?
- We are saying it's science.

294
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,870
- You should watch what you say.
- We are saying it's science.

295
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,310
He just looks dumb!

296
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,180
- Seriously.
- You punks!

297
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,320
This is...
This is a personal attack.

298
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,110
- Don't land a personal attack.
- I know. You shouldn't do that.

299
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,980
- Don't land a personal attack.
- It's just wrong.

300
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,750
Suk Jin has the face of a man
who gets okay grades...

301
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,220
and leads a diligent life.

302
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,350
- His life is following his looks.
- Seriously.

303
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,460
Listen.

304
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,860
- I will tell you this.
- Okay.

305
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,930
When Suk Jin debuted
in the early 1990s,

306
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,970
people in the show business said...

307
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,600
that he has the face of a host
who will lead the future.

308
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,770
Did they say that about Suk Jin?

309
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,500
- He became a host.
- No.

310
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,580
Who said that?

311
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,770
It isn't science!

312
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,180
- While he hosts shows...
- Did people really say that?

313
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,420
- If it's between A and B...
- He can work as a host.

314
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,640
I can work as a host.

315
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,090
He is the Yoo Jae Suk of YouTube!

316
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,140
I can work as a host.

317
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,290
- He became a host.
- While he hosts shows...

318
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,820
- When I was a rookie...
- I am sure...

319
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,650
- Many people on social media...
- No, no. Don't talk about that.

320
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,720
(He cuts off Kwang Soo again.)

321
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,250
This isn't the time
to talk about social media.

322
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,470
Let's not talk about that.

323
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,120
- Can't I talk about it?
- Jae Suk is right.

324
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,170
Don't talk about social media.

325
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,040
- We are done.
- Let's see the result now.

326
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,070
B won.

327
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,730
Haha, So Min, Jong Kook,

328
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,340
- and Kwang Soo claimed...
- It's A.

329
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,500
- that face reading is science.
- There is no doubt about it.

330
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,240
If you found them persuasive,
choose A.

331
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,500
- Are we A or B?
- We are B.

332
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,510
- We are B.
- Choose A.

333
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,580
- A.
- It's A.

334
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,950
Let's see
the staff members' choice. One,

335
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,190
- two,
- Face reading isn't science.

336
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,420
- three.
- It's A.

337
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,480
(What will be
the staff members' choice?)

338
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,880
- It's B.
- It's B.

339
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,960
- B!
- More people chose B.

340
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,430
- That's right. It isn't science.
- More people chose B.

341
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,850
- It isn't science.
- More people chose B.

342
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,700
- More people chose B.
- Good job. Jae Suk, you did well.

343
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,120
It was hard.

344
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,970
What should I do?

345
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,890
- I have no information points.
- Me neither.

346
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,470
You have one last chance
to win information points.

347
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,230
The second mission is
your last chance to win points.

348
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,370
The lower you go,

349
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,950
the more points you will win.

350
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,010
It's Patience Prevails.

351
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,110
I am not good at that.

352
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,350
Two people will be on one team.

353
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,220
With your backs touching,

354
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,750
you will play limbo while one of you
carries the other on your back.

355
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,100
On the limbo stick,
brushes with wet paint are attached.

356
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,200
Even if you get paint on your face,

357
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,440
you succeed
if the stick doesn't fall.

358
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,100
But you fail...

359
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,310
if the stick falls
or a member's feet touch the ground.

360
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,630
The height you passed will be
the team's record.

361
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,130
1st place gets 7 points.

362
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,500
2nd place gets 5 points.

363
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,810
3rd place gets 3 points.

364
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,740
4th place gets 1 point. It will be
given to each team member.

365
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,820
We need to place second
at the very least.

366
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,950
Your team member is important.

367
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,950
It's a matter of who teams up
with Jong Kook.

368
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,720
- That would be incredible.
- Kwang Soo is too tall.

369
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,850
We will pick the teams now.

370
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,520
Let's do this.

371
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,720
You will team up with the member
who picks the same color.

372
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,460
- Please.
- 2, 3.

373
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,490
Yellow.

374
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,570
- Kwang Soo.
- Three.

375
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,990
- Blue.
- Three.

376
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,760
Red.

377
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,210
- Three.
- Red.

378
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,400
- Yellow.
- Yellow. Okay!

379
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,940
(Seeing her team member
makes her legs give out.)

380
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,440
- Hey, what about you?
- Green.

381
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,140
- Yellow.
- Yellow. Okay!

382
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,270
Green.

383
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,610
- I'm your partner.
- Oh, it's you.

384
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,870
- That's not bad.
- Ji Hyo, this is good.

385
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,970
- Yes, this is good.
- What's this?

386
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,090
- So Min.
- You should carry me on your back.

387
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,510
(The crazy height difference makes
Se Chan sigh.)

388
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,110
We must not pair up with each other.

389
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,750
- I clearly told you before.
- Why does this keep happening?

390
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,520
I don't like this situation either.

391
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,560
We can't... Gosh. Please let me
go now. I'm begging you.

392
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,760
We're in trouble.

393
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Let me win a race at least once.

394
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,470
- Shall we go last? Or third?
- Kwang Soo, if you do this well,

395
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,760
- I'll give you 10,000 dollars.
- Okay.

396
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,630
- This is important.
- You guys go last.

397
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,180
Se Chan promised to give me
10,000 dollars if I do this well,

398
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,370
and it made me so happy.

399
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,870
He said he'll give me 10,000 dollars
if I do well.

400
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,640
With that money,
you won't be in the bottom place.

401
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,240
Exactly. He said he'll give me
10,000 dollars.

402
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,880
- I'm a generous man.
- I'm so excited.

403
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,420
I wouldn't offer petty cash
like 50 or 100 dollars.

404
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,510
- I'll give him 10,000 dollars.
- I'd do anything for that money.

405
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,920
I'm jealous.

406
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,960
Oh, man. That's too low.
That's too low.

407
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,830
- Just keep going.
- The brushes will fall off at once.

408
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,300
- Hold my arms tightly.
- Okay.

409
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
- I'll put my hands on my knees.
- Got it.

410
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,860
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

411
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,540
- That's exactly my point.
- That makes sense.

412
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,970
- This won't be easy.
- I'll wrap your arms like this.

413
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,400
- Wait.
- Hold on a second.

414
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
- I'm ready.
- It's hard because you can't see.

415
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
(Lifting up)

416
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,970
You should lie down
just like Haha did.

417
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,050
(Jong Kook carries Haha who gained
weight recently on his back easily.)

418
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,140
Go now. Go, go.

419
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,270
- Keep going. Go.
- That's too low.

420
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,090
- Keep going. Yes.
- Can I keep going?

421
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,550
- Keep going without stopping.
- You can move as you are.

422
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,220
(What a stable position.)

423
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,850
- Keep going.
- Really?

424
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,430
- Is it okay?
- Keep going.

425
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,300
- Keep going, Jong Kook.
- Bend down a little. A bit lower.

426
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,390
(As Haha got scared
and asked him to lower him,)

427
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,620
(he lowered his body
with all his might.)

428
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,490
(With a large gap
between the brushes and Haha,)

429
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,400
- Okay!
- Okay.

430
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,710
(they passed without getting
any paint on Haha.)

431
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,630
(It was a textbook play.)

432
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,730
Great job.

433
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,970
We passed.

434
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,350
- Here we go.
- You can do it!

435
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,550
- Ji Hyo, tell me what to do.
- It's Ji Hyo's team's turn.

436
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,110
- I'll tell you.
- Okay.

437
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,320
- They pair up together often.
- I'll tell you.

438
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,720
- Ji Hyo, can we go now?
- Yes, let's go.

439
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,850
- Go. Keep going.
- Can I go as I am now?

440
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,850
Go.

441
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,480
- Maintain the height.
- Okay.

442
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,960
Jae Suk, go down a little.
Just a little lower.

443
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,830
- I just did.
- Okay. Good. Go now.

444
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,100
(Jae Suk tried to lower his body
as much as he could.)

445
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Oh, my gosh.

446
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,170
(Her body touched the brushes!)

447
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,600
(When they were halfway through,)

448
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,360
(Ji Hyo's body touched the brushes.)

449
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,100
- Wait. Go down.
- I just did.

450
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,000
Keep going as you are. Good.

451
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,340
Okay.

452
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,370
I just did.

453
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,270
(Ji Hyo prevented from touching
brushes again by tilting her head.)

454
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,370
- We did it, Jae Suk.
- Okay. Good job.

455
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,610
- Why is everyone so serious today?
- Let's go.

456
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,350
Why are you all so serious?

457
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,420
Next!

458
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,110
Let's do this. I'll turn the game
around in three years. Watch me.

459
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,750
People probably think
we can't do this.

460
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,960
But we can do this.

461
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,560
- We can succeed.
- Let's prove them wrong.

462
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,930
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay!

463
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,600
He can pass the first level.

464
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,540
He's been working out at home.

465
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,760
I've been working out at home.

466
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,760
Okay. Suk Jin, let's go.

467
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,000
Go, go. Go straight. Hurry up.

468
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,810
- Her feet might touch the floor.
- Suk Jin, go straight.

469
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,040
- Oh, no.
- Be careful.

470
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,100
Go, go. Go straight. Hurry up.

471
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,580
(Suk Jin is going forward
with his wobbly legs.)

472
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,950
(Give me a moment.)

473
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,220
- You're out.
- Let me take a break.

474
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,720
- No, we're not.
- They're out.

475
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,790
Let me take a short break.

476
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,550
Okay. Suk Jin, focus.

477
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,610
- What?
- Focus.

478
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,190
But they keep talking to me.

479
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,590
- Go with that height.
- Okay.

480
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,880
By the way, are you playing the game
with your uncle?

481
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,700
(2021 New Year's Special,
Athletic Contest with Uncles)

482
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,850
Is this a New Year's special?

483
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,260
- Okay.
- Are you in the center?

484
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,760
- Go now.
- Here we go.

485
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,230
- Hey, you look so scary.
- Suk Jin.

486
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,570
Wait, Suk Jin.

487
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,710
- How high is it?
- Your feet mustn't touch the floor.

488
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,040
- What did you see?
- You should see the bar.

489
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,500
(But the weak niece hasn't even
lifted up her head to see the bar.)

490
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,580
- What did you see?
- You should see the bar.

491
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,100
- Suk Jin, I can't see it.
- Hey, take a look.

492
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,550
- I can't see it.
- Lift up your head and look at it.

493
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,820
- Wait for a second.
- Come on.

494
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,010
- They won't make it.
- You should see it.

495
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,420
- Take a look at it.
- Wait.

496
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,790
(She's taking a break on her uncle's
back unintentionally.)

497
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,850
- I said, look!
- She can't lift up her head.

498
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,290
Suk Jin, you're pulling her arms
too hard.

499
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,010
- Lift up your head and look.
- So Min, you should take a look.

500
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,190
- I can't...
- Or you can't pass.

501
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,150
(Big Nose started moving backward
without checking the height.)

502
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,890
Okay. Go. Go down a little.

503
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,100
No. Lower. Lower.

504
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,800
(The bar started swaying.)

505
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,170
Go down. Lower.

506
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,570
(They failed in the end.)

507
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,540
(Suk Jin's legs gave out
after only a few steps.)

508
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,630
- Lower...
- Oh, no.

509
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,000
(Big Nose is still too weak
despite exercising.)

510
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,100
Gosh. I can't believe...

511
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,970
My thighs hurt so much.

512
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,010
(She's paying a silent tribute
to her uncle who was humiliated.)

513
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,250
Hey, you should've looked at it.

514
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,280
(While the 2 weakest members are
feeling sad about failing Level 1,)

515
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,210
(someone is preparing for his turn
while taking off his shirt.)

516
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,140
(Wiggling)

517
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,110
(He's willing to take off 1 layer of
his bottom clothes to move freely.)

518
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,320
Let's just check the height.

519
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,350
Try it.

520
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,830
(The beanpole in leggings tries
carrying the dumpy guy on his back.)

521
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,300
- Grab my thighs.
- Kwang Soo.

522
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,570
- Where? Here?
- Support your body like that.

523
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,770
Try to hold it by yourself.

524
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,600
(What?)

525
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,160
- Kwang Soo, this won't work.
- That won't work.

526
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,510
- They can't even...
- Kwang Soo, this won't work.

527
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,130
They might fail in front of the bar.

528
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,200
(They'll definitely fail
in front of it.)

529
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,810
- They might fail in front of it.
- Wait, Kwang Soo.

530
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,480
- Stop.
- It won't work?

531
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,750
Kwang Soo, you...

532
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,020
You have such a skinny butt,
Kwang Soo.

533
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,780
- That's not true.
- I was lying on your back,

534
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,790
- and all I could feel was the bone.
- Stop it.

535
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,320
By the way, where did you
get these leggings?

536
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,990
Why are you asking that?

537
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,850
It's okay as long as the bar
doesn't fall off.

538
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,530
I'll bend down this much, so you...

539
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,030
Stop. You're too tall.

540
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,500
- Come up higher.
- Like this?

541
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,860
- Like this?
- Yes. That's good.

542
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,070
- Here we go.
- That's good. You look stable.

543
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,270
He didn't have to take off
his pants. Why did he do that?

544
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,240
- That's good.
- Kwang Soo, tell me what to do.

545
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,080
- Where did you get your leggings?
- Keep going.

546
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,630
That's not important now.

547
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,600
- I like leggings too.
- Keep going.

548
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,350
- Okay.
- Keep going.

549
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,370
Hang on. I don't think
these are leggings.

550
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,820
They're leggings.

551
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,880
Get your hands off me!

552
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,180
- Look.
- They're leggings. Stop.

553
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,150
- Look here.
- They're unique.

554
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,210
- This is...
- Let's go.

555
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,590
Hey, stop. Wait. I said, wait!

556
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,650
(His leggings are at risk
of being damaged.)

557
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,060
- Wait. Hey.
- Goodness.

558
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,850
(The leggings man is facing a crisis
in front of the bar.)

559
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,860
- Stop. Wait a second.
- Gosh.

560
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,500
Why? What's wrong?

561
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,840
Why do you want to come down?

562
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,600
Put him down, Se Chan.

563
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,040
- Why did you tell me to stop?
- It's okay now.

564
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,200
- Do you want to come down?
- Stand up for a second.

565
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,630
- I think...
- Hey! Stop.

566
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,400
- Hey, you can go now.
- Hey, stop!

567
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,510
Wait.

568
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,750
(Se Chan has no idea what crisis
Kwang Soo is dealing with.)

569
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,870
- His leggings...
- Bend lower.

570
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,580
- You should bend lower.
- Gosh, my leggings.

571
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,710
(Bouncing)

572
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,050
Oh, gosh.

573
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,760
- You should bend lower.
- Gosh, my leggings.

574
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,380
(Se Chan tries to lower his body
as much as possible, but...)

575
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
Oh, no.

576
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,180
Gosh.

577
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,730
You're out.

578
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,150
Hey, your leggings have...

579
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,500
a zipper.

580
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,690
It's not a zipper.

581
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,770
- It's not?
- It's not a zipper.

582
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,630
(He ended up getting paint
on his leggings for nothing.)

583
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,130
Oh, my. Will we be able to
pull it off?

584
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,430
- Okay.
- I'm dizzy.

585
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,240
This is the final match.

586
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,400
If both teams succeed,
we'll give you all bonus points.

587
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Sounds great.

588
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,080
- It's hard to step backward.
- I think we'll fail this time.

589
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,580
- It's too low.
- It should be lower.

590
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
It's really low.

591
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,140
That's too difficult.

592
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,820
That's impossible.

593
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,880
Let me see. I think I should
squat as low as I can go.

594
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,880
Let's move diagonally, Jong Kook.

595
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,730
- No. Let's stand straight.
- Will you go straight?

596
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,390
This is almost
physically impossible.

597
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,230
- Just a second.
- Really?

598
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,830
- Wait.
- Okay. This is good.

599
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,230
Jong Kook, go now. Just go.

600
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,240
- Wait.
- I'll hold this position.

601
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,460
It's okay. Keep going.

602
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,400
Just a slight touch won't
make the bar fall off.

603
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,770
- Stop.
- You can still succeed.

604
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,100
- Just a little lower.
- You have no choice.

605
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,700
You should go lower.

606
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,010
- It's okay. Keep moving slowly.
- Wait.

607
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,050
Jong Kook, stop.

608
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,940
- You'll fail because of his belly.
- You should move slowly.

609
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,990
- Look at his belly.
- How much have you been eating?

610
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,750
Why is his belly sticking out
so much?

611
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,410
Hey, I'm feeling good now.

612
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,110
Oh, gosh. Hold on.

613
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,620
Hey. Hey, you...

614
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,150
(Between the brushes and Jong Kook's
back, he's feeling happy somehow.)

615
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,800
(Because of Haha's confession,)

616
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,860
(Jong Kook lost his balance.)

617
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
- Why?
- His belly is...

618
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,860
sticking out too much
to pass the bar.

619
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,430
(Jong Kook and Haha failed
Level 2.)

620
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,810
- Ji Hyo, this is...
- I don't think we can do this.

621
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,580
If you succeed,
you will get seven points.

622
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,850
- Would you pay 30,000 dollars?
- We'll probably fail, Ji Hyo.

623
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,870
Hold on.

624
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,850
This is impossible.

625
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:56,870
(Even the strong Jong Kook failed
to clear 95cm.)

626
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,940
- Ji Hyo, here we go.
- Okay.

627
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,290
Let's go.

628
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,940
- I'll move now.
- I'll try to hang steadily.

629
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,940
Let's go, let's go.

630
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,950
Jae Suk, you need to go
much lower than this.

631
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,820
This is physically impossible.

632
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,990
You're right. This is impossible.

633
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,790
(Her legs have almost passed.)

634
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,620
- Jae Suk, go down. It's too close.
- It's over.

635
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,330
- Go down, Jae Suk.
- It's over.

636
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,360
Ji Hyo, does your body touch
the brushes?

637
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,800
Yes... I mean, no. Dad.
I won't touch it.

638
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,930
Did she just call him "Dad"?

639
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,340
She called him "Dad".

640
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,340
No, Dad. I won't touch it.

641
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,080
(She's so flustered
that she made a mistake.)

642
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,540
- "Dad!"
- Ji Hyo, are you all right?

643
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,370
- Yes, Jae Suk. I'm all right.
- Okay.

644
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,870
Is this "Dad's Challenge"?

645
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,110
(At every step he makes,
the bar sways.)

646
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,880
Gosh. This is too low.

647
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,020
Oh, no. It'll fall off.

648
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,090
No, I think he can pull it off.

649
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,020
(They're moving backward slowly
getting paint on Ji Hyo.)

650
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,530
- Ji Hyo can't do anything about it.
- No.

651
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,420
(95cm is too low to pass under it
while carrying someone on the back.)

652
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,230
- No, it's okay.
- Ji Hyo can't do anything about it.

653
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,260
Go slowly.

654
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,300
(It's okay?)

655
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,830
(Jae Suk is passing under the bar
little by little.)

656
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,800
It's okay.
You can do this, Jae Suk.

657
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,240
- Oh, no.
- Be careful.

658
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,400
- It's okay.
- It'll work.

659
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,460
- It'll work.
- It'll work.

660
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,040
- Will that work?
- It's okay.

661
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,010
- It'll work.
- It'll work.

662
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,600
- It's okay.
- It'll work.

663
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,610
(Meanwhile, they already passed
the halfway point.)

664
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,750
- It'll work.
- It'll work.

665
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,750
- Will that work?
- It's okay.

666
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,380
This is unbelievable.

667
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,590
- Awesome.
- Jae Suk.

668
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,850
This is unbelievable.

669
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,090
We can do this.

670
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,290
- We're almost there.
- It's working.

671
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,450
They did it.

672
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,650
(Jae Suk fell backward
at the last moment.)

673
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,570
(If they succeed, they'll obtain
7 points as the sole winning team.)

674
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,600
The bar didn't fall off.

675
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,160
We made it. We made it.

676
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,930
(Jae Suk and Ji Hyo cleared 95cm.)

677
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,930
We made it.

678
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,170
(Jae Suk succeeded the hardest 95cm
with his strong mindset.)

679
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,750
Ji Hyo, we made it.

680
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,780
(It's hard to believe he succeeded.)

681
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,140
Ji Hyo, we made it.

682
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,520
(They're excited about
the unexpected success.)

683
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,110
- I can't believe we did it.
- Jae Suk, you're awesome.

684
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,710
- Great job!
- I'm so excited.

685
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,020
How did he do that?

686
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,880
- I'm so excited!
- Ji Hyo!

687
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,760
- Jae Suk!
- I can't believe this.

688
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,790
(The 2 investors hit the jackpot.)

689
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,950
I can't believe we pulled it off.

690
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,150
(After buying 2 Level 2 Information,
they'll still have 1 point left.)

691
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,300
Everyone seems so crazy
about getting information.

692
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,530
You're all crazy
about getting information.

693
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,270
Why would you be so serious?

694
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,810
- We did it, Ji Hyo.
- I didn't expect it.

695
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,900
(They were more serious than ever
during the last mission.)

696
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,480
Jae Suk and Ji Hyo are the winners.
Each will receive seven points.

697
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
- Oh, yes!
- All right!

698
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,310
I'm going to buy some information.

699
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,580
(The 2017 Stock Prices)

700
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,610
What should I buy this time?

701
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,850
(The 2017 Stock Prices)

702
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,450
You sold 750 shares
of F Biotechnology...

703
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,530
and cashed out 30,000 dollars.

704
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,330
So this is the amount I have left
after cashing them out?

705
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,960
Do you want to give them
another chance?

706
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,230
- Of course not. Why would we?
- Just once.

707
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,690
I'll give you some money.
What do you say?

708
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,800
No, I won't accept it.

709
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,300
Give each of us 5,000 dollars.

710
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,430
- 5,000 dollars for each?
- You'll spend only 30,000 dollars.

711
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,740
- But if you give us the money...
- Okay!

712
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,510
- Okay.
- Is he that rich?

713
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,350
- I'll give each 5,000 dollars.
- 5,000 dollars. Okay.

714
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,140
How much money does he have?

715
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,250
(So 30,000 dollars was deducted
from his account.)

716
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,580
Really? But I still have this much
in my account?

717
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,990
(He still has over 56,000 dollars
left in his account.)

718
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,680
My gosh. I had more than
100,000 dollars.

719
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,650
This is good.

720
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,230
(Suk Jin, in 2nd place,
has less than half of Se Chan.)

721
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,060
I think I should go all-in for this.

722
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,330
Since this is the last chance,
I'm going to...

723
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,420
How much money
does he have... What?

724
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,040
My goodness. He's incredible.

725
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,100
How much does he have?

726
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,840
He still has almost 60,000 dollars.

727
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,600
I also have 15,000 dollars in cash.

728
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,930
- Gosh. What?
- Why do you have so much money?

729
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,340
Why do you have so much money?

730
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,370
It feels like I'm playing
with babies.

731
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,350
While they're contemplating whether
or not to invest 500 dollars more,

732
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,640
- I'm thinking of 10,000 dollars.
- That's amazing.

733
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,750
While I'm dealing with amounts
higher than 10,000 dollars,

734
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,150
I see you guys talking 500 dollars.
It doesn't draw my attention.

735
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,330
Gosh.

736
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,650
(The other investors have a feeling
of relative deprivation.)

737
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,450
Gosh, this is so difficult.

738
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,300
Does anyone want to sell
information to me?

739
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,030
(Yang and Rich even buys
information with money.)

740
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,300
I'll pay you if you give me
useful information.

741
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,500
May I offer you 1 piece
of 3-point information?

742
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,270
Really? Tell me what kind first.

743
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,460
- IT.
- What?

744
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,200
- IT.
- Which one of them?

745
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,370
(A black market for information
opened in an instant.)

746
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,510
What else should I buy?

747
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,580
I've seen a sight like this
on a news show.

748
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,050
- What did you say?
- I've seen this on a news show.

749
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,610
- Gosh. It's giving me a headache.
- Everyone was...

750
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,450
- whispering to each other.
- How much?

751
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,520
This is no joke.

752
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,710
Up to 5,000 dollars?

753
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,490
- How many shares of B can I buy?
- B Entertainment?

754
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,190
I mean, we're using fake money.

755
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,190
Here's 5,000 dollars.

756
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,330
They're all whispering
to each other.

757
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,800
Why is it taking you so long
to calculate it?

758
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,540
Why is everyone so serious?

759
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Hello.

760
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,510
I'm Jeon So Min, the life
of the party on Running Man.

761
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,240
From my experience
in stock investment,

762
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,400
I learned that making an investment
by following your hunch...

763
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,850
can lead to failure.

764
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,600
That's why I've decided...

765
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,080
to go all-in for one company.

766
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,440
(The interview with the disoriented
citizen ended.)

767
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,180
Se Chan, I have information
on B Entertainment.

768
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,820
- Sorry?
- B Entertainment.

769
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,410
I'm sorry,

770
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,880
but I'll give you 100 dollars,
so get lost.

771
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,420
- Thank you.
- Okay?

772
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,390
- If you give me fake information...
- This is real information.

773
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,730
Don't do that to me.

774
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,800
(B Entertainment announces
production of...)

775
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,960
("Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks".)

776
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,240
Hold on. Oh, gosh.

777
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,390
(Hold on!)

778
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,860
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks" will be
released next year?

779
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,040
- This is the information I got.
- That movie was a huge flop.

780
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,930
(He's saying something very harsh.)

781
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,440
That won't be useful.
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks"?

782
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,210
If you go to Se Chan, he'll tell you
to get lost offering 100 dollars.

783
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,370
You can get 100 dollars easily.

784
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,790
(It's a high-paying job as long as
you can endure humiliation.)

785
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,610
- He just blabbered nonsense.
- What did he say?

786
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,350
He advised me to buy
B Entertainment's shares...

787
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,380
because "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks"
will be released.

788
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,060
(It's useless information
that no one would buy.)

789
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,830
- Don't leak the information.
- That's why I told him to get lost.

790
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,690
Don't leak useful information.

791
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,100
G Foods...

792
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,620
- G Foods?
- Can I buy that much?

793
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,960
- Sorry?
- Haha and Jong Kook's tonkatsu...

794
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,300
is about to be released.

795
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,960
- Here. Get lost.
- Thank you.

796
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:24,100
He said that his tonkatsu product is
about to be released.

797
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,100
- Go on.
- It's about to be released.

798
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,850
- It's around the corner.
- It's coming soon.

799
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,880
Kwang Soo, come with me.

800
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,490
Let's go and buy some information.

801
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,520
(Following Se Chan)

802
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,110
Kwang Soo, I'll get information...

803
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,150
(Kwang Soo joined him
without much thought.)

804
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,560
on I Chemical.

805
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,590
- Okay?
- Okay.

806
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,420
Chemical companies did well
from 2017 to 2019.

807
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,300
- I think it's D IT. I saw it.
- I see.

808
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,620
- Okay.
- You check out D IT.

809
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,930
And I'll check out I Chemical.

810
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,500
- Okay. Let's meet up here.
- Okay.

811
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,360
(Haha will check out D IT. Jong Kook
will check out I Chemical.)

812
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,960
All right. Oh, dear.

813
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,400
I'll get a hint on I Chemical.

814
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,600
- Which level would you like?
- Level One, please.

815
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,940
(I Chemical increased sharply.
Could there be good news again?)

816
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,850
(Crude oil prices skyrocket.)

817
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:05,850
(Crude oil prices skyrocket?)

818
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,020
That's great news.

819
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,020
"Crude oil prices..."

820
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,920
- Is this information on I Chemical?
- Yes.

821
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,730
(What does oil price have to do
with a chemical company?)

822
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,000
Is an oil price increase
good for a chemical company?

823
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,000
Is it not good?

824
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
(Information only confuses
him more.)

825
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,340
Is an increase in oil price
good for a chemical company?

826
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,770
- Okay.
- Got it.

827
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,810
Does oil have anything to do
with a chemical company?

828
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,580
No, oil is...

829
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,940
It has something to do
with the oil price.

830
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,280
- It means the oil price increased.
- I see.

831
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,140
- The energy...
- So they're not related?

832
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,350
If it increased sharply,

833
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,750
we have to figure out
how it'll affect the stock price.

834
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,020
But we can't because we didn't
learn things like that.

835
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,520
We're done for.

836
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,560
It's so difficult.

837
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
I Chemical.

838
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,350
- I Chemical stock went down, right?
- Yes.

839
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,620
- Check out I Chemical.
- I'll do that.

840
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,570
- Then I'll get information on...
- E Biotechnology.

841
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,860
- E Biotechnology?
- Yes.

842
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,390
Okay.

843
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,600
(So Min got Level 1 Information
on I Chemical too.)

844
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,430
"Crude oil prices skyrocket."

845
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,400
Suk Jin.

846
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
What did you find out?

847
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,870
It said that
crude oil prices skyrocketed.

848
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,940
- Is that it?
- Yes. "Crude oil prices skyrocket."

849
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,140
If there's less demand,
the stock price will go down.

850
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,370
- Am I right?
- Yes.

851
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,590
- I Chemical.
- Yes.

852
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,680
Did you hear
that the oil price increased?

853
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,110
If it increased...

854
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,290
That means it's just the beginning.

855
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,030
- What?
- It's just the beginning.

856
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,450
- Is that what it means?
- If the oil price...

857
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,650
- No. That means...
- Are you saying it's good news?

858
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,500
Is it good news? Isn't it bad news?

859
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,360
Suk Jin, think about it.
If the oil price goes up,

860
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,390
then...

861
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,860
(The increase in crude oil price)

862
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,600
There will be more demand
for alternative energy.

863
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,040
(As a result, I Chemical stock will
increase as an energy company.)

864
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,130
- Come with me.
- Why?

865
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,740
I'll explain it to you.

866
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,740
Cameraman, won't you follow us?

867
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,740
(Cameraman, won't you follow us?)

868
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,850
I'll explain it to you.

869
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,200
(Cameraman, won't you follow us?)

870
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,580
(Rushing)

871
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,670
We're having a discussion.

872
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,940
(The cameraman unintentionally
forgot about him.)

873
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,880
I mean, we're...
What he meant by that...

874
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,760
There can be several ways
of interpreting the news.

875
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,610
Since oil prices increased,

876
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,950
there might be more demand
for alternative energy.

877
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,920
- Then it won't affect their stock.
- It's possible.

878
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,800
You're right. It said
that the price skyrocketed.

879
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,130
Then I should invest
in I Chemical.

880
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,660
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

881
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,340
- It will definitely rise.
- Okay.

882
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,580
- I'm sure this is right. Let's go.
- Okay.

883
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,440
- I think we're right.
- I'll invest half in it.

884
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,850
I think we're right.

885
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,940
- D IT?
- D IT and I Chemical.

886
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,370
I'll buy as many shares as I can.

887
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,210
- D IT and I Chemical?
- Yes.

888
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,350
(After long, hard thought...)

889
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,850
I'll buy I Chemical's shares.

890
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,850
(Ji Suk Jin's account balance)

891
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,850
200 shares.

892
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,950
(He invested most of his money
in I Chemical.)

893
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,330
I'll invest the remaining money
in E Biotechnology.

894
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,890
- All in E Biotechnology?
- Yes.

895
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:30,950
(He sold his F Biotechnology shares
and bought E Biotechnology.)

896
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,120
(Jeon So Min's account balance)

897
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,830
I will pull out of everything
and invest in I Chemical.

898
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,120
(So Min invested all she had
in I Chemical.)

899
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,300
I'll sell half of the shares,

900
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,500
and invest in C IT.

901
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
(As a novice, she invested
in several companies.)

902
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,010
Mr. Yang.

903
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,600
Can you give me 27 dollars?

904
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,040
- How much?
- 27 dollars.

905
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,900
Are you sure you didn't mean
250 or 270 dollars?

906
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,140
I said 27 dollars.

907
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,050
But if you give me 270 dollars,
I'd be grateful.

908
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,520
I hope you don't think...

909
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,180
- that I'm arrogant.
- Never.

910
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,150
- I'm not doing charity, you know.
- Of course.

911
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,880
Can you do the mosquito dance
just for me?

912
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,920
(Can you do the mosquito dance
just for me?)

913
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,420
(He drooled.)

914
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,330
Forget it if you don't want to.

915
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,600
- I'll invest in other companies.
- It's not like that.

916
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,500
(Inner conflict)

917
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,190
- Forget it if you don't want to.
- No. I'll do it.

918
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,340
I could invest in other people.

919
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,200
I know that it went down
and went back up.

920
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,980
But I'm not sure whether it happened
in 2019 or 2020.

921
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,600
(A giant mosquito bit my foot)

922
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,370
(Satisfied)

923
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,410
(He paid 250 dollars
for the mosquito performance.)

924
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,880
- Thank you for your performance.
- Thank you.

925
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,050
- I really enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

926
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,650
- I'll ask for it again.
- Okay.

927
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,490
Se Chan, what about me?

928
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,620
(The 2nd show,
The Human Magnet Show)

929
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,300
How is it stuck on there?
That's amazing.

930
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
- Honestly...
- How long can it last?

931
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,390
How do you do that?

932
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,340
Here's 500 dollars for you.

933
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,460
- How does it stay attached to her?
- It's for your magnet show.

934
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,600
- Really?
- Yes.

935
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,340
(While many investors gave in
to capitalist society...)

936
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,940
Jae Suk, I'm at the bottom.
Please help me out.

937
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,440
Then let's share the information
we got with each other.

938
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,250
Information? Okay. I agree.

939
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,490
I'll get information
on that company.

940
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,490
A biotechnology company?

941
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,730
- F Biotechnology.
- F Biotechnology?

942
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,620
I'll get information
on F Biotechnology.

943
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,420
(Jae Suk came to buy information
on F Biotechnology as he promised.)

944
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,190
Can I get information
on F Biotechnology?

945
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,300
- Level 1 or 2?
- Level 2.

946
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,300
(He bought Level 2 Information
on F Biotechnology.)

947
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,840
(F Biotechnology put the rumor about
its clinical trial failure to rest.)

948
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,010
(And its stock price increased.)

949
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,240
(F Biotechnology stock prices
will increase!)

950
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,010
(It increased a lot,
but it will increase even more?)

951
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,210
(He found out that F Biotechnology
stock will increase again!)

952
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,250
Thank you.

953
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,590
(He found out that F Biotechnology
stock will increase again!)

954
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,590
- So many people have come here.
- What did you find out?

955
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,020
- You look excited.
- What did you find out?

956
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,180
- Sorry?
- Which company did you check out?

957
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,330
Which company did you check out?

958
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,620
Well, I just...

959
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,850
He won't tell us.

960
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,850
Ji Hyo!

961
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,860
(He calls Ji Hyo
to share the information!)

962
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,460
F Biotechnology stocks will rise.

963
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,400
- F Biotechnology?
- Yes, its stock will rise.

964
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,600
It may not increase sharply,
but buy some of its shares.

965
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,580
(With the information
that she got from Jae Suk...)

966
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,110
I'll invest all I have
in F Biotechnology.

967
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,640
(Staying alert
not to let anyone hear him...)

968
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
I'll pull out of I Chemical
and invest in F Biotechnology.

969
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,880
- Will you sell all of it?
- Yes.

970
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,150
(Yoo Jae Suk's account balance)

971
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,520
Let me see. How much is it?

972
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,620
I have 28 dollars.

973
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,620
I'll buy extra shares of I Chemical
worth 20 dollars.

974
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,530
It's 35 dollars.

975
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,500
Oh, that's last year's price.

976
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,960
Gosh. I should've bought it
last year.

977
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,190
Then I'll just have to hold on.

978
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,740
(He has no choice but to hold on to
I Chemical stocks for another year.)

979
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,010
Hold on to it!

980
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,630
(Lee Kwang Soo's account balance)

981
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,780
First...

982
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,350
(Se Chan got information on
I Chemical from Kwang Soo.)

983
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,780
I'll buy 250 shares
of F Biotechnology.

984
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,380
(Earlier on, Jae Suk found out that
F Biotechnology stock will rise.)

985
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,520
Thank you.

986
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,230
(And Se Chan
observed him carefully.)

987
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,760
(You look excited.)

988
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,730
(Se Chan sensed his excitement
from his smile.)

989
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,120
(After looking around,)

990
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,600
(he followed Jae Suk.)

991
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,040
(Jae Suk and Ji Hyo shared tips
without knowing anything.)

992
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,100
(Se Chan slyly approached them
without missing the chance.)

993
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,480
(And he successfully eavesdropped
on the news about the increase!)

994
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,280
(He quickly bought as many shares of
F Biotechnology as he could.)

995
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,050
(Could Se Chan hit the jackpot
again this year?)

996
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,060
(Time's up
for the investments of 2017.)

997
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,060
Let's find out.

998
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,450
Since I earned a lot
in the first year...

999
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,950
- I just need to beat Ji Hyo.
- I can't give up to the end.

1000
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,300
I hope I don't end up
at the bottom.

1001
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,620
You're incredible.

1002
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,830
That's not true. I have more money
in here... Why do I have money here?

1003
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,300
He looks different somehow.

1004
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,630
Where do you get so much money?

1005
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,040
- Where did all the money come from?
- How much are these worth?

1006
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,660
- They're 500-dollar bills.
- 500 dollars?

1007
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,510
You look handsome today.

1008
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,930
After the prices are revealed,

1009
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,430
I'll...

1010
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,810
hand out some pocket money.

1011
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,810
- Sure.
- Thank you, sir!

1012
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:42,850
- Sir.
- How about this?

1013
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,940
Once the prices are revealed,

1014
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,580
- throw your money into the air.
- What do you say?

1015
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,680
Hold on a second.

1016
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,250
- That's not a bad idea.
- Right?

1017
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,260
- Just throw it.
- Wait a second.

1018
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,710
I should change these into bills.

1019
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,290
Throw money into the air
in smaller bills...

1020
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,760
depending on the stock prices.

1021
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,230
- Where will you throw them at?
- 2,000 dollars.

1022
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,420
In the air?

1023
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,030
We're all done here.

1024
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,030
(He's ready to receive the money.)

1025
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,660
- Mr. Yang!
- I...

1026
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,000
- Once the price skyrockets...
- Live long and prosper.

1027
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,070
I...

1028
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,070
(Money will rain down
if the stock price skyrockets.)

1029
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,200
- What are you doing here?
- It should be done.

1030
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,930
- Did you go all-in?
- Yes.

1031
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,510
Well, I invested
10,000 to 20,000 dollars...

1032
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,580
in the stocks I have.

1033
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,850
Unbelievable.

1034
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,370
- He can't lose, can he?
- I can't.

1035
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,850
Patience will prevail.

1036
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,940
But you haven't been patient at all.

1037
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,940
How can you be patient
with just 50 dollars?

1038
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,760
Just buy yourself
a snack or something.

1039
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,180
- You...
- With 50 dollars?

1040
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,650
How much do you have in total?

1041
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,060
I have more than Ji Hyo.

1042
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,390
- Really?
- You'd be surprised.

1043
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,920
It's all about who ends up losing.

1044
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,730
- It's the New Year.
- Happy New Year.

1045
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,000
- Happy New Year.
- Just this once...

1046
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,000
- I...
- Patience will prevail.

1047
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,330
We're aging too much today.

1048
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,400
Come on. Let's do this.

1049
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,730
(Ji Hyo and Jae Suk invested
everything in F Biotechnology.)

1050
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,040
Gosh, please.

1051
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,000
Let the price skyrocket.

1052
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,020
(Se Chan also invested
a lot in F Biotechnology.)

1053
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,810
Let the price skyrocket.

1054
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,540
Hold on a second.

1055
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,850
(The stock prices are revealed.)

1056
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,290
Ji Hyo, check out F Biotechnology!

1057
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,080
Guys!

1058
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,690
Here you go!

1059
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,290
(The 2018 Stock Market)

1060
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:08,270
(F Biotechnology: plus 150 percent,
I Chemical: minus 14 percent)

1061
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,920
Ji Hyo, check out F Biotechnology!

1062
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,940
(F Biotechnology skyrocketed
and ended at 150 percent!)

1063
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,040
Jae Suk!

1064
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,360
(F Biotechnology: plus 150 percent)

1065
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,580
(Meanwhile, I Chemical plummeted.)

1066
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:22,770
(Kwang Soo was betrayed
by I Chemical.)

1067
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,150
Ji Hyo, check out F Biotechnology!

1068
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,980
Guys! Here you go!

1069
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,380
(Chairman Yang's asset increased
by investing in F Biotechnology.)

1070
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,810
(It's raining money!)

1071
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,020
The stock price skyrocketed!

1072
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,520
It skyrocketed!

1073
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,060
(The money has small investors
spinning out of control.)

1074
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,020
Jae Suk!

1075
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,900
(The polarization of wealth
has become more serious.)

1076
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,730
- No way.
- Unbelievable.

1077
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,500
I sold F Biotechnology
and bought E Biotechnology.

1078
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,770
I lost money
on all the investments I made.

1079
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,480
F Biotechnology.

1080
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,900
We should've invested
in F Biotechnology.

1081
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,380
- You too, right?
- I'm in the red.

1082
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,170
- Okay, I'm good.
- Jae Suk,

1083
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,350
but the oil price went up.

1084
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,170
- What?
- Why did I Chemical drop?

1085
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,210
It's obvious it will drop.

1086
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,920
- But the oil price went up.
- I Chemical...

1087
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,380
That probably has nothing
to do with I Chemical.

1088
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,020
But that was
the information I received.

1089
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,790
But if the oil price goes up...

1090
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,190
(An increase in cost
will lead to less earnings.)

1091
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,250
Wouldn't I Chemical's stock price
go up?

1092
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,560
Oh, no.

1093
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,670
F Biotechnology...

1094
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,230
I shouldn't have sold
the stocks I had.

1095
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,400
I kept on mentioning
biotechnology companies.

1096
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,540
(Even in a mock investment,)

1097
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,710
(biotechnology keeps
disappointing him.)

1098
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,480
(Meanwhile, Yang and Rich
now has over 70,000 dollars.)

1099
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,580
You earned more once again?

1100
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,110
You earned another 100,000 dollars?

1101
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,250
My balance is now close
to 100,000 dollars.

1102
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,520
(Chairman Yang
is close to having 100,000 dollars.)

1103
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,880
- Unbelievable.
- I should get myself a driver.

1104
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,860
I keep...

1105
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,290
- I keep earning money.
- You should...

1106
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,920
- give yourself a nickname.
- Like what?

1107
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,790
- Dongducheon Braised Monkfish.
- Braised Monkfish?

1108
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,860
- That's worth 500 dollars.
- Thanks.

1109
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,330
Thank you.

1110
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,460
He earned a lot as well.

1111
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,730
(Jae Suk won the jackpot
with F Biotechnology too.)

1112
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,940
(An increase of 150 percent
couldn't taste sweeter.)

1113
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,040
(Nice!)

1114
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,400
How many zeroes are there?

1115
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,880
I have close to 10,000 dollars now.

1116
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,980
(She went from being in the red
to having 10,000 dollars.)

1117
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,710
What do I do?

1118
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,250
I'm doomed.

1119
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,250
Which jerk said to be patient?

1120
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,520
Who said that?

1121
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,150
When will mine go up?

1122
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,000
(He waited, but the stock price
fell to the floor.)

1123
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,060
Kwang Soo...

1124
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,860
He's got nothing.

1125
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,170
Let me see.

1126
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,600
There's nothing I can do now.

1127
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,230
How much do you have?

1128
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,400
29,000 dollars? Wait.

1129
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,730
You have 2,900 dollars?

1130
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,810
(You have 2,900 dollars?)

1131
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,610
But I have more than 3,000 dollars
in my hand right now.

1132
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,210
Hold on a second.

1133
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,810
Aren't you going to invest that?

1134
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,080
- Should I invest it with you?
- I mean,

1135
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,540
I was told to be patient.

1136
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,020
You're just being stubborn.

1137
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,060
I'm leaving the stock market
once I earn back my seed money.

1138
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,980
(He couldn't look
more pitiful from behind.)

1139
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,460
There's no way I can come in last.

1140
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,130
I should enjoy my life
from here on out.

1141
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,360
You must be smelling
the scent of money from here.

1142
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:00,310
(The tall investor reacts
to the scent of money.)

1143
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,940
Maybe a seagull will snatch it up.

1144
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,440
Are there no seagulls here?

1145
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,330
Maybe one will snatch it up.

1146
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,940
All right!

1147
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,170
(Smirking)

1148
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,350
The humiliation...

1149
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,350
I'll have this change my life!

1150
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,250
Here I come!

1151
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,880
(August of 2018)

1152
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,210
Time sure flies.

1153
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,310
(It's already the fall of 2018.)

1154
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,830
(The 2018 Stock Market)

1155
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,290
I Chemical and J Shipbuilding.

1156
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,960
J Shipbuilding is on the rise.

1157
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,170
J Shipbuilding
has been doing better.

1158
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,400
(Suk Jin looks to J Shipbuilding
to change things around.)

1159
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,040
Wait. What was its original price?
300 dollars?

1160
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,190
Kwang Soo,

1161
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,400
- check J Shipbuilding.
- J Shipbuilding?

1162
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,540
I'll check I Chemical.

1163
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,330
- Biotechnology...
- I Chemical should do better.

1164
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,400
I'll get information on it.

1165
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,480
It should be on the rise by now.

1166
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:40,980
Check J Shipbuilding, all right?

1167
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,610
(They agree to check J Shipbuilding
and I Chemical respectively.)

1168
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:46,610
(Kwang Soo's here for
information on J Shipbuilding.)

1169
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,690
- I'll check I Chemical.
- You have 60 points.

1170
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,750
You can buy
the Level One Information.

1171
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,560
"The US invests in
solar energy generation."

1172
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,150
(The US invests in
solar energy generation.)

1173
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,290
Isn't this a Korean company?

1174
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,400
(The US invests in
solar energy generation.)

1175
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,130
I'll get information on the chemical
and shipbuilding industry.

1176
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,920
This is about
the shipbuilding industry.

1177
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,670
(A large heavy industry company
wants to take over J Shipbuilding.)

1178
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,860
(The US invests in
solar energy generation.)

1179
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,000
These are both good news.

1180
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,080
Can I get some information too?

1181
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,230
(The pointless man enters.)

1182
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,250
Did you check on...

1183
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,250
- the shipbuilding industry?
- Yes.

1184
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,980
I'll trade the information
for 500 dollars.

1185
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,150
Really?

1186
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,850
- Okay, I'll share.
- The shipbuilding industry.

1187
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,420
You must've earned quite a lot.

1188
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,250
I'll give you 500 dollars.

1189
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,750
Kwang Soo,
I'll give you 1,000 dollars not to.

1190
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,810
Sure thing.

1191
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,250
(Kwang Soo changes his attitude.)

1192
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,360
- Come on.
- Good.

1193
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,060
- Must you be like this?
- Gosh.

1194
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,830
You're already in a solid lead.

1195
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,460
Still, I can't afford to
let you earn any more.

1196
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,330
- You're in second place.
- The information...

1197
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,540
is crucial though.

1198
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,110
I'll buy it for 500 dollars.

1199
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,230
Give it to me first.

1200
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,400
Let me see it.

1201
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,830
There's nothing I can do
with this money anyway.

1202
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,940
I don't get what this means though.

1203
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,380
"The best radish is..."

1204
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,020
- Are you kidding me?
- What does this mean?

1205
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,610
"The best radish is..."

1206
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,110
(Stop fooling around.)

1207
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,250
- Hand it over.
- This was the information.

1208
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,560
- Give it to me.
- "The best radish is..."

1209
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,690
- "Joseon radish."
- Hand it over!

1210
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,080
How is that the information?

1211
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,420
- "The best radish is..."
- Hand it over.

1212
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,630
- I don't get what this means.
- "The best radish is..."

1213
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,690
- Is it Joseon soy sauce?
- Joseon soy sauce?

1214
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:10,100
Joseon radish is the best?

1215
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,190
Hello,

1216
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,540
I'm Jeon So Min,
the life of Running Man.

1217
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,000
As you can see,
they've teamed up as duos.

1218
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,380
Meanwhile, I've been off on my own.

1219
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:21,880
Do you invest in stocks?

1220
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,420
You don't?
Who here invests in stocks?

1221
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,150
Anyone? Mr. Kang.

1222
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,110
Do you invest in stocks?

1223
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,250
- A little.
- Do you?

1224
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,060
C IT,

1225
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,920
J Shipbuilding, and I Chemical.

1226
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,060
Which one should I invest in?

1227
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,060
- C IT.
- C IT?

1228
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,290
(So Min's ears prick up
at his answer.)

1229
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,670
- Are you sure?
- No, I...

1230
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,540
So Min, why are you all alone?

1231
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,330
Well...

1232
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,170
- Are you and Chan Hee a team?
- Yes.

1233
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,400
- We are.
- He invests in stocks too.

1234
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
- So I heard.
- Yes, that's right.

1235
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,480
He invests in stocks.

1236
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,610
Mr. Kang.

1237
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,770
Thank you.

1238
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,420
What use would he have
for that money?

1239
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,480
He would have no use for this.

1240
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,790
He gave me some information.

1241
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,110
Thank you.

1242
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,190
- This is killing me.
- Let's get to work, people.

1243
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,790
(It's already November.)

1244
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,330
What matters the most...

1245
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,960
is how we do in the latter years.

1246
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,960
- Ji Hyo...
- Do you have enough for...

1247
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,630
three pieces of information?

1248
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,330
No, only one.

1249
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,330
Should I get the information?

1250
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,310
Wouldn't the stock price rise?

1251
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,310
- Check on B Entertainment.
- B Entertainment?

1252
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,250
- We'll share, right?
- Of course.

1253
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,880
(She'll buy information
on B Entertainment.)

1254
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,810
(What's the Level 2 Information
on B Entertainment?)

1255
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,420
Okay, here you go.

1256
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,920
(What's the Level 2 Information
on B Entertainment?)

1257
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,880
(No Japan Movement: B Entertainment
gets linked to patriotism.)

1258
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,150
"No Japan Movement."

1259
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,190
(The stock price rises.)

1260
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,460
B Entertainment gets linked
to patriotism...

1261
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,520
and the stock price rises.

1262
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,770
(B Entertainment's
stock price rises?)

1263
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:51,860
We'll go for B Entertainment.

1264
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,360
I'll go all-in.

1265
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,400
- Thank you so much.
- Let's do this.

1266
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,610
Ji Hyo, that was
a Level Two Information, right?

1267
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,480
(Ji Hyo decides to go all-in.)

1268
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,580
I'll sell everything I have...

1269
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,270
and buy B Entertainment's stocks.

1270
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:06,350
(B Entertainment: 7,764 shares)

1271
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,290
I'll readjust my portfolio.

1272
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,710
- B Entertainment, please.
- B Entertainment?

1273
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,360
- Yes.
- With everything you have?

1274
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,400
J Shipbuilding is on the rise.

1275
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,650
(J Shipbuilding: plus 25 percent)

1276
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,690
How much was that originally?
300 dollars?

1277
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,190
(He's been analyzing
J Shipbuilding for minutes.)

1278
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,040
(Suk Jin's been eyeing
J Shipbuilding for a while now.)

1279
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,130
The shipbuilding industry
had a hard time winning contracts,

1280
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,440
but it's been solid these days.

1281
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:30,830
The shipbuilding industry
hit bottom in recent years.

1282
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,500
(On his own,
he analyzes the industry.)

1283
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,940
I'm a little confused though.

1284
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,940
I can't remember if the industry...

1285
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,020
started to tick up in 2018 or 2019.

1286
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,420
The shipbuilding industry
gets better, but when?

1287
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,150
(He's been waiting for the industry
to be on the rise.)

1288
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,080
I should just go all-in.

1289
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,190
To win, I need to take a chance.

1290
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,830
It's already hit bottom.

1291
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,920
(Suk Jin mumbles by himself.)

1292
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:54,900
J Shipbuilding.

1293
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,230
I'm going all-in.

1294
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,440
- You'll sell the other shares?
- That's right.

1295
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,500
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo...)

1296
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,670
I have 1,300 dollars.

1297
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,980
- I Chemical.
- I Chemical?

1298
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,500
(He invests everything he has
in I Chemical.)

1299
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,610
It should be on the rise by now.

1300
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:08,770
It should be.

1301
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,210
It can't just continue to
plummet like this.

1302
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,920
That I'll give you.

1303
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,580
- I Chemical's a good move, right?
- I'm bored now.

1304
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,690
I Chemical?

1305
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,420
I Chemical...

1306
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,520
Yes, it's about time
the stock price went up.

1307
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,730
It ticks up slightly
only to plummet.

1308
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,290
Those tend to skyrocket.

1309
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,150
What's your take on J Shipbuilding?

1310
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,360
Not bad, guys.

1311
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
(Suk Jin makes it seem obvious
that he invested in J Shipbuilding.)

1312
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,630
I invested 20,000 dollars.

1313
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:30,900
(I invested 20,000 dollars.)

1314
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,100
To win, I need to take a chance.

1315
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:35,170
- I had to go all-in.
- Our conversation...

1316
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,270
"I poured it all in.
It went all in."

1317
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,540
Those expressions...

1318
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,400
- "We pumped into it."
- "We pumped into it."

1319
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,920
- "I went all-in. I bet everything."
- "I bet everything."

1320
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,710
- The things we say...
- In the end...

1321
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,850
In the end, being in halfway
doesn't mean anything.

1322
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,420
I don't think I can ever
invest in stocks.

1323
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,250
- You need to invest everything.
- It's making me dizzy.

1324
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,360
It's better to just
work hard instead.

1325
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,150
- I'm not making any money.
- It's here again!

1326
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,830
- Keep going!
- Let the price go up!

1327
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,730
Happy New Year!

1328
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:59,790
Let's be healthy!

1329
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:01,100
Merry Christmas!

1330
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,520
We're aging really fast.

1331
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:04,960
- Please...
- Ji Hyo.

1332
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,130
- Jae Suk.
- Let's go, let's go!

1333
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,670
J Shipbuilding!

1334
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,810
- Please...
- J Shipbuilding!

1335
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,900
(Ji Hyo and Jae Suk invested all
of their money in B Entertainment.)

1336
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,040
(Kwang Soo decided to stick
with I Chemical until the end.)

1337
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,110
J Shipbuilding!

1338
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:22,850
(And these four safely invested
their money in various stocks.)

1339
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,480
(How will the stock market
of 2019 turn out?)

1340
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:27,750
(This year, last year, fluctuation)

1341
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,080
- 500 dollars!
- Yes!

1342
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,250
(This year, last year, fluctuation)

1343
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,330
Jae Suk!

1344
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,520
I can't believe this.

1345
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,770
(The 2019 Stock Market)

1346
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,830
(B Entertainment increased
by 50 percent.)

1347
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,270
(I Chemical increased
by 7 percent.)

1348
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:38,270
(J Shipbuilding decreased
by 20 percent.)

1349
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,460
- 500 dollars!
- Yes!

1350
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,630
(B Entertainment increased
by 50 percent.)

1351
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:42,710
Jae Suk!

1352
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,670
(They gained a 50 percent profit.)

1353
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:45,810
- Ji Hyo!
- Jae Suk.

1354
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,650
- Ji Hyo!
- Yes!

1355
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,170
(They're about to
turn their lives around.)

1356
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,210
That was amazing, Jae Suk.

1357
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:51,710
Ji Hyo!

1358
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,940
(It increased!)

1359
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,980
Seven percent?

1360
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,460
(It increased by 7 percent?)

1361
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,560
(J Shipbuilding
dropped by 20 percent.)

1362
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:03,900
That's it, we've all gained
50 percent.

1363
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,190
- That's amazing. Jae Suk.
- We made it.

1364
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,560
Suk Jin, J Shipbuilding's
stock price dropped.

1365
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,960
- It's down again.
- I told you about IT, didn't I?

1366
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,040
- We...
- He invested in J Shipbuilding.

1367
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,290
Jae Suk.

1368
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,230
Your hunch is amazing.

1369
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,000
You can just leave
F Biotechnology as is.

1370
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:19,980
If you just leave it there,
it'll keep increasing its value.

1371
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,170
(Crooning)

1372
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,170
Won't a goose fly by
and pick this up?

1373
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,210
(He smells the money going loose.)

1374
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,920
(Kwang Soo the goose appears again.)

1375
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,690
(The penniless birds have gathered.)

1376
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,790
(Crooning)

1377
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,130
(A collision occurs.)

1378
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,310
(Give it to me!)

1379
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,360
(They were meant to be rich
stock investors in the beginning.)

1380
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,170
Hold on, your lips cracked.

1381
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,380
Oh, no. I bumped my lips into his.

1382
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,540
It's so gross.

1383
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,670
- We don't even have pride.
- It's about time it increases.

1384
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,310
At 100 dollars...

1385
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,520
It's the last round, right?

1386
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,250
- It's the last one, right?
- It is the last one.

1387
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,380
But I know how this round
will turn out.

1388
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,880
I don't think I'll get 2nd place.
I was in 2nd place before.

1389
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,150
Now I have 16,000 dollars.

1390
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,900
Oh, no.

1391
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,600
How come J Shipbuilding
is not increasing at all?

1392
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,500
(Kwang Soo's account balance
increased by little.)

1393
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,830
The price increased,
and this is all I have?

1394
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:24,210
Why did I think of
the word "holding out"?

1395
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,980
How much did you make, Jae Suk?

1396
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,750
I have around 60,000 dollars.

1397
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,750
- What? Really?
- You earned that much?

1398
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:33,080
- Yes.
- But this can't be.

1399
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,080
(He can almost afford
to buy an E-Class.)

1400
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,420
You earned that much?

1401
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,310
(Jae Suk is behind Se Chan
by 16,000 dollars.)

1402
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:39,580
He earned a lot.

1403
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,150
I invested steadily.

1404
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,560
I have only 74,000 dollars?

1405
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,230
- What did you say?
- Why did you say it like that?

1406
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,060
- What?
- What did you say?

1407
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,600
- That's a funny way to put it.
- You pronounced it wrong.

1408
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,690
- Are you okay?
- I meant 74,000 dollars.

1409
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,440
In virtual games like this,

1410
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,860
it's okay
as long as I don't place last.

1411
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,610
1st and 2nd places,
and the last one.

1412
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,330
The rest means nothing
other than those three.

1413
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:01,540
The ones in the middle
mean nothing.

1414
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,000
I'm sorry,
but who are you talking to?

1415
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,750
(Embarrassed)

1416
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,940
Who are you talking to?
There's no one around.

1417
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,250
No one is listening.

1418
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,690
There was no one who nodded.

1419
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,080
- What's worse is that...
- He just said whatever he wanted.

1420
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,020
What's worse is that
the cameras weren't shooting him.

1421
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,650
- No one's listening to you.
- The thing is...

1422
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:16,080
Who are you talking to?

1423
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,650
I was talking to everyone.

1424
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,560
- Everyone?
- I was talking to everyone.

1425
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,790
- Oh, Dongducheon?
- Yes.

1426
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,330
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1427
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,060
You picked the right one.

1428
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,130
(Counting how much Ji Hyo has)

1429
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,060
- What's going on?
- She picked the right one.

1430
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,540
What happened, Ji Hyo?

1431
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,480
(She has 23,000 dollars already?)

1432
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,880
Look at this. Ji Hyo...

1433
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,210
(Gosh, you poor thing.)

1434
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,770
- Ji Hyo.
- She earned 15,000 dollars.

1435
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,020
- Ji Hyo, you did it.
- Jae Suk.

1436
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,380
- Thank you!
- Did you make a lot?

1437
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,520
- Jae Suk.
- Did you go all-in?

1438
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:42,920
It's all thanks to you!

1439
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,210
(Thanks to her mentor,
Ji Hyo was revived.)

1440
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:45,480
- IT stocks?
- Will I Chemical increase?

1441
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,560
(Kwang Soo realizes
he's in trouble.)

1442
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,230
It will increase, but I don't think
it will increase by a lot.

1443
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,630
It's good that you invested
in I Chemical.

1444
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,860
If I Chemical doesn't increase,
I have no hope.

1445
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,460
Should I switch to IT stocks?

1446
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,170
IT stocks aren't bad.

1447
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,170
- You think they'd work?
- I just...

1448
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:01,360
(Unlike I Chemical,
IT stocks got positive reviews.)

1449
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,730
(Ji Hyo rose to the top
by investing in B Entertainment.)

1450
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,610
(If he wants to beat Ji Hyo,
he needs to win big.)

1451
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,310
- Information on D IT, please.
- Okay.

1452
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,920
(With the points he saved,
he buys information on D IT.)

1453
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,420
Who doesn't know this?

1454
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,750
Everyone around the world
knows this.

1455
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,250
("COVID-19 breaks out.)

1456
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,830
(The high-level information
Kwang Soo got)

1457
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:28,790
(He earned information that
everyone around the world knows.)

1458
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,520
Does that mean the price dropped?

1459
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,310
(But this is his first time where
he got all the words from the info.)

1460
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,980
Jae Suk, it's D IT.

1461
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,480
(When he has no clue,
he asks Jae Suk for help.)

1462
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,880
If COVID-19 breaks out,
will the price increase?

1463
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,580
Game companies'
stock prices increase...

1464
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,210
because everyone stays inside.

1465
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,850
(Game companies' stock prices
increase due to COVID-19?)

1466
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,250
You mean IT stocks?
Because of games?

1467
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,250
Of course.

1468
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,650
(D IT already increased
by 43 percent.)

1469
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,500
(Will it increase again
due to COVID-19?)

1470
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,900
Invest it all in D IT.

1471
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,020
I'll go all-in on D IT.

1472
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,860
- You're going all-in on D IT?
- Yes, this is the last round.

1473
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,230
I can't remember it clearly.
Shipbuilding stocks did increase.

1474
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,040
- I think you're right.
- Right?

1475
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,040
- A major company takes it over.
- Does it?

1476
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,880
- I saw the hint.
- You did?

1477
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,480
I told you, a major company
takes it over.

1478
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,980
That's why 20 percent dropped.

1479
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,040
That's right. That's why the major
company is taking it over.

1480
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,520
- If it takes over...
- What will happen then?

1481
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,650
- It will increase instantly.
- I invested 100 dollars in it.

1482
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:24,860
If a major company takes over,
its price will increase instantly.

1483
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,380
Okay. I'll buy them all.

1484
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,650
- Didn't I do a good job?
- You did.

1485
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,150
If you make a lot,
share some with me.

1486
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,730
But I was going to buy
these stocks anyway.

1487
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,150
I'll buy 200 dollars more.

1488
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,500
(Suk Jin spends all his money
on J Shipbuilding.)

1489
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,170
I should bet to win.

1490
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:38,730
It will increase, right?

1491
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:41,440
I'll invest it all
in E Biotechnology.

1492
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,170
All of it.

1493
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,440
Please invest all of it in D IT.

1494
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,250
So that's all for
the 2019 stock market, right?

1495
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:50,310
I think IT stocks
will increase a lot too.

1496
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,670
(The nouveau riche is being chased
by Jae Suk.)

1497
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,650
I'm going to invest it all...

1498
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:56,750
- in C IT.
- What?

1499
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,060
(The two richest investors
invest in C IT and D IT.)

1500
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,330
Please gather around.

1501
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,860
It's okay as long as
I'm not in last place.

1502
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:05,790
I'm in last place right now.

1503
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,670
Who is in last place?

1504
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,000
Happy New Year!

1505
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:11,170
We're almost there! Please!

1506
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,130
It's Christmas!

1507
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,630
Merry Christmas!

1508
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:15,710
(They spend
the last Christmas together.)

1509
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,000
(All of their fates
can be changed.)

1510
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,810
- The bell is going to ring!
- Please, please.

1511
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,380
- It's the last round, right?
- Please, IT stocks!

1512
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,650
(The results
will determine the winners.)

1513
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,020
Please, please!

1514
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,040
(Currently,
Se Chan is in 1st place...)

1515
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,060
(with his investment in C IT.)

1516
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,360
(Jae Suk, who invested in D IT,)

1517
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,920
(is in 2nd place.)

1518
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,900
(Ji Hyo invested in D IT. Jong Kook
invested in E Biotechnology.)

1519
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,230
(J Shipbuilding,
C IT, D IT, D IT)

1520
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:42,290
Please!

1521
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:45,100
(What will be the results
of the last stock market?)

1522
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,170
(The 2020 Stock Market)

1523
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,670
- Yes!
- Jae Suk!

1524
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,110
IT!

1525
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,440
- IT!
- Jae Suk!

1526
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,980
(C IT increased by 67 percent,
D IT increased by 60 percent,)

1527
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,670
(J Shipbuilding decreased
by 50 percent.)

1528
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,980
(D IT made it!)

1529
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,020
Ji Hyo!

1530
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,060
(He's overwhelmed by the profit
he made after a long time.)

1531
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:08,690
C IT increased by 67 percent.

1532
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:12,000
(C IT increased more than others?)

1533
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,290
C IT increased by 67 percent.

1534
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,100
Wow, B Entertainment
increased by 100 percent.

1535
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,270
Look at J Shipbuilding.
It decreased by 100 percent.

1536
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,670
B Entertainment
increased by 100 percent.

1537
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,940
(J Shipbuilding decreased
by 50 percent.)

1538
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:26,730
(He looks like he just lost
half of all his fortune.)

1539
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,580
B Entertainment
increased by 100 percent.

1540
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,920
(J Shipbuilding's price plummeted.)

1541
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:34,850
Suk Jin.

1542
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,350
Are you okay?

1543
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,980
Suk Jin.

1544
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,710
He lost all his money
on J Shipbuilding.

1545
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,380
Suk Jin!

1546
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,830
I'm Suk Jin who invested
in J Shipbuilding!

1547
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:49,690
(J Shipbuilding's stock
didn't increase in the end.)

1548
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:51,860
- What happened, Suk Jin?
- I told him several times.

1549
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,770
- What happened, Suk Jin?
- He was so stubborn.

1550
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:54,810
(He needs to be alone for a while.)

1551
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:56,540
It decreased by 100 percent.

1552
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,810
(He ended up losing
50 percent of his money.)

1553
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,310
- Gosh.
- Thank you, Jae Suk.

1554
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,040
- I told you to buy B Entertainment.
- Thank goodness I sold it.

1555
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,650
I Chemical dropped again.

1556
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,040
Thank goodness you sold it.

1557
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:09,190
- The rankings must've changed.
- We don't know how they changed.

1558
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,440
Suk Jin...

1559
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,810
- Suk Jin.
- I'm Suk Jin...

1560
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,190
who invested in J Shipbuilding!

1561
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,650
Well done, Suk Jin.

1562
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,420
I'm Suk Jin who invested
in J Shipbuilding!

1563
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,060
- His face turned red for real.
- I'm so dizzy.

1564
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,630
Seeing Suk Jin react that way
makes it feel so real.

1565
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:21,770
I know. What is this?

1566
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,520
- But...
- He's horrible with stocks.

1567
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,860
it's because Suk Jin only
trusted his guts.

1568
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,540
- He never listened to the others.
- I know.

1569
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,110
It's the same in reality.

1570
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,500
How could a stock worth 250 dollars
drop to 10 dollars?

1571
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,210
- How could he...
- I know.

1572
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:35,350
Won't that put me in last place?

1573
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,920
Let's check out the rankings.

1574
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,670
I put everything in biotechnology
stocks because everyone told me so.

1575
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:41,710
Me too.

1576
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,210
I was in second place.

1577
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,480
Please, please!

1578
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,190
The ones in 1st and 2nd place
get prizes,

1579
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:47,610
and the one in last place
gets the punishment.

1580
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,920
3rd place is Ji Hyo
who made 37,000 dollars.

1581
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,020
(3rd place, Song Ji Hyo,
37,182 dollars)

1582
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,130
- Thank you, Jae Suk.
- She went up to third place!

1583
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,600
- Ji Hyo quietly...
- She was in last place.

1584
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,130
- She even went below zero!
- I really did.

1585
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:00,600
Many people make money by sticking
to the ones who are good at stocks.

1586
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,230
When I followed Jae Suk,
the stock price dropped.

1587
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,400
4th place is Jong Kook
who made 19,960 dollars.

1588
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,810
(4th place, Kim Jong Kook,
19,960 dollars)

1589
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:08,880
I made that much.

1590
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,080
Fifth place is So Min.

1591
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,610
- That's not bad.
- Not bad.

1592
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:13,670
- In the last round...
- At least I'm not in last place.

1593
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:16,540
6th place is Haha
who made 16,350 dollars.

1594
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,290
- I'm safe, right?
- Yes.

1595
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,420
The difference between
1st and 2nd place is around 10,000.

1596
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,920
First place...

1597
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:28,630
(Jae Suk invested quietly
and steadily in substantial stocks.)

1598
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,100
(Se Chan led the stock market
from the beginning.)

1599
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,540
is Se Chan who made
110,000 dollars.

1600
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,440
- That's amazing.
- He made 100,000 dollars?

1601
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,860
- 110,000 dollars!
- I should've invested it all.

1602
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,500
I made 110,000 dollars
after spending 30,000 dollars?

1603
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,080
Jae Suk made 93,000 dollars.

1604
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,000
- He did well.
- 93,000 dollars.

1605
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,580
- Wow, you're the master.
- My goodness.

1606
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,250
- He did well.
- Now,

1607
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,650
it's a battle among
the ones who made the least.

1608
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,610
But my stock
increased by 60 percent.

1609
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:52,360
- Among the two...
- Please.

1610
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,310
I'm Suk Jin who invested
in J Shipbuilding!

1611
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,360
In the previous round,

1612
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,730
- I was in 2nd place.
- You're apart by 500 dollars.

1613
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:59,100
My stock increased by 60 percent
in the last round.

1614
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,420
The seventh place
who barely avoided the penalty.

1615
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,170
(The difference between the two
is only 540 dollars.)

1616
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,330
(Who came in 7th place
between Suk Jin and Kwang Soo?)

1617
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,360
The seventh place...

1618
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,360
(Who came in 7th place
between Suk Jin and Kwang Soo?)

1619
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,550
Congratulations, Kwang Soo.

1620
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:23,670
(Congratulations, Kwang Soo!)

1621
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,420
(Lee Kwang Soo's account balance)

1622
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,570
(7th place, Lee Kwang Soo)

1623
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,130
Suk Jin made 8,260 dollars.

1624
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,940
I'm Suk Jin who invested
in J Shipbuilding!

1625
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,940
(His love for shipbuilding
cut his profit in half.)

1626
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:34,970
Shipbuilding...

1627
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,200
You went around and gave
lectures on stocks. Look at you now.

1628
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,150
- This is...
- How did you...

1629
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,920
How did it drop to that
from 20,000 dollars?

1630
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,990
You set a new record.

1631
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:46,860
He's getting the penalty
for six weeks in a row.

1632
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:49,590
Didn't you fly a kite last week?

1633
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,590
(He's getting the penalty
for 6 weeks in a row.)

1634
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,450
- That's amazing.
- The week before that,

1635
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:53,550
- he wrote a letter of apology.
- I did too!

1636
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,920
- I saw him on my way home.
- He also made dinner with me.

1637
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,970
That's amazing.

1638
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,860
- It's really six weeks in a row.
- You wrote a letter of apology too.

1639
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,800
But what did he do so wrong?

1640
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,800
What did I...

1641
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,300
I really thought I wouldn't
get the penalty.

1642
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:06,780
I really thought
I wouldn't be in last place.

1643
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,170
- I thought I'd never lose my money.
- You said that earlier too.

1644
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,300
He kept saying he wouldn't
end up in last place.

1645
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,050
- I thought I'd never lose my money.
- Seriously.

1646
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,840
He doesn't accept the fact
that he's bad at it.

1647
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,380
I was going after
the 1st or 2nd place.

1648
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,420
- That's why I went all-in.
- His eyes are shining brightly.

1649
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,740
Suk Jin, I think you're bad at it,
so stop investing in stocks.

1650
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,780
That's not it. I never thought
I'd end up in last place.

1651
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,280
- He thought he'd win.
- Thank you, Jae Suk.

1652
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,880
Today's prize...

1653
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:27,200
Today's race
was Genius Investors Race.

1654
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:28,760
This is the staple food of Koreans.

1655
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,590
1st place wins 40kg of rice,
and 2nd place wins 20kg of rice.

1656
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:33,030
It must be heavy.

1657
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,530
You're giving us rice because
it's stock investment special.

1658
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,360
But Suk Jin has to carry the rice
to their cars.

1659
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,440
- That's the penalty.
- Gosh, that hurts my pride.

1660
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,550
- But Suk Jin is way older than me.
- I know.

1661
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,110
Put it in my trunk, Suk Jin.

1662
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,780
- You're so cheeky.
- Please put it in my trunk.

1663
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:50,450
- It's not easy to carry rice.
- It must be troublesome.

1664
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:52,780
- They even brought a carrier.
- It must be heavy.

1665
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,650
Oh, no. This is kind of sad.
What is this?

1666
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:57,950
- It suits him though.
- It really suits him.

1667
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,360
- A carrier suits me?
- There's a cane too.

1668
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,720
It's an excellent
squatting exercise.

1669
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:06,530
(He starts delivering the rice to
the houses of 1st and 2nd places.)

1670
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,970
He made some money
in the beginning, and that was it.

1671
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:13,070
(He had no idea it'll turn out
this way.)

1672
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:18,470
(A shameful past
where he acted up and bluffed)

1673
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,920
(Everyone, if you invest like I did,
you'll go under.)

1674
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,590
My gosh. This is so annoying!

1675
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:29,630
(A man's wailing ASMR)

1676
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,320
Where is it? Where's your car?

1677
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:34,820
Can you put this down for me?

1678
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,130
(It's not that big of a penalty,
but he's a lot of work.)

1679
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:38,170
Hold on.

1680
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:40,970
Hold on.

1681
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:42,490
(All the female staff
members ended up helping him.)

1682
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,530
(He takes a short break thanks to
the help of the younger people.)

1683
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,030
We need a rod to make it stand.

1684
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,030
A rod?

1685
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,650
Gosh, I shouldn't have
bet all my money on it.

1686
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,010
Is this Jae Suk's car?

1687
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,470
Did you put mine in my trunk?

1688
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,550
I did.

1689
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,950
You should've put it
in the passenger's seat.

1690
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,150
Come on.

1691
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,860
Don't invest too much
in one company.

1692
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,150
Suk Jin, if you have any questions
about stocks, ring me up.

1693
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,420
- Ring me up, okay?
- Gosh, this hurts my pride.

1694
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,860
- You have to listen to me.
- He's a total rookie though.

1695
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,940
That way, you'll succeed.
Bring the carrier back inside.

1696
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,800
Gosh. Don't invest too much
in one company.

1697
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,970
- Suk Jin, bring that rice.
- I'm on my way.

1698
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:20,280
(Suk Jin bitterly went home
after delivering the rice.)

1699
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,030
(A week later)

1700
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,470
(Smiling broadly)

1701
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:24,570
(Long life, healthy, blessing)

1702
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,650
(A birthday table...)

1703
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:29,840
(filled with words of blessings)

1704
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,450
What's this? My goodness.

1705
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,360
- Look at this.
- It's quite cold.

1706
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,590
- Hello.
- This is...

1707
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

1708
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,420
Are you serious? "Age doesn't
matter, your heart is what matters"?

1709
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:40,860
- What's this?
- You're telling us to tell our age?

1710
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,760
- Gosh, that startled me.
- My goodness.

1711
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,670
- I thought something bad happened!
- Hey.

1712
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,130
- Here we go.
- Hey, hey!

1713
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,800
It totally startled me.

1714
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,240
- Don't we have to bow?
- By the way,

1715
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,400
people don't really
have this kind of party.

1716
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:53,700
Isn't this what you see at your
60th birthday party?

1717
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,030
- Why would you put pears here?
- He's already 60?

1718
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,650
Hold on.
Are we having the party early?

1719
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,380
- Do we also light candles?
- Why did you put the candles?

1720
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,740
Hello!

1721
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:01,840
- Hello.
- Wow.

1722
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,450
- What are you doing?
- What's all this?

1723
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,220
- I haven't seen this for a while.
- What's this?

1724
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,780
- Isn't this fake?
- What's this?

1725
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,510
- It is fake.
- Right?

1726
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,650
- Did he die? No, right?
- Come on, Haha.

1727
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,920
- That's why I bowed only once.
- We all did.

1728
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,950
Why did they have to use
that photo?

1729
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:16,590
- I know, he looks like Im Ha Ryong.
- Out of all photos...

1730
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,320
"Age doesn't matter,
your heart is what matters"?

1731
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,860
I think it should be the other way
around for Suk Jin.

1732
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,070
"Your heart doesn't matter,
your age is what matters."

1733
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:23,110
That's right.

1734
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,470
(Suk Jin's true heart only exists
in the stock charts.)

1735
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:25,700
- Your heart doesn't matter.
- Your heart doesn't matter.

1736
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,070
- Your age is what matters.
- Look at the cake.

1737
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,440
Even the font is so old-fashioned.

1738
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:31,470
You didn't pay much attention
to Suk Jin,

1739
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,110
and you just wanted
to make it funny.

1740
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,740
- You're going to make him cry.
- Isn't this too mean?

1741
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,320
It really looks like
an ancestral rite table though.

1742
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,380
But he had a good life.

1743
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:42,860
This is why everyone brought
their gifts for him.

1744
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,220
I really got a good one.

1745
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,260
- I...
- Actually, Suk Jin...

1746
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,360
doesn't really like gifts.

1747
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,070
- He likes things that are hopeful.
- That's right.

1748
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,990
Something like information
on stocks.

1749
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,670
Something like that.

1750
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:57,260
Or introducing a rich man to him.

1751
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,700
- Something hopeful like that.
- He likes that kind.

1752
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,970
- Introducing a rich man.
- That's right.

1753
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:02,280
- He likes new connections.
- He loves that.

1754
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,900
Suk Jin doesn't care for gifts.

1755
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,010
For a man of Suk Jin's age,
it's best to eat good foods...

1756
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,380
and go to a good place.

1757
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,650
- That's right.
- Right?

1758
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:10,450
- Watching something fun...
- Us spending time with him...

1759
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:11,740
is the greatest gift.

1760
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,260
The best gift for him
is us calling him often.

1761
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,320
- That's right.
- Exactly.

1762
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,220
Talking to him on the phone
for more than a minute.

1763
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,130
- Or sending a long text.
- Gosh, you brats.

1764
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,530
Today,

1765
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,860
you're the residents of
Running Village.

1766
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,970
Is that so?

1767
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,070
There's a joyous occasion
in Running Village.

1768
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,130
That's right, it's a party.

1769
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:30,570
It's the birthday party of the elder
of the village, Ji Suk Jin.

1770
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,380
Based on
the date of our shoot, tomorrow,

1771
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:34,530
- February 10...
- It's tomorrow.

1772
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:36,800
- is Suk Jin's birthday.
- He's here.

1773
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,150
Let's welcome the star of today,
Ji Suk Jin!

1774
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,380
(Everyone warmly welcomes him.)

1775
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,550
Suk Jin!

1776
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:46,590
What's that? Why did they
make him wear those?

1777
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,920
- I know.
- Don't make fun of him!

1778
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,360
(Looking old)

1779
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,550
(Why did they make him wear those?)

1780
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:54,920
Don't make fun of him!

1781
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,420
My gosh, we wish you good health!

1782
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:01,700
Stop it!

1783
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,970
Why am I the only one
wearing this?

1784
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,760
I thought everyone else
was wearing this.

1785
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,880
Let's put him up in the air.

1786
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,130
Stop it! Don't!

1787
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:10,200
(Dancing joyfully)

1788
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,450
- Yes!
- Thank you!

1789
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,740
- Suk Jin.
- Be healthy!

1790
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,240
- Grandpa.
- We wish you good health.

1791
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,510
- Stay healthy.
- So Min learned that dance.

1792
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:19,650
- So Min is good at that.
- Hey, you.

1793
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:20,690
(So Min's been showing the dance she
learned from the community center.)

1794
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:21,880
You're good.

1795
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:24,090
You're good!

1796
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,280
So Min is good.

1797
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,030
She learned it
from the community center.

1798
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,760
- You're good.
- Hey.

1799
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,670
- We should host him another one.
- I'm the only one wearing this?

1800
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,400
- Suk Jin.
- Everyone else is...

1801
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,860
- Congratulations.
- Wait.

1802
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:35,970
- It looks warm.
- Congratulations.

1803
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:37,670
Am I a man of nature or what?

1804
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,470
- I'm not a man of nature.
- Only think of your health.

1805
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:41,300
- This is driving me crazy.
- Let's see.

1806
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,900
- Gosh.
- It's pretty.

1807
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,150
What's so pretty?

1808
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:45,550
- You're wearing rubber shoes too.
- Hey.

1809
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,780
Don't give me that delighted look.
I hate it.

1810
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,950
- Hey, I hate that face.
- You're his role model.

1811
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:51,990
A role model.

1812
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,780
- My gosh.
- It suits him.

1813
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:55,760
- He looks especially delighted.
- He's 60.

1814
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,760
He looks really delighted,

1815
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,950
- so I hate it.
- I feel so happy today.

1816
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,400
Hey! What's this?

1817
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,030
What is this?
What am I, a grandpa?

1818
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,130
Where did they find
those artificial flowers?

1819
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:07,340
Long life and health?
This is insane.

1820
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,340
There are many nice photos,
and you used this?

1821
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,760
I had a photoshoot recently.

1822
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,570
- But that makes him look like...
- What is that?

1823
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,700
- Your photoshoot?
- He really looks like...

1824
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,340
a grandpa.

1825
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,340
(He finds it hilarious too.)

1826
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,380
- What is this?
- Suk Jin.

1827
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:23,150
That's what I wore
during a comedy skit!

1828
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,510
It suits you so well
that I can't act up.

1829
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:27,550
- I can't say much.
- I can't be flippant.

1830
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:30,280
- Seriously.
- I had a photoshoot.

1831
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,720
You know, I find that hilarious.

1832
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,150
"Bravo your life!"

1833
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,030
It's so funny.

1834
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:37,720
<i>Bravo, bravo</i>

1835
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:42,170
- Bravo your life!
- Life!

1836
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,400
<i>Bravo, bravo</i>

1837
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,900
Long life, health, and blessing!

1838
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:48,670
Let's shout this together.
Ji-ravo, Ji-ravo!

1839
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,340
Ji-ravo!

1840
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:52,240
It sounds weird.

1841
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,450
(Good words pour in
for the good day.)

1842
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:55,610
Ji-ravo! Ji-ravo!

1843
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,950
Ji-ravo your life!

1844
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,650
<i>- Ji-ravo, jee-ravo
- Ji-ravo, jee-ravo</i>

1845
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:03,320
<i>- My life, my days
- My life, my days</i>

1846
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,150
- Ji-ravo! Ji-ravo! Let's go!
- Ji-ravo!

1847
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:06,320
It's like Haribo.

1848
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,550
- The staff members are happy too.
- It's nice.

1849
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:11,260
Everyone is genuinely happy.

1850
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:13,900
It's a happy occasion.

1851
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,740
You are the oldest member
on variety shows.

1852
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,340
- Seriously.
- You have worked for many years.

1853
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,170
- Call the Guinness World Records.
- He is living history.

1854
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:20,510
Please live a long life.

1855
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:21,800
- You are making history.
- Guinness World Records...

1856
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,130
- would be a stretch.
- Seriously,

1857
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,050
this is an incredible feat.

1858
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:27,950
Only a few people born in
the 1960s are on variety shows.

1859
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:29,920
- I know.
- Why are you being so serious?

1860
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,490
- It's true.
- That's right.

1861
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:32,920
We should be serious
when it's necessary.

1862
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,110
What are you doing?
Show me your dance instead.

1863
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,590
Show me your dance instead.

1864
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:38,190
(She dances right away
upon Suk Jin's request.)

1865
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,590
- He likes it.
- Suk Jin likes it.

1866
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,300
- He likes it.
- She is good.

1867
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:43,590
- She is good.
- She is good.

1868
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,570
- So Min.
- You know,

1869
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,170
- your daughter-in-law...
- Her moves are beautiful.

1870
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,700
- has beautiful dance moves.
- Seriously.

1871
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,440
(The vending machine of dance
has beautiful moves.)

1872
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,340
(He loves it.)

1873
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:57,670
Seriously.

1874
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:58,880
Her moves are beautiful.

1875
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,920
Suk Jin is happy.

1876
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,550
- You are happy, right?
- He is very happy.

1877
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:02,780
- You know,
- She is good.

1878
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,740
I didn't get...

1879
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,650
why old people liked
traditional music so much...

1880
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:07,990
- back in the days.
- Do you get it now?

1881
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:09,610
I am starting to like it.

1882
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,450
- Suk Jin is going along with it.
- Dance.

1883
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:12,780
- I am starting to like it.
- He is asking her to dance.

1884
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,860
I like these dance moves now.

1885
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:16,420
So Min is good.

1886
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:17,590
She is very good.

1887
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:19,070
She is quite good for someone who
learned from the community center.

1888
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:21,300
She is especially good at this.

1889
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:22,630
Look at that.

1890
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:23,760
(She twists her shoulders
and wrists excessively.)

1891
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,900
- Look at that.
- She is good at this.

1892
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,700
She likes that dance move so much.

1893
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,170
She is good at this.

1894
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,950
Presents are a must
at a birthday party.

1895
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,450
The residents of Running Village...

1896
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,450
prepared presents for Suk Jin.

1897
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,110
They are for you.

1898
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,920
My birthday is tomorrow, not today.

1899
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,880
- It's fine either way.
- We prepared them with seriousness.

1900
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,490
Maybe the daughter-in-law wants
to go first.

1901
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:46,380
- These days,
- It must be a bamboo wife.

1902
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:47,720
- Suk Jin...
- A bamboo wife.

1903
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,090
- The thing is...
- Hey.

1904
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:51,070
I have an actual wife.

1905
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:52,900
- This is a new wife.
- Really?

1906
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,240
A new wife.

1907
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,900
- A new face?
- Yes. A new face.

1908
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,470
Summer is coming up.

1909
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:58,760
You should hug it
when you go to bed.

1910
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,740
He always dreams of deviating
from his daily life.

1911
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,800
No, I don't.

1912
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:04,510
- I ordered it.
- It goes well with your outfit.

1913
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:06,200
(It goes well
with the color of his outfit!)

1914
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,550
But...

1915
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,820
my wife might be displeased.

1916
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,010
A new face.

1917
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:11,720
It will cool you down in summer.

1918
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,010
- It's cool indeed.
- Yes.

1919
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:15,420
- There were different sizes.
- Suk Jin,

1920
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,320
- it's covered. It isn't cool.
- You must remove the plastic bag...

1921
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,880
to have the air go through.

1922
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,450
Why would it be cool
when it's covered?

1923
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:22,550
- He is ridiculous.
- It's nice.

1924
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:25,590
He doesn't skip a beat
when it comes to telling a lie.

1925
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,170
It's cool. It's nice.

1926
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,360
- I prepared something...
- Will you go next?

1927
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,630
- so that you can work out.
- What?

1928
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:33,130
- What is it?
- Jae Suk prepared a nice present.

1929
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:35,670
I don't joke around.

1930
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:36,840
Is it a mat?

1931
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,740
I prepared it
so that you can work out.

1932
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:41,380
- At-home workout is all the rage.
- That's right.

1933
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:43,740
I prepared it
so that you can work out.

1934
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:44,840
What is it?

1935
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:46,010
- Gateball.
- Gateball.

1936
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,610
(Gateball!)

1937
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:50,380
- Gateball.
- He prepared it with seriousness.

1938
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,550
- This is driving me crazy.
- Gateball.

1939
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:54,030
- This is driving me crazy.
- It's nice.

1940
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:55,420
You should try it.

1941
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,860
- I am not old enough to play this.
- You can play it at home.

1942
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,990
- It will be a nice exercise.
- All right.

1943
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,900
It will be a nice exercise.
Jae Suk is right.

1944
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,130
I should have thought
of that present.

1945
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:04,760
I play powerful sports.

1946
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:06,740
I move around a lot.

1947
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,840
- A sport like this.
- It's for an at-home workout.

1948
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,200
It's for an at-home workout.

1949
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,510
That's right.

1950
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,470
- You should play it.
- That's right.

1951
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,840
- Use it.
- Play gateball.

1952
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,990
- Work out.
- Gateball.

1953
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:19,320
Speaking of working out,

1954
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,760
you should take this
after a workout.

1955
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,360
- It's a supplement for seniors.
- Hey!

1956
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,880
- It's protein for seniors.
- It's nice.

1957
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:26,760
- Is this product placement?
- It's protein.

1958
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,400
No, this isn't product placement.

1959
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,990
- It's protein for seniors.
- Hey.

1960
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:32,760
It's for people who are
as old as your mother.

1961
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,670
I swear I saw what took place
at Jong Kook's van this morning.

1962
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,260
Gap Jin was putting
this supplement in a box...

1963
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:39,340
when he said, "That's too much.
Take out a few."

1964
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:40,840
He took out a few of them.

1965
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,940
(My protein is precious.)

1966
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,670
Let's see what Ji Hyo brought.

1967
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:47,170
After you work out and take protein,

1968
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:48,470
you can use this
when you take a shower.

1969
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,650
- A shower.
- For you,

1970
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,490
I prepared hair growth shampoo.

1971
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:52,650
(Scalp treatment shampoo)

1972
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:54,320
- Scalp treatment shampoo.
- Scalp treatment shampoo.

1973
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,360
- Is this product placement?
- No.

1974
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,860
Ji Hyo is really thoughtful.

1975
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,320
She said no.

1976
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:01,030
Shampoo and conditioner.
I prepared them...

1977
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,860
- for your hair.
- She is thoughtful.

1978
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,420
You should take care of your hair.

1979
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,760
These are shampoo and conditioner.

1980
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:08,260
- They are nice.
- Right.

1981
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,490
Suk Jin doesn't like them.

1982
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,240
- You should have bought a big one.
- You are going...

1983
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,740
to use them.

1984
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:14,740
Suddenly...

1985
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:16,780
It's Kwang Soo's turn.

1986
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,740
I thought of Suk Jin's health.

1987
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,340
- To buy this,
- You know...

1988
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,570
I went to many places.

1989
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,110
- Health is the best.
- Seriously.

1990
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:24,690
I am a healthy man.

1991
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:26,590
In the new year...

1992
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,190
We want you to be healthier.

1993
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,190
Quit smoking e-cigarette.

1994
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,780
- Blow bubbles instead.
- What is that?

1995
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:32,920
Bubbles.

1996
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,220
It's for your lung capacity.

1997
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,420
- Lung capacity.
- It's for your lung capacity.

1998
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,300
Lung capacity? Hey.

1999
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,030
Are you that worried about
my lung capacity?

2000
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,590
Are you that worried?

2001
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,470
I use this a lot in the restroom
at home.

2002
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,570
Why?

2003
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:45,610
- I have kids.
- Kids.

2004
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:46,940
- Don't use it in the restroom.
- Why not?

2005
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,200
If you slip, you will die.

2006
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,840
- Don't use it in the restroom.
- You will die.

2007
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,380
You will die.

2008
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:54,280
- If you are bored...
- How heartwarming!

2009
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,840
After you shampoo your hair,

2010
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,690
- you should blow bubbles.
- If you are lonely...

2011
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,450
It will be fun if you use it
during a bath.

2012
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,720
If I shampoo my hair...

2013
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,280
and blow bubbles in the restroom,

2014
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,650
- I will look like a madman.
- No!

2015
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:07,050
You should try it.

2016
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,800
- Seriously.
- You might find it fun.

2017
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,490
I think you will like it.

2018
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,420
I went to many stores to find it.

2019
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:13,670
It's like a festival.

2020
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,030
Suk Jin, congratulations.

2021
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,130
Health!

2022
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,260
- Use it with caution.
- This is driving me crazy.

2023
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,240
- Health is the most important.
- All right.

2024
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,280
(He continues to blow it.)

2025
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,110
- You are doing well.
- You are doing well.

2026
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:27,470
- "You are doing well"?
- You are doing well.

2027
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:29,320
- Hey.
- It's so nice.

2028
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,780
You are doing well.

2029
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,880
That's a big bubble.

2030
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,380
You pop the bubbles like this.

2031
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,360
It's also a good eye exercise.

2032
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:38,650
A good eye exercise.

2033
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,400
I went to many stores to find it.

2034
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,150
- What's your present?
- I want Suk Jin to open it.

2035
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,530
- Really?
- Yes. It's an actual present.

2036
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,920
- Will something pop up?
- No, no.

2037
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,240
- Isn't it a bag?
- Yes, it is.

2038
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,670
- I prepared a crossbody bag.
- A bag?

2039
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:49,760
It's nice.

2040
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,840
(I see.)

2041
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:58,400
(A mission bag for the member
who loves Running Man)

2042
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,470
A crossbody bag.

2043
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,150
(People who give the presents
have way more fun than Suk Jin.)

2044
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:04,340
- Hey.
- A crossbody bag.

2045
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:05,950
You lose it often.

2046
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:07,990
- I use it at other places.
- It's an extra bag.

2047
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:09,280
I bet you got this...

2048
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,760
from the production crew
because you forgot to get a present.

2049
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:14,090
I prepared this as a joke.

2050
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,550
There is a real present.

2051
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:17,490
- He went to the department store.
- A real present.

2052
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:18,920
It's no joke.

2053
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,990
- Hey.
- A real present.

2054
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:21,260
He actually got a nice present.

2055
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:22,570
Why did you get a nice present?

2056
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:24,170
My goodness.

2057
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,030
Why did you get a nice present?

2058
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:27,630
I got it for real.

2059
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:29,530
To be honest, I don't really like
designer items.

2060
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,900
- You like them.
- Suk Jin.

2061
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:33,380
- He looks so happy.
- You can exchange it.

2062
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,070
Why can't I stop smiling?

2063
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,050
G Brand.

2064
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:39,150
- G Brand.
- Seriously.

2065
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:40,280
Open it.

2066
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:41,780
G Brand.

2067
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,450
I got it for real.

2068
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,190
There is a receipt too.

2069
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,820
- He checked Suk Jin's size.
- He asked the stylist.

2070
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,260
I need this to get a refund.

2071
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,530
- If I don't like it...
- A refund?

2072
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:52,970
- Are you going to get a refund?
- That came out wrong.

2073
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,990
An exchange.

2074
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:56,910
(Se Chan became generous
after making a lot of R money.)

2075
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:57,960
- This is incredible.
- Se Chan is amazing.

2076
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:00,040
- He got shoes.
- I flexed.

2077
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,080
(He flexed for the oldest member.)

2078
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,500
- He got shoes.
- I flexed.

2079
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,370
It's an actual present.

2080
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:05,650
Do you know my size?

2081
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,650
- I asked your stylist, Ha Na.
- Really?

2082
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:08,650
(Se Chan checked his size
for a surprise present.)

2083
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:09,870
- Ha Na.
- Yes.

2084
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,880
(Peek-a-boo)

2085
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,320
(Forget this.)

2086
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:18,330
(He wants a refund
for the cheap rubber shoes.)

2087
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,360
(Laughing)

2088
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,700
(He got fooled again.)

2089
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:27,070
(He wakes up from his dream
and kicks the air angrily.)

2090
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,290
They suit your outfit.

2091
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,610
I agree.

2092
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,210
- You should put them on.
- You should put them on.

2093
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:35,170
- Put them on.
- Put them on.

2094
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,500
- I am so angry.
- Hurry over here.

2095
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,210
- Put them on.
- Hurry over here.

2096
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,540
- They suit your outfit.
- No!

2097
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,080
I won't put them on.

2098
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:43,370
Hurry up.

2099
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:44,650
- I won't put them on.
- Why are you so slow?

2100
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:48,620
The brand is called Fool's Gucci.

2101
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:50,210
Fool's Gucci.

2102
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,990
The original shoes were a bit off.

2103
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,720
- Seriously.
- These shoes are perfect.

2104
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,830
- These shoes are perfect.
- He looks cool.

2105
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:57,660
My goodness.

2106
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,330
- All right.
- I won't wear them!

2107
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:00,460
- These are...
- Fool's Gucci.

2108
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,070
- These are K-UGGs.
- K-UGGs.

2109
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:03,240
- K-UGGs.
- You look cool.

2110
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,570
- You are set.
- Your outfit is finally complete.

2111
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,330
They are shiny too.

2112
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:10,170
Those are K-UGGs.

2113
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:11,950
This is driving me crazy.

2114
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,370
- This is driving me crazy.
- They are nice.

2115
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:14,670
- They are perfect.
- They are perfect.

2116
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:16,120
- All right.
- His previous shoes were a bit off.

2117
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,290
All right.

2118
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:19,210
If this makes you happy...

2119
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:20,490
Everybody is happy.

2120
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:22,080
This is nice.

2121
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,360
Give me the box.

2122
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,460
I need to use it again.

2123
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,090
- I need to use it again.
- That's good.

2124
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,960
Didn't you use it on
"My Little Old Boy"?

2125
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,500
That's right.
It comes in very handy.

2126
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,790
- It's nice.
- You used it.

2127
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:34,290
In any case...

2128
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:35,630
In any case, thank you.

2129
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:37,740
(Price is just a number.
It's the thought that counts.)

2130
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,240
- Now it's my present that's left.
- What is that?

2131
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,710
- It's really big.
- I put in a lot of effort.

2132
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:42,940
It's really big.

2133
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:44,910
You went through a lot.

2134
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,170
- Your career spans over 30 years.
- Yes.

2135
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,280
- It spans over 28 years.
- 28 years.

2136
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:50,710
I think...

2137
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:54,080
you lived diligently
without taking a proper break.

2138
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:58,050
I want you to sit down
and take a rest.

2139
01:15:58,050 --> 01:15:59,690
- Is it a massage chair?
- That way,

2140
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:02,500
you will be able to plan the future.

2141
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,200
So I prepared this present.

2142
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:06,620
Sit down, Suk Jin.

2143
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:07,870
It's a proper present.

2144
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,040
It's a proper present.

2145
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,330
- What is it?
- It's a drawing book.

2146
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,710
Sit down and plan your future.

2147
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:16,740
It's nice.

2148
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:18,210
My goodness.

2149
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,370
My goodness.

2150
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:22,820
Artist Ji.

2151
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,650
- It suits his outfit.
- It does.

2152
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:26,490
The hat, outfit, and shoes
are a complete set.

2153
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:29,210
Keep a picture diary
of what happens every day.

2154
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,530
- Keep a picture diary, Suk Jin.
- Here is the bamboo wife.

2155
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:34,030
This is... This is...

2156
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:36,220
(Keep a picture diary
of your remaining days.)

2157
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,200
(They are so considerate
of Suk Jin.)

2158
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,720
Give him the present.

2159
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,830
Make sure you keep a picture diary
every day.

2160
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:46,070
Seriously.

2161
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:47,110
Father.

2162
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:49,740
Make sure you keep a picture diary
every day.

2163
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:51,450
Okay?

2164
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,210
- What?
- Weather, clear.

2165
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:54,370
(Suk Jin's happy day)

2166
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:56,910
Suk Jin, you can color it too.

2167
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:59,950
- I see.
- Song Yi loves it.

2168
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:00,990
(All of them root
for his healthy and long life.)

2169
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,910
- It's so nice.
- Shall we take a photo?

2170
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,690
- Let's take a photo.
- Let's take a photo.

2171
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,250
A group photo.

2172
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,250
(A group photo is a must
at a birthday party.)

2173
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,420
Long life, health, and blessing.

2174
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:12,760
Thank you.

2175
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:15,090
It was nice.

2176
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,210
- It was nice.
- Did I hear wrong?

2177
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:20,470
- What?
- Cameramen talk to each other.

2178
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:22,130
Yun Sang just said,

2179
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:24,150
"Tight shot
on the ancestral rite table."

2180
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:25,840
"Tight shot
on the ancestral rite table."

2181
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,000
Hey, Yun Sang!

2182
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,450
"Tight shot
on the ancestral rite table."

2183
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:30,040
- I am serious.
- This isn't an ancestral rite!

2184
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,450
- The ancestral rite table?
- I heard it somewhere from here.

2185
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,010
What were you thinking?

2186
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:35,080
Who called it
the ancestral rite table?

2187
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,620
I heard someone say that.

2188
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:37,960
You don't know
who Yun Sang is, do you?

2189
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,120
Yun Sang?

2190
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,960
(Flustered)

2191
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,250
A special segment for Suk Jin.

2192
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,000
(Which one of them is Yun Sang?)

2193
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,620
Ji Suk Jin's Find Yun Sang!

2194
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,620
Yun Sang has been on the team
for 11 years.

2195
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,370
Yun Sang has been with us
from the early days of the show.

2196
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,240
Find Yun Sang!

2197
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,110
(For 11 years, Yun Sang has worked
as a cameraman for Kwang Soo.)

2198
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:55,040
(Suk Jin even rooted for Yun Sang.)

2199
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,970
(He was on TV many times
as Kwang Soo's cowardly partner.)

2200
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:01,870
(Kwang Soo even hosted his wedding.)

2201
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:04,790
(The living fossil of Running Man,
Choi Yun Sang)

2202
01:18:04,990 --> 01:18:06,950
(Where is Yun Sang?)

2203
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:10,080
It's the birthday event
for Mr. Ji-ravo.

2204
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,330
Find Yun Sang.

2205
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:13,160
- Find Yun Sang.
- Will he succeed?

2206
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,220
Yun Sang has been with us
from the early days of the show.

2207
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,420
It's either one of them.

2208
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,700
Ji-ravo.

2209
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,130
- It's either one of them.
- He narrowed it down a lot.

2210
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,040
I saw them
from the early days of the show.

2211
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,110
He narrowed it down a lot.

2212
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:26,260
- It's either one of them.
- Ji-ravo.

2213
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,710
Suk Jin still has it.

2214
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:29,000
"Suk Jin still has it."

2215
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,040
This is fun.

2216
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,150
This is...

2217
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,500
Yun Sang?

2218
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,670
(What?)

2219
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:35,410
Yun Sang.

2220
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,820
You didn't answer,
so it must be you.

2221
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:39,250
Yun Sang.

2222
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,290
(It's nice to meet you, Yun Sang!)

2223
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,820
- Yun Sang.
- Happy birthday.

2224
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:44,790
(He found Yun Sang!)

2225
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:48,830
- Ji Suk Jin!
- Ji Suk Jin!

2226
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:51,620
- Ji-ravo.
- This skill comes from experience.

2227
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:54,090
Ji-ravo Show!

2228
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:55,090
It was so obvious.

2229
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:57,260
- Try putting the ball through it.
- He didn't answer.

2230
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,260
- Long life, health, and blessing!
- Stand over there and do it.

2231
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,040
Please give him a round of applause.

2232
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,950
<i>- Ji-ravo, jee-ravo
- Ji-ravo, jee-ravo</i>

2233
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:07,670
(He dreams of a hole-in-one moment
in his life.)

2234
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:10,470
I can't help
but try hard to succeed.

2235
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:12,750
(He plays the background music.)

2236
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:16,360
(Dancing)

2237
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:20,830
(A path to the bravo-worthy life)

2238
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:22,250
Suk Jin, you can do it!

2239
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,400
- You can do it!
- Okay!

2240
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,790
It's a piece of cake.

2241
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:26,570
(He swings hard
with the members' support.)

2242
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,370
(He was always the 1st victim
of Name Tag Elimination.)

2243
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:34,580
(The members' tough affection
that continued on for 11 years...)

2244
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:37,250
(gave him a hard time at times.)

2245
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,910
(But he made people laugh
with his weakness.)

2246
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,250
- Suk Jin, you can do it.
- You can do it.

2247
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,250
(He puts 11 years of sadness
into the ball.)

2248
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,120
(Goodbye.)

2249
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:53,530
Ji Suk Jin!

2250
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,220
This is driving me crazy.

2251
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,620
He still has it.

2252
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:58,400
- He did a good job.
- This is nice.

2253
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,870
He is still energetic.

2254
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,160
Suk Jin still has it!

2255
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,260
Of course I succeeded.

2256
01:20:03,570 --> 01:20:04,830
(Take this.)

2257
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,130
(Ji-ravo's time flows backwards.)

2258
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:07,160
This is nice.

2259
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,940
Suk Jin has strong arms.

2260
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,650
- He still has it.
- This is nice.

2261
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:12,080
Suk Jin looks happy.

2262
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,280
(Thanks to Ji-ravo,
everyone has a happy time.)

2263
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,650
It's so nice.

2264
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:15,780
This is fun.

2265
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,990
We will see you next week.

2266
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:19,210
Bye.

2267
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,410
That's it for today's Ji-ravo Show.

2268
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:22,410
That was funny.

2269
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:25,190
The residents of Running Village
congratulated Suk Jin today.

2270
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:27,080
The village head...

2271
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,530
sent a present to Suk Jin,
the oldest resident,

2272
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:31,920
to wish him a long and healthy life.

2273
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,530
This is the real present.

2274
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:34,570
Seriously.

2275
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:36,500
Why wish for a long and healthy life
when I am in my 50s?

2276
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,110
- Is it a letter?
- It's a letter.

2277
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:39,500
(What is this letter?)

2278
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,110
"Dear Mr. Ji Suk Jin."

2279
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:45,080
"Happy birthday to Mr. Ji Suk Jin,
the oldest resident of the village."

2280
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,610
"Were you surprised
by the empty box?"

2281
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:47,840
I haven't checked the box yet.

2282
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:51,540
"For your birthday,
I prepared a surprise event."

2283
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:54,580
"At a place in the village
that is related to 'House',"

2284
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:57,690
"I hid the gold I prepared."

2285
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,750
Gold?

2286
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,900
"I hope you will find it well."

2287
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,550
(Is gold hidden in the village?)

2288
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,200
(The village head's
special present,)

2289
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,830
(gold is somewhere in the village.)

2290
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,960
(The birthday party for Suk Jin
takes a back seat.)

2291
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,500
(Even the birthday man
becomes obsessed with the gold.)

2292
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,660
(Jae Suk's Home, Kwang Soo's Home,
Jong Kook's Home, Suk Jin's Home)

2293
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:12,960
(A secret is hidden
inside the village.)

2294
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,670
(Not all houses are the same.)

2295
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:17,300
(In the mysterious houses,)

2296
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,710
(find the hidden gold!)

2297
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:21,540
(The prize of gold...)

2298
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:22,870
(makes everyone greedy.)

2299
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,580
(But the box is empty.)

2300
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,860
(The village head's present,
gold is missing.)

2301
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:31,220
(It's a scary birthday party.
Where is the gold?)

2302
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:33,160
Who took it?

2303
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,620
(Into the House,
It's Time to Find the Gold)
