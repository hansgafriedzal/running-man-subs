1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,930
- Hello.
- Hi.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,640
- Hi.
- My goodness.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,470
- Hi.
- Hello.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,370
- We're filming at a fancy building.
- Hello.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,770
- This is a cute building.
- Gosh.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,980
- Seriously.
- I'd love to come with my family.

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,370
Right. The bread smells
really good downstairs.

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,540
- It's not product placement.
- This isn't product placement.

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,750
- It's not?
- No.

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,390
- You should have told us.
- It's still pretty.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,460
We came up with the lines ourselves.

13
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,820
- You should've told us in advance.
- Hello.

14
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,190
- Suk Jin.
- My gosh.

15
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,780
Suk Jin, is this
one of your buildings?

16
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,850
(Suk Jin enters as
if he owns the place.)

17
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,690
Suk Jin, is this
one of your buildings?

18
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,890
Are you the CEO?

19
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,460
- I didn't know it was all set up.
- Yes.

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,030
- I thought you were the CEO.
- I had no idea.

21
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,640
Here comes
the recipient of the award.

22
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,810
- Yu San Seul!
- Yu San Seul!

23
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,280
- The Rookie Award.
- Yu San Seul!

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,600
- The Grand Award from SBS.
- Thank you.

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,450
- The Rookie Award from MBC.
- Thank you.

26
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,380
He won both the Grand Award
and the Rookie Award.

27
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,490
I didn't expect it at all, but I won
the Rookie Award yesterday.

28
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,990
With that, I managed to win
awards from every category.

29
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,490
- No, you need one more award.
- Good for you.

30
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,680
(Is there an award
Jae Suk still needs to win?)

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,650
- Which award is that?
- The SNS Star Award.

32
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,820
(It's the award Kwang Soo won.)

33
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,220
- There's an award I really want.
- That's not from SBS.

34
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,770
- What is it?
- The Chungjungone Award.

35
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,490
(Jae Suk wants
the Chungjungone Award.)

36
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,570
Why?

37
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,740
- That award?
- No one ever heard of my awards.

38
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,050
Thank you.

39
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,140
The Chungjungone Award.

40
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,000
Jong Kook won
the Top Excellence Award.

41
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,020
(Jong Kook won
the Top Excellence Award.)

42
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,020
- That was his first.
- Congratulations.

43
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,240
Se Chan won
the Excellence Award too.

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,280
- Right.
- Gosh.

45
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,380
- But I...
- Yes.

46
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,960
- You didn't cry.
- Right.

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
Your girlfriend cried,
but you didn't.

48
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,830
- But...
- My girlfriend?

49
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,390
(It looked like
So Min was wiping her tears.)

50
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,490
- Did you cry?
- But Jae Suk,

51
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,860
I'll tell you what Se Chan told me
after he got drunk at the party.

52
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,190
- What did he say?
- He got drunk and told me this.

53
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,610
He told me that
he would follow his heart...

54
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,410
and do whatever he wants to So Min.

55
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,440
(He would follow his heart
and do whatever he wants to So Min.)

56
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,680
(He'll follow his heart?)

57
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,550
I'm serious. I swear.

58
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,180
- Don't lie.
- I'm serious.

59
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,720
- There you go again.
- I swear.

60
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,470
- Stop forcing them.
- I can't believe this.

61
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,190
- Don't force it.
- Right.

62
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,280
- Since we all won big awards...
- That's right.

63
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,020
even before our 10th anniversary
at the year-end awards ceremony,

64
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,250
we'd like to say
thank you once again.

65
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

66
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,520
- So you got a coffee truck.
- Yes.

67
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,200
- Right.
- It was from the show.

68
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,960
- Thank you.
- Who sent the truck?

69
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,900
Everyone on the show?

70
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,270
- All of us did?
- But no one knows who sent it.

71
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,010
- Just be quiet.
- We won't talk about this?

72
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,110
I sent the truck, but I sent it
under the name of the show.

73
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,110
- Shouldn't we all pay for it?
- Hey.

74
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,480
- Send him 200 dollars.
- Should we give you 200 dollars?

75
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,920
- Wait, no one knew about this?
- Wire him 200 dollars.

76
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,310
(Wait, no one knew about this?)

77
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,550
- I had no idea.
- No.

78
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,810
- I had no idea.
- I didn't know.

79
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,930
I was so grateful.

80
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,580
- It was from just you?
- Yes.

81
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,580
You should have told us at least.

82
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,800
When I thanked them,
they didn't say anything about this.

83
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,990
It didn't come from one person.
We all sent him the truck.

84
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,460
- Right. We got the truck.
- Yes.

85
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,330
(Anyway, thank you.)

86
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,430
Se Chan went to Jong Kook's concert.

87
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,400
- You were on stage for 19 minutes?
- 19 minutes?

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,430
- You were there for 19 minutes?
- So...

89
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,930
- 19 minutes?
- It was more than 19 minutes.

90
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,370
If you only count the soundtrack,
it ran for 19 minutes.

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
If you combine acts here and there,
it's about 25 minutes.

92
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,580
- Wait.
- I thought it was my concert.

93
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,050
- I was flustered too.
- When he walks around,

94
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,610
he talks to himself.
I thought he was possessed.

95
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,920
You were practicing singing.

96
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,360
- Se Chan is Jong Kook's butler.
- I had no time.

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,730
Yes, I'm practically his butler.

98
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,700
Guys who used
to be his sidekick are...

99
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,090
- Haha and Kwang Soo.
- Haha.

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,230
- They can't do it anymore.
- When he grows up,

101
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,620
- I'll let him go.
- You will.

102
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,060
- Hang in there more.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,090
Just like you get discharged
from the army,

104
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,300
you get discharged from me too.

105
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,010
(He can be discharged
from his position.)

106
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,610
- Is it two years or longer?
- Yes.

107
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,710
- There's a time limit.
- I see.

108
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,010
Hey, you need to get out of there.

109
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,450
Before we start the race,

110
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,020
some guests will be
joining you today.

111
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,140
We've invited popular stars
who are expected...

112
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,890
- to have a great year in 2020.
- Popular stars.

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,760
- Please come on out.
- Come on out. Who are the guests?

114
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,150
- Isn't that Sae Rok?
- She's coming up the stairs.

115
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,990
- Hello.
- Gosh, Sae Rok.

116
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,790
- It's been a while.
- It's been a while.

117
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,390
(Keum Sae Rok:
She'll shine even more in 2020.)

118
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,200
(She ruled the movie industry
with her unique performance.)

119
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,930
(Last time, she showed
her unique charms on the show.)

120
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,610
(She made everyone
burst into laughter.)

121
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,800
(What kind of performance
will the rising star put on today?)

122
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,180
- It was for the orientation trip.
- Right.

123
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,240
(And another guest enters.)

124
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,610
- She worked with Kwang Soo.
- Ju Young.

125
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,890
- My gosh.
- Ju Young.

126
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,180
- Hello.
- Hi.

127
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,420
It's you today? Gosh.

128
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
(A new star in the movie industry,
Lee Ju Young)

129
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,620
(This scene-stealer grabbed
people's attention in "Believer".)

130
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,360
(She's friends with Kwang Soo
as they were in the same drama.)

131
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,100
- Hello.
- Come this way, Ju Young.

132
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,470
- She's the same age as Kwang Soo.
- Hi.

133
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,630
- Gosh.
- Nice to meet you.

134
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,000
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Your hair grew a lot.

135
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,980
- It's been a while, Ju Young.
- Yes.

136
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,500
I thought
she was Kwang Soo's sister.

137
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,240
- Why?
- You resemble each other.

138
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,850
- You look alike when you smile.
- We get that often.

139
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,350
- She resembles him when she smiles.
- Yes.

140
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,380
Let us bring in one more guest.

141
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,590
Who is it?

142
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,550
- Who is it?
- Hello.

143
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,450
(Chorong of Apink:
She always shows us new charms.)

144
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,820
(Lovely Chorong helped
Running Man throw a great party.)

145
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,300
- It's been a while.
- Chorong.

146
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,970
(It's been a while
since the fan-meet.)

147
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,240
Anyway, she's joining us too.

148
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
- We have one last guest.
- There's more?

149
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,130
I just got the script.

150
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,470
(He's about to introduce the guest.)

151
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,540
What is it?

152
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,930
(What? Why are they laughing?)

153
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,980
(Who is the guest?)

154
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,780
It's Kang Han Na.

155
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,850
- Han Na.
- Hey.

156
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,280
(Han Na: She's family now.)

157
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,590
(Giving her a warm welcome)

158
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,090
- Yes, you're here.
- Wait.

159
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,880
- Han Na.
- Did you know who was coming?

160
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,290
- Han Na.
- We didn't know.

161
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,430
- Hello.
- Well, she's...

162
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,950
- She's not a guest anymore.
- Han Na.

163
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,160
- Will she join us in the end?
- This is great.

164
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,250
No, stand in the middle.

165
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,320
- Han Na.
- You dyed your hair.

166
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,670
Your strategy is pretty good.

167
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,120
What strategy?

168
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,630
Are you trying
to sneak into the show?

169
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,100
- In a casual way?
- Very smoothly.

170
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,970
Your plan is to join us
among these four guests...

171
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,540
like you're part of the cast.

172
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,980
- Just like that. It'd be great.
- Yes.

173
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,280
These four guests will join us
today. Nice to meet you.

174
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,780
(4 guests who will have
a better year in 2020 are here.)

175
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,010
- Nice!
- Nice!

176
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,610
Let's say hello to each guest.

177
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,790
I heard that you and Sae Rok
are very close.

178
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,050
- Yes.
- We filmed "Believer" together.

179
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,530
Right.

180
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,750
- "Believer"?
- Yes.

181
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,250
Sae Rok told the staff
that she joined our show...

182
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,550
with the guests
she wasn't close with,

183
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,400
so she couldn't have fun
to the fullest.

184
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,490
- Really?
- You said you felt awkward.

185
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,060
- You stood out.
- Is that true?

186
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,910
It was my first variety show,
so I was nervous.

187
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,370
This time, I told them I wanted to
join you guys with a close friend.

188
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,350
Sae Rok managed to get her friend on
the show in her second appearance.

189
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,570
(She got her friend on the show
in her second appearance.)

190
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,740
- She did.
- She brought Ju Young here.

191
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,720
- She's influential.
- She is, isn't she?

192
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,290
- She's influential.
- Indeed, she is.

193
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,010
Suk Jin has been on the show
for 10 years,

194
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,920
but he has never managed
to get his friends...

195
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,880
- on the show.
- I've never done that.

196
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,590
I'm barely hanging by a thread here.

197
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,990
Things aren't stable
for Suk Jin either.

198
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,190
His spot on the show
isn't guaranteed.

199
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,760
Come here.

200
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,630
- Come here.
- You should come.

201
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,000
- Do you want a beating today?
- This is hilarious.

202
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,180
You told him to come to you.
Why did you go?

203
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,340
(Laughing)

204
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,110
- I knew he wouldn't come.
- He knew Jae Suk wouldn't come.

205
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,310
By the way,
Sae Rok, did you take dance lessons?

206
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,590
I thought I was a good dancer,
but I was terrible.

207
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,420
He won the TV competition,
"Dancing 9."

208
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,180
I worked on "The Fiery Priest"
with Um Mun Suk.

209
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,420
- Mun Suk?
- Jang Ryong.

210
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,450
I had a one-day lesson from Mun Suk.

211
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,750
Can you show us?

212
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,100
- Yes. But I'm really bad.
- Give her a round of applause.

213
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,490
- This only involved my shoulders.
- That's great.

214
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,800
- Great.
- I can't wait.

215
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,040
Only your shoulders will move?

216
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,930
- Only her shoulders?
- Right.

217
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,060
- Is it something like this?
- Right.

218
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,680
(The music starts right away.)

219
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,280
- She startled me.
- What was that?

220
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,850
Isn't this "Bad Guy"?

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
- Yes, "Bad Guy".
- "Bad Guy".

222
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,370
(The song is "Bad Guy"
by Billie Eilish.)

223
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,150
She prepared a nice one.

224
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,590
- She was good before too.
- Yes.

225
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,950
(She moves lightly to the rhythm
of the heavy bass guitar.)

226
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,860
That's the dance she learned
from the winner of "Dancing 9."

227
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,860
(This is the shoulder dance
Sae Rok talked about.)

228
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,560
I like her facial expression.

229
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,740
(She's chopping the beat
with her shoulders.)

230
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,930
She's using her shoulders a lot.

231
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,130
Look at her face.

232
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,130
- Look at her face.
- She came determined.

233
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,150
(She warmed up her shoulders.)

234
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,240
(Her shoulder dance is in full swing
all of a sudden.)

235
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,110
I mean...

236
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,450
(Will she dislocate her shoulders?)

237
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,360
She came determined.

238
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,230
She prepared a nice one.

239
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,320
Gosh, Sae Rok.

240
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,360
Sae Rok.

241
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,550
(She starts again.)

242
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,990
(Until when will you make her
dance with her shoulders?)

243
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,490
Look at her face.

244
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,410
- She's dancing with her shoulders.
- Great.

245
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,540
- He taught her a good one.
- Right.

246
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,280
- Great.
- It's straight up shoulder dance.

247
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,840
This is why it's called
the shoulder dance.

248
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,970
- She uses her shoulders a lot.
- Great job.

249
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,520
- The shoulder dance.
- That was great.

250
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,620
(She wraps up the dance
by shaking off her shoulders.)

251
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,620
(She's good.)

252
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,340
- She's good.
- You were great.

253
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,920
You're good
given you learned it within a day.

254
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,580
- You were great.
- Wasn't that great?

255
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,220
- I only danced with my shoulders.
- Great.

256
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,480
- Ju Young.
- Yes?

257
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,190
- Do you want to try this? Yes.
- Me?

258
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,430
I'm terrible at dancing.

259
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,190
- You should still try it.
- Just do it with your shoulders.

260
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,220
I was in "Just Dance."

261
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,300
Right.

262
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,640
- It was a drama.
- It was about ballroom dancing.

263
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,100
- I was in that drama last year.
- Really?

264
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,280
- Actually...
- Can you do ballroom dancing?

265
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,600
I can do the cha-cha-cha.

266
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,200
That's great.

267
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,250
Can you play the song for that?

268
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,970
I'm really good at this.

269
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
- I'm only good at this.
- It's ballroom dancing.

270
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,980
- Play the music.
- I think she'll be good at it.

271
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,050
She took lessons, right?

272
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,340
Gosh, Ju Young.

273
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,850
(The music starts.)

274
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,580
She did this in her drama.

275
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,170
(It's a fancy start
like her confidence.)

276
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,830
(She carefully takes her steps
as if she's walking on thin ice.)

277
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,010
(But...)

278
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,140
(She's...)

279
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,680
(Something is off.)

280
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,600
(Why is she suddenly kicking?)

281
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,920
There it is.

282
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,210
Wait, I don't think
she's an expert at it.

283
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,120
- I mean...
- She looks stiff.

284
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,710
- She's good, but it's weird.
- Something seems off.

285
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,160
It looks like...

286
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,080
a wooden toll is dancing.

287
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Right.

288
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,000
(She reminds them
of a broken marionette.)

289
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,500
(She reminds them
of a broken marionette.)

290
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,000
(She safely finishes her dance
without hurting herself.)

291
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,040
- She's good, but it's weird.
- This was so random.

292
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,100
Well done.

293
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,170
- For now...
- Wasn't I good?

294
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,140
Here's what I liked about her dance.

295
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,300
I liked stiff body rolls.

296
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,540
(That's what Jae Suk likes.)

297
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,380
And when she did this move,

298
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,750
she staggered.

299
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,440
- That was great.
- She staggered.

300
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,080
- It was strange.
- That was great.

301
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,580
Give a round of applause
to these actresses.

302
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,710
(Like best friends, both of them
prepared unique dance routines.)

303
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,850
All right. Next, we have Chorong.

304
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,930
(It's time to interview Chorong.)

305
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,400
<i>It's time to party, Chorong</i>

306
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,060
We talked about this before.

307
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,000
She learned hapkido for eight years.

308
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,930
- Hapkido? For eight years?
- So...

309
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,190
she's very good at martial arts.

310
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,100
Can you demonstrate for us?

311
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,880
Instead of kicking,

312
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,750
- I'll show you a cartwheel.
- A cartwheel.

313
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,310
- She'll do the cartwheel.
- That's not an easy move.

314
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,050
- Warm up first. Are you okay?
- What?

315
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,210
You should warm up first.

316
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,480
(Flexible)

317
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
You know,
there are stances in hapkido.

318
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,980
- Can you show us these moves?
- What is that?

319
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,980
- This isn't one of them?
- That's so wrong.

320
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,260
- What is this?
- Isn't that what drunk old men do?

321
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,430
What is this?

322
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,030
(On the other hand,
her stance is sharp.)

323
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,170
Gosh, look at that.

324
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,560
- That's the stance.
- Did you see that?

325
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,000
- That's the stance.
- She can do the stance.

326
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

327
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,140
- But it's been...
- Has it been a while?

328
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,930
- a while since I tried this.
- Okay.

329
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,280
I'm sure your body will remember.

330
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,600
(She takes off her shoes.)

331
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,680
- My gosh.
- What?

332
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,250
That was no joke.

333
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,710
- Was that a one-handed cartwheel?
- Hey.

334
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,890
It was a one-handed cartwheel,
right?

335
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,660
You did it with one hand.

336
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,310
I had no idea that you'd do this.

337
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,290
- Let me try again.
- She's really good.

338
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,350
The first was great.

339
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,260
I just thought she was going
to do a regular one.

340
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,670
- My gosh.
- She's got the pose.

341
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,040
(She puts only one hand
on the floor.)

342
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,140
With just one hand.

343
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,370
(And she comes back up.)

344
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,170
(A perfect cartwheel)

345
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,330
(Impressed)

346
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,470
You can do this?

347
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,180
- That was real.
- Chorong.

348
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,410
- You're a hero.
- Seriously.

349
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,840
- That was so cool.
- Seriously.

350
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
- That's so cool.
- Great.

351
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,790
Please give a round
of applause to Chorong.

352
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,120
We don't need
to interview Han Na.

353
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,550
- You see,
- We're family now.

354
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,930
- we've interviewed her often.
- It's not necessary.

355
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,130
- She's a radio host.
- We don't need to interview her.

356
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,630
- You're a radio host?
- Aren't you a radio host?

357
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,800
- That's right.
- A radio host?

358
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,400
(She became a radio host.)

359
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,670
(So Min was her first guest.)

360
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,770
It's called "Raise the Volume."

361
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,730
- "Raise the Volume"?
- Yes.

362
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,600
Have you been practicing?

363
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,300
I wanted to ask Suk Jin
for some tips.

364
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,420
- A radio host should feel...
- What should I do?

365
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,780
comfortable.

366
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,120
- You shouldn't be pressured.
- He's right.

367
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,420
Relax.

368
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,580
Like he said,
he was very relaxed...

369
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,420
when he was a radio host.

370
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,930
And that's how he quit.

371
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,130
(He did exactly what he just said.)

372
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,950
(He attacks him with the truth.)

373
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,190
That's right.

374
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,500
You need to feel pressured
to do well.

375
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't talk too sternly
as if you're on the news.

376
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,730
- Han Na.
- Should I not?

377
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,430
- Should I not feel pressured?
- Talk as if...

378
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,430
- you're talking to a friend...
- A friend?

379
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,930
- or a girlfriend.
- He was reprimanded for that.

380
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,380
The guests weren't his friends.

381
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,780
But he was too comfortable
with them.

382
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,440
- They were offended.
- Right.

383
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,070
- Right.
- They weren't his friends.

384
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,150
All right. These four guests...

385
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,070
have joined us.
Give them a round of applause.

386
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,250
(Welcome to our show!)

387
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,420
Welcome.

388
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,580
For today's race, you need to have
great bonds with your partners.

389
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,890
- Let's decide on your partners.
- Partners?

390
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,720
It will be called Here I Am.

391
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,000
A male member will sit
with his back toward the females.

392
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,690
He will say his ideal type.

393
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,140
If you think you're that type
or just interested,

394
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,170
you can come up
and try to become his partner.

395
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,600
The male will hand the doll
to the female of his choice.

396
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,510
I'm going to pick the woman
who shows interest in me.

397
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,810
The men will be here,
and the women will be over there.

398
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,380
This is similar to that show.

399
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,250
- "Match Made from Above".
- "Match Made from Above".

400
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,620
There's no need to rush.

401
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,890
- All the men are the same.
- We're the same?

402
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,930
Come on.

403
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,350
- We're just playing a game.
- That's right.

404
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,500
I like this.

405
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,900
- It's just a game.
- I'm the center of attention.

406
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,300
- Se Chan, go first.
- Okay.

407
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,430
- Thank you.
- Hey.

408
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,590
You only look good
because you're among us.

409
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,640
Right.

410
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,510
- You look handsome.
- This is nice.

411
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,730
All right.

412
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,510
I don't ask for much.

413
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,180
I'd like someone who has
a pretty wink to come up.

414
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,550
- Why?
- Because winking is...

415
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,650
- It's not time yet.
- Hey, hey.

416
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,070
I'd like someone who has
a pretty wink to come up.

417
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,940
(Are you calling for me?)

418
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,050
(So Min approaches him.)

419
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,890
- Hold on.
- No.

420
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,130
Do you remember what color
the woman you're interested in...

421
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,820
is wearing?

422
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,260
- What about her hairstyle?
- Her hairstyle?

423
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,500
- To be frank,
- Bob cut?

424
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,870
- I love bob cuts.
- Really?

425
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,930
Do you?

426
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,000
- It would be nice...
- Bob cuts?

427
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,430
if someone with a bob cut
came out.

428
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,200
You like bob cuts.

429
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,230
(She grabs her hair.)

430
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,100
- Because of what you said...
- What about a bob cut...

431
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
but with her hair tied?

432
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,680
- What about that?
- I don't like that.

433
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,070
- You don't?
- No.

434
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,780
I like hair that's this long.

435
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,420
- A bob cut.
- You like bob cuts?

436
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,920
Many of them have that hairstyle.

437
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,290
On the count of three,
look behind you.

438
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,340
One,

439
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,080
two,

440
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,120
three.

441
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,580
(Her heart flutters
just by watching them.)

442
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,450
Three.

443
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,720
I knew it.

444
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,430
(Hi, Se Chan.)

445
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,230
(I have a pretty wink
and a bob cut.)

446
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,200
(He sees her winking...)

447
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,140
(and bursts into laughter.)

448
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,070
- He loves it.
- Are you just pretending?

449
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,650
I'm confused too.

450
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,280
Decide whether or not
you're going to give her that doll.

451
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,650
I don't have to give it?

452
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,940
(Oh, right.)

453
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,180
(He can choose.)

454
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,660
Then I'll wait a bit more.

455
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,020
(He plays hard to get.)

456
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,430
(She's irritated.)

457
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,630
- What?
- I'll wait.

458
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,720
You will?

459
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,000
First, we'll count.

460
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,090
One...

461
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,670
- Let me see her wink.
- Okay.

462
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,870
- You do that.
- I think...

463
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,370
- 1, 2, 3.
- She's going to wink.

464
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,400
(She tries to win his heart
by winking at him.)

465
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,910
- 1, 2, 3.
- She's going to wink.

466
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,200
(Giggling)

467
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,100
You're enjoying this.

468
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,280
He's right. We know you like her.

469
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,780
Don't pretend like you don't.

470
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,120
- One...
- Why are you blushing?

471
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,020
Didn't you say that
you'd listen to your heart?

472
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,390
To whom does your heart belong?

473
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,130
1, 2, 3.

474
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,260
(To whom does his heart belong?)

475
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,220
(For whom does his heart beat?)

476
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,720
I'll listen to my heart.

477
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,090
(His heart calls out to So Min.)

478
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,140
- What is going on?
- What is this?

479
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,800
(What is going on?)

480
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,010
- It's unbelievable.
- What is this?

481
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,750
Don't do this! This is boring!

482
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,710
- Hey!
- It's boring for her.

483
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,290
- So Min doesn't like it.
- Why are you mad at me?

484
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,980
- I don't like this.
- You had a pretty wink.

485
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,420
- It was nice.
- By the way...

486
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,520
- He was serious.
- What's going on here?

487
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,450
What is this? Are you playing
hard to get?

488
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,290
We have no idea
what's going on between them.

489
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,160
- I was joking around,
- I'm serious. What's with them?

490
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,500
- but he actually chose me.
- She had a pretty wink.

491
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,090
You were bashing him
for giving you the doll,

492
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,670
- but you seemed really happy.
- He gave it to you for fun.

493
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,230
It looked like
you were being proposed to.

494
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,670
(It looked like
she was being proposed to.)

495
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,070
(Her heart fluttered.)

496
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,280
(She was smiling.)

497
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,180
- Let's do this. Okay.
- Okay.

498
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,680
- Come over here.
- What? You're partners?

499
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,810
- Yes, we are.
- Of course, they are.

500
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,150
- Really?
- Do you not get this?

501
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,210
I do.

502
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,020
Do you know where we are?

503
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,780
- Do you?
- Do you?

504
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,950
I know.

505
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,130
This really feels like
"Match Made from Above."

506
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,400
- Right.
- Many of them actually dated.

507
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,570
(He finds his target.)

508
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,340
- After shooting those...
- There were actual couples.

509
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,870
matchmaking programs,

510
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,500
- some dated in real life.
- Right.

511
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,610
Right.

512
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,970
(I'm talking about you.)

513
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,030
What?

514
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,650
- That was out of the blue.
- Talk, will you?

515
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,880
- Me?
- Weren't you one of them?

516
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,270
What?

517
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,240
(He fails to make him spill.)

518
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,940
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know the story.

519
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,280
I only focused on working.

520
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,750
- Really?
- Of course.

521
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,520
I can vouch for Jae Suk.

522
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,780
- He's good at matchmaking.
- I am.

523
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,290
My wife and I broke up back then,
but he helped us get back together.

524
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,370
- That's how we got married.
- That's right.

525
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,690
That's why I cut ties with him
for two years.

526
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,930
We had broken up for good.

527
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,530
What would that make of Hyun Woo?

528
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,840
(Whispering)

529
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,170
I'm just joking around.

530
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,500
Dad's just joking.

531
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,770
- Whom are you pointing at?
- You're the fruit of our love.

532
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,770
(Hyun Woo, you're the fruit
of our love.)

533
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,680
He is?

534
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,740
- You know you are, right?
- He's the fruit of your love?

535
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,940
(He can relate to him
as a father himself.)

536
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,450
- You are.
- He's the fruit?

537
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,480
Your mom and dad loved
each other so much.

538
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,680
Hyun Woo is the fruit of their love

539
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,100
- Next is Jong Kook.
- Okay.

540
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,160
- I bet he's popular.
- It's been a while.

541
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,400
He was always matched with women.

542
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,870
- He used to be.
- Right.

543
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,840
But he's taking a break for now.

544
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,610
- It's a long break.
- Yes.

545
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,270
What's your ideal type?

546
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,770
I'd like someone who's fun
to come out.

547
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,770
Right.

548
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,200
I want us to have similar humor.

549
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,240
- That's important.
- All right.

550
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,040
- Come out if you're fun...
- I'm not fun.

551
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,820
and think you two
have similar humor.

552
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,920
Come out if your friends
have told you that you're fun.

553
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,280
Let's begin.

554
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,890
1, 2, 3.

555
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,430
(No one's coming out.)

556
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,160
- This is unexpected.
- This is unexpected.

557
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,750
(Have I been taking a break
for too long?)

558
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,760
It seems like those
who are coming out right now...

559
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,290
- Right.
- want to be matched with him.

560
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,460
- Jong Kook.
- What is this?

561
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,530
(The others come out as well.)

562
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,070
This is it.

563
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,310
<i>- I loved my friend's friend</i>
- They have come out.

564
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,310
From the way I see it,
the lady who came later...

565
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,740
- is feeling competitive.
- Right.

566
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,940
That's the only explanation.

567
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,740
Right. It's obvious.

568
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,010
(Sae Rok and her friend, Ju Young,
have both come out.)

569
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,150
- This is unexpected.
- Really?

570
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,940
- 1, 2, 3.
- I'm surprised.

571
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,120
(They have chosen
love over friendship.)

572
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,160
Three.

573
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,950
Hold on a minute.

574
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,220
(He's flustered and doesn't know
what to do.)

575
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,660
- This is unbelievable.
- Two of them have come out.

576
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,790
- Goodness, Jong Kook.
- You two are close.

577
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,330
<i>Fill me up with love</i>

578
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,870
- I don't know what to do.
- Kim Jong Kook.

579
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,610
I'm glad that they came out.

580
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,530
- Why did you come out?
- Why?

581
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,080
I wanted to win.

582
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,970
So this is strictly business?

583
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,240
- And you, Sae Rok?
- Did I make a mistake?

584
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,040
I think if we're partners,

585
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,920
we'll have fun and win.

586
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,680
And I personally really like him.

587
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,210
I have a question.

588
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,160
What do you think about Ju Young?

589
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,750
- Is she funny?
- I don't think she's fun.

590
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,220
(She gives a cold reply.)

591
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,900
(Shocked)

592
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,190
- You're so mean.
- Did you hear that?

593
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,720
- This is hilarious.
- We're not close.

594
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,030
In your opinion,
is she funny or not?

595
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,570
- Not even a bit.
- Not even a bit?

596
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,610
(She counterattacks.)

597
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,470
- This is a competition.
- How fascinating.

598
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,970
If you're both boring...

599
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,200
(Han Na stands up.)

600
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,580
If you're both boring...

601
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,650
- Han Na stood up.
- Han Na's here.

602
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,150
- What was that?
- She's here.

603
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,320
(She mimics her.)

604
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,780
(She tries to be interesting
by mimicking her.)

605
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,480
- I'm fun. No? Don't go?
- What?

606
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,180
- Come out.
- Go?

607
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,920
- What took you so long?
- Bring your cushion.

608
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,480
- I'll be back.
- Is he interested in Han Na?

609
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,180
- Look at his face.
- I think he is.

610
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,490
He winked at her
and told her to come out.

611
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,220
He was giving me a sign.

612
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,670
You should've come out sooner.

613
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,670
(Will these two become a couple?)

614
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,840
He gave you a sign.

615
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,960
However, you came out
after the time was up,

616
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,200
- so you need to go back.
- Really?

617
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,500
(It's a shame.)

618
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,840
She was too late.

619
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,340
- She needs to follow the rules.
- She was too late.

620
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,200
- You must.
- She was too late.

621
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,310
She needs to follow the rules.

622
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,700
- She was too late.
- What does that make me?

623
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,920
- She's too late. I'm sorry.
- I see.

624
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,180
- I was late.
- All right, then.

625
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,180
They don't look too happy.

626
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,180
- This is your last chance.
- By the way,

627
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,980
how did Jong Kook look
when Han Na came out?

628
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,520
That's enough!

629
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
(Shut that mouth of yours.)

630
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,600
- That's enough!
- He just hit you.

631
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,670
- Stop it.
- He flew back.

632
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,870
- You just got hit.
- I'm fine.

633
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,490
- He flew.
- What are you talking about?

634
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,530
- Know when to stop.
- He hit you.

635
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,030
I don't think he hit me,
so why are you saying he did?

636
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,000
- Exactly. It's what you believe.
- Right.

637
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,030
To each his own.

638
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,410
You must give one of them
the doll.

639
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,440
Five,

640
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,510
four...

641
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,940
(Han Na lost her chance
to come out.)

642
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,920
(Will he choose one of them?)

643
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,680
- I'll protect their friendship.
- Three...

644
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,280
(He values loyalty.)

645
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,830
(But they've lost
both love and friendship.)

646
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,250
They dissed each other so much.

647
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,900
- I'd like to protect it.
- Good work.

648
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,100
(She returns to her place quickly.)

649
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,520
- By the way,
- They're flustered.

650
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,370
they showed different reactions.

651
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,490
Sae Rok returned
in a blink of an eye.

652
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,640
"Forget it."

653
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,340
"It's not like I liked you anyway."

654
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,910
- It's funny.
- However,

655
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,110
Ju Young seemed to be shocked.

656
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,510
Jong Kook hates it the most
when people try to win him over.

657
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,380
- They wanted to win me over.
- They just want your power.

658
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,040
- I'm not a tool.
- Exactly.

659
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,420
That's what slightly upset you?

660
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,950
I'm afraid so.

661
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,480
If Han Na doesn't choose you again,
it's over for you.

662
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,990
From what I can tell,
a rumor has spread among them.

663
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,160
- Exactly.
- You're doomed.

664
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,220
- That he's not a gentleman.
- That he's picky.

665
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,220
That he's the worst.

666
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,430
They all know that
he's not a gentleman.

667
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,960
- He's a dirtbag.
- Exactly.

668
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,230
A dirtbag.
Anyway, Suk Jin, you're up.

669
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,500
Here you go.

670
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,680
- I'll just tell you one thing.
- That isn't necessary, so sit down.

671
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,910
That isn't necessary.

672
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,310
Don't take the liberty
of doing anything.

673
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,920
Han Na gained fame thanks to me.

674
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,580
- Just sit.
- You're right.

675
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,210
- Right?
- That's right.

676
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,040
- Right.
- Just sit down.

677
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,680
He thinks I owe him.

678
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,660
- So Suk Jin is up next.
- Yes.

679
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,860
Who do you want as a partner?

680
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,160
I'd like someone feminine,

681
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
someone who doesn't get angry,

682
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,370
and someone who doesn't nag.

683
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,140
I'd also appreciate it
if she didn't mind my clumsiness.

684
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,600
So someone who isn't
like your wife...

685
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,910
(Your wife's opposite?)

686
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,960
Is that what I meant?

687
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,230
Then I said it wrong.

688
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,730
- I didn't mean that.
- Someone who isn't like your wife.

689
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,500
- That's not what I meant.
- I see.

690
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,200
I just want someone
who won't suddenly yell.

691
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,010
Forget all of
the other things he said.

692
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,780
He just wants someone
who doesn't get angry. 1, 2, 3.

693
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,780
- Please come on out.
- Gosh.

694
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,620
What do they find
charming about him?

695
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,860
Are you playing a prank on him?

696
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,520
No way!

697
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,220
This is wrong.

698
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,400
What's going on?

699
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,600
- Is this a prank?
- Is this my lucky day?

700
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,330
- Your lucky day?
- It sure is.

701
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,670
I'll speed things up before
they change their minds. 1, 2, 3.

702
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,140
(He can't help but exclaim.)

703
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,880
This is absurd.
Just how sweet are you two?

704
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,150
- Look at them.
- Why are you sitting like that?

705
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,240
She wants to look like a lady.

706
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,970
Can I ask why you're out here?

707
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,150
It's because I heard how
he made Han Na a star.

708
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,320
- Who?
- I wanted that.

709
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,510
- Because you wanted to be a star?
- That's the reason?

710
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,820
That's why?

711
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,630
- You want to be a star?
- Yes.

712
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,860
- She's seeing the bigger picture.
- It's a lie, you know.

713
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,750
Han Na achieved that all by herself.

714
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,130
- Say something, Han Na.
- Must I be his partner twice then?

715
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,600
- It was all Han Na.
- Suk Jin did nothing for her.

716
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,340
Han Na took care
of Suk Jin that day.

717
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,900
You thought he helped Han Na?

718
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,730
That's news to me. What do you
mean Suk Jin helped her?

719
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,080
Chorong, what brought you out here?

720
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,380
Partnering up with you
seemed less burdening.

721
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,000
I see.

722
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,380
She's approaching this
from a business standpoint.

723
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,380
- So...
- I mean...

724
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,380
She finds him easy.

725
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,420
I'm the one
who's choosing, you know.

726
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,980
I'm bad at playing games too.

727
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,710
- She just wants to have fun.
- I'll feel less burdened...

728
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,710
- to be with someone like me.
- I see.

729
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,130
Try to persuade me
with your gaze then.

730
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,160
Suk Jin's taking advantage
of the situation.

731
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,020
- He's having fun.
- He's enjoying this.

732
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,990
You have three seconds to choose.

733
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,900
In 1, 2, 3.

734
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,430
(Chorong?)

735
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,000
(Or Sae Rok?)

736
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,730
(Suk Jin chooses Sae Rok.)

737
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,080
- Chorong was declined.
- I'll make you a star.

738
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,380
I'm counting on you.

739
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,940
Are you an idiot?
He held Han Na back that day.

740
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,240
Well...

741
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,620
- I can't believe it.
- Exactly.

742
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,210
How can you be this tactless?

743
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,750
Han Na had to take a break
after being partnered with him.

744
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,950
Exactly!

745
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,360
I have a bad feeling about this.

746
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,520
- Mr. Shiny Jacket.
- Yes.

747
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,060
Who do you want as your partner?

748
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,760
- Today...
- You're dressed well today.

749
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,430
Anyone who wishes to only
partner up with me today...

750
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,430
should come forward.

751
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,570
So anyone who wants
to be your partner.

752
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,030
Come on out then.

753
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,880
In 1, 2, 3.

754
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,770
All right.

755
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,000
All these ladies?

756
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,500
- No way.
- Seriously?

757
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,710
Why didn't anyone
show interest in me like this?

758
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,320
No wonder he won the SNS Star Award.

759
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,180
- The winner of the SNS Star Award.
- Look at him.

760
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,120
- He's dressed for the occasion.
- I know.

761
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,680
- You're right.
- Right.

762
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,220
Please turned around in 1, 2, 3.

763
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,020
(Ju Young comes forward
for the 2nd time.)

764
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,160
(Kwang Soo has his hopes up.)

765
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,130
(But then he's disappointed.)

766
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
- What?
- Why won't you look at her?

767
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,340
- Who are you looking at?
- What's wrong with you?

768
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,070
Just look at who's in front of you.

769
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,110
- Don't look away.
- Don't be like that.

770
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,500
Ju Young, why are you out here?

771
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,140
I want to be a lot of fun today,

772
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,970
so being with someone I know...

773
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,150
Someone she knows.

774
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,680
So you only want
to be partners with him...

775
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,390
because you want to be funny today.

776
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,820
What?

777
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,980
So 1, 2, 3. What's your choice?

778
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,860
(Will Kwang Soo choose Ju Young?)

779
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,130
(Or will he decline her offer?)

780
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,100
I'll try again later.

781
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,830
(His pride is hurt.)

782
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
What...

783
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,840
Why?

784
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,610
What's wrong with you?

785
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,110
- Am I not allowed to do that?
- Why are you trying to be funny?

786
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,970
- I'm allowed to decline.
- Gosh.

787
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,410
- Ju Young.
- Stay seated.

788
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,770
You can stay seated.

789
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,040
- Drag her back.
- Ju Young...

790
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,240
Goodness.

791
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,680
What she said made me so sad.

792
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,940
- Why?
- She said,

793
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,620
"It's fine.
I'm quite popular, you know."

794
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,390
(Just a moment ago)

795
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,890
It's fine.
I'm quite popular, you know.

796
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,860
(It's fine.
I'm quite popular, you know.)

797
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,990
(Only Jae Suk heard
her lonely statement.)

798
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,960
No one asked her...

799
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,790
and no one said she wasn't popular.

800
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,760
- Goodness.
- Ju Young, oh, dear.

801
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,840
It's not because you're not popular.

802
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,470
Haha, you're next.

803
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,410
Well, just as a partner...

804
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,770
Why can I already see it?

805
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,150
- See what?
- Who you'll be teamed up with.

806
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,120
One of the ladies has been
passionately gazing at you.

807
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,280
I've never seen her
be like this before.

808
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,890
That gaze of hers...

809
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,950
It's not something
she shows every day.

810
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,220
- It's a first in 10 years.
- From what I can tell,

811
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,130
the others will have to stay back.

812
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,930
Remember what we said
at our team dinner?

813
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,170
We wished for something fresh
in the new year.

814
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,530
If anyone fits that bill,
please come forward.

815
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,960
- I think someone will.
- 1, 2, 3.

816
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,000
Someone new...

817
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
(Tossing)

818
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,730
(A fresh entrance)

819
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,700
That's new.

820
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,970
- She's here.
- That was fresh.

821
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,040
- But still...
- It's nice.

822
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,510
- You never know.
- Haha, you never know.

823
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,010
- Good.
- 1, 2, 3. Turn around.

824
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,820
(Peek-a-boo!)

825
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,780
(He's disgusted.)

826
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,160
I'll ask you one last time.
Why do you find me so charming?

827
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,430
Stop being this way
just because Gary's gone.

828
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,760
Forget about him.
Who on earth is he anyway?

829
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,070
Unbelievable.

830
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,640
- Gary?
- You've got to be kidding me.

831
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,030
Do you know what's more annoying?

832
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,230
My wife actually
acknowledges her now.

833
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,930
Byul, don't worry.
I'll keep him in check.

834
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,310
Unbelievable.

835
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,970
In 1, 2...

836
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,010
(The official couple that's
acknowledged by his wife)

837
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,040
(Will they welcome
a second couple on the show?)

838
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,920
(What's Haha's decision?)

839
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,160
This is your last chance.

840
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,780
(There you go.)

841
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,160
- Nice.
- This is great.

842
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
(Congratulations!)

843
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,830
- This is great.
- Of course.

844
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,220
- I'm glad.
- I'm happy too.

845
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,490
You're killing me, you know that?

846
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,340
Why are you doing this to me?

847
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,790
- Is it Jae Suk's turn next?
- Yes.

848
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,840
There's only one thing
I look for in a partner.

849
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,140
If you can't help yourself
from partying,

850
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,110
- then join me today.
- There's movement already.

851
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,470
- The ladies...
- Everyone except...

852
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,210
for one person is ready to party.

853
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,420
Their shoulders
are already bouncing.

854
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,710
Join me if you love partying.

855
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,210
In 1, 2, 3.

856
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,010
Go ahead.

857
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,590
That's all I look for in a partner.

858
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,160
I'm not exactly the life of a party.

859
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,250
Then please stay back.

860
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,690
- What?
- Please stay back.

861
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,990
(They suddenly put on the brakes.)

862
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,330
You shouldn't have said that.

863
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,760
(You shouldn't have said that.)

864
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,400
If you're the least bit interested
in partying...

865
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
(He corrects his condition.)

866
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,460
- Anyone who's interested...
- I'll lower my standard.

867
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,070
- So anyone who's interested?
- That's right.

868
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,140
Even if you aren't
the life of a party,

869
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,970
- if you're interested...
- That much you'll accept.

870
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,000
The candidates have all shown up.

871
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,120
All right.

872
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
(Startled)

873
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,980
Ju Young?

874
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,480
(He can't believe his eyes.)

875
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,420
(Ju Young openly stated
that she doesn't party.)

876
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,430
(I saw how you were earlier.)

877
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,860
But... Hold on.

878
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,020
(She steals the stuffed animal
away from him.)

879
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,960
You can't steal it.

880
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,030
- What about Chorong then?
- What?

881
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,530
Don't be like this!

882
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,260
Seriously. Don't be this way.

883
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,000
- No way.
- Don't do this.

884
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,680
I had no idea
Ju Young would show up.

885
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,410
- I...
- Why not?

886
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,500
Well...

887
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,350
I mean...

888
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,880
Chorong likes to party though.

889
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,580
- That's right.
- Right?

890
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,620
It's a tough choice.

891
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,940
All right.

892
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,950
(Jae Suk will now choose.)

893
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,830
It's my turn to choose
and I have someone in mind.

894
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,690
(Will he choose Ju Young who
could have the party DNA in her?)

895
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,690
All right.

896
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,490
(Who will Jae Suk choose?)

897
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,960
I choose Ju Young.

898
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,930
(He chooses
the partygoer in the making.)

899
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,640
- Nice!
- I choose Ju Young.

900
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,730
- I knew it.
- Just so you know,

901
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,200
- that was her third attempt.
- Chorong was rejected again.

902
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
- Gosh.
- This time,

903
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,700
the ladies will choose.

904
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,770
- Right.
- The ladies will choose this time.

905
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,480
I'd like to hear a cute
acrostic poem.

906
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
All right.

907
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,010
- To Kang Han Na.
- I once did the same...

908
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,010
for Jong Kook.

909
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,330
- That's right.
- He coldly rejected me.

910
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,430
(He coldly rejected me.)

911
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,250
(Looking adorable)

912
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,400
(She did her best to be his partner
in episode 472.)

913
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,170
(He chose Seol In Ah instead.)

914
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,400
(You rejected me?)

915
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,840
(Jong Kook,
I will never forget this.)

916
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,910
(He deeply regrets it.)

917
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,000
All right then.

918
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,430
It will be done to Kang Han Na.
Kang.

919
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,310
Kang Han Na.

920
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,500
- Han.
- Han.

921
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,680
Han Na.

922
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,510
- Na.
- Have eyes only for me.

923
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,580
(Have eyes only for me.)

924
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,210
(Han Na, have eyes only for me.)

925
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,420
(I'm going to vomit.)

926
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,680
- No way.
- Unbelievable.

927
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,130
- This is hard to watch.
- Did you see what he just did?

928
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,130
You've got to be kidding me.

929
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,750
- Gosh.
- Keep that in mind then.

930
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,160
- Right.
- Kwang Soo, you're next.

931
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,600
- Sure.
- Kang.

932
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
(Kwang Soo will come up
with a poem next.)

933
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,790
Kang Han Na.

934
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,490
- What on earth?
- Look at him squirming.

935
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,290
- Are you kidding me?
- Han.

936
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,030
I'll only say this one thing.

937
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,910
Na.

938
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,470
I want to be your partner.

939
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,500
(I want to be your partner.)

940
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,200
You've got to be kidding me.

941
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,470
(Screaming in pain)

942
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,700
Why?

943
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,120
(He tried to look too adorable.)

944
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,420
(He is arrested for
bringing harm to the viewers' eyes.)

945
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,350
I was supposed to look cute.

946
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,710
(Even though
they tortured the viewers,)

947
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,750
(their poems were successful.)

948
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,860
- Have you chosen?
- Yes.

949
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,220
Hand the stuffed animal
to one of them.

950
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,750
In 1, 2, 3.

951
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,020
(She heads straight over to...)

952
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,690
And now Chorong...

953
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,640
(And now Chorong...)

954
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,810
You're allowed
to object to their partnership.

955
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,500
- Actually...
- Well...

956
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,970
- Yes?
- Actually...

957
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,200
(Chorong seems to have
something to say.)

958
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
(Does Jong Kook have his hopes up?)

959
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,420
(I...)

960
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,240
I'll just be partnered
with whoever's left.

961
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,420
(I'll just be partnered
with whoever's left.)

962
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,350
I'm okay with anyone left over.

963
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,180
Hey.

964
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,590
"Anyone left over."

965
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,220
- She said, "anyone left over."
- "Anyone left over"?

966
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,680
The way she said was a bit...

967
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,860
- "Anyone left over."
- I'm left over too.

968
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,060
All right.

969
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,100
Kwang Soo and Chorong are a team.

970
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,260
"Anyone left over."
That's hilarious.

971
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
That's so funny.

972
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,730
(Finally, all couples are decided.)

973
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,170
(Jae Suk and Ju Young, Se Chan
and So Min, Suk Jin and Sae Rok)

974
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,610
(Haha and Ji Hyo, Jong Kook and
Han Na, Kwang Soo and Chorong)

975
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,930
Depending on the combination
of cards held at the end,

976
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,880
each couple will be
either rewarded or penalized.

977
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,470
- The race is called Switch Cards.
- Cards?

978
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,310
The deck consists of pairs of
water, fire, wind, and tree cards,

979
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,180
which are element cards,

980
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,710
and two prize cards
and two penalty cards,

981
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,210
which are special cards.

982
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,160
Each member
will randomly pick one card...

983
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,560
and pair it with
his or her partner's.

984
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,060
For example, a couple with
a water card and a prize card...

985
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,330
wins abalone as a prize.

986
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,600
A couple with a water card
and a penalty card...

987
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,450
will be penalized
with the water cannon.

988
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,430
A couple with a penalty card
and a prize card...

989
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,070
will only be penalized.

990
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,370
I want abalone!

991
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,900
A water cannon in this weather?

992
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,810
After each round,
the top two couples...

993
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,110
get to choose a couple...

994
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,230
and see whether they hold
element cards or special cards.

995
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,770
They can also switch cards
with a member of their choice.

996
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,700
The couple in second place
can switch cards...

997
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,040
with any couple except
for the couple in first place.

998
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,480
After three rounds,
each couple will be...

999
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,420
either rewarded or penalized...

1000
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,890
according to
their card combinations.

1001
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,590
Come forward and pick two cards.

1002
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,780
Are we going to pick cards?

1003
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,130
Go to the table.

1004
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,130
These are the only ones who may
become a couple in real life.

1005
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,490
(So Min and Se Chan
pick cards first.)

1006
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,670
- I hope they'll go out.
- So do I.

1007
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,790
(Which cards did they pick?)

1008
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,500
(Penalty)

1009
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,080
(A water card and a penalty card
mean the water cannon.)

1010
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,080
Good job.

1011
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,040
I tend to be unlucky
with these things.

1012
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,470
Let's see.

1013
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,620
You can show your card.

1014
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,440
(Prize, fire)

1015
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,180
(A fire card and a prize card mean
a Korean beef bulgogi set.)

1016
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,780
(Jae Suk holds back his smile.)

1017
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,330
Jae Suk must have picked
a bad one.

1018
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,950
He doesn't look happy.

1019
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,250
- Does it show?
- Yes.

1020
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,430
- Gosh.
- What was mine?

1021
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,220
(All couples have picked cards.)

1022
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,370
(Card Distribution)

1023
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,760
Let's hurry up.

1024
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,000
- It's raining.
- Let's do that!

1025
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,730
In the first mission,
you will compete as two teams.

1026
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,200
This couple foot volleyball game
is called...

1027
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,910
Foot Volleyball with You.

1028
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,410
(Foot Volleyball with You)

1029
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,520
- Foot Volleyball with You.
- Foot Volleyball...

1030
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,750
with You.

1031
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,890
Each team consists of 3 couples.
Pick 2 couples for each round.

1032
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,080
The same foot volleyball
rules apply.

1033
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,390
The ball has to go over the net
within three hits.

1034
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,830
A ball is out
if it lands outside the lines.

1035
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,850
The ball can't be hit
by the same player twice in a row.

1036
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,520
- No two hits in a row.
- No?

1037
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,850
These are the basic rules.

1038
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,190
One member of each couple
will use his or her feet...

1039
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,330
while the other will use a tool...

1040
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,540
from the prop truck.

1041
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,140
Once a member chooses a tool,
it can't be taken away.

1042
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,870
We always have these special rules.

1043
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,370
First place and second place will be
chosen from the winning team.

1044
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,810
- Okay.
- Let's win first place.

1045
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,000
First...

1046
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,910
Which couple should we compete with?

1047
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,120
(He thinks they're competing
one on one.)

1048
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,580
Three couples become a team.

1049
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,790
- Three couples become a team.
- Three couples become a team.

1050
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,390
So we have two teams.

1051
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,690
Oh, he got it wrong.

1052
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,060
He thought
we were competing separately.

1053
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,230
Is that what we're doing?

1054
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,520
All right.

1055
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,460
- We're divided into two teams?
- Yes.

1056
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,190
Let's start.

1057
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,790
(Team Unmarried versus Team Married)

1058
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,690
- Ready.
- Avoid the bamboo wife.

1059
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,290
- Ji Hyo.
- Get set.

1060
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,040
(Most of them are female.)

1061
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,080
No!

1062
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,480
No!

1063
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,850
(Due to Ju Young's leg injury,
Jae Suk participates instead.)

1064
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,580
Move!

1065
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,310
(Han Na chooses a paddle.)

1066
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,040
Good choice!

1067
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,310
(Ji Hyo chooses a frying pan.)

1068
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,790
So Min, good job!

1069
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,250
What is So Min doing?

1070
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,350
(What did So Min choose?)

1071
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,250
(Huge)

1072
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,230
- What is So Min doing?
- So Min!

1073
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,560
Good job.

1074
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,870
(So Min chooses a huge
air mattress.)

1075
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,000
It's very hard.

1076
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,440
Isn't this nice?

1077
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,040
- Yes, this is perfect.
- Right?

1078
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,230
(Sae Rok chooses a giant hand.)

1079
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,330
This is the best.

1080
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,330
- That looks nice.
- You can't change tools now.

1081
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,370
They all look pretty good.

1082
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,770
Here we go.

1083
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,250
Let's go!

1084
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,540
Should we practice?

1085
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,140
Go. Start.

1086
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,390
I should serve like this.

1087
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,750
- Hey!
- Gosh.

1088
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,430
(Kwang Soo receives the serve
with his face.)

1089
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,390
- Kwang Soo.
- Your face...

1090
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,930
- Kwang Soo!
- You might hurt yourself.

1091
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,290
Are you okay?

1092
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,790
- Kwang Soo.
- What did he do?

1093
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,770
Are you stupid?

1094
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,230
He's not a fool.

1095
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,600
- Let's get started.
- The first round is important.

1096
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,640
(The main game starts.)

1097
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,940
- Let's start!
- Okay.

1098
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,940
- The game starts now.
- Let's do this!

1099
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,680
- Haha, go.
- It's mine.

1100
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,140
(It's mine.)

1101
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,620
(He's too short.)

1102
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,960
(The direction was good,
but he couldn't reach it.)

1103
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,080
- Gosh.
- Hey!

1104
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,960
What are you doing?

1105
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,230
- It suddenly...
- He doesn't know how short he is.

1106
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,600
- What are you doing?
- It suddenly went up.

1107
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,660
We were lucky.

1108
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,250
- Yes!
- Nice!

1109
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,120
- Did we score a point?
- We were lucky.

1110
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,870
- Let's start again. Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

1111
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,140
- Let's start.
- Let's go.

1112
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,660
Relax.

1113
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,440
I'll get it.

1114
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,440
(Sae Rok smashes the ball
with her giant hand.)

1115
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,350
- What are you doing?
- Way to go!

1116
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,500
- Two.
- Calm down.

1117
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,580
Okay!

1118
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,120
(A cheerful full swing)

1119
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,040
- Chorong, good job.
- Shout, "I'll get it".

1120
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,580
- Good job, Sae Rok.
- She's good.

1121
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,580
Good job.

1122
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,350
She's an ace.

1123
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,330
- Can you see my face?
- You have to say, "I'll get it".

1124
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,890
Is So Min just standing there?

1125
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,120
I'm playing too.

1126
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,560
I'm doing my best.

1127
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,870
Block the ball here.

1128
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,060
(She chose the biggest tool,
hoping to contribute to her team.)

1129
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,560
(But she can't even hold it up.)

1130
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,500
(While she struggles to even
hold it, the score becomes 1 to 1.)

1131
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,680
But...

1132
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,180
you can hit the ball
before it bounces.

1133
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,270
(So Min is doing her best.)

1134
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,580
So Min is getting in the way.

1135
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,410
(Swinging)

1136
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,640
She's getting in our way too.

1137
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,250
- We can't see anything.
- We can't see anything.

1138
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,190
So Min, you shouldn't
block the serve.

1139
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,810
- Okay.
- It's so annoying.

1140
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,930
(The game restarts
with Suk Jin's serve.)

1141
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,060
That was accurate.

1142
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,660
- Mine!
- That was accurate.

1143
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,230
Okay. Go!

1144
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,600
- Okay!
- What are you doing?

1145
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,190
(Standing still)

1146
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,660
- What are you doing?
- It's...

1147
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,190
Why didn't you hit the ball?

1148
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,460
- So Min!
- I can't do that.

1149
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,580
- I can only block the ball.
- It's like a wall.

1150
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,370
(I can only block the ball.)

1151
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,680
I can only block the ball.

1152
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,210
- Okay.
- You should hit it the second time.

1153
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,370
We can't even see So Min's face.

1154
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,140
We can't see you.

1155
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,020
It's okay. Let's continue.

1156
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,310
I'll show you.

1157
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,020
Se Chan is laughing at you.

1158
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,250
(The score is 1 to 2,
and Se Chan serves.)

1159
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,960
(The air mattress finally
blocks the ball?)

1160
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,350
(Defense is the air mattress's
only function.)

1161
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,930
(But...)

1162
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,100
Sae Rok!

1163
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,440
I can't see anything!

1164
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,890
(They lose another point.)

1165
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,960
I can't see anything!

1166
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,540
- It doesn't work.
- So Min.

1167
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,660
- Yes!
- Sae Rok!

1168
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,500
- Sae Rok is our ace.
- We don't have to do anything.

1169
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,850
So Min.

1170
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,500
You should just stand still.

1171
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,870
Let's do this!

1172
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,440
- Okay!
- There you go.

1173
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,540
Kwang Soo, get ready.

1174
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,890
- Kwang Soo!
- Come in!

1175
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,460
(Kwang Soo, here you go.)

1176
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,350
- Gosh.
- Hey!

1177
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,060
(What?)

1178
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,480
- Why did you do that?
- Hey!

1179
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,930
Kwang Soo, can't you do better?

1180
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,660
- What's with you?
- I mean...

1181
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,960
- Why did you do that?
- Okay.

1182
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,020
Okay.

1183
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,790
By the way, is So Min...

1184
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,660
on vacation?

1185
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,440
- Are you on vacation?
- Jae Suk.

1186
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,000
- We're all on vacation.
- Put it down.

1187
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,540
- Is your team...
- I'm doing my best.

1188
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,910
on vacation?

1189
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,370
Lie down for a minute.

1190
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,020
We can't see anything.

1191
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,710
Lie down for just one round.

1192
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,620
Let's play!

1193
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,640
So Min, just a second.

1194
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,250
She should be outside the court.

1195
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,080
- I can finally see something.
- Let's play!

1196
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,960
- I can finally see something.
- So Min, just a second.

1197
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,350
I can finally see you guys.

1198
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,960
(The score is 1 to 4.
Team Married serves.)

1199
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,190
Kwang Soo, get ready.

1200
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,430
- Get ready.
- Good!

1201
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,520
Kwang Soo!

1202
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,620
Attack!

1203
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,960
(Team Unmarried loses
another point.)

1204
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,160
(Because of Kwang Soo's lousy pass,
his team loses a point.)

1205
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,230
- Kwang Soo!
- He's so bad.

1206
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,830
For Chorong to be able to hit it,
the ball should be high.

1207
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,310
- The ball should go above the net.
- I get it now.

1208
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,870
- He gets it now.
- Chorong can stay still.

1209
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,810
- I can't see anything again.
- It's annoying.

1210
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,140
- I shouldn't have chosen this.
- Move forward.

1211
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,210
So Min, move. I can't see anything.

1212
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,620
So Min!

1213
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,020
(While So Min is blocking the view,)

1214
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,120
(the other team suddenly attacks.)

1215
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,160
I can't see anything.

1216
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,560
(It's a mess.)

1217
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,120
So Min!

1218
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,160
I can't see a thing!

1219
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,370
So Min, move.

1220
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,830
- So Min, look at this.
- I mean...

1221
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,910
So Min.

1222
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,370
- Stay outside the lines.
- So Min is on our team.

1223
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,710
- Go in only when the ball comes.
- Okay.

1224
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,230
- Okay?
- I got it.

1225
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,440
- I mean...
- Stay outside the lines.

1226
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,870
Okay.

1227
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,520
I feel sorry for So Min.

1228
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Hold on.

1229
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,540
So Min is blocking the camera.

1230
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,890
(Hold on.
So Min is blocking the camera.)

1231
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,560
- Hey!
- Move!

1232
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,190
- Go to the other side!
- I want to be on camera too.

1233
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,520
- I want to be on camera.
- You can stay here.

1234
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,620
(So Min is now standing
farthest away from the camera.)

1235
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,460
The cameraman rarely
says something like that.

1236
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,140
Stand here...

1237
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,290
and put it on the ground.

1238
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,140
Why did you choose this?

1239
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,040
(Exploding)

1240
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,000
(The air mattress was
the beginning of trouble.)

1241
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,370
Calm down.

1242
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,210
- Stand here.
- You can't even hold it.

1243
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,440
You can't even hold it?

1244
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,520
- Hold it. It's on your back.
- It's on her back.

1245
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,190
Okay. Let's play!

1246
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,250
(We can finally play.)

1247
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,410
I can see everything now.

1248
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,290
- Calm down.
- How have you been?

1249
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,930
- The real game starts now.
- I missed you.

1250
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,730
I can't give up.

1251
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,060
I still can't give up.

1252
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,120
Can we change tools?

1253
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,890
- You can only change players.
- Okay.

1254
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,640
- Why?
- Do you want to try?

1255
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,890
- I want to.
- All right.

1256
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,100
So Min, you can just stay here.

1257
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,160
(So Min gets replaced.)

1258
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,270
Hey!

1259
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,640
- I haven't done anything.
- Yes, you have.

1260
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,370
You've done a lot.

1261
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,210
- Let's go.
- Okay!

1262
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,580
Here we go.

1263
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,850
- Chorong.
- Chorong, hit it!

1264
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,210
Hit it!

1265
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,790
(What?)

1266
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,190
(Defensive heading)

1267
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,390
(For once, Suk Jin scores a point.)

1268
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,850
- Good job.
- This is so easy.

1269
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,060
Good job.

1270
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,330
- The ball came right to me.
- Foot volleyball is so easy.

1271
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,870
- We'll go in now.
- Go ahead.

1272
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,940
- Who should play?
- Kwang Soo.

1273
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,560
- Come in.
- Can I play one round?

1274
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,230
- Here we go.
- Let's go!

1275
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,770
(Will Team Married be able to
sustain their momentum?)

1276
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,210
I'll get it.

1277
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,180
Okay.

1278
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,410
- Hey!
- It's out.

1279
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,020
- It's out.
- It's ours.

1280
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,120
Hey!

1281
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,310
- It's out.
- It's ours.

1282
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,350
- You need to hit it lightly.
- Okay.

1283
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,980
- That team...
- I got it now.

1284
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,080
needs to send Kwang Soo away.

1285
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,560
The biggest problem is Kwang Soo,
not So Min.

1286
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,750
- No, no.
- I am serious.

1287
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,830
- Kwang Soo.
- You might think that.

1288
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,890
- Kwang Soo, you are like an X-man.
- I watched him play.

1289
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,660
- He...
- Don't tell them that.

1290
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,730
- What?
- Don't tell them that.

1291
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,060
Ju Young said,
"Don't tell them that."

1292
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,770
She wants to win.
She is competitive.

1293
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,940
I will show you what I can do.

1294
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,940
(Everyone knows that
he is a lousy player.)

1295
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,000
(Team Unmarried has 1 point
and Team Married has 8 points.)

1296
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,310
Let's go. I'll get it.

1297
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,770
- Kwang Soo, use your head.
- Kwang Soo.

1298
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,040
- Here.
- Hit it.

1299
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,440
- Han Na!
- Okay, that's good.

1300
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,770
(She scoops up the ball.)

1301
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,890
Okay.

1302
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,980
That's good.

1303
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,310
All right!

1304
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,890
(Dancing)

1305
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,160
(Laughing)

1306
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,520
That was good.

1307
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,500
What was that?
Was that a mask dance?

1308
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,730
What was that?

1309
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,230
Jae Suk did this.

1310
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,040
My left foot...

1311
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,500
You did a good job, Ji Hyo.
It was my mistake.

1312
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,710
- Okay.
- Okay. Han Na, you are doing well.

1313
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,080
(They improved with Han Na.
What will happen this time?)

1314
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,410
(My goodness!)

1315
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,440
Hey!

1316
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,750
(Dancing)

1317
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,850
Hey!

1318
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,080
Hey, come on out.

1319
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,410
- My goodness.
- What was that?

1320
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,790
He is worse than Dream.

1321
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,560
- Come on out.
- That's it.

1322
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,750
- Hold on.
- That's it.

1323
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,230
Remember
what I have done so far, okay?

1324
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,890
- What are you doing?
- It was a mistake.

1325
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,230
You did the mask dance too.

1326
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,230
(Haha is happy
to see a fellow dancer.)

1327
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,790
Are we taking a mask dance class?

1328
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,190
Why are we keep doing
the mask dance?

1329
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,390
We need to do better.

1330
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,160
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1331
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,600
(Jong Kook serves...)

1332
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,580
(and Jae Suk touches the ball.)

1333
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,140
Nice serve!

1334
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,640
(His anger explodes.)

1335
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,980
This is no fun!

1336
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,410
The two of you should sit out.

1337
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,810
This is ridiculous.

1338
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:48,960
Suk Jin should play.

1339
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,080
For goodness' sake.

1340
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,390
This won't do. Come on out.

1341
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,460
- This won't do.
- Come on out.

1342
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,790
- Come on out.
- Come on out.

1343
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,250
- Sae Rok, you should play.
- No, no. Hold on.

1344
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,960
I have a suggestion. From now on,

1345
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,460
- you are out if you make a mistake.
- Come on out.

1346
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,270
- Let's do that.
- You are out if you make a mistake.

1347
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,440
(Team Unmarried has 4 points
and Team Married has 8 points.)

1348
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,660
That was short.

1349
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,910
(Team Unmarried
loses a point again.)

1350
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,640
Someone who made a mistake
should be switched.

1351
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,500
(This is my chance.)

1352
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,310
Someone who made a mistake
should be switched, Jong Kook.

1353
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,520
Ms. Bed, come over here.

1354
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,440
- Hold on.
- I...

1355
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,850
- You are blocking people's views.
- I want to play.

1356
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,520
- I'm outside now for So Min.
- So Min, you can play.

1357
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,890
- Move that signboard.
- Let's go.

1358
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,620
Gosh, I can't see anything.

1359
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,060
- Okay.
- Jong Kook, kick.

1360
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,000
- Okay. That's good, So Min.
- Kick.

1361
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,120
- That's good, So Min.
- Hold it up.

1362
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,520
(Shouting)

1363
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:34,890
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1364
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,600
(Mine! Mine! Mine!)

1365
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,140
I...

1366
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,080
(He acts like
he was going to kneel.)

1367
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,040
Sae Rok could have sent it
over the net!

1368
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,040
Why didn't you do it?

1369
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,540
- He pushed Sae Rok.
- He said, "Mine! Mine! Mine!"

1370
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,520
- He pushed her and yelled, "Mine!"
- He said, "Mine! Mine! Mine!"

1371
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,120
I could have sent it over the net.

1372
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,310
Hold on.

1373
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,810
Are we a dance club?

1374
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,750
I am a dancer!

1375
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,730
Seriously.

1376
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,830
(They create dance moves
of all genres.)

1377
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,100
This is ridiculous.

1378
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,100
- You should stand over here.
- I am sorry,

1379
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,160
but how many people are there?

1380
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,830
(Swarming)

1381
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:12,460
- How many people are there?
- Seriously.

1382
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,500
I am sorry.

1383
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,730
Follow the rules, okay?

1384
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,980
- Let's put out hands together.
- We can win.

1385
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,210
- Sae Rok, come here.
- Let's go!

1386
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,710
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

1387
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,180
- What are you doing?
- Suk Jin.

1388
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,680
- I did it from here.
- You only had to take...

1389
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,850
- a few steps.
- I did it from here.

1390
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,520
- Let's begin.
- Let's go.

1391
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,790
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1392
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:30,850
- Okay.
- Okay.

1393
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:32,230
That's good.

1394
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,330
All right.

1395
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,460
We got this.

1396
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,750
So Min, let's go.

1397
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,770
- Han Na, there you go!
- You are good.

1398
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,690
(Han Na's smash)

1399
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,160
That's good.

1400
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,540
So Min, what are you doing? So Min!

1401
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,060
(Help the team.)

1402
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,600
- So Min!
- Get up!

1403
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,370
- So Min!
- Get up!

1404
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,040
(Take this!)

1405
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,500
- So Min!
- Get up!

1406
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,640
I mean...

1407
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,370
- You have an air mattress.
- You can't kick it.

1408
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,390
- "Take this!"
- You need to use your weapon.

1409
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:00,390
- I mean...
- You should have been ready.

1410
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,120
- Jong Kook.
- She tried to kick it.

1411
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,350
- I can't...
- Go home and lie down on a bed.

1412
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,980
I can't control it as I want.

1413
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,230
I can't...

1414
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,660
- Okay. I will try harder.
- We are doing very well.

1415
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,830
- So Min, you know what to do.
- Yes, Jong Kook.

1416
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,100
- Block when I tell you to.
- Okay.

1417
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,730
- Get it.
- You can do it.

1418
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:16,960
Come on.

1419
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,600
- Nice! Jong Kook!
- Come on.

1420
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,960
(What?)

1421
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,370
- Nice! Jong Kook!
- Come on.

1422
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,210
(Jong Kook heads the ball
into the net.)

1423
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,250
Had you kicked it,
it would have gone over the net.

1424
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,710
Hold on.

1425
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,710
- Are you going to overlook it?
- It was hilarious.

1426
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,690
(Jong Kook's rare mistake
makes the members very happy.)

1427
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,410
- His head almost went into the net!
- Use your leg.

1428
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,350
I thought the ball was higher.

1429
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,160
- You should have used your leg.
- I thought the ball was higher,

1430
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,730
so I used my head.

1431
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,160
- I burst out laughing.
- That was hilarious.

1432
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
That was hilarious.

1433
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,560
- For goodness' sake.
- Let's resume.

1434
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,440
Let's win. Let's finish them off.

1435
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,500
Let's go.

1436
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,140
(The current score is 11 to 5.
Jae Suk continues to serve.)

1437
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,600
That's good.

1438
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,980
- Han Na.
- Send it over the net.

1439
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,980
That's it!

1440
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,040
- Han Na.
- Send it over the net.

1441
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,140
(A strong spike)

1442
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,480
- Han Na!
- Yes!

1443
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,680
- Send it over the net.
- That's it!

1444
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,350
(Team Married fails to block
Han Na's strong spike.)

1445
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,190
- Han Na!
- So Min, good job.

1446
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,290
- That was good.
- That was good.

1447
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,560
- You are incredible.
- So Min, good job.

1448
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,660
So Min, stay still.

1449
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,750
- Han Na, that was amazing.
- Han Na.

1450
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,120
- So Min, you are doing great.
- I want to play!

1451
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,830
She spiked the ball.

1452
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,120
Han Na is athletic.

1453
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,430
This is good.

1454
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,290
- Mine!
- Okay.

1455
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,160
- Okay.
- That's good.

1456
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,230
Han Na, get ready.

1457
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:24,290
Han Na, hit it!

1458
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,370
- There you go!
- All right!

1459
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,410
That's it.

1460
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,660
(Han Na's strong spike)

1461
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,000
That's it.

1462
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,500
- Hit it!
- Ju Young, that's it.

1463
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,040
(Ji Hyo and Ju Young
manage to receive.)

1464
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,000
- That's it.
- All right.

1465
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,210
Move out of the way.

1466
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,540
- That's it.
- So Min, move out of the way.

1467
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,980
That's it.

1468
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,390
- Han Na.
- So Min.

1469
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,810
- There you go.
- No!

1470
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,120
- He touched the ball twice!
- There you go.

1471
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,580
You did it.

1472
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,790
- So Min, you did it.
- Good job.

1473
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:47,290
(So Min and the air mattress
did it.)

1474
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:50,690
(So Min blocked the ball
for the first time.)

1475
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:53,020
(So Min, good job!)

1476
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,640
- You did it.
- So Min, you did it.

1477
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,690
(She was scorned
outside the stadium.)

1478
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,100
- Good job.
- You did it.

1479
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,540
- You did it.
- Seriously.

1480
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,210
- You succeeded.
- You finally contributed.

1481
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,850
- The air mattress did all the work.
- Seriously.

1482
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,600
Was my face visible?
Was my face visible?

1483
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,910
This is exhausting.

1484
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,020
It was incredible.

1485
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,290
- Let's go.
- This is good.

1486
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,620
- You will get it, right?
- He will kick it.

1487
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,690
- Hey!
- Out! Okay.

1488
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,850
(Haha makes a mistake
as soon as he starts playing.)

1489
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,290
(Dejected)

1490
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,060
- Haha, focus.
- Switch me out.

1491
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,060
- You should have used your leg.
- I can't do it.

1492
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,100
The floor is slippery. Sit here.

1493
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,600
Okay.

1494
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,940
That's good.

1495
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,060
(Jong Kook serves nicely.)

1496
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,270
That's beautiful.

1497
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,960
(What?)

1498
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,440
(He used his shoulder in haste.)

1499
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,770
For goodness' sake.

1500
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,540
- Why did you do the shoulder dance?
- What?

1501
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,680
<i>Until when will you make me do
the shoulder dance?</i>

1502
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,870
We are a dance club.

1503
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,290
This won't do.

1504
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,640
Did Jae Suk get kicked out
after one try?

1505
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,350
Did Jae Suk get kicked out
after using his shoulder?

1506
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,460
- Good.
- Good. Nice serve!

1507
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,600
It's beautiful.

1508
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,230
- You are out.
- You are out.

1509
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,270
- You are out.
- How strange!

1510
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,660
We don't want you in his stead.

1511
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,960
We will play on our own.

1512
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,230
(The three of us will play
on our own.)

1513
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,370
- Move.
- That's hilarious.

1514
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,770
- Play.
- Sae Rok, play.

1515
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:06,940
(Team Unmarried
is just 1 point behind.)

1516
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,210
- Let's win!
- Mine.

1517
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:09,980
Kwang Soo, get ready.

1518
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,180
Move out of the way.

1519
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,040
(My goodness!)

1520
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,540
(Floundering)

1521
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:21,190
- What?
- Did you use your leg?

1522
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,250
That was an acrobatic move.

1523
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,830
- He was like Ronaldinho.
- He was like a pigeon.

1524
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:26,020
- Jong Kook.
- What was that?

1525
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,560
- I am sorry.
- He was like Son Yeon Jae.

1526
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,390
(Team Married serves.)

1527
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,560
- Mine.
- No, no.

1528
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,060
Kwang Soo.

1529
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,660
- Nice!
- Good job.

1530
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,790
(Han Na's high-quality attack)

1531
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,040
Okay!

1532
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,770
(Sae Rok receives the ball,
but it hits the net.)

1533
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,410
- Han Na.
- Han Na, you are good.

1534
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,140
- You are doing all the work.
- Han Na, you are good.

1535
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,270
Sae Rok.

1536
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,770
Getting it over the net
isn't the only option. You can pass.

1537
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:50,310
I will pass it to you.

1538
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,480
That's volleyball.

1539
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,250
(That's volleyball.)

1540
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,790
Hold on. Suk Jin,
we aren't playing volleyball.

1541
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,160
- Explain yourself.
- Hey.

1542
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,750
Did you hear him? "Sae Rok."

1543
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,460
"You can pass. That's volleyball."

1544
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,430
"That's volleyball."

1545
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,620
That's a volleyball rule.
Didn't you know?

1546
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,190
Foot volleyball follows
the volleyball rules.

1547
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,330
Don't try so hard to get it
over the net. You can pass.

1548
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:13,310
- Yes, Sir.
- "That's volleyball."

1549
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,040
- Let's begin.
- Let's go!

1550
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,410
(This attack could be crucial.)

1551
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,710
- Do you want to serve?
- Shall I do it?

1552
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:22,020
(He wants to serve
and receive the spotlight.)

1553
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,120
Let's go!

1554
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,890
He is so greedy.

1555
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,310
(The icon of petty greed
serves with greed.)

1556
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,580
All right.

1557
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,560
- He should have moved back.
- Okay!

1558
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,750
- My goodness.
- Okay.

1559
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,190
- Kwang Soo, use your head.
- Kwang Soo.

1560
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,430
- Come on!
- Han Na!

1561
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,890
- There you go!
- That's it!

1562
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,190
That's it!

1563
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,290
(What?)

1564
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,730
- There you go!
- That's it!

1565
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:42,270
(Suk Jin receives the ball
with his hand.)

1566
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:46,140
You aren't playing volleyball!

1567
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,960
This isn't volleyball!

1568
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,080
I did it without thinking.

1569
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:52,250
Why did you use your hand?

1570
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,850
I was in a hurry.

1571
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,940
(He gets switched out
after a foul play.)

1572
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,620
- We will win a point this time.
- Okay.

1573
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,120
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1574
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,520
Here I go.

1575
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,120
(Both teams have 3 points left.)

1576
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,980
- Okay. Han Na.
- Han Na.

1577
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,190
- Go slow.
- Han Na, hit it!

1578
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,460
- There you go!
- Let's go!

1579
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,890
- Come on.
- That was good.

1580
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:08,960
Hold on.

1581
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,850
(So Min blocks the ball!)

1582
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,620
- Nice!
- What was that?

1583
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,230
- Out.
- That was good.

1584
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:17,270
So Min, hold it up!

1585
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,410
(She holds up the air mattress
and blocks the ball.)

1586
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,410
- There you go!
- Nice!

1587
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,410
(They are leading the game now!)

1588
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,770
- I am sorry. I didn't expect that.
- It's okay.

1589
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,940
- I was thinking.
- It's okay.

1590
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,350
- You got this!
- What did I tell you?

1591
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:30,680
- That's it!
- Hey!

1592
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,290
That's how you play!

1593
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,810
- You were so cool.
- Seriously.

1594
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:35,060
You were so cool.

1595
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,560
- Good job.
- You were so cool.

1596
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,690
If we lose...

1597
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,480
- Three men should play.
- Let's do that.

1598
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:41,690
And...

1599
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:42,690
(They get three men on the court...)

1600
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,020
(and get Ju Young's tray.)

1601
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,500
Hold on.
Jae Suk, what are you doing?

1602
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,270
- What do you mean?
- What are you doing?

1603
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,540
- There are three men.
- Hold on.

1604
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,190
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

1605
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,560
- I can use this, right?
- What?

1606
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,410
Are you going to use the giant hand?

1607
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,810
Suk Jin, you told Sae Rok
about 30 minutes ago...

1608
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,370
that you will make her a star.
Then you stole her giant hand.

1609
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,980
- It's okay.
- You said you will make her a star.

1610
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,290
He meant she'll leave this field.

1611
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,080
- Is that what he meant?
- You got a lot of solo shots.

1612
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,960
You drew enough attention.
It's fine.

1613
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,960
(He wants attention, so making her
a star is not his priority.)

1614
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,430
- I'm going to take off my jacket.
- What? You getting serious?

1615
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,120
- Are you taking your jacket off?
- I'll show you.

1616
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,330
I'll show you
my foot volleyball skills.

1617
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,230
You're going to catch a cold.
Put it back on.

1618
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:23,440
- You got it? Okay.
- Okay.

1619
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,830
Let's get started.

1620
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,500
What's this?

1621
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,230
- Give me a minute.
- So Min, stand up!

1622
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,000
- Hold it up.
- Hold it.

1623
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,210
- Block it.
- The Great Wall.

1624
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:33,180
- Hold it up.
- Hold it.

1625
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,270
(It's Jae Suk's turn to attack.)

1626
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,410
(Hitting)

1627
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,690
(He attacks his own face.)

1628
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,350
What was that?

1629
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,190
Is that what you wanted to show us?

1630
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,930
- Is that it?
- Was that comedy?

1631
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,290
- This...
- What was that?

1632
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,600
- That wasn't funny.
- You know it was a foul, right?

1633
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,120
They made a foul before that.
So Min touched the net, right?

1634
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,870
Jae Suk, your face is red.
Are you all right?

1635
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,060
I'm okay.

1636
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,540
All right. Let's go.

1637
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,540
- So Min is good.
- This is match point.

1638
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,580
Match point.

1639
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,000
One point left.

1640
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,640
- Don't worry.
- Good luck.

1641
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,140
So Min, hold it up.

1642
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,210
The Great Wall.

1643
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,410
(Jae Suk kicks it toward
So Min's inflatable tube.)

1644
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,790
- So Min, hold it up.
- The Great Wall.

1645
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,990
- Nice!
- The Great Wall.

1646
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,060
(She got used to it.)

1647
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,540
- So Min.
- She's good.

1648
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,740
Chorong, get ready.

1649
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,330
- Chorong.
- Excuse me!

1650
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,640
Chorong!

1651
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,700
(She hit it kind of hard.
What's he doing?)

1652
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,720
It's out.

1653
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,620
(Did it hit his hand then go out?)

1654
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,010
It's out.

1655
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,540
Good one, So Min.
That was the right timing.

1656
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,810
(He sounded awkward.)

1657
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,060
It's out.

1658
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,830
- Didn't you touch it?
- No.

1659
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,450
- This is not volleyball.
- Be quiet.

1660
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:52,830
- Wait. Didn't you touch it?
- Be quiet.

1661
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,720
- Be quiet.
- The ball bounced off.

1662
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,790
Be quiet.

1663
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,260
- They don't know.
- Let's get started.

1664
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,430
- We need one more.
- Okay.

1665
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,140
- So Min.
- Slow down. Use your head.

1666
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,310
- Oh, gosh.
- Get up, So Min.

1667
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,040
(Kwang Soo received it
with his face.)

1668
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,700
Get up, So Min.

1669
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,120
- Leave it.
- All right.

1670
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,280
- Get up.
- Leave it.

1671
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,720
(That was close, but it went out.)

1672
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,410
- All right.
- Out. It went out.

1673
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:18,410
- That was in.
- In!

1674
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,910
- It went out.
- In!

1675
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:20,930
It wasn't in.

1676
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:24,660
It came in this direction
and went out completely.

1677
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,850
- No.
- It went out.

1678
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,600
- Doesn't it have to be on the line?
- Excuse me.

1679
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,470
If you admit that it was out,
I'll give you another chance.

1680
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,490
- It went out.
- Okay.

1681
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,010
(That took 0.5 seconds.)

1682
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,310
One more chance.

1683
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,660
Excellent.

1684
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,310
- It went out completely.
- Then?

1685
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,780
- It went out.
- Good.

1686
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,780
This is better than a tricky call.
All right.

1687
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,410
- That went out completely.
- Good luck.

1688
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,410
- Okay!
- Okay!

1689
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:45,850
Hey, Han Na.

1690
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,140
Stand up, So Min.

1691
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,680
(Han Na's shot is successful.)

1692
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,260
- Good job, Han Na.
- Stand up.

1693
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,490
- Good job. Here.
- Stand up!

1694
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,830
- I kept it alive.
- Stand up!

1695
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,330
(Will it be Suk Jin's foot,
a spear that can't pierce anything?)

1696
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:59,350
(Or will it be So Min's inflatable,
a shield that can't block anything?)

1697
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,600
Stand up! Okay!

1698
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,120
(Team Married loses 15 to 13.)

1699
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,600
- No.
- Did we win?

1700
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,870
(That was a long and dirty match.)

1701
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,140
Did we win?

1702
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,700
That didn't work.

1703
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,680
- Good game.
- Good job.

1704
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,180
- We almost had it.
- That was close.

1705
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,950
Let's think about something good.

1706
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,370
- We warmed up too late.
- You need 1st and 2nd place.

1707
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:21,390
That's true.

1708
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:22,510
Everybody will do
rock-paper-scissors.

1709
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,390
- Everybody?
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1710
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,620
(Jong Kook and Se Chan win.)

1711
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,990
- Okay, us 2.
- Us 2.

1712
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,330
They're 1st and 2nd place.

1713
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:31,930
- 1st and 2nd place.
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1714
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,830
- We won.
- Okay!

1715
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:34,990
We're first place.

1716
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,470
Good job.

1717
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:38,640
- It's okay.
- We're second.

1718
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,910
Then, let's have
the first-place couple come up.

1719
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,010
Okay.

1720
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,100
- First place.
- Let's keep this up.

1721
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,910
We won regardless.

1722
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,600
Oh, dear.

1723
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,970
You can pick one couple.

1724
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:55,410
For example, I'll say they have
1 element card and 1 special card.

1725
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,990
Are special cards prizes?

1726
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,510
We won't know? I see.

1727
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:01,850
I see.

1728
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,560
When Kwang Soo lost
rock-paper-scissors,

1729
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,850
he didn't look too happy.

1730
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,600
We shouldn't pick his team.

1731
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,560
- A different team?
- We get to find out.

1732
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,260
- He'll tell us.
- For all teams?

1733
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,830
No, one team.

1734
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,240
- Han Na.
- My bad.

1735
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,510
- Look at the mountains.
- I exercised too much.

1736
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,740
- Stare at it for a minute.
- I'm not in my right mind.

1737
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,010
Look far away. Can you see?

1738
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,100
- My head cleared up a bit.
- I see. Let's try that again.

1739
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,310
(My head cleared up a bit.)

1740
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,970
- Let's try that again.
- Let's go.

1741
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,040
- I'll try again.
- Okay.

1742
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,970
- Then...
- One team.

1743
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,410
let's pick a team
that looks the happiest.

1744
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,720
Which one's that?

1745
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,120
- So Min. She's at ease.
- So Min?

1746
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,720
- Should we ask for hers?
- Yes.

1747
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,850
Se Chan and So Min have...

1748
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:40,220
1 element card and 1 special card.

1749
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,390
(They have "water"
and a penalty card.)

1750
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,700
We don't know if that's a prize.

1751
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,970
We can take our chance.

1752
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,430
- Should we try?
- I don't care.

1753
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,310
Then let's switch
Jong Kook's card...

1754
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:56,680
(In the beginning, their draw...)

1755
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,580
(had neither a prize
nor a penalty card.)

1756
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:05,680
(If they switch with So Min,
they'll get a penalty card.)

1757
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,680
Se Chan's.

1758
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,930
Jong Kook and Se Chan will
switch their cards.

1759
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,060
With yours?

1760
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,390
Let's switch. Come this way.

1761
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,890
Is that good?
So Min, this is going very well.

1762
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:19,200
- Right?
- This is excellent.

1763
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,060
- Let's go.
- This is what we want.

1764
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,510
Okay.

1765
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,240
It wasn't a prize card.

1766
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,200
(They're disappointed
it's not a prize card.)

1767
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,140
We have this.

1768
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,740
You can ask about anybody
besides the first-place team.

1769
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,970
Kwang Soo doesn't have it.

1770
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:35,010
- Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo's team.

1771
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,290
Kwang Soo and Chorong have...

1772
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:40,890
two special cards.

1773
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,600
(Kwang Soo and Chorong have
2 special cards.)

1774
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:50,120
(There are 2 prize cards
and 2 penalty cards.)

1775
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,760
(So Min has 1 penalty card,)

1776
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,410
(and Jae Suk has the other.)

1777
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,810
(Since Kwang Soo's team has
2 special cards,)

1778
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,620
(that means they have 1 prize card
and 1 penalty card.)

1779
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:05,850
(But they don't know that.)

1780
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,240
- Which special cards?
- You don't know.

1781
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,220
- But there are two prize cards.
- I think it's a prize.

1782
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,180
We have one penalty card.

1783
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:13,220
Let's switch yours.

1784
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,330
- For Chorong's? Kwang Soo's?
- Chorong.

1785
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:15,330
- No.
- Chorong?

1786
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,330
Chorong.

1787
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,260
(They pick Chorong's card.)

1788
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,760
- Chorong's.
- With So Min's.

1789
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,970
With mine.

1790
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,600
Se Chan and So Min will
switch So Min's card for Chorong's.

1791
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,100
Please switch.

1792
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,200
(They smile mysteriously.)

1793
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,370
Come here, Chorong.

1794
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,310
What is it?

1795
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,510
- Let's do it privately.
- Privately.

1796
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,240
- So Min had a penalty card.
- Come here.

1797
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,310
- What a relief.
- I know.

1798
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,040
So Min, don't let it show.

1799
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,080
(So Min switches her penalty card
with Chorong's card.)

1800
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,220
(Is Chorong's card...)

1801
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,310
(a prize or penalty card?)

1802
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:44,910
(Swallowing)

1803
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,930
Gosh.

1804
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:49,330
(They chuckle
after seeing the card.)

1805
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,990
- So Min.
- Did you switch?

1806
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:53,790
- Hey, it's a penalty card.
- Let me see.

1807
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,470
It's a penalty card.

1808
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,370
- Let's see.
- It's a penalty card.

1809
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:59,660
- We got another penalty card.
- Really?

1810
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,200
(Kwang Soo and Chorong had
1 prize card and 1 penalty card.)

1811
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,240
(Chorong's was the penalty card.)

1812
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,200
(She gave up her penalty card
and got somebody else's.)

1813
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,370
(They still have a penalty card,
so they might get the penalty.)

1814
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,390
Something doesn't look right.

1815
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,990
So round one is over.

1816
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,850
Let's get going for round two.

1817
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,580
Yes!

1818
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,330
That was too bad.

1819
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,430
(Card Distribution)

1820
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,450
- Good job.
- I was looking forward to it.

1821
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,100
(Card Distribution)

1822
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,970
This is a perfect day
to stay home and lie in bed.

1823
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:31,990
I know.

1824
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:33,660
I want a car date.

1825
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,310
It's really nice on a rainy day.
With music on.

1826
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,810
- What do you do?
- I drink rice wine at home.

1827
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,310
Rice wine?

1828
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:44,510
- That sounds good.
- What do you do, Chorong?

1829
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:47,740
I stay at home like any other day.

1830
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,010
"Like any other day".

1831
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,390
I stay at home...

1832
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:53,490
(She has no energy.)

1833
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,790
We were all happy
before you said that.

1834
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:58,100
- What do you do at home?
- What do you do?

1835
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,290
Do you live by yourself, Ju Young?

1836
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:00,390
- No.
- Then?

1837
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:02,700
I live with my grandma,

1838
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,640
dad,

1839
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,470
sister and her husband.

1840
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,870
- Really?
- You have a huge family.

1841
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:08,910
Really?

1842
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,100
- It's a two-story house.
- It's a two-story house?

1843
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,680
- Is it a cool house?
- "A cool house"?

1844
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,700
(It's a two-story house?
Is it a cool house?)

1845
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,910
"A cool house"?

1846
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,580
My dream is to live
in a two-story house.

1847
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,950
- That wasn't appropriate.
- What was that?

1848
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,740
- What's cool and uncool?
- It's old.

1849
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:25,060
This is the second mission
where you can switch your cards.

1850
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,120
(Second mission to switch cards)

1851
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,260
It's Speed Initial Game.

1852
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,030
One couple will play at a time.

1853
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,930
The first person listens
to the initials...

1854
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:36,490
and says a two-syllable word
that is not a repeat.

1855
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:39,390
The next person takes the syllables,

1856
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:42,600
flips it around,
and says a two-syllable word.

1857
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,510
For example, if I say "Ghana,"
Kwang Soo can say, "poverty."

1858
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:48,240
Then Chorong has to flip
the initials around.

1859
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,140
1st and 2nd place couples...

1860
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,410
- can switch their cards.
- Okay.

1861
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,580
It's only 1st and 2nd place.

1862
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,850
Which couple shall we start with?

1863
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,140
Should we go first?

1864
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,140
(Should we go first?)

1865
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,160
What's up with you today?

1866
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,510
Nothing.

1867
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:02,160
We usually start from the back.

1868
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,260
- "Should we go first?"
- He's so ambitious today.

1869
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,290
They're the only real couple here.

1870
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,720
- That's not true.
- Real.

1871
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,990
- We're going to start.
- Power!

1872
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,100
Let's get started.
Speed Initial Game.

1873
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,430
- Start.
- Start.

1874
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:16,540
Pyeongchang.

1875
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:17,970
Pingchang.

1876
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,200
(Pingchang?)

1877
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,240
(What on earth is that?)

1878
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,540
You could have gone with "Award."

1879
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,280
- "Award".
- "Pingchang"!

1880
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,040
What on earth is "Pingchang"?

1881
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,680
- What on earth is "Pingchang"?
- I am sorry.

1882
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:30,010
This is an easy game.

1883
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:31,620
Since he went first,
we will give him another chance.

1884
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,490
Speed Initial Game!

1885
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,680
- Start.
- Start.

1886
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,790
Student.

1887
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,030
Plea.

1888
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,430
(Correct)

1889
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,700
(Now, Se Chan needs to say
a word...)

1890
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,120
(that starts with shiot and hieut
in Korean.)

1891
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,140
Primary school.

1892
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,160
(He got the right initials.)

1893
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,510
- You are right.
- What's the meaning?

1894
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,430
(It's a sudden question.)

1895
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,100
- What's the meaning?
- It's like small happiness.

1896
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,350
No.

1897
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:56,780
(It's like small happiness.)

1898
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,620
- The spelling is different.
- That is spelled differently.

1899
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,850
Don't you know the word?

1900
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,010
Primary school.

1901
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,260
You lost your chance. It's over.

1902
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,950
- The next couple.
- We will go next.

1903
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,720
- Suk Jin, this isn't easy.
- Do you want to go first?

1904
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:11,890
You need to succeed first, okay?

1905
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,220
Speed Initial Game!

1906
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,370
- Start.
- Start.

1907
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:16,430
Name.

1908
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,330
Iran.

1909
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,600
(He needs to say a word
that starts with rieul and ieung.)

1910
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,700
Luna.

1911
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,870
(The initials are wrong.)

1912
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,080
Ieung!

1913
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,780
It's an Ieung!

1914
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,600
- This is too hard.
- Suk Jin,

1915
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,470
exactly how will you make
Sae Rok a star?

1916
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:36,310
(From the way you are acting,
it seems impossible.)

1917
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,810
You need to make her stand out.

1918
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,410
You already placed fourth
on the top keywords search list.

1919
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:41,850
(I am sure you didn't know.)

1920
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,530
You already placed fourth.

1921
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:45,600
- Are you sure?
- Yes, you placed fourth.

1922
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,930
- Because she is good at the game?
- That's right.

1923
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,490
When you are next to me,
you appear to be good at the game.

1924
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:50,060
She became popular that way.

1925
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,390
When you are next to me,
you appear to be good at the game.

1926
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:54,330
Han Na has always been good
at games.

1927
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,600
Had you not been Suk Jin's partner,
you would have placed second.

1928
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,310
You are stuck in fourth place.

1929
01:02:58,310 --> 01:02:59,700
(She moved down two places
because of Suk Jin's wrong answer.)

1930
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,810
Let's resume.

1931
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,470
Speed Initial Game!

1932
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,700
- Start.
- Start.

1933
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:05,680
Socks.

1934
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:07,120
Oma.

1935
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,510
- What's "Oma"?
- "Oma"?

1936
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,720
Countryside.

1937
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,160
Nongpang!

1938
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,180
Graduation.

1939
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,580
- Haha.
- What? It's your turn!

1940
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,350
Scholar.

1941
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,890
Defense.

1942
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:20,950
Secretary.

1943
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:21,990
You succeeded.

1944
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:24,290
(Jae Suk and Ju Young place 1st
and Haha and Ji Hyo place 2nd.)

1945
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:26,100
- Haha!
- We did it!

1946
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,470
- We did it!
- This is incredible.

1947
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:29,010
First place.

1948
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,580
First place, come on up.

1949
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,640
It's us.

1950
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:34,280
I can't believe
Jae Suk placed first.

1951
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,780
I placed first too.

1952
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,970
(Jae Suk and Ju Young start
to switch cards.)

1953
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:39,180
Let's watch their reactions
and decide.

1954
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:41,140
(With the current cards,
they can win the beef bulgogi set.)

1955
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:43,350
We want to check
Sae Rok and Suk Jin's cards.

1956
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,390
Suk Jin and Sae Rok.

1957
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:46,720
(They check
Sae Rok and Suk Jin's cards.)

1958
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:47,930
This is bad.

1959
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:49,760
Both of them have an element card.

1960
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,790
(Both of them have an element card.)

1961
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,530
(Suk Jin and Sae Rok have
2 unknown element cards.)

1962
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,060
Would you like to switch cards?

1963
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,560
(If they switch an element card,
their prize will change.)

1964
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,870
Let's switch cards.
Let's switch your card with theirs.

1965
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,140
I will switch my card.

1966
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,810
(They currently qualify
for the beef bulgogi set.)

1967
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:04,410
I want Sae Rok's card.

1968
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:08,140
Ju Young will switch her card
with Sae Rok's.

1969
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,600
- Sae Rok's card.
- Sae Rok's card.

1970
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,470
Ju Young and Sae Rok
will switch cards.

1971
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:13,850
Ju Young will switch her card
with Sae Rok's.

1972
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,410
(Sae Rok's card could change
the couple's prize.)

1973
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:17,740
(Sae Rok's card is...)

1974
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:20,910
(tree.)

1975
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,580
Sae Rok, you can do back.

1976
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,430
Ju Young, check the card
with Jae Suk.

1977
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,720
Sae Rok doesn't look happy.

1978
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:27,490
Come here.

1979
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,830
(I can't believe
the prize became the bamboo wife.)

1980
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:30,370
(Suk Jin and Sae Rok still have
2 element cards.)

1981
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,830
- It's not too bad.
- I know.

1982
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:35,930
We want to check
Team Jong Kook's cards.

1983
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:37,600
- Right?
- Yes.

1984
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,470
Jong Kook and Han Na have...

1985
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,370
two element cards.

1986
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:43,700
They don't have a special card.

1987
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,720
(Sighing)

1988
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:51,390
(Since Ji Hyo and Haha have
2 element cards,)

1989
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:53,390
We should have picked
a different team.

1990
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:56,120
(switching cards with Jong Kook
and Han Na would be meaningless.)

1991
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,330
Let's take a wild guess.

1992
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,160
We will take a wild guess.

1993
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,120
(We will take a wild guess.)

1994
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,970
Chorong. Chorong.

1995
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,030
Chorong?

1996
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,760
Should I switch my card with hers?

1997
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,970
(Will he switch his card
with Chorong's?)

1998
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,540
(So Min switched her bad card
with Chorong's,)

1999
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:14,970
(but they didn't see it.)

2000
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,870
Ji Hyo will switch her card
with Chorong's.

2001
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:22,180
I guess Chorong has a nice card.

2002
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:25,310
(Didn't So Min give her a bad card?)

2003
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,720
(Laughing)

2004
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,850
Really?

2005
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,560
I think he is acting.

2006
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,430
Kwang Soo can't control his face.

2007
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,950
Kwang Soo, you look happy.

2008
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:35,200
- Of course not.
- Is he happy?

2009
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,260
I am not happy.

2010
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:37,390
He looks awkward.

2011
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:38,540
He looks awkward.
I can tell that he is happy.

2012
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:39,930
- He looks so happy.
- He is happy.

2013
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:42,600
(Let's see.)

2014
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,540
Is it good?

2015
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,780
Chorong is happy.

2016
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,040
(They lose an element card
and get a penalty card.)

2017
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,280
- She is overjoyed.
- Why did they pick us?

2018
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,280
(He scans the prizes.)

2019
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,140
Kwang Soo,
your gaze stayed on the top.

2020
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,120
You checked out the prizes, right?

2021
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,490
- I got you.
- Kwang Soo is overjoyed.

2022
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,040
Chorong looks happy.

2023
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,390
(Haha and Ji Hyo's sacrifice
shines.)

2024
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,560
(The second switch ends.)

2025
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:03,620
The last mission that will give you
a chance to switch cards is...

2026
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,660
I Can See Your Movements.

2027
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:06,720
(The last mission,
I Can See Your Movements)

2028
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,990
I Can See Your Movements.

2029
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:10,930
Two couples will compete
in each round of the tournament.

2030
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:11,930
It's a tournament.

2031
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,240
The offense and defense will stand
with a wall in the middle.

2032
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,600
The defense will freely lay
16 pads...

2033
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,370
of four different colors,
red, blue, yellow, and green.

2034
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,580
Without a visual on the defense,
the offense...

2035
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,140
will pick four colors in turn.

2036
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,580
The members on the defense
need to touch...

2037
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,870
the corresponding pads
without collapsing.

2038
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,220
Once you touch a pad,
you can't switch to a different one.

2039
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:33,390
The members on defense
must start out from the same pad.

2040
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,350
(The members of the defense
must start out from the same pad.)

2041
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,330
Kwang Soo has an advantage
since he is tall.

2042
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:38,530
I am jealous.

2043
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,970
The offense will throw
three water balloons over the wall.

2044
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:43,720
If they hit a member,
they win a point.

2045
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,700
The team with the highest score
will win.

2046
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:48,010
- I see.
- It sounds scary.

2047
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:50,760
If the water balloon doesn't burst,
it doesn't count.

2048
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,540
- Okay.
- It needs to burst.

2049
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,680
We can catch it, right?

2050
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,180
You be touching the pads,
so it will be hard.

2051
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,140
You won't be able to catch it
when your hands are on the pads.

2052
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,540
Suk Jin doesn't understand
how the game works.

2053
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,890
Do you understand? Do you?

2054
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,080
Yes, I do.

2055
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:06,490
Now, it's time to check
which team you will go against.

2056
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,390
- This is important.
- This is important.

2057
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,350
Let's see.

2058
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:13,260
(The list of matches)

2059
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,970
- Let's go first.
- Shall we do that?

2060
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:16,530
All right.

2061
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:18,240
- Okay.
- We will be the defense first.

2062
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,490
Okay. Let's go to the other side.

2063
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,930
They are bound to be at the center.

2064
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,640
- Do we start now?
- Do what you want to do.

2065
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,640
(It's time to lay the pads
as they want.)

2066
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,040
I will do it. What do you want?
This one?

2067
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,100
Yes. The red one.

2068
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:31,580
It sticks because of the water.

2069
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,140
- Here.
- This one?

2070
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,310
(They listen to them.)

2071
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:36,080
It shouldn't be
at the corner, right?

2072
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:38,080
- Shall we do this?
- Which one?

2073
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,410
- These two? Okay.
- Yes.

2074
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,350
- Okay.
- Now...

2075
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,580
How about this one?

2076
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,330
- Like this?
- They look good together.

2077
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:47,830
- You are right.
- Right?

2078
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:48,930
They look very good together.

2079
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,200
- They look like a couple.
- Seriously.

2080
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:52,890
Han Na, in which year were you born?

2081
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:54,540
- 1989.
- 1989?

2082
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:56,510
- Were you born in 1989?
- Okay. She passes.

2083
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:57,870
What? I pass?

2084
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:58,930
Okay. She passes.

2085
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:00,700
(There he goes again.)

2086
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,310
I acknowledge her
as my sister-in-law.

2087
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:05,680
There are like 30 girls
he calls "Sister-in-law."

2088
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,180
(Haha and 30 sisters-in-law)

2089
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,040
- There are like 30 girls.
- 30 sisters-in-law.

2090
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,760
- Like this? Is this perfect?
- I think it's perfect.

2091
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,890
(They finish placing the mats
under Han Na's directions.)

2092
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:20,060
- Let's begin.
- Okay. Let's go.

2093
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,890
Say the first color.

2094
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:23,700
Red.

2095
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,370
- Red?
- Red.

2096
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:27,370
- It should be this one, right?
- Yes.

2097
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,970
(They start from the same pad!)

2098
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,450
You are the worst at this.

2099
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,710
You are the worst at this. Stop.

2100
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,620
We will say the next color.

2101
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,380
Red.

2102
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,840
Red, red.

2103
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,460
It's not too bad.

2104
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,310
(Each one of them needs to pick
from the 3 remaining red pads.)

2105
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:48,420
Hold on. Hold on.

2106
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,550
She picked.

2107
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,750
(She picks a pad.)

2108
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,960
No take-backs.

2109
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,090
Let's keep going.

2110
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,460
- No, no.
- Hold on.

2111
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,590
My goodness.

2112
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:00,700
(Jong Kook chooses a red pad.)

2113
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,260
(A forced onscreen relationship
isn't complete...)

2114
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,240
Give him a back hug!

2115
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,300
(without the audience's reaction.)

2116
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,880
You look good!

2117
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:09,300
- What's the next color?
- Blue.

2118
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:11,380
- What?
- Blue.

2119
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,510
- Blue.
- Yes.

2120
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:13,710
(Han Na touches the pad.)

2121
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:18,960
- Okay.
- Here comes the last one.

2122
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,310
- Blue.
- Blue.

2123
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:21,920
My goodness.

2124
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:23,850
How will they do it?

2125
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,630
- How will they do it?
- What will they do?

2126
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:26,830
(Is this possible?)

2127
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,500
(It's relatively easy for Han Na.)

2128
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,800
You can't switch hands.

2129
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:31,870
- What?
- You can't switch hands.

2130
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,540
This hand needs to go there.

2131
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:35,000
Jong Kook, hold on.

2132
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,430
Should I pull out this hand?
How will it go there?

2133
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,540
It's the only way.

2134
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,250
Maybe I need to break this arm.

2135
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,470
- How will you do this?
- What should we do?

2136
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:45,620
It hurts.

2137
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,970
- Still...
- Try it. I think it will work.

2138
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,880
- Move this foot a bit.
- Hold on. I will try it.

2139
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,120
Move this foot a bit more.

2140
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,290
Will it work?

2141
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:56,030
(Will it work?)

2142
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:58,390
- I will do this.
- It's touching the red pad.

2143
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:59,720
All right.

2144
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,830
(He moved his foot a little.)

2145
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:01,920
Will it work?

2146
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,700
(He moved his foot a little.)

2147
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,460
(He touches the blue pad!)

2148
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:10,500
(In 2020, Jong Kook has
flexibility as well.)

2149
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,040
They are making a cross!

2150
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,210
- They look good together.
- There you go!

2151
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,710
- Cross!
- Cross!

2152
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:16,910
You are doing great.

2153
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,380
Is this the power of love?

2154
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:21,210
- I will throw a balloon now.
- Okay.

2155
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:23,510
(Jae Suk attacks first
with a water balloon!)

2156
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:28,330
(Will Jae Suk's water balloon...)

2157
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:32,500
(hit the cross of love?)

2158
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,720
(What will happen?)

2159
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:40,740
(It hits Han Na.)

2160
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:45,410
(It hits Han Na on the back.)

2161
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,140
I guess it hit someone.

2162
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,950
- Did it hit someone?
- Did it hit someone?

2163
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:54,470
- That was incredible.
- One water balloon.

2164
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,050
That was incredible.

2165
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,550
Here comes the second one.

2166
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,250
(Here comes
the second water balloon!)

2167
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:07,630
(It hits Han Na again!)

2168
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,330
(Han Na got hit twice in a row.)

2169
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:11,700
Oh, my goodness.

2170
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,910
You have to throw it far.

2171
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:18,380
(She's soaked.)

2172
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,540
They already got the penalty.

2173
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,250
Next. This is the last one.

2174
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,500
My hands are about to slip.

2175
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:27,670
(This is the last water balloon!)

2176
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:33,420
(It floats like a butterfly
and stings Han Na like a bee.)

2177
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:35,590
Please draw the curtains.

2178
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:38,800
Jong Kook didn't get a drop on him.

2179
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,590
When we talk, they can hear us.

2180
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:41,890
- Did you get hit?
- Han Na got it all.

2181
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:43,920
- She got it all.
- That's so much.

2182
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,800
I thought somebody had punched
the back of my neck.

2183
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,300
The back of my neck.

2184
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,630
I didn't know what it was.

2185
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:50,870
You earned three points.

2186
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,280
(Jae Suk and Ju Young earn
3 points.)

2187
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,840
He was precise.

2188
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,100
Exactly.

2189
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,640
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

2190
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,670
(Jong Kook and Han Na earn 1 point.)

2191
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:01,140
You earned one point.
Jae Suk advances.

2192
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,010
(Jae Suk and Ju Young's team won.)

2193
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:04,210
I got them.

2194
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:05,660
I got them.

2195
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,420
(Suk Jin and Sae Rok won next.)

2196
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:08,530
(Ji Hyo and Haha also won.)

2197
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:09,630
We won.

2198
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:11,700
That was no joke.

2199
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:14,130
Jae Suk, Suk Jin,
and Haha's teams won,

2200
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,370
so this is the final match
to decide 1st and 2nd place.

2201
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,090
Rules don't change.

2202
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:20,260
One person from each team
will attack...

2203
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:21,460
and the other person will defend.

2204
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,760
If you throw the water balloon
at your teammate,

2205
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,300
- you lose two points.
- Okay.

2206
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,780
We have to be good.

2207
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,300
- This is the real game.
- We'll be good.

2208
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,000
- Good luck.
- Ju Young.

2209
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,470
Play well.

2210
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:33,780
First color.

2211
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,420
Let's start with yellow.

2212
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:37,140
(First color is yellow.)

2213
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,140
(They start on different squares.)

2214
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,010
- I pick blue.
- Blue.

2215
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,090
(Second color is blue.)

2216
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,460
Yellow and blue.

2217
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,550
Suk Jin is next.

2218
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:46,130
I'll pick green.

2219
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,420
(Suk Jin picks green.)

2220
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,960
Here's the last one. Yellow.

2221
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,090
(Last one is yellow.)

2222
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:53,590
(I'm going for this one.)

2223
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:56,540
(Ji Hyo got there first.)

2224
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,710
(She has to go for the one behind.)

2225
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,500
- Can't I do this?
- You can.

2226
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,750
- Who was that?
- That was Sae Rok.

2227
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,170
Are you good to go?

2228
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:06,780
We're going to throw it.

2229
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,710
Sae Rok, I'll avoid you.

2230
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,050
If I hit you, it's minus two points.
I have to do well.

2231
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,310
Go.

2232
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,830
(Sae Rok, we'll win the game,)

2233
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:20,300
(and I'll turn you into a star.)

2234
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:21,800
I hit somebody.

2235
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,930
(Suk Jin's water balloon
got somebody.)

2236
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:27,300
(What now?)

2237
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,710
- I hit somebody.
- Wasn't that Sae Rok?

2238
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,240
- Wasn't that Sae Rok's voice?
- Sae Rok.

2239
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:33,780
- Was it Sae Rok?
- Sae Rok.

2240
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,670
(A moment ago)

2241
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:38,340
(He said
he wouldn't throw it at her.)

2242
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:41,210
(He got Sae Rok on the dot.)

2243
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,490
I hit somebody.

2244
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:45,090
(Shaking)

2245
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:46,210
I hit somebody.

2246
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:48,880
(She's speechless.)

2247
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:50,590
- That was her voice.
- Really?

2248
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:52,350
- Sae Rok.
- Next is Haha.

2249
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:53,750
- Me.
- I'm in big trouble.

2250
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:55,420
You went for the center.

2251
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:57,260
That was the cry of a pterosaur.

2252
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,930
That was Sae Rok's voice.

2253
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,090
- That could have been Ji Hyo.
- I'm going.

2254
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:02,930
We pointed her out.

2255
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,170
It's far.

2256
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:07,000
(Where will Haha's balloon go?)

2257
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,640
(2nd hit)

2258
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:16,010
(She let out a single cry.)

2259
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:19,210
- She's right in the front.
- Who is it?

2260
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:20,880
This is...

2261
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,680
Are you all right?

2262
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,300
Let's just exclude her.

2263
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,000
Please get her a white towel.

2264
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:29,830
Sae Rok, it's not you, right?

2265
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:31,200
- Sae Rok.
- Hold on.

2266
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,500
I'm next.

2267
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,170
- She's up close.
- Right in front.

2268
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:38,670
(As they thought.)

2269
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,210
(Crying)

2270
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,140
(It's an echo of the cry
they just heard.)

2271
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,280
Sae Rok, tell me it's not you.

2272
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,750
It's not you, right?

2273
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:50,380
Oh, my goodness.

2274
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:52,290
Sae Rok.

2275
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:55,960
Sae Rok, it's not you, right?

2276
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,180
- Sae Rok. Sae Rok.
- I'm going.

2277
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:00,350
Sae Rok, I'm going.

2278
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,460
(At this point)

2279
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,460
Let's become a star.

2280
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:07,000
(Take this and become a star.
I'll turn you into one.)

2281
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:09,000
- Oh, my goodness.
- It didn't hit her.

2282
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,340
Let's become a star.

2283
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:13,210
(All the other water balloons
popped.)

2284
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,710
He can't even make this work.

2285
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,500
Jong Kook.

2286
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,920
It didn't hit her.
She's right up close.

2287
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,310
I'm going.

2288
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,160
(He easily hits the target.)

2289
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,050
(Groaning)

2290
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:29,220
(She lets out a shriek
from deep in her throat.)

2291
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,460
Please stop!

2292
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:31,850
What sound was that?

2293
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,890
(Please save Sae Rok.)

2294
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,460
Stop it!

2295
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,540
If these were bombs, not a trace
would have remained.

2296
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:39,800
What sound was that?

2297
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,840
- Sae Rok. Who was that?
- Who was that?

2298
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:43,540
Whose voice was that?

2299
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,960
Sae Rok, that wasn't you, right?

2300
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,410
- Sae Rok.
- Please tell me it wasn't you.

2301
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:47,470
- Sae Rok.
- Sae Rok.

2302
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,140
This is my last one.

2303
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,080
Last one. She's right over here.

2304
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:54,620
(Groaning)

2305
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:59,180
(She has a great singing voice now.)

2306
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:01,120
Just kill her.

2307
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,180
We're coming.

2308
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:03,830
Who was it?
Sae Rok, it wasn't you, right?

2309
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:05,590
- Was it you?
- Was it Sae Rok?

2310
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,700
She got like four water balloons.

2311
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:08,800
Really?

2312
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,890
How does this work then?

2313
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,630
Are we in last place?

2314
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:14,040
You are in last place.
You've been eliminated.

2315
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,060
Haha and Jae Suk both have
two points each.

2316
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,130
Two points?

2317
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:18,460
But that was a great sound.

2318
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,430
This is how
Sae Rok will become a star.

2319
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:21,600
I knew it.

2320
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,470
I told you I'd turn you into a star.

2321
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:25,280
The ending segment is yours.

2322
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,310
Okay.

2323
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,680
That was amazing.

2324
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,180
First place team, come here.

2325
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:35,220
They can't touch us.

2326
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,160
- They can't touch us, right?
- No.

2327
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,130
Which team
would you like to know about?

2328
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:40,630
We...

2329
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:42,220
Ours is the worst right now.

2330
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,560
(Tree card and prize card
gives a bamboo wife.)

2331
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,630
Right?

2332
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:45,740
Or instead...

2333
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,760
Suk Jin has an element card.
He has the other one.

2334
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,100
- Let's get his.
- That's true.

2335
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,600
(Switch with Suk Jin
for a better prize?)

2336
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,800
That's right.

2337
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,380
We'll switch...

2338
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:57,600
with Suk Jin.

2339
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:00,450
- Suk Jin and Ju Young will switch.
- Okay.

2340
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:02,380
- With me?
- Yes.

2341
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,750
This is very important.

2342
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:10,460
(Jae Suk's team switched with
Suk Jin. What will they win now?)

2343
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,530
(Bamboo wife)

2344
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,060
(This card is!)

2345
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:19,000
(What is it?)

2346
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:26,210
(The element card Suk Jin had...)

2347
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:30,210
(was water.)

2348
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,340
(Water card and prize card
gives the abalone set.)

2349
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,880
It should have been wind.

2350
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:37,380
Second place team,
please come forward.

2351
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,590
(Jae Suk and Ju Young won
the abalone set instead.)

2352
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,090
You can't switch with
the first place team.

2353
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:43,420
Which team would you like to know?

2354
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:47,030
It doesn't matter
which cards we get.

2355
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:50,390
Hold on.

2356
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,670
(They have to find out which teams
don't have penalty cards.)

2357
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:56,540
We know what Chorong has.

2358
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,540
(That was originally Ji Hyo's card.)

2359
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,800
- Right?
- Yes.

2360
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,950
Which team's information
would you like to know?

2361
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:07,580
(Ji Hyo switched her card
with Chorong in the last round.)

2362
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,880
- Okay.
- Chorong is happy.

2363
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,210
(Ji Hyo got the penalty card.)

2364
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:12,510
- She's so happy.
- Why do we...

2365
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:14,380
(Their eyes went
to the prize section.)

2366
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,250
- She's so happy.
- Why is your gaze up?

2367
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,330
He looked at the prize section.

2368
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:19,630
- Kwang Soo is so happy.
- I saw you.

2369
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:21,550
Kwang Soo, you look happy.

2370
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:22,670
- What?
- Were you happy?

2371
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:23,870
I wasn't.

2372
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,300
He's so happy.

2373
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,560
(He couldn't hide
where he was looking.)

2374
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,630
Kwang Soo and Chorong's team.

2375
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:32,540
It doesn't matter who.
We can get any.

2376
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,600
(They predict that Kwang Soo
and Chorong have a prize card.)

2377
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,640
(Chorong has a tree card,
Kwang Soo has a prize card.)

2378
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,170
Kwang Soo and Chorong have...

2379
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,990
one element card
and one prize card.

2380
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:47,920
(They have one prize card.)

2381
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,250
(Ji Hyo and Haha can't hide
their smiles.)

2382
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,500
(They have no idea
what's about to happen to them.)

2383
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,420
Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo will switch.

2384
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:01,000
(They think
Kwang Soo has the prize card.)

2385
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,130
It's 100 percent.

2386
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:03,260
Right.

2387
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:08,210
Ji Hyo will switch with Kwang Soo.

2388
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:09,710
(What?)

2389
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:12,280
I think Kwang Soo got
the penalty card at the end.

2390
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,970
Good work.

2391
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:16,010
(Ji Hyo and Haha obtain
a prize card.)

2392
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:17,990
(Kwang Soo and Chorong obtain
a penalty card.)

2393
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:19,750
Okay.

2394
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,850
Kwang Soo got the penalty.

2395
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,960
I'll reveal the cards.

2396
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,090
Is it over?

2397
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:28,590
- Yes, it's over.
- Is this over?

2398
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:29,830
We're done?

2399
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:31,170
(Same ending,
different facial expressions)

2400
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:32,670
- Do we go outside?
- Is this over?

2401
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:35,000
- But then...
- I said there were three rounds.

2402
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,500
- He said it was over.
- He said it was the last round.

2403
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:41,000
Please take turns
and reveal your cards.

2404
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,550
Ji Hyo is the queen.

2405
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:43,670
- Did you get it?
- She's the queen of luck.

2406
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:45,050
Wind and...

2407
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,920
Prize!

2408
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,470
(Prize card and wind card
gives an air purifier.)

2409
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:49,840
- That was amazing.
- It's an air purifier.

2410
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,350
- You won an air purifier.
- I wanted it.

2411
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:54,250
We wanted that one.

2412
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:56,380
We didn't know where wind was.

2413
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:58,490
Did you have wind?

2414
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,660
No.

2415
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,830
Prize card.

2416
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:03,800
(Thanks for the prize card.)

2417
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,390
We got a penalty card at the end.

2418
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:10,910
We had the prize card all day,
but it changed at the end.

2419
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,100
That's too bad.

2420
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,130
Tree.

2421
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:14,280
Next.

2422
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,840
- I had wind.
- That's where it was.

2423
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,000
It's a penalty.

2424
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,050
All right.

2425
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:20,510
(It's time for
the prizes and penalties.)

2426
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:23,420
I'll hand out the prizes first.

2427
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:25,290
Take the abalone set.

2428
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:28,490
This is for Ju Young's big family.

2429
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,460
Her grandma,
sister, and sister's husband.

2430
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,350
- It's alive.
- Have an abalone party.

2431
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,030
- This too.
- Thank you.

2432
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:38,260
This wasn't ours.

2433
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,540
This is for...

2434
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:40,890
- Ju Young's big family.
- That's so nice.

2435
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,130
Running Man is so warm.

2436
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,710
- This is great.
- She just moved.

2437
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:48,710
We'll give the whipped cream penalty
to Ju Young too.

2438
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:50,800
We'll give it to her.

2439
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:53,210
- We'll give up the flogging too.
- For Ju Young...

2440
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:55,640
who has a big family.
We'll give her two whipped creams.

2441
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:58,850
We'll do the flogging penalty first.

2442
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:01,250
Kwang Soo and Chorong are up.

2443
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:04,420
Jae Suk and Ju Young will do
the flogging.

2444
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:05,530
- Us?
- Yes.

2445
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:07,830
Okay, I'll hit Kwang Soo then.

2446
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:11,060
- Jae Suk, show us.
- I will.

2447
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,430
Now for our star from
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks."

2448
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:14,200
- Of course.
- What?

2449
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,600
- Hurry.
- Why did you mention that...

2450
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,210
- when I'm getting the penalty?
- Is that the famous movie?

2451
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:18,630
- Is that the famous movie?
- Yes, it is.

2452
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:19,840
It has to look puffy.

2453
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,780
- Yes, I'll take care of that.
- It looks too flat.

2454
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,780
What do you mean?

2455
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,670
- I'll make it look puffy.
- Yes, do that.

2456
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:26,380
- It has to show depth.
- Here I go.

2457
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:27,950
- Okay.
- Watch this, Ju Young.

2458
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,090
If Jae Suk doesn't do this...

2459
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:30,510
(She's shocked.)

2460
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:32,680
If Jae Suk doesn't do this...

2461
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,680
(The high-roller gets the stick.)

2462
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,290
(Jae Suk wants him to perform
better with his bottom.)

2463
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:37,550
"One-Eyed Jacks".

2464
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:38,750
- "One-Eyed Jacks".
- Hit it hard like this.

2465
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:40,720
Let's finish up with the penalty.

2466
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,390
- Yes.
- Okay.

2467
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:45,090
- I wonder what will happen to them.
- It might go to the side.

2468
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:46,370
- We can't be together.
- We are breaking up today.

2469
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:47,540
- We are not a match.
- We'll break up.

2470
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:50,630
- Yes.
- Great. 1, 2, 3.

2471
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,410
(The blue whipped cream
is launched!)

2472
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,640
(I hope these Genies can
make your dream come true.)

2473
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:56,950
- It's colored.
- My gosh.

2474
01:21:57,710 --> 01:22:00,310
- What?
- I got it all over my face.

2475
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:02,290
(Thank you for joining us
on a cold day.)

2476
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:03,310
Good job.

2477
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:04,950
- Good work.
- Great job.

2478
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:06,310
Good work.

2479
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:08,850
(As for this year...)

2480
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,490
(The members get together to get
their fortunes read for 2020.)

2481
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,720
(Their fortunes make them smile...)

2482
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,830
(and cry.)

2483
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:19,200
(The fortune-reading
brings them shock and horror.)

2484
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,740
(They make an awful pair?)

2485
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,210
(The members prayed
for good luck in 2020.)

2486
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,840
(But...)

2487
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,410
(they have the biggest crisis.)

2488
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:28,280
(The main MC, Jae Suk,
has vanished?)

2489
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,670
(And a mysterious briefcase
remains alone.)

2490
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:33,120
(The one who has
the secret briefcase...)

2491
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,920
(will get the biggest luck in 2020.)

2492
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,550
(What is the shocking secret
in this tightly closed briefcase?)

2493
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:39,250
(The Rat Holds
the Briefcase with Money)
