1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,090
- Hello.
- Hi.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,290
We're going to get
our fortune read again.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,900
We're getting our fortune read
for the new year.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,260
- Has it been a year already?
- Hello.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,210
All right. Well, this year...

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,410
- We should say hello first.
- Gosh, we're filming now.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,140
(He was taking his time
to drink his coffee.)

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,320
(He quickly puts it away.)

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,550
- You didn't know we started?
- Wait.

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,780
- Don't act like you didn't know.
- I didn't know we started.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,480
- He's like an American.
- Right.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,850
- American style.
- Jong Kook...

13
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,420
- There's one thing he's scared of.
- What is it?

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,550
The viewers.

15
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,800
(It's the viewers.)

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,400
He's not scared of anyone else.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,400
- I'm scared of them.
- Jong Kook is only scared...

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,800
- of the viewers.
- That's the only fear he has.

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,900
You didn't know?
He's also scared of me.

20
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,010
- He's scared of who?
- When I put on a straight face,

21
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,160
- he gets scared.
- You're a viewer too.

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,300
- Right.
- Is that so?

23
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,980
- You're also a viewer.
- That's true.

24
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,770
- That's right.
- I see.

25
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,150
Suk Jin is afraid of some people,
and one of them is Jong Kook.

26
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,480
(Jong Kook is watching.)

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,290
First of all, we should deliver
our New Year's greetings.

28
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,790
The Year of the Metal Rat, 2020,
has dawned.

29
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,080
- The Year of the Metal Rat.
- Viewers, Happy...

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,880
- New Year.
- Happy New Year.

31
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,890
My goodness. Oh, my.

32
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,060
Gosh. Going down
and coming up is so difficult.

33
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,590
He struggles more and more
every year.

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,810
Whenever we deliver our
New Year's greeting every year,

35
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,080
there are only two people
who complain about bowing.

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,910
They are Park Myung Soo
and Suk Jin.

37
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,370
- Gosh.
- I'm serious.

38
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,640
- They never change.
- Gosh.

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,390
This morning, we overheard
Suk Jin's phone call.

40
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,980
Right. There's a story behind it.

41
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,780
Kwang Soo, Jong Kook,

42
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,420
- We were just talking.
- Se Chan and I were talking.

43
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,390
"Yes, Director. The foreigners
are making unusual moves."

44
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,160
(The foreigners are
making unusual moves?)

45
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,670
What on earth is going on
with you these days?

46
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,590
- What kind of moves did they make?
- No.

47
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,700
It's about the stock market.

48
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,140
- It was about stocks.
- Right.

49
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,140
Wait, that's...
I heard he was just a total filler.

50
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,110
- I'm not a total filler.
- He's...

51
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,580
I'm just a regular filler.

52
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,840
- He's a big filler.
- That's it.

53
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,200
Why did you put on a hat
that signifies a drop in stocks?

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,310
- It's blue.
- What do you mean?

55
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,050
Blue means that the price went down.

56
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,480
- You should wear red for the rise.
- Don't say that.

57
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,220
- Why did you wear blue?
- This has nothing to do with that.

58
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,560
It's blue.
It means the price went down.

59
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,110
This signifies the ocean.

60
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,320
On top of that,
it says "end" on his hat.

61
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,590
(On top of that,
it says "end" on his hat.)

62
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,290
- Is it over? The end of the rise.
- Oh, no!

63
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,970
- The end of the drop in the prices.
- The end of the foreigners' moves.

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,770
That's not what it means.

65
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,970
Haha is wearing the pants
for the rise.

66
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,100
- Right.
- That's it.

67
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,410
- His stocks will go up.
- This feels nice.

68
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,030
Colors are important
at the beginning of the year.

69
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,750
- Yes, it's important.
- It's important.

70
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,100
He's wearing a blue hat
at the start of the year.

71
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,650
- Suk Jin is in trouble.
- Right.

72
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,680
I'm sorry to bring this up.

73
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,070
- This is making me uneasy.
- Right.

74
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,120
(Haha checks his underwear.)

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
No.

76
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,490
He's wearing red underwear too.

77
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,020
- His underwear?
- His underwear is red too.

78
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,750
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Haha.

79
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,430
(Kwang Soo is also
wearing red underwear.)

80
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,430
Nice. We're going up.

81
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,290
- My goodness.
- Let me see.

82
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,290
(Will he get lucky in the new year?)

83
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,530
Kwang Soo.

84
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,030
(Even Se Chan is wearing
red underwear.)

85
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,060
- What?
- My gosh.

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,560
- Yes.
- Hey.

87
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,810
Yes.

88
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,660
- Happy New Year.
- Hey.

89
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,280
What's happening?
Which red underwear is that?

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,410
- Hey.
- This is amazing.

91
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,470
- Me too! I'm wearing red too!
- Hey, you shouldn't show it to us.

92
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,680
(So Min wants to join the red wave.)

93
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,810
Hey.

94
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,540
- So Min.
- I'm wearing red too.

95
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,040
- Stop it.
- I want to be on the rise too.

96
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,840
Okay. Stop it.

97
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,990
- Don't do it.
- That's enough.

98
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,930
- What is she doing?
- Goodness. Hey.

99
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,620
What's wrong with her?

100
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,090
- I feel hot...
- Gosh.

101
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,690
- all of a sudden.
- I'm hot too.

102
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,900
- She just...
- Suk Jin.

103
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,370
You need to have red
in your underwear.

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,060
(Even Jae Suk is wearing
red underwear.)

105
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,410
(The energy of the rise
is spurting everywhere.)

106
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,270
- Hey.
- You shouldn't do that.

107
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,310
Stop it.

108
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,740
I want to join too.

109
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,030
- I want to join too.
- Stop it.

110
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,970
I don't believe in that stuff.
I don't.

111
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,470
- Gosh.
- Your underwear isn't red?

112
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,220
I swear. He's probably
wearing black underwear.

113
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,150
- Everything about him is black.
- It has to be black.

114
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,090
- You should make it bleed at least.
- Should I start bleeding?

115
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,990
(Somewhat jealous)

116
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,430
Since it's the new year, let's talk
about our goals in the new year.

117
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,190
Haha, what's your goal
for this year?

118
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,500
I want to learn.

119
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,770
What?

120
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,590
Right. I want to learn something.

121
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,810
- You want to learn something?
- Yes.

122
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,440
My oldest son crushed me
in everything.

123
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,530
Excuse my language. I should start
learning how to speak properly.

124
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,780
- Like your choice of words?
- I want to learn.

125
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,280
- He figured out you're not smart.
- He figured it out.

126
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,590
My son figured out I'm stupid.

127
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,180
(The depth of his knowledge
was exposed to his 8-year-old son.)

128
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,760
- Don't say that.
- It's heartbreaking.

129
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,920
He thought I was good at English
when he was five.

130
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,130
Since I went abroad often,
he thought I was good.

131
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,160
But when he turned six,
he figured out the truth.

132
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,970
Since we're talking about this,
let me share my story.

133
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,340
When my son was seven years old,

134
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,340
I read him storybooks in English
every night.

135
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,380
One day, my son said,
"Dad, don't read me storybooks."

136
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,580
(Dad, don't read me storybooks.)

137
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,040
(He was shocked
when his son said no to story time.)

138
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
- Because of your pronunciation?
- Because of my pronunciation.

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,740
- Because of your pronunciation?
- That must be the reason.

140
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,180
Gosh, that's scary.

141
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,890
He told me not to read him books
because of my pronunciation.

142
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,390
- Gosh, our dads of the show.
- Right.

143
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,200
So after he turned seven, I stopped
reading him English storybooks.

144
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,490
- Gosh, that's funny.
- That's true.

145
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,660
Great. So you want to learn more.
What about you, Ji Hyo?

146
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,710
She should quit smoking.

147
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,860
(Slandering her)

148
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,710
Please quit this year.

149
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,530
- Make 2020 the last year.
- Please.

150
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,040
- I hope she can quit this year.
- Right. It's about time.

151
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,720
- We should end the interview here.
- Quit smoking.

152
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,410
We hope that Ji Hyo
will stop smoking this year.

153
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,180
- I hope I can quit smoking.
- Great.

154
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,680
- She went along with it.
- She played along.

155
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,180
Do it for the sake of your health.
Great.

156
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,590
What about you, Suk Jin?

157
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,330
I definitely have a goal.

158
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,330
- Stocks going up?
- Stocks going up?

159
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,290
- Nothing like that. It's not that.
- What is it?

160
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,420
I'll work on my lower body.

161
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,590
The robot...

162
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,300
I want to have
Jong Kook's lower body.

163
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,930
I'll show you a strong
and muscular lower body.

164
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,580
Just focus on getting strong first.

165
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,910
(His comment strikes home.)

166
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,470
Just do that first.

167
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,580
- Jong Kook.
- That was brutal.

168
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,970
- He's full of energy today.
- No.

169
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,390
- You know?
- Hey.

170
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,110
I've been getting
a lot of compliments lately.

171
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,220
- My goodness.
- Okay.

172
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,550
Your goal isn't what we expected
to hear in the opening segment.

173
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,220
- What? What do you want?
- It's too plain.

174
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,760
- He said it's too plain.
- Should I talk about stocks?

175
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,160
- That's all.
- What should we talk about?

176
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,830
Have a second child. Tell us
that you'll have another child.

177
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,160
My gosh, having another child?

178
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,400
- Why not?
- Another child?

179
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,660
- Yes. Work out for it.
- Develop your lower body.

180
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,910
- My gosh.
- Do you still have such desires?

181
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,340
- What?
- Do you?

182
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,840
(You're still going strong, right?)

183
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,470
(Let me say a few words of blessings
for the New Year.)

184
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,540
- Hey, that's crazy.
- If you still have...

185
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,760
"Crazy"? He said it's crazy.
That's funny.

186
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,980
It goes through the roof.

187
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,280
(He's still very healthy.)

188
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,160
I go by Fiery Suk Jin.

189
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,790
Fiery. He's fiery.

190
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,970
My goodness, Haha.

191
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,340
- What about you, Jong Kook?
- I want to stay healthy as always.

192
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,600
Shouldn't you say that your goal
is getting married in 2020?

193
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,300
Right. But getting married...
I'm sure you know this. At my age...

194
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,210
- You're careful about it.
- Right. I'm careful about it.

195
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,100
He cherishes himself too much.
He loves himself too much.

196
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,220
- He loves himself too much.
- Right.

197
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,670
(He's in love
with exercising and muscles.)

198
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,150
My gosh, my abs.

199
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,480
(He's in love
with exercising and muscles.)

200
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,850
My gosh, my triceps.

201
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,030
That's why he washes
his underwear on his abs.

202
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,990
- He uses soap too.
- Like this.

203
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,860
He can wash his underwear
on his abs.

204
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,660
What about you, So Min?

205
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,030
It's always been my goal.
I want to quit drinking.

206
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,070
That's one of my goals. Instead of
wishing to meet people organically,

207
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,660
I'm going to take more initiatives.

208
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,640
- Like BD? Blind dates?
- What?

209
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,670
I thought you said, "kiss."

210
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,300
- Well, I like that too.
- No, not that.

211
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,650
I like that too.

212
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,670
- I'll set you up if I know anyone.
- I want to be set up.

213
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,540
- I already introduce a lot of guys.
- Set me up with someone.

214
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,170
In fact, I already have faith
in Jae Suk.

215
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,740
- I'm eyeing someone right now.
- Right.

216
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,180
- Really?
- I just got to know him recently.

217
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,050
So if there's a chance, I'll set up
an occasion for them to meet.

218
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,420
I'm observing him right now.

219
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,260
- You'll set them up?
- Yes.

220
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,590
- What is it?
- So you could have fun?

221
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,590
(That's a reasonable doubt.)

222
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,840
Really?

223
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,010
Then, let me join you too.

224
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,660
Men can tell if a guy is
good or not. I'm serious.

225
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,300
This is for Jong Kook and So Min.
Set them up if you know anyone.

226
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,970
- I'll do that.
- They might end up dating.

227
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,080
(Will they end up dating
each other?)

228
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,780
- I'm serious.
- Yes, Jong Kook.

229
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,470
- I'll introduce a nice guy to you.
- Okay.

230
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,780
Do you know
the guy came to my mind first?

231
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,110
- Who is it?
- Se Chan.

232
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,180
(Don't look too far.)

233
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,920
So Min, date Se Chan if you can.

234
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,030
But he's such a nice guy.
You guys like each other.

235
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,850
- He's a great guy.
- You guys like each other.

236
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,160
The three of us should hang out.

237
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,200
- With Jong Kook? Sounds great.
- With Jong Kook.

238
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,340
That's great.

239
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,210
We prepared a race to celebrate
the Year of the Metal Rat, 2020.

240
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,030
Before we start the race,
we prepared a segment...

241
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,650
where you can get
your fortune for 2020 read.

242
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,750
Is it that time already?

243
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,150
(What kind of event...)

244
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,910
(will await the members
of Running Man this year?)

245
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,760
Let us introduce you
to Park Sung Jun,

246
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,080
the fortune-teller who will
read your fortune for the new year.

247
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,320
- Please come in.
- Yes!

248
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,390
I love this.

249
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,260
- Hello.
- Hello.

250
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,000
- We meet every year.
- We meet again.

251
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,500
- He brought a small briefcase.
- The briefcase.

252
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,190
- He has a briefcase today.
- Yes.

253
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,060
It feels like yesterday when
you tripped walking in last year.

254
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,960
- Yes. He tripped when he left too.
- Right.

255
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,930
It's the Year
of the Metal Rat, 2020.

256
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,380
I'll read your fortune
for the new year.

257
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,250
Jae Suk, you were born
in the Year of the Rat.

258
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,520
- I was.
- Right.

259
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,410
So centering around Jae Suk,

260
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,390
I'll see which members
are compatible with him.

261
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,050
- Our compatibility with him?
- Our compatibility?

262
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,160
I will start...

263
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,280
with Mr. Ji Suk Jin first.

264
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,530
- He's going first again this year.
- My gosh.

265
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Can you also read his fortune
regarding this?

266
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,460
He said the foreigners are
making unusual moves today.

267
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,430
That's so funny.

268
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,660
- That's hilarious.
- Will it go up or down?

269
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,240
Tell him what will happen
with the foreigners.

270
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

271
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,070
Please read my fortune well.

272
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,940
Suk Jin, starting 2016,
I kept telling you...

273
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,570
- to do nothing.
- Right.

274
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,650
(2 years ago
during his fortune-reading session)

275
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,280
(For the past 2 years, you did well
holding yourself back.)

276
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,450
(Just hang in there 1 more year.)

277
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,290
- "Stay down. Do nothing."
- You told me to stay down.

278
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,500
"Don't do anything."

279
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,870
- Will it be different today?
- First of all,

280
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,140
you didn't do anything
for 3 years from 2016 to 2018.

281
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,870
- In the new year, finally...
- "Finally".

282
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,110
"Finally".

283
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,110
(He's been keeping quiet
for 3 years. What about this year?)

284
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,610
You will have good fortune
that can bring money and honor.

285
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,940
(You will have good fortune
that can bring money and honor.)

286
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,890
- I can't believe this.
- No way.

287
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,890
- It's here!
- He's on the rise!

288
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,450
- It's good news after three years.
- He's on the rise!

289
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,420
- Congratulations.
- I'll treat you to a meal.

290
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,790
But even if he gets back
what he lost, it'll just be even.

291
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,230
Right. He's been losing
for three years.

292
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,560
He's been going down
for three years.

293
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,140
- Things will work out for him now.
- Right.

294
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,030
So in 2020,
as long as your energy allows,

295
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,270
it's better to do everything
that comes your way.

296
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,800
- Really?
- He's working a lot lately.

297
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,980
- I've never heard such good news.
- Okay.

298
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,940
So in 2020, you'll go abroad more
as you'll have itchy feet.

299
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,120
You might perform
in other parts of Korea as well.

300
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,180
Right. Why don't you make your way
to Hollywood this year?

301
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,810
- Gosh, I'll go anywhere.
- You know?

302
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,390
So in 2020 and 2021,

303
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,660
you'll be lucky enough to move
around a lot and make a fortune.

304
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,000
If you miss this chance...

305
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,920
(If you miss this chance...)

306
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,060
(He'll be finally lucky. What will
happen he misses the window?)

307
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,140
You will have another chance
at the age of 64 and 65.

308
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,640
(That's about 10 years later.)

309
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,880
Ten years?

310
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,800
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- Oh, no.

311
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,280
Suk Jin, if you miss this chance,
you'll be in trouble.

312
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,780
Seriously. Suk Jin...

313
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,710
- never gets a good chance.
- That's too short.

314
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,280
I don't get this chance often.

315
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,040
- I should seize this opportunity.
- At the age of 64.

316
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,910
- The next one is 10 years later.
- 10 years later?

317
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,050
So you are very ambitious
when it comes to money.

318
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,360
You're somewhat ambitious
in holding a good title as well.

319
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,600
But as long as you don't embarrass
yourself, you'll have money.

320
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,290
That means he'll be a nouveau riche.

321
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,140
- He's spot on though.
- A nouveau riche.

322
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,530
Suk Jin just makes sure
he doesn't embarrass himself...

323
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,200
- or gets criticized.
- I can't say he's wrong.

324
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,540
So this year and next year,
don't get distracted.

325
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,040
- Just focus on your work.
- Okay.

326
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,810
- Yes, you should just work.
- Thank you.

327
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,990
- You should work.
- I can't believe this.

328
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,360
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

329
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,550
I've never seen him smile
while getting his fortune read.

330
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,320
(Suk Jin's New-Year Fortune:
Money and honor.)

331
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,550
Thank you.

332
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,260
(But if he misses his chance,
he must wait until 64.)

333
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,730
Next,

334
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,660
- it's Haha.
- It's his turn at last.

335
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,790
- It's here.
- My gosh.

336
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,190
His days have been dark.

337
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,930
- His days have been dark.
- Right.

338
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,110
His fortune last year was the worst.

339
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,110
(Haha's fortune was
1 of the 2 worst ones.)

340
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,510
It's your turn. It's here!

341
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,650
You have a chance.

342
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,250
(Two years ago,
during his fortune-reading session)

343
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,710
(Your fortune this year isn't good.
It's the darkest fortune.)

344
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,580
(It's pitch-dark.)

345
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,310
Haha, so far,

346
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,420
- I never told you any good news.
- Right.

347
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,530
In 2018, you passed
the pitch-dark days.

348
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,600
- You passed them.
- It's over now.

349
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,900
- I can't wait.
- My business partner!

350
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,900
It's the end of the tunnel.

351
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,660
For 5 years starting 2020...

352
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,430
- For 5 years.
- For 5 years?

353
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,530
Hold on.

354
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,670
For 5 years starting 2020,
the world will be yours.

355
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,540
(For 5 years starting 2020,
the world will be yours.)

356
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,850
(His dark days are over.)

357
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,050
- Haha.
- My gosh.

358
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,580
- Haha.
- Hey.

359
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,660
- Goodness.
- Are you crying?

360
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,390
- Hey, it'll last five years.
- My gosh.

361
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,630
Hey, that's a long time.

362
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,790
- I think I'll get only six months.
- That's amazing.

363
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,370
- Haha, it's here.
- Don't miss your chance.

364
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,530
- It's finally your time.
- My goodness.

365
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,740
Haha, you got it now.

366
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,240
(His dark days flash by
in his mind.)

367
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,010
- He's crying.
- He's really crying.

368
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,030
Haha.

369
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,670
(He's really crying?)

370
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,440
- Haha, we know how you feel.
- It's here.

371
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,310
- It's yours now.
- It's here.

372
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,520
You waited for a long time now.

373
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,890
Actually, my wife and I held hands
together and prayed last night.

374
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,450
(The master of waiting:
I know how you feel, Haha.)

375
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,630
You'll be on your way to reaching
the peak from 2020 to 2024.

376
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,230
- You'll be on the rise.
- My gosh, that's amazing.

377
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,630
- I'm really happy for him.
- At last.

378
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,790
Actually, Haha,
you need to support Jae Suk.

379
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,370
Of course. Yes.

380
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,560
- I've been distant from him lately.
- He has to support Jae Suk?

381
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,070
It's not about being close
or distant from him.

382
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,010
When you are with Jae Suk, it's
likely you steal energy from him.

383
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,070
- I do?
- Yes.

384
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,480
- I don't want to do that.
- I heard that before.

385
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,650
That's why I was really sorry.

386
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,850
So you need to help him out.

387
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,910
- Sure. I'll do anything.
- Okay.

388
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,450
Do I need to help him
financially or...

389
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,920
"Financially"?

390
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,050
- Should I give him 10 dollars?
- Hey.

391
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,900
- Give him some money every month.
- Okay.

392
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,790
- Gosh. Give him cash.
- Okay.

393
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,790
Send him some yogurt regularly.

394
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,430
What? He said Haha
should send me yogurt regularly.

395
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,830
Okay. I'll wrap it up well.

396
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,930
I'll visit you.
I was disappointed before.

397
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,570
Don't you like meat?

398
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,780
I'll bring you some.

399
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,850
Didn't you curse him two years ago?

400
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,040
Let's go!

401
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,940
- Hang in there!
- It's your era.

402
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,260
(Haha's New-Year Fortune:
5 years of good luck)

403
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,160
Next up is So Min.

404
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,530
- My gosh.
- It must be good then.

405
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,030
- At last.
- I'm curious about her fortune.

406
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

407
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,270
Sir, I heard I will have a bad
fortune for three consecutive years.

408
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,530
(She starts spilling intel
before sitting down.)

409
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,240
- Okay.
- Right? That's my fortune.

410
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,690
I heard that in January...

411
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,330
- She talks too much.
- Don't tell him that first.

412
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,060
- I mean...
- Wait. Just be quiet.

413
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,880
- In January...
- Be quiet.

414
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,440
I was told that I should be extra
careful in January and stay safe.

415
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,350
And I was informed that
it'd get better on February 4.

416
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,280
- When did she get hers read?
- Doesn't she go to church?

417
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,390
- Will I have a good year?
- Well, first, So Min,

418
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,160
you're a gem who was born in spring.

419
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,490
You have a strong energy of gold.

420
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,950
(She likes it.)

421
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,030
She's liking it.

422
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,030
You are sentimental
and get easily inspired,

423
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,190
but you fantasize too much.

424
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,500
(But you fantasize too much.)

425
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,140
(Showing off her fantasies)

426
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,110
- Fantasize?
- My gosh, that's spot on.

427
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,740
- He's precise.
- He's spot on.

428
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,830
How can he be so precise?

429
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,240
Whether it's people
or inanimate objects,

430
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,650
you easily obsess over them.

431
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,070
- That's true.
- She does obsess over them.

432
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,250
So in 2020,
the Year of the Metal Rat,

433
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,360
you will have a good fortune
for the spouse.

434
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,260
You may meet your other half.

435
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,450
- Gosh, So Min.
- In 2020?

436
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,730
- Your dream will come true.
- My gosh.

437
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,950
- Really?
- Yes.

438
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,600
So your lucky charm will help you.
That's your fortune.

439
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,730
- Someone will help her.
- A lucky charm will help her.

440
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,870
Sung Jun. My gosh, my bad.

441
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,770
- Don't be casual with anyone.
- Hey. What was that?

442
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,780
- Don't be casual with anyone.
- Don't be rude to Mr. Park.

443
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,800
Gosh. I'm sorry.

444
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,150
- What's wrong with you?
- It slipped.

445
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,120
- Mr. Park.
- So Min.

446
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,480
That's one of the wishes she has.

447
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,080
She's so happy. She's just excited.

448
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,180
- She's happy.
- When? What month will I meet him?

449
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,890
First, after February 4,
your fortune will get better.

450
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,050
Can't I find out
which age group he's in?

451
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,920
First of all, let's look at
your fortune for your spouse.

452
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,560
You have no ties with younger guys
or guys around the same age.

453
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,700
You have ties with older men.

454
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,330
- He's disappointed.
- Se Chan.

455
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,530
He's the same age as me.

456
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,200
- She won't have ties with Se Chan.
- Does it mean it won't work out?

457
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,510
- He's liking it.
- Hey, you.

458
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,350
I know you're disappointed.

459
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,350
Don't pretend that you're okay.

460
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,890
Among the members of your show,

461
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,980
- you're compatible with one member.
- Who is it?

462
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,750
(Which member is compatible
with So Min as her spouse?)

463
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,860
It's...

464
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,720
(Who is it?)

465
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,920
It's Se Chan.

466
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,830
- Really?
- But they are the same age.

467
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,130
- They are the same age.
- We're the same age.

468
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,460
You are the same age. However,
the compatibility of you two...

469
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,910
is like a taffy stick.

470
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,040
- What?
- Taffy stick?

471
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,140
(Their compatibility
is like a taffy stick.)

472
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,910
- Wait. It sounds like a curse word.
- Wait.

473
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,080
Isn't that a bad thing?

474
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,650
When something is like taffy,
it has a negative connotation.

475
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,440
- It means they stick like taffy.
- Does it mean they are that close?

476
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,240
It means once we stick,
we can't be separated.

477
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,350
It means that we can't be
separated afterward. Right?

478
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,980
Yes, you will stick together
like a taffy stick.

479
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,520
Once you develop a relationship,
it will not break.

480
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,660
- If you get married,
- Why are you standing up?

481
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,800
you can't get divorced.

482
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,920
We can't get divorced?

483
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,630
Right. I won't let you divorce me.

484
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,930
(He's trapped in her love.)

485
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,660
On top of that, as for Se Chan,

486
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,910
since you're cute and adorable,
he'll do things for you.

487
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,110
He'll be a devoted husband.

488
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,000
(He'll be a devoted husband.)

489
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,610
(Devoted Husband Se Chan)

490
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,470
In fact, Se Chan is
such a warmhearted guy.

491
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,740
Of course.

492
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,940
He is a devoted husband,
but his class is low.

493
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,290
(He is a devoted husband,
but his class is low.)

494
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,560
(This devoted husband
is of low class.)

495
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,250
That hurts.

496
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,130
- That hit me hard.
- That's true.

497
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,520
- That hit me hard.
- This is fun whenever we do it.

498
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,720
He tries to do things for you,

499
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,870
but he's lacking and incompetent
by nature.

500
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,230
- He can't fully satisfy you.
- Right.

501
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,900
- He can't reach your expectations.
- Right.

502
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,700
- He's incompetent.
- We recently had a barbecue,

503
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,670
and he kept putting cooked meat
on my plate.

504
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,150
So that was touching.

505
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,110
I like grilling meat.

506
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,970
You're flirting with her.
You're giving her signals, punk.

507
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,890
- Thank you.
- So Min.

508
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,560
That's good news.

509
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,860
Congratulations, So Min.

510
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,950
(So Min's New-Year Fortune:
She'll meet the love of her life.)

511
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,630
(Her compatibility with Se Chan
is sticky like the taffy stick.)

512
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,920
Next,

513
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,400
- it's Kwang Soo.
- It's time.

514
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,990
Kwang Soo had the best fortune
up to last year.

515
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,190
He had the best fortune.

516
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,400
(Kwang Soo had the best fortune.)

517
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,410
(This year, 2018,
is the brightest year for you.)

518
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,910
(You'll be lighting
your last flame.)

519
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,850
(You'll be lighting
your last flame.)

520
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,880
(He said it'd be his brightest
and final year.)

521
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,790
(I'm still young.)

522
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,680
This is your fortune for this year.

523
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,660
You have stepped
on the tiger's tail,

524
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,520
but you'll survive by running away.

525
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,800
(He will survive by running away.)

526
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,450
You'll survive by running away.

527
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,660
What? What does he mean?

528
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,460
- Goodness.
- What is this?

529
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,690
Thankfully, you won't die.

530
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,610
You'll cause trouble,
but you won't die from it.

531
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,200
I stepped on the tiger's tail?

532
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,340
- What a relief.
- What?

533
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,910
In fortune-telling,

534
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,470
there's an energy called
the White Tiger.

535
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,170
While walking through the mountain,
you'll meet a tiger,

536
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,510
throw up blood, and die.

537
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,180
I'll throw up blood and die?

538
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,680
(This is the meaning
of the White Tiger.)

539
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,180
(It's frightening.)

540
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,590
- That's the White Tiger.
- Okay.

541
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,720
But since you have some luck
to begin with,

542
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,520
- you'll be able...
- I won't throw up blood and die?

543
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,130
to run away and survive.

544
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,190
So it's a relief.

545
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,760
- What a relief.
- Seriously.

546
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,340
You'll survive.

547
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,840
You'll be blessed
with love and money.

548
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,610
It's highly likely that you'll meet
a nice woman.

549
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,670
But you lack dating skills.

550
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,670
(He has a fatal weakness.)

551
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,440
- Dating skills?
- You see,

552
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,050
- Who taught him those skills?
- he does lack those skills.

553
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,320
Who taught him?

554
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,240
- Who taught him?
- He lacks those skills.

555
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,750
(Kwang Soo's New-Year Fortune:
Steps on the tiger's tail but lives)

556
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,320
(Possibility for a relationship,
but lacks dating skills)

557
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,520
Next is Jong Kook.

558
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,680
- Me?
- It's Jong Kook's turn.

559
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,990
For the past 2 to 3 years, you were
blessed with love and money.

560
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,960
But for this year,

561
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,160
- you'll be receiving less of them.
- Really?

562
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,960
It's best for you to be
more conservative and stable.

563
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
- Really?
- More conservative than now?

564
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,770
- More?
- Even more than right now?

565
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,500
If he becomes
even more conservative,

566
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,110
- He's already conservative enough.
- it'll be terrible.

567
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,710
Your best colors for this year...

568
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,010
are pink and red.

569
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,510
(How is pink his best color?)

570
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,250
Hey, that's your best color.

571
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,220
- It's pink.
- Apink!

572
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,250
(Jong Kook's New-Year Fortune:
He'll be blessed...)

573
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,220
(with less love and money.
His best color is pink.)

574
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,720
If you invest in someone
or something...

575
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,300
or lend money to someone,

576
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,370
you won't be able to get it back
9 times out of 10.

577
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,500
- Goodness.
- It's you.

578
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,610
- Hey.
- You're the chosen one.

579
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,770
Will I be blessed
with a marriage partner?

580
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,730
Of course, you do since I do.

581
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,410
For this year,

582
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,970
you'll be blessed with neither
money nor women.

583
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,410
(He'll have neither.)

584
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,290
He'll have nothing.

585
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,980
(Se Chan's New-Year Fortune:
He shouldn't invest.)

586
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,590
I'm doomed this year.

587
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,360
You'll be blessed with love.

588
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,490
- That's good news.
- You'll be able to find a man...

589
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,900
or gain honor.

590
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,690
As long as he doesn't have
too strong of an energy,

591
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,070
- you'll be fine.
- I see.

592
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,870
- That means it's not Jong Kook.
- He's disqualified.

593
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,930
- No.
- Jong Kook can be...

594
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,340
a devoted husband.

595
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,700
- Right.
- That's true.

596
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,410
- Suk Jin is a devoted husband too.
- Right.

597
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,700
So it Jae Suk.

598
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,670
Se Chan lacks in some ways,
but he's also devoted.

599
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,240
Sir.

600
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,860
- You need to be more precise.
- Sir.

601
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,250
- What you said was hurtful.
- Sir.

602
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,180
- Is it my brain or my face?
- Which one is it?

603
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,330
- Is it his face?
- This is driving me crazy.

604
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,720
- In various ways.
- In various ways?

605
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,900
He lacks all around.

606
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,690
(Ji Hyo's New-Year Fortune:
Blessed with love and honor)

607
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,490
(She should avoid
those with strong energies.)

608
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,260
You were born
in the Year of the Rat.

609
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,840
- You're right.
- You were.

610
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,700
You strongly prefer stability.

611
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,640
- I agree.
- He is like that.

612
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,000
- He never invests in anything.
- If you're unsure about something,

613
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,500
- you won't make a move.
- You're right.

614
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,770
- That's accurate.
- You're right.

615
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,510
You won't get along well with
Suk Jin who enjoys taking risks.

616
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,550
I offered him several suggestions,
but he never took any of them.

617
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,560
Ever since we got
to know each other,

618
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,590
he's been offering me
countless suggestions.

619
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,630
But I've never accepted any of them.

620
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,950
- That's why you're still friends.
- Precisely.

621
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,020
- That's why.
- Not even once.

622
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,930
If we work on something together,
we will fall apart.

623
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,570
I've never accepted
any of his offers.

624
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,610
This is your fortune for this year.

625
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,840
Last year, you've been quite busy,

626
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,270
so you need to take care
of your health.

627
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,500
You may have many expenses.
Have your eyes open.

628
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,000
You should work out with me.

629
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,270
(Jong Kook will help him
stay healthy.)

630
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,890
Since the southside is warmer,
it's better for you.

631
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,090
- The south?
- Yes.

632
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,250
Your best colors are red and pink.

633
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,980
- Red and pink?
- Yes.

634
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,290
You two are the same.

635
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,690
- We should wear matching clothes.
- You and Jong Kook are the same.

636
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,190
His best color is pink too.

637
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:30,600
I looked at your compatibility
with the other members.

638
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
My compatibility?

639
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,570
You have bad compatibility
with those born...

640
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,540
- in the Year of the Sheep.
- Who is it?

641
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,230
- It's me.
- Haha was born then.

642
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,270
Why?

643
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,740
Those born in the Year of the Sheep
and Rat have bad energy.

644
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,710
- I see.
- What?

645
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,010
There are various kinds of sheep.

646
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,290
- Hey, shut it.
- Come on.

647
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,790
(I'm a good sheep.)

648
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,920
- Okay.
- Give me one more chance.

649
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,920
- I understand.
- But there's more.

650
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,830
You and Haha aren't compatible
in every other way as well.

651
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,690
(Gasping)

652
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,400
(Is this an irony of fate?)

653
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,260
You should go on
your separate ways now.

654
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,430
That's funny.

655
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,580
- You are compatible with those...
- Do tell me.

656
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,910
born in the Year of the Cow.

657
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,880
- It's Kwang Soo.
- It's him.

658
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Jae Suk.

659
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,240
- It's you.
- When you two meet,

660
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,710
you can bond with each other well.

661
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,180
(Of course)

662
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,160
- I give him dating advice.
- That's right.

663
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,210
- We bond so well.
- That's right.

664
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,360
- You become sentimental.
- That's right.

665
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,860
That's what happens.

666
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,020
I told you
I'm your best dating coach.

667
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,160
- He's been doing it for a decade.
- That's right.

668
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,960
But no matter how good
the advice is,

669
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,840
your innate lack of dating skills...

670
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,110
Okay.

671
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,730
- I got it.
- See?

672
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,810
Did you get that?

673
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,410
- He lacks dating skills.
- I only give you good advice.

674
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,810
- Okay.
- Thank you.

675
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,550
(Jae Suk's New-Year Fortune:
The south and pink are best.)

676
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,550
(Worst compatibility with Haha,
best compatibility with Kwang Soo)

677
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,210
Your new-year fortunes
have all been read.

678
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,180
We'll say goodbye to Sung Jun...

679
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,250
- and begin our race.
- Thank you.

680
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,330
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

681
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,250
I have something for Jae Suk.

682
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,190
- What is that?
- Let me give this to you.

683
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,330
What is that?

684
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,840
(His legs are asleep.)

685
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,430
- Sir.
- Are your legs okay?

686
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,160
- Sir.
- Are you okay?

687
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,410
- Are you okay?
- Hurry up.

688
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,970
(Actually, the same thing happened
last year as well.)

689
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,580
(Trembling)

690
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,940
(You should work out your legs
more often this year.)

691
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,390
- Sir.
- You should work out.

692
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,320
- Climb Mount Gwanak.
- I will.

693
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,160
- That's for you.
- Okay.

694
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

695
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,250
- Goodness.
- Is that a mission card?

696
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,600
He seems to be in a lot of pain.

697
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,870
This must be the mission card.

698
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,260
Since you were born
in the Year of the Rat,

699
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,570
it must be related to you.

700
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,230
(They're curious.)

701
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,310
Hold on a minute.

702
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,470
(He walks away from the members.)

703
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,700
What?

704
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,290
(What could it be?)

705
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,850
- What is it?
- Let me see the briefcase.

706
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,180
- That didn't last long.
- I need the briefcase.

707
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,320
- Hold on.
- This is...

708
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,790
- Is he trying to run away?
- What is it?

709
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,330
- What did it say?
- Gosh.

710
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,560
He read it so quickly.

711
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,800
- Hold on.
- What was it about?

712
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,060
Let me see this as well.

713
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,020
The staff has his coat.
He must be running away.

714
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,600
Really? Let me see.

715
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,690
Seriously?

716
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,660
The staff has his coat.
He must be running away.

717
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,870
(He grabs onto the briefcase.)

718
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,660
(He runs away.)

719
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,930
- Shouldn't we catch him?
- Why do you want me to run?

720
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,470
Why?

721
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,670
(He runs away
and leaves the staff behind.)

722
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,410
Is this it?

723
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,710
Why are you suddenly telling me
to run away?

724
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,890
- Let him leave for now.
- What is going on?

725
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,620
- Why did he run away?
- He has good energy,

726
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,290
- so we should let him go.
- Is he leaving just like that?

727
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,130
Today's new-year race is called
The Rat with the Money.

728
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,660
Since Jae Suk was born
in the Year of the Rat,

729
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,660
he ran away with the briefcase
holding 1,000 dollars.

730
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,110
(The briefcase holds 1,000 dollars.)

731
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,310
(What was written on the scroll?)

732
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,610
(Run away with the briefcase
full of money right now.)

733
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,910
(Briefcase full of money)

734
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,510
The briefcase you have
has 1,000 dollars.

735
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,710
(There is 1,000 dollars
in the briefcase.)

736
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,410
You're the first owner
of the briefcase.

737
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,890
The briefcase's password has
6 digits with the last one being 0.

738
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,600
Through the missions, you'll be able
to obtain the numbers one by one.

739
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,130
Once one of you opens it
and obtains the money,

740
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,630
the race will end.

741
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,340
The other members can take
the briefcase...

742
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,460
from you by stealing it...

743
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,760
or by ripping your name tag off
while the briefcase is hidden.

744
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,380
However, if you rip the name tag
of a member who doesn't have it,

745
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,110
you'll get a five-minute time out.

746
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,770
A five-minute time out?

747
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,980
Among you, there are four snakes
who are eyeing the briefcase.

748
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,180
- 4 snakes?
- 4 snakes?

749
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,060
(There are 4 snakes among them.)

750
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,560
(4 snakes versus
4 Running Man members)

751
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,860
- There are 4 among the 8 of you.
- 4?

752
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,450
If Jae Suk was here,
he would've done this.

753
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,830
He would've.

754
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,830
Nobody knows just yet.
We'll tell you later.

755
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,220
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

756
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,900
I'm sorry. Jae Suk wasn't here,

757
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,140
- so I did it.
- They grabbed me by my collar.

758
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:05,000
The snakes won't know
who their fellow snakes are.

759
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,650
If one of the snakes ends up
opening the briefcase, they win.

760
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,880
If it's a Running Man member,
Running Man wins.

761
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,150
The one who opens it
can divide the money...

762
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,180
among their team members.

763
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,150
(The one who opens it
can choose how much to share.)

764
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,160
Now, you should go
to your designated places,

765
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,680
find out your identities,
and receive your mission maps.

766
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,360
- Okay.
- Got it.

767
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,600
Let's go catch the rat.

768
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,800
- We should catch that rat.
- Let's go.

769
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,070
Let's go and catch our Mickey Mouse.

770
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,200
<i>- Let's catch the rat
- Let's catch the rat</i>

771
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,040
We'll find out our identities here.

772
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,970
(They each get into their cars.)

773
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,350
- Here is your mission map.
- Okay.

774
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,620
You can pick wherever
you want to go.

775
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,820
- Wherever I want?
- Yes.

776
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,120
We need to pick the location?

777
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,290
I need to go to one of these places.

778
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,320
I need to pick one.

779
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,480
There is a total of six places.

780
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,590
Each mission has a limit
to how many can participate.

781
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,330
If you win, you'll be given
one number from the password.

782
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,760
Even if you succeed,

783
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,690
if the majority of the participants
are snakes,

784
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,490
the number won't be given.

785
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,570
What?

786
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,870
No way.

787
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,500
However,

788
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,580
even if you succeed in the mission,
if the majority of you are snakes,

789
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
you will not receive
a number in the passcode.

790
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,970
Instead, you will receive
a hint about the snakes.

791
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,890
About who they are?

792
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,320
So it's important to do the missions
without the snakes.

793
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,090
That's right, or don't let
be the majority.

794
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,720
- This is insane.
- You won't receive the number.

795
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,750
Let me tell you
which role you're playing.

796
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,020
Sure. That's most important.

797
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,560
You are...

798
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
(A snake or a Running Man?)

799
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,220
- You are a Running Man.
- All right!

800
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,020
(Se Chan is a Running Man.)

801
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,140
Snake or rat or whatever.

802
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,260
I'll rip them all apart
and teach them a lesson.

803
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,340
- Suk Jin, you are...
- Yes?

804
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,500
A snake.

805
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,700
A snake? What am I
supposed to do then?

806
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,210
I didn't fully listen earlier.

807
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,510
(What am I supposed to do then?)

808
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,680
(Him not knowing the rules
is worrisome.)

809
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,860
Jong Kook, you are a Running Man.

810
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,480
So I'm not a snake. Got it.

811
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,900
(Jong Kook receives a phone call.)

812
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,870
Hold on. It's Jae Suk.

813
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,960
(Hold on. It's Jae Suk.)

814
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,400
(Jae Suk's calling
when he's on the run?)

815
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,230
- Jae Suk?
- It's me, Jong Kook.

816
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,610
Yes, I'm here.

817
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,070
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

818
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,340
We need to complete missions...

819
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,930
- in order to know the passcode.
- Exactly.

820
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,140
So...

821
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,150
come over here to me
without telling anyone.

822
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,710
Where?

823
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,850
The spot for mission number two.

824
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,320
(Completing the mission
will give them the first digit.)

825
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,890
The spot for mission number two?

826
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,420
- That's right.
- I see you believe in our fate.

827
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,560
- Of course.
- I know.

828
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,660
It's why I'm calling you
and Kwang Soo over.

829
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,960
Okay, I'll be there.

830
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,570
- See you soon.
- Sure.

831
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,020
(The call ends.)

832
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,190
Why did Jae Suk
call me over though?

833
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,000
What if I rip off his name tag?

834
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,410
I can't tell if Jae Suk is
a snake or not.

835
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,940
He currently has the money,
so I should head over there.

836
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,970
(Jong Kook heads to the spot
for mission number 2.)

837
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,080
Since we're doing this...

838
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,710
No one would admit to being a snake.

839
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,050
So Min is calling.

840
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,980
- My sweet taffy.
- My sticky partner.

841
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,890
My taffy, what's your role today?

842
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,680
A Running Man, of course.

843
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
(Se Chan asks about her identity.)

844
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,220
(So Min is a Running Man
just like I am?)

845
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,070
What do you say to you and me...

846
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,760
trying a mission for two?

847
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,960
(How about we
try a mission for two?)

848
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,840
Will you put your trust in me,
Ms. Running Man?

849
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,230
(Why don't we test
our sticky relationship?)

850
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,970
(Se Chan suddenly
sends her a proposal.)

851
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,150
Let's head
to mission number one then.

852
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,470
(Sure thing.)

853
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,550
Are you good with it?

854
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,940
Okay, I'll meet you there right now.

855
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,480
I'm heading to mission number one.

856
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,980
(If they succeed, they'll find out
where the case of money is.)

857
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,890
But I want to know
the passcode more.

858
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,950
Take me
to mission number five instead.

859
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,750
(She changes her mind.)

860
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,020
- Mission number 5.
- 5?

861
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,070
(Will the sticky partners
go their separate ways in 2020?)

862
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,100
I'll head right away
to mission number two.

863
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,140
- Sure, meet me here.
- Got it.

864
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,160
- Must we all gather first?
- Yes.

865
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,610
This is a mission for three,
so I called you and Jong Kook.

866
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,770
Gosh, this place
wasn't easy to locate.

867
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,670
- Jong Kook, hurry.
- Got it.

868
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,510
- We must succeed in this mission.
- Of course.

869
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,270
This mission will reveal
the first digit of the passcode.

870
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,410
The game is called
Catch with Your Forehead.

871
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,480
(Mission 2:
Catch with Your Forehead)

872
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,590
There are three different items
in these boxes.

873
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,920
You must stand before
an acrylic wall...

874
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,450
and catch the object
with your forehead.

875
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,960
At least two of you must succeed.

876
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
- At least two of us?
- Yes.

877
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,930
If you wish for another try,
you should eat a lemon slice first.

878
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,300
A lemon slice?

879
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,870
(To try the mission again
with the same members...)

880
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,930
(We had better get it done
in one try.)

881
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,580
Please choose your box.

882
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,930
I'll go first.

883
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,170
(Jae Suk chooses a box.)

884
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,440
- It's an easy one.
- It's a ddakji!

885
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,470
(It's a ddakji!)

886
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,470
- This is a done deal.
- We'll surely do this.

887
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,390
- Just two of us need to succeed.
- Got it.

888
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,150
(At least two of them
must catch it with their forehead.)

889
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,390
- Okay.
- Good.

890
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,090
Please kneel down first.

891
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,450
- Ready...
- Hold on.

892
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,860
(Once Jae Suk kneels down,)

893
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,420
(Kwang Soo gazes
at Jae Suk's name tag.)

894
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,130
(Glancing)

895
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,460
Just so you know,
when you knelt down,

896
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,570
Kwang Soo looked at your name tag.

897
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,570
- Seriously?
- It wasn't like that.

898
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,570
(A tattletale)

899
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,770
(So that you can
steal my case of money?)

900
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,410
I was only glancing.

901
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,970
What other reason do I have?

902
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,510
Ready, get set...

903
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,970
Jae Suk can do this.

904
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,320
(The ddakji drops.)

905
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,510
(Will he be able to...)

906
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,890
(catch the ddakji
with his forehead?)

907
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,560
(Did he catch it?)

908
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,830
(Groaning)

909
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,130
Go!

910
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,830
- Hold on.
- You failed.

911
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,690
What happened?

912
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,490
- Shall I go next?
- By the looks of it,

913
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,570
Jae Suk didn't want to succeed.

914
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,460
- I did.
- What's wrong with you?

915
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,140
- I didn't know how to do it.
- Ready...

916
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,410
(Jong Kook is next.)

917
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,270
(Will he be able to catch the ddakji
with the muscles in his forehead?)

918
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,940
- Gosh.
- What?

919
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,470
(He touched his forehead
for a split second.)

920
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,470
What was that?

921
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,670
Didn't my forehead touch the wall?

922
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,350
- It touched by then I lifted it.
- You did.

923
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,890
I lifted it off the wall. Why?

924
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,320
- Why did you do that?
- Because you're a snake.

925
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,680
I'm not!

926
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,450
(Because you're a snake.)

927
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,860
- You didn't want to get caught.
- That's not it. Let's try again.

928
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,450
- Again?
- We can do it.

929
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,460
(To try again,
they must eat a lemon slice.)

930
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,370
The one with the money
should eat it.

931
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,340
Darn it. Okay, I will.

932
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,340
Why did I lift my forehead?

933
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,670
(Glancing)

934
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,770
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

935
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,500
- Jae Suk.
- Come on.

936
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,870
You have the money...

937
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,170
and this all began
because you ran off with it.

938
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,580
(A ripping sound)

939
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,480
I'll eat the lemon slice.

940
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,420
This all began
because you ran off with it.

941
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,960
(A ripping sound)

942
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,560
- We've only just begun, you know.
- Unbelievable.

943
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,250
- He's too exhausting.
- We've only just begun.

944
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,390
(He eats a lemon slice
worth 1,000 dollars.)

945
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,770
Good job, Jae Suk.

946
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,500
(A ripping sound)

947
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,770
(Jae Suk has
the case of money again.)

948
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,210
You did a great job.

949
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,810
That was good.

950
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,140
- I'll choose the same box.
- Sure.

951
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,580
It'll probably be the ddakji again.

952
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,440
What's this?

953
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,790
- A card?
- This will be too difficult.

954
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,710
Ready, get set...

955
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,710
(The card
is too difficult to catch.)

956
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,580
- I almost had it.
- You almost did.

957
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,960
I shouldn't look elsewhere.

958
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,120
No, looking at it makes it easier.

959
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,890
- I told you to look at it.
- I guess you're right.

960
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,560
- Darn.
- Choosing the right object is key.

961
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,600
Kwang Soo.

962
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,500
(Kwang Soo, eat the lemon.)

963
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,540
What?

964
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,210
Just eat the lemon, Kwang Soo.

965
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,600
You're the designated lemon-eater.

966
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,040
It should be the one with the money.

967
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,140
I'll eat it.

968
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,140
(That was unexpected.)

969
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,440
(Too sour!)

970
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,440
- It's really sour.
- It makes your teeth ache.

971
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,980
It's the sourest lemon I've had.

972
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,850
(After sucking in a mouthful)

973
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,190
Jae Suk!

974
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,250
- Jae Suk, just a little bit more.
- Are you all right?

975
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,250
- Darn.
- You're almost done.

976
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,290
Gosh, it's sour.

977
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,420
(After a struggling last bite...)

978
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,460
(A ripping sound)

979
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,850
(His name tag gets ripped off.)

980
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,600
(Kwang Soo gets his revenge.)

981
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,460
(Another ripping sound)

982
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,960
(Are you done with your lemon?)

983
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
(Are you done
ripping off his name tag?)

984
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,270
You guys are exhausting.

985
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,770
The case of money
belongs to Jong Kook now.

986
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,480
- Right.
- Darn it.

987
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,140
Kwang Soo, you choose this time.

988
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,940
We should've ended this
with the ddakji.

989
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,690
- It's quite heavy.
- Nice.

990
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,520
- It's a mini chocolate cake.
- That's good.

991
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,960
Nice one.

992
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,850
Let's do this.

993
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,160
- 2 out of 3 is all we need.
- Kwang Soo, you're up.

994
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,290
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

995
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,850
Just get it over with.

996
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,560
Ready, get set...

997
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,500
We were too cautious before.

998
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,830
(The mini chocolate pie drops.)

999
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,390
(Will Kwang Soo be able
to catch it with his forehead?)

1000
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,310
Okay!

1001
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,460
(He caught it!)

1002
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,770
Nice. You did it.

1003
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,910
- That was great.
- My gosh.

1004
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,210
- Okay!
- I'll go next.

1005
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,980
Only one more of you
needs to catch it.

1006
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,980
You've got this.

1007
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,080
- Okay.
- You were a beast just now.

1008
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,290
Ready, get set...

1009
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,210
(Will Jae Suk be able to catch it?)

1010
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,330
(He bangs his forehead
and then his nose.)

1011
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,920
- Okay!
- Nice.

1012
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,020
(He caught it with his forehead.)

1013
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,560
- You did it.
- Are we good?

1014
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,770
I did it.

1015
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,270
Nice!

1016
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,560
(If there aren't
more than two snakes,)

1017
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,560
(they'll receive
the first digit of the passcode.)

1018
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,330
You successfully
completed the mission.

1019
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,410
If more than two of you are snakes,

1020
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,210
you will not receive
the passcode digit.

1021
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,710
- More than two of us?
- Right.

1022
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,580
- This will tell us who we are.
- Exactly.

1023
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,770
Among the three of you,
the number of snakes...

1024
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,480
(Jong Kook is a Running Man.)

1025
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,750
(If both of them are snakes,
no hints will be given.)

1026
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,750
(How many of them are snakes?)

1027
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,750
There are less than two.

1028
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,750
(The number of snakes
is less than two.)

1029
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,870
That's why you will receive
the passcode digit.

1030
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,690
(Either they're both Running Men
or only one is a snake.)

1031
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,390
One of you is a snake.

1032
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,460
(Jong Kook's radar is at work.)

1033
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,330
It really isn't me.

1034
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,480
I'm not a snake.

1035
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,600
See how close Kwang Soo is to me?

1036
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,170
- What are you talking about?
- You see it too, right?

1037
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,210
The first digit of the passcode...

1038
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,390
- is eight.
- Eight?

1039
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,710
- Eight?
- Eight? Let's write it down.

1040
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,850
(The passcode
that has been revealed so far.)

1041
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,390
I will give the case of money
to Jong Kook.

1042
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,660
- But...
- To me?

1043
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,270
That really hasn't
been my goal today.

1044
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,960
It's probably safer
in your hands anyway.

1045
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,270
- Right.
- Right?

1046
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,270
- Who would steal it from you?
- Exactly.

1047
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,370
- All right then.
- Let's head out.

1048
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,170
- We'll go and do another mission.
- Sure thing.

1049
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,270
Let's go.

1050
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,410
(The three of them
head to another mission spot.)

1051
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,870
(The location for mission number 1)

1052
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,940
(Se Chan is there all alone.)

1053
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,290
(He suggested to So Min
that they try the mission for 2.)

1054
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,790
(Sure!)

1055
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,560
(She changed her mind.)

1056
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,690
(He waits for his sticky partner not
knowing that she has betrayed him.)

1057
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,290
What if no one shows up?

1058
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,390
(Can he see the future?)

1059
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,960
(When will So Min be here?)

1060
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:36,460
Wait. She's here.
Of course, she should be here.

1061
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,670
She's here.

1062
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,830
(Did So Min change her mind again?)

1063
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,040
Hey, Cobra!

1064
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,850
(Hey, Cobra!)

1065
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,850
Unbelievable.
Did she just call me a cobra?

1066
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,520
Where's Se Chan? Is he here?

1067
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,580
- He looks...
- Yes, like a snake.

1068
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,210
- A snake.
- That's what he looks like.

1069
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,420
- Hold on.
- Look, it's Suk Jin.

1070
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,230
- There they are. Hi!
- Suk Jin!

1071
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,460
Greetings, partner.

1072
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,190
- Hi, guys.
- Welcome, my new partner.

1073
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,870
- You know...
- Are you a snake?

1074
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,290
Neither Team Snake
nor Team Running Man...

1075
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,270
is the villain today.

1076
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,410
- Do we need 4 people?
- We need 4 people.

1077
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,810
- Let's wait a bit.
- Let's wait.

1078
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,270
- Let's have some bread too.
- All right.

1079
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,100
- Okay.
- Let's wait inside.

1080
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,600
- Let's go inside.
- Jae Suk is calling me.

1081
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,710
- Tell him to come.
- Jae Suk.

1082
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,040
- Jae Suk is calling me.
- Tell him to come.

1083
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,670
- Jae Suk, we need one more person.
- Where are you?

1084
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,140
I'm at number five, the bakery.

1085
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,690
Listen, come to the spot for mission
number four by yourself right now.

1086
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,080
Mission four?

1087
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,160
Mission four?
All right. Where is it?

1088
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,290
(He tells So Min to come
to mission number 4 on speaker.)

1089
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,960
(Everyone hears it.)

1090
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,290
There are many snakes over there.
Come here by yourself.

1091
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,670
We're three people here right now.

1092
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,060
We need one more person
to carry out the mission.

1093
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,670
They're one person short.

1094
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,330
They're three people right now.

1095
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,210
Then I'll go to mission number five.

1096
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,170
You should hurry up.

1097
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,580
- We need to get the passcode.
- Right.

1098
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,140
I'll go find out the passcode.

1099
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,310
Okay, I'll come
to mission number five.

1100
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,480
- Okay.
- All right, see you.

1101
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,120
- He's coming here.
- He seems to be with someone else.

1102
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
He told someone
he'd find out the passcode.

1103
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,750
It must be someone he can trust.

1104
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,460
Ji Hyo, we need
to complete the mission...

1105
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,350
- and get the case of money.
- Let's do that.

1106
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,960
(To find out where the money is,
they have to complete the mission.)

1107
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,500
What's this?

1108
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,770
It looks pretty easy.

1109
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,540
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

1110
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,330
This mission is for two people.

1111
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,560
By completing this mission,
you can find out...

1112
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,830
either who has the money
or where the money is.

1113
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,830
It's called Extreme Times Tables.

1114
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,910
"Extreme Times Tables"?

1115
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,270
We'll ask you
multiplication questions,

1116
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,750
and you'll take turns answering.

1117
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,540
But you have to answer
the tens place correctly...

1118
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,960
and the ones place incorrectly.

1119
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,160
After both of you have answered,

1120
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,580
you have to say the sum
of the two numbers...

1121
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,100
within three seconds.

1122
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,330
I'm sorry, but I think
I'll go to another place.

1123
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,690
Me too.

1124
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,690
This is too hard. We're supposed
to say the tens place correctly?

1125
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,330
Yes, say only
the tens place correctly.

1126
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,560
This is driving me crazy.

1127
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,770
- We'll give it a try anyway.
- Let's give it a try.

1128
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,140
All right.

1129
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,980
<i>- Memorize your times tables
- Memorize your times tables</i>

1130
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,370
What's 3 times 4?

1131
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,620
It's 17.

1132
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,370
(Success)

1133
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,710
<i>- Memorize your times tables
- Memorize your times tables</i>

1134
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,790
What's 5 times 3?

1135
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,190
It's 21.

1136
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,210
(Fail)

1137
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,060
(5 times 3 equals 15.)

1138
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,350
- You failed.
- What did you do?

1139
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,660
I thought 5 times 3 equals 20.

1140
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,000
- What's "5 times 3 equals 15"?
- 5 times 3 equals 15.

1141
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,270
Right, 5 times 3 equals 15.

1142
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,230
What was she even asking?

1143
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,640
What a stupid question!

1144
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,040
What's "5 times 3 equals 15"?

1145
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,810
Yes, 5 times 3 equals 15.

1146
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,600
The last round was a mistake.

1147
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,640
- Give us another chance.
- What's "5 times 3 equals 15"?

1148
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,350
If you're ready, let's start.

- It's 35.

1151
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,390
You failed.

1152
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,520
- It's 38.
- You failed.

1153
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,790
It's 63.

1154
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,520

1159
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,640
(Success)

1160
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,540
3, 2, 1.

1161
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,000
(They need to say the sum, 115,
to complete the mission.)

- You failed.

1164
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,440
- What's the correct answer?
- It's 115.

1165
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,660
Gosh.

1166
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,520
(They're disappointed
in their brains.)

1167
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,690
(Here's your 5th lemon.)

1168
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,960
Ji Hyo, I think...

1169
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,460
either of us should leave.

1170
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,890
- We need someone else.
- Right.

1171
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,420
- Right?
- We need someone good at math.

1172
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,460
This is...

1173
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,190
Someone is calling me.

1174
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,460
- Hi, Kwang Soo.
- Where are you?

1175
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,480
I'm with Rattlesnake right now.

1176
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,330
Let's meet up.

1177
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,870
Let's meet up at a mission spot.

1178
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,250
The others are together right now.

1179
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,670
They're about to carry out
a four-person mission.

1180
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,140
We'll go to the other four-person
mission spot. Where are you?

1181
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,940
Where should we meet? Which number?

1182
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,440
- Mission number 5?
- Let's go to mission number 5.

1183
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,460
Okay.

1184
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,480
Let's go.

1185
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,120
- Let's go. We'll be four people.
- Unbelievable.

1186
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,830
(They didn't complete their mission
and leave for a 4-person mission.)

1187
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:53,420
(The members divide into 2 groups
and carry out 4-person missions.)

1188
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,270
I'm hungry.

1189
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:57,940
- Let's have some bread.
- I almost ate this.

1190
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,230
- Do you have any money?
- Do you have any money?

1191
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,330
Red bean paste and butter buns
are tasty.

1192
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,730
We have no money.
We can't eat anything.

1193
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,440
The staff will pay for it.

1194
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,810
- We have no money.
- They'll pay for it.

1195
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,140
Are you stealing it?

1196
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,410
- No. I have money.
- No.

1197
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,500
Let's get this too.

1198
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,980
- We should have this one.
- Let's get two of these.

1199
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,810
- So Min, I'm on my way there.
- Are you on your way?

1200
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,250
Please hurry up.
The snakes are eating bread.

1201
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,960
- What?
- The snakes are eating bread.

1202
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,980
What?

1203
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,830
The snakes are eating bread?
All right.

1204
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,750
(The hungry snakes
are gobbling up the bread.)

1205
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,390
She said the snakes
are eating bread.

1206
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,790
(The snakes must love food.)

1207
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,500
Jae Suk is here.

1208
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,100
I heard the snakes ate bread.

1209
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,810
If you complete this mission,
you can find out the 4th digit...

1210
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,830
and have lunch.

1211
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,480
It's called Blind Michelin.

1212
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,540
(Mission 5: Blind Michelin)

1213
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,870
There are 13 ingredients
including bibimbap ingredients.

1214
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,250
Without seeing the ingredients,
one member will decide...

1215
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:51,420
how many teaspoons, spoons,
or ladles...

1216
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,160
of each ingredient will be used.

1217
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,250
You can pass up
to three ingredients.

1218
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,600
If the four of you manage
to finish the dish, you succeed.

1219
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,290
You'll get another chance
if you eat a lemon.

1220
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,730
For example, you say, "5 teaspoons
of ingredient number 1"...

1221
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,060
or "1 ladle of ingredient number 8."

1222
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,670
- This is not good.
- We won't be able to enjoy it.

1223
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,940
Please pick one person
to play the game.

1224
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,670
I'll do it.

1225
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,250
You can do this!

1226
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,620
- Bring in the ingredients.
- Please.

1227
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,290
(The ingredients are
shocking and horrifying.)

1228
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,420
Gosh.

1229
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,460
Are those bibimbap ingredients?

1230
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,390
(There are both tasty
and scary ingredients.)

1231
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:33,020
Gosh, that skate smells so strong.

1232
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,730
There are ingredients
we absolutely don't want.

1233
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,500
- Gosh.
- What is that?

1234
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,500
You don't want
three ladles of anything.

1235
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,000
Okay?

1236
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,770
He probably can't hear me.

1237
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,170
I can.

1238
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,670
- You can?
- I just ignored you.

1239
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,170
(What Suk Jin said was too obvious,
so Jae Suk ignored him.)

1240
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,420
(How will their bibimbap turn out?)

1241
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,710
Let's get started.

1242
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,290
- This is bad.
- Let's go, Jae Suk!

1243
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,210
- Ingredient number one.
- Ladles!

1244
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,350
Ingredient number one.

1245
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,390
(It's rice, one of the basic
bibimbap ingredients.)

1246
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,390
- Ingredient number one.
- Ladles!

1247
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,730
(We want a lot of it!)

1248
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,020
- Ingredient number one.
- Ladles!

1249
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,170
- Please.
- Two spoons.

1250
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,500
(That's too little.)

1251
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,940
This is driving me crazy.

1252
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,580
(It's too little
compared to the size of the dish.)

1253
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,230
(Calm)

1254
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,710
- With some sauce...
- Ingredient number two.

1255
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,770
- Pass.
- Pass!

1256
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,670
For ingredient number two,
I'll use a teaspoon.

1257
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:25,920
Good. Put just one teaspoon.

1258
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,580
(Salt)

1259
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,040
- Three teaspoons.
- Gosh.

1260
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,480
(We're doomed.)

1261
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,750
- Gosh.
- It'll be too salty.

1262
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,230
Two spoons of rice...

1263
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,250
and three teaspoons of salt?

1264
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,690
(A generous amount of sodium
is added.)

1265
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,290
Ingredient number three.

1266
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,390
- Ladles!
- Ladles!

1267
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,540
Put all of it.

1268
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,000
One ladle.

1269
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,770
All right, that's not too bad.

1270
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,710
It'd balance out the saltiness.

1271
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:51,940
That's good.

1272
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,410
- One spoon.
- That's good.

1273
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,710
That's good. We need it.

1274
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,750
We need it.

1275
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,940
- Two spoons.
- Perfect.

1276
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,250
Two spoons of rice
and two spoons of gochujang?

1277
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,440
- How will it taste?
- All right.

1278
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,120
Ingredient number seven.

1279
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,520
(Next up, ingredient number 7...)

1280
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,560
(is wasabi.)

1281
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:09,920
This is important.

1282
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,000
Ingredient number seven.

1283
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,500
Put a lot. Put ladles of it.

1284
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,920
Wait, no.

1285
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,170
- What's ingredient number seven?
- Is that what you want?

1286
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,670
(So far, their bibimbap
is still edible...)

1287
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,910
(as long as they avoid wasabi.)

1288
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:25,270
(Will Jae Suk manage
to avoid wasabi?)

1289
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,410
Two spoons.

1290
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,640
(Generous)

1291
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:29,910
- What?
- What?

1292
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,020
Gosh, we're doomed.

1293
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,250
We can't eat it.

1294
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,250
- There's too little rice.
- It'll be too salty.

1295
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,480
Ingredient number eight.

1296
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,480
Fried eggs.

1297
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,480
- Put a lot.
- Put ladles of it.

1298
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,980
(Fried eggs might be able to
save their food.)

1299
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,230
- Pass!
- Gosh!

1300
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,170
(They explode their anger.)

1301
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,290
Seriously.

1302
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,460
Hey!

1303
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,170
(Jae Suk hears their complaints
over the music.)

1304
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:53,190
Seriously.

1305
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,600
Hey!

1306
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,310
That was the one thing
I'd been waiting for.

1307
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,600
We can pass
up to three times, right?

1308
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,230
Ingredient number nine.

1309
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,440
- Choose between numbers 9 and 10.
- There are tasty ones, right?

1310
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,920
(He has to choose
between skate soup...)

1311
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,420
(and beef and radish soup.)

1312
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,750
(What will Jae Suk choose?)

1313
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:09,850
I choose ingredient number 10.

1314
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,160
- Good.
- Okay.

1315
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,480
(Beef and radish soup is
a safer choice than skate soup.)

1316
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,120
(Beef and radish soup)

1317
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,290
We still have some hope.

1318
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,660
Choose between numbers 11 and 12.

1319
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,770
(It's either stir-fried pork
or stir-fried grasshoppers.)

1320
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,190
(What will Jae Suk choose?)

1321
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,190
I choose ingredient number 11.

1322
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,710
- Good!
- Good!

1323
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,980
It's not bad.

1324
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,710
Ingredient number 11, okay.

1325
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,210
Pass! You can pass up
some ingredients.

1326
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,980
(What's the last ingredient?)

1327
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,620
(Chocolate syrup?)

1328
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,080
Pass ingredient number 13!

1329
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,660
- Pass!
- Ingredient number 13.

1330
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,190
(What will Jae Suk choose?)

1331
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,520
- I'll use a spoon.
- Gosh.

1332
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,560
(This is a disaster.)

1333
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:51,830
Three spoons.

1334
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,520
(As many as 3 spoons)

1335
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,830
(They're about to eat
chocolate bibimbap.)

1336
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,000
(You eat all of it.)

1337
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,190
I'm out of here.

1338
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,290
Is it over?

1339
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,440
- We're in trouble.
- This is pretty bad.

1340
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,580
We have only two spoons of rice.

1341
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,310
- Only 2 spoons of rice.
- Only 2 spoons of rice...

1342
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,980
and three spoons of wasabi.

1343
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,410
There's salt too.

1344
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,350
But it looks all right, at least.

1345
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,580
- Let me see.
- It's assembled in a nice way.

1346
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,980
We have stir-fried pork too.

1347
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,310
- But...
- There's chocolate syrup too.

1348
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,190
Should we add the stir-fried pork
to the bibimbap?

1349
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,790
- Yes.
- Let's do that.

1350
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,020
- Let's make it less salty.
- Just a little bit.

1351
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,060
- Let's pour in some soup too.
- Just a tiny bit.

1352
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,560
- It's very tasty.
- Put a lot of it.

1353
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,230
Let's put some of this too.

1354
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,690
Let's try it.

1355
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,140
It looks pretty okay.

1356
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,290
Doesn't it look all right?

1357
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,330
It looks like Jeonju bibimbap.

1358
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:38,140
- Is it okay?
- What do you think?

1359
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,330
(So Min plucks up her courage
and tries it.)

1360
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,910
- Is it okay?
- Is it salty?

1361
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,770
The sesame oil balances it out.

1362
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,120
(It's better than they thought.)

1363
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,170
Does it taste good?

1364
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,620
- The sesame oil saved it.
- It tastes good.

1365
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,690
Gosh, it's too salty.

1366
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,710
It's too salty. We can't finish it.

1367
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,190
(The wasabi finally hits.)

1368
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:59,660
(Intense)

1369
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,230
(Their first try fails.)

1370
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,420
We can never finish it.

1371
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,960
Trust me this once.

1372
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,960
- Okay.
- Try it.

1373
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,290
We need to eat a lemon.

1374
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,100
- I will add a bit at a time.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1375
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,500
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1376
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,170
(Scissors, paper, scissors, paper)

1377
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,640
(Jae Suk and Haha lose.)

1378
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,770
- For goodness' sake.
- Eat a lemon.

1379
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,480
<i>Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1380
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,120
- I can't believe it.
- Will you eat it?

1381
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,020
What Sung Jun said was correct.

1382
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,730
- Seriously.
- The two of you...

1383
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,420
Jae Suk took my penalty.

1384
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,620
What he said was correct.

1385
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,520
I guess you like lemons.

1386
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,000
What he said about that jerk
was correct.

1387
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,440
(Getting angry
over the fortune told earlier)

1388
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,540
Seriously.

1389
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,310
Eat a lemon.

1390
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,540
The 4-person mission
for the 3rd digit of the passcode...

1391
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,980
is Add One More Syllable.

1392
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,210
(The 5th mission:
Add 1 More Syllable)

1393
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,310
Add One More Syllable.

1394
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,640
Listen to a syllable
from the production crew...

1395
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,980
and say a word that starts
with that syllable in succession.

1396
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:00,890
The words must have
2, 3, 4, and 5 syllables in Korean.

1397
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,960
For example, I could give you...

1398
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,230
- "Ga".
- "Ga".

1399
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,620
Yes. Say the words
to the beat like this.

1400
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,560
Purse, stingray,

1401
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,600
steamed stingray, and so on.
You add a syllable each time.

1402
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,000
- We say the words in order.
- That's right.

1403
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,230
Five-syllable word?

1404
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,870
Is there a five-syllable word?

1405
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,370
- Yes.
- I am sure they found it.

1406
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,210
That's right. Dasan Call Center.

1407
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,910
- Like this.
- Yes, that's acceptable.

1408
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:23,980
You are good.

1409
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,940
If you aren't a snake,
give a five-syllable word.

1410
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,020
We should switch positions.

1411
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,120
- Why?
- Three-syllable words are easier.

1412
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,580
Three-syllable words are easier.

1413
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,830
I am not looking down on you.

1414
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,790
- I just want us to succeed.
- I will give a three-syllable word.

1415
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,290
- I will sit here.
- Two-syllable word.

1416
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,420
- Give a two-syllable word.
- Okay.

1417
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,690
- Let's begin.
- Let's go.

1418
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,370
- Get ready, go.
- Get ready, go.

1419
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,000
<i>- 1, 2, 3, 4
- 1, 2, 3, 4</i>

1420
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,060
The first syllable is "Ga."

1421
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,000
- Ghana.
- Ganada.

1422
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,140
(Ganada?)

1423
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,170
(They fail
at the three-syllable word.)

1424
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,670
- Hold on.
- It's like the Korean alphabet.

1425
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,810
Ga, na, da, ra, ma...
I thought they would accept it.

1426
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:02,440
Ga, na, da, ra, ma, ba, sa?

1427
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,790
"Stingray" was the example
they gave us earlier.

1428
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,620
- I wanted to take it easy.
- Ji Hyo.

1429
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,290
Would you switch seats with him?

1430
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,290
Are you looking down on me or her?

1431
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,190
- I am looking down on you.
- Me?

1432
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,390
Say a two-syllable word.

1433
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,620
I can say a three-syllable word.

1434
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,940
I thought "Ganada" would work...

1435
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,230
- if I insisted.
- Okay.

1436
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:20,640
Let's try again.

1437
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,310
Since you failed,
eat a slice of lemon.

1438
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:23,870
Whoever messes up should eat it.

1439
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,080
- It's the logical solution.
- He got it wrong.

1440
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,330
(The member who said "Ganada"
eats a slice of lemon.)

1441
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:30,770
(He will get
a year's worth of vitamin C today.)

1442
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,190
I hate it.

1443
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,850
Go.

1444
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,810
<i>- Ga, na, 3, 4
- 1, 2, 3, 4</i>

1445
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,890
The first syllable is "Mi."

1446
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,020
Mi...

1447
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,350
(Incorrect)

1448
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:51,290
How can she fail to give
a two-syllable word? She is a snake.

1449
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,890
- I couldn't think of one.
- Eat a slice of lemon.

1450
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,000
Okay. I will do that.

1451
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:55,940
It's obvious.

1452
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,940
(Is she a snake?)

1453
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,710
I couldn't think of one.

1454
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,600
I think you are a Running Man.

1455
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,670
Of course, I am.
I am a Running Man.

1456
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,020
Se Chan is a Running Man.
You and Ji Hyo are snakes.

1457
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,350
My goodness.

1458
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,290
My goodness.

1459
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,460
I am sorry. I wanted to remove
the booger in your eye.

1460
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,730
Are you okay?

1461
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,920
I forgot I had lemon juice
on my hand. I am sorry.

1462
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,830
Okay. I found out
how you feel about me.

1463
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,040
I forgot.

1464
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,040
There was lemon juice on my hand.

1465
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:32,140
(Ji Hyo finishes eating a lemon.)

1466
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,540
- She is good at eating lemons.
- She is tough.

1467
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,270
Which four-syllable word
would you have given?

1468
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,580
I have one. Art academy.

1469
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,020
- How about you?
- Seaweed soup with rice.

1470
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,080
We could have ended the game.

1471
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,020
We can add "with rice."

1472
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,560
- That's right.
- We can add "with rice."

1473
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,460
- Okay.
- Adding "Academy" works too.

1474
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,160
I can give a four-character idiom.

1475
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,790
- You don't know any of them.
- Just you watch.

1476
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:53,750
- You make me laugh.
- Just you watch.

1477
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,460
- You don't know any of them.
- Just you watch.

1478
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,100
Okay. Let's go again.

1479
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,890
<i>- 1, 2, 3, 4
- 1, 2, 3, 4</i>

1480
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,960
The first syllable is "Ah."

1481
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:03,870
Dad.

1482
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,000
Father.

1483
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,410
Mister's place.

1484
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:07,830
Arirang Pass.

1485
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:10,580
- Mister's place.
- Arirang Pass.

1486
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:13,250
- "Mister's place" is ridiculous.
- Seriously.

1487
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,920
You little snake!

1488
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,120
- "Mister's place" is ridiculous.
- I couldn't think...

1489
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,290
of a four-syllable word.

1490
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:20,390
There is a four-character idiom
that means "Pandemonium."

1491
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,980
- There are so many words.
- Don't you know it?

1492
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:25,600
- There are so many options.
- This is pandemonium.

1493
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,620
Okay.

1494
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,020
You know,
I made a mistake with "Mi."

1495
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,790
- I am sorry.
- Give a two-syllable word.

1496
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,710
(There is pandemonium in his mouth.)

1497
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,210
My goodness.

1498
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,580
Let's resume right away.

1499
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,310
All right. Kwang Soo,
four-syllable words are easy.

1500
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:44,770
- Seriously.
- That's right.

1501
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,210
(Is he removing an eye booger?)

1502
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,940
That's right.

1503
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,250
Stop it!

1504
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,580
Oh, the lemon! I am sorry!

1505
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,730
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1506
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,690
(Please don't try this at home.)

1507
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,370
- Are you okay?
- You know,

1508
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:02,520
- Everything is brighter.
- Right?

1509
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,730
I am sorry.

1510
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,730
- I didn't have an eye booger.
- No.

1511
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,060
- I didn't have an eye booger.
- Your eyes looked dull.

1512
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,770
- Okay.
- Okay.

1513
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,410
(I need to wake up now!)

1514
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,710
- Let's go.
- Let's begin.

1515
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,370
<i>- 1, 2, 3, 4
- 1, 2, 3, 4</i>

1516
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,520
The first syllable is "Na."

1517
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,390
Country.

1518
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,480
Butterfly hairpin.

1519
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,580
Nai... Naijinman.

1520
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,660
(Incorrect)

1521
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,250
Jong Kook, I...
Please switch seats with me. Sorry.

1522
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,850
How could you fail to give
a four-syllable word?

1523
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,750
I am certain you are a snake.

1524
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:34,390
- I can't think one.
- I will bet my fortune.

1525
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:35,870
How many percent of it?

1526
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,100
I will bet all of it.

1527
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,600
You made it.

1528
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,440
- You can stop working now.
- I, Lee Kwang Soo...

1529
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,040
- You can stop working now.
- I finally made it.

1530
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,670
I finally made it.

1531
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:48,310
(Kwang Soo becomes rich
thanks to a mission.)

1532
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,980
Mom and Dad, I will be a filial son.

1533
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,890
- Let's resume right away.
- Let's begin.

1534
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,130
The first syllable is "Do."

1535
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,920
(The first syllable is "Do.")

1536
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,230
- City.
- "City".

1537
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,830
(Ji Hyo misses "Do"
even though it is relatively easy.)

1538
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,270
Hold on.

1539
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,940
- "City".
- Let's go. They are snakes.

1540
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,230
- Jong Kook.
- Let's go.

1541
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,880
Even if we succeed,
we won't get the passcode.

1542
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,880
- There is a hint.
- We won't get it.

1543
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,150
I want to know for certain
if the two of them are snakes.

1544
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,400
We know for certain.

1545
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,310
It makes no sense to mess up
a two-syllable word.

1546
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:28,380
(Are Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo snakes?)

1547
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,290
Use all three chances
to pass up an ingredient.

1548
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:32,520
- That's right.
- Yes.

1549
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,790
That's the only way we can eat
tasty bibimbap.

1550
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,880
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1551
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,020
Shall I choose
ingredient number one?

1552
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,600
(Ingredient number 1 is
the fiery chicken sauce.)

1553
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:44,460
(Please don't do that.)

1554
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,830
(Pondering)

1555
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,060
Pass!

1556
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,770
(He passes up
the fiery chicken sauce.)

1557
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,400
Ingredient number two. Hold on.

1558
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,480
(There are bean sprouts
and shredded white radish.)

1559
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,980
Ladles!

1560
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:08,920
Ladles! Two ladles!

1561
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:10,980
- Okay.
- Two ladles.

1562
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,130
- Two ladles.
- Did I do it right?

1563
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,270
- This is good.
- Ingredient number three.

1564
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,130
(Fried eggs
add flavors to bibimbap.)

1565
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,860
(Everyone stands up.)

1566
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,310
- Five spoons!
- Okay!

1567
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,360
That's good.

1568
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:27,170
(Haha screams out his picks,
but something is suspicious.)

1569
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:30,170
- All right.
- Stand up...

1570
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:33,020
Stand up if it's good.
Remain seated if it's bad.

1571
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,710
If something needs to be passed up,
run around.

1572
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,190
(Jae Suk ran around
for the fiery chicken sauce.)

1573
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:42,190
(He saw it
from the side of his eye.)

1574
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,690
(Everyone stood up for fried eggs.)

1575
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:48,060
(Brazen)

1576
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:51,330
(He pretended to guess
with intuition.)

1577
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,690
(It will be delicious.)

1578
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:55,730
That's good.

1579
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,900
Now, standing up is prohibited.

1580
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,270
- What?
- My legs hurt.

1581
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:01,040
- My legs hurt.
- Okay, okay.

1582
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,040
(He doesn't know
that they got caught.)

1583
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,580
Now...

1584
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,020
(It's time
for ingredient number 5, wasabi.)

1585
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,610
- Now...
- Ingredient number five.

1586
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,380
(He must pass it up.)

1587
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,150
Now, standing up is prohibited.

1588
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:17,690
(If they remain seated, Haha is
bound to have a few spoonfuls.)

1589
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:20,920
(Wasabi)

1590
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,790
(What do I do?)

1591
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,960
(With her body,
she tells him to pass it up.)

1592
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,460
My goodness.

1593
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,110
(Do I pass it up?)

1594
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,230
- Be careful.
- Why did you trip me?

1595
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,270
Pass!

1596
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:37,980
(She sacrificed her knees
and got a pass.)

1597
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,980
My knees hurt.

1598
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,110
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

1599
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:42,690
- Be careful.
- My goodness.

1600
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,210
She is in pain.

1601
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,860
Be careful. Get up.

1602
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,560
Be careful.

1603
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,560
That hurt.

1604
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:50,960
Ingredient number seven.

1605
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,500
(It's time for chocolate syrup.)

1606
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,560
(Everyone is remaining seated.)

1607
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,000
(Chocolate syrup could be worse
than wasabi.)

1608
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,830
(At that moment...)

1609
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,330
- I need to go to the restroom!
- Pass!

1610
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,270
(Is she going to the restroom
so suddenly?)

1611
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,380
Good job.

1612
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,610
So Min, are you going
to the restroom?

1613
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,650
- She was in a hurry.
- My goodness.

1614
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,580
Okay, okay. That was great.

1615
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:16,690
All right.

1616
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,880
(They manage to save bibimbap
from chocolate syrup.)

1617
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,980
All right.

1618
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,710
Choose between number 9
and number 10.

1619
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,250
Number 10?

1620
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:25,860
Number 10?

1621
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,520
(Jae Suk throws a water bottle.)

1622
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,650
Give him some water.

1623
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,830
- I choose number nine.
- Okay.

1624
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,500
Number 12?

1625
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,100
Number 12?

1626
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,210
- One teaspoon.
- Okay.

1627
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,040
- That was incredible.
- We can eat this bibimbap.

1628
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,710
- That was incredible.
- That was incredible.

1629
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,110
(They finished making
the Jeonju bibimbap.)

1630
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:44,250
- That was incredible.
- All right.

1631
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,350
That was incredible.

1632
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,980
- That was incredible.
- It looks delicious.

1633
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,540
It's proper bibimbap.

1634
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,690
Seriously.

1635
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:53,020
It looks amazing.

1636
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,060
(They enjoy the dish shamelessly.)

1637
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,790
- Is it good?
- It is.

1638
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,480
It's good.

1639
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,230
(The easiest mission is
to finish one bowl.)

1640
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,360
Gochujang.

1641
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,830
Let's add this too.

1642
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,400
This is actually good.

1643
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,290
Mission accomplished.

1644
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,500
As I have told you,
even if you accomplish a mission,

1645
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,710
if a majority of you are snakes,

1646
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,670
- you don't get the passcode.
- Correct.

1647
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,380
Among you, there is...

1648
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,920
(If Suk Jin is the only snake,
the passcode will be revealed.)

1649
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,250
(If there are more snakes,
the passcode won't be revealed.)

1650
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,480
a majority...

1651
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,110
(If there are more snakes,
the passcode won't be revealed.)

1652
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:26,960
of snakes,
so the passcode won't be provided.

1653
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,210
- This is insane.
- There are two?

1654
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,520
- You, you, and you.
- It's not me.

1655
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,790
However,

1656
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:34,750
I'll tell you
how many of you are snakes.

1657
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:35,770
How many?

1658
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:36,920
Among you, there are...

1659
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,600
- I think it's 2.
- It must be 2 because it's not me.

1660
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,600
- I swear it's not me.
- Among you,

1661
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,860
- there are...
- I'm a Running Man.

1662
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,860
Is it three by any chance?

1663
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,860
- three snakes.
- See? It's everybody but me.

1664
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,940
Is it three by any chance?

1665
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,040
(All but one are snakes.)

1666
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,350
- It's everybody but me.
- It's everybody but me.

1667
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,980
- You're a snake.
- You tricked me.

1668
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,150
Are you a snake?

1669
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,420
He's a snake.

1670
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,480
- You were a snake.
- You can't deny it.

1671
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,480
Snake, snake, and snake.

1672
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,790
I'm a Running Man.

1673
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,250
I'm the only one
who knows the truth.

1674
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,980
- I saw the mission.
- This is unbelievable.

1675
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,810
I'm the only one who knows this.
They're all snakes.

1676
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,130
I'm the only one who knows this
because I'm the real Running Man.

1677
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:06,500
- I'm the only one who knows this.
- I'm the only one who knows this.

1678
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,960
- Everybody but me is a snake.
- I'm certain.

1679
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,000
There are only filthy snakes here.

1680
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
- What did you say?
- Filthy snakes?

1681
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,540
(What did you say?)

1682
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,940
Filthy snakes?

1683
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,440
- You filthy thing.
- Hey!

1684
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,540
I was being easy on you.

1685
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,610
If you get angry, you're a snake.

1686
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:21,730
- I'm not angry.
- If you get angry, you're a snake.

1687
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:23,500
I'm not a snake.

1688
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,400
(Haha lost his temper...)

1689
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,520
(because he is a snake.)

1690
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,310
(When he found out he's a snake,
he went for the 4-person mission.)

1691
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:32,480
Snake So Min, Snake Jae Suk,
and Snake Haha.

1692
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:35,190
- What?
- I'm certain.

1693
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:38,060
I'm not sure about you,
so come with me.

1694
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,020
- What? Me?
- Yes.

1695
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,900
Regardless of who's a snake,
we need to find out the passcode.

1696
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,500
There's no point of talking about
who could be a snake.

1697
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,540
- Come with me, Mr. Snake.
- Okay, let's go.

1698
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,230
- I think...
- You were a snake.

1699
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,770
- Jae Suk...
- Everybody but me is a snake.

1700
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,630
It's the briefcase!

1701
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:54,940
- Don't get close.
- No, don't get me wrong.

1702
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,670
Look. Listen to this.

1703
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,020
Out of Haha, Suk Jin, Jae Suk,
and me, there are three snakes.

1704
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,670
Three snakes, but I'm human.

1705
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:02,710
- What?
- I'm human.

1706
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,810
Hey, stay back.

1707
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:05,980
- Are you a snake?
- Se Chan.

1708
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,860
Three were snakes.

1709
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,330
- 3 out of 4?
- I told you.

1710
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:13,190
- That's what I was saying.
- There are no snakes among us.

1711
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,250
There are no snakes.

1712
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,600
- What happened to you guys?
- There was only one.

1713
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,000
There was only one.

1714
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,830
(From the four of them,)

1715
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:22,440
(Jong Kook and Se Chan are
both a Running Man.)

1716
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,400
(Either Ji Hyo or Kwang Soo is
a snake.)

1717
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,980
- I'm human.
- It's either you or her.

1718
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,440
- Is it you?
- I'm human.

1719
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,500
I'm not.

1720
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,040
I don't think it's you either.

1721
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,810
(Jae Suk wants to know
what So Min's identity is.)

1722
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:34,670
So I'm going to find out
what she is.

1723
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,580
- I'm human.
- Come with us.

1724
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,610
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1725
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,980
I'll find out for sure.

1726
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,980
(They go to a different mission.)

1727
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,960
Give it to me.

1728
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,330
- Oh, dear.
- I'll keep it for now.

1729
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:44,420
(Jae Suk takes the briefcase
from Kwang Soo.)

1730
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,630
It feels better
not to carry the suitcase.

1731
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:47,790
Why?

1732
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:48,860
Stand next to me.

1733
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:52,020
(What? Why did she rip
his name tag?)

1734
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,900
- There's no point in doing that.
- It was just for practice.

1735
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,330
If you eliminate someone
without the briefcase,

1736
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:57,770
you get a five-minute time out.

1737
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,230
It's a rule.

1738
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,230
- What?
- Come this way.

1739
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:02,500
I explained the rules to you.

1740
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,900
- Come this way.
- Was I not supposed to do that?

1741
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,150
- You're not, but I'll let it go.
- Why did you do that for?

1742
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,020
- This is your fault.
- It's a rule.

1743
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,310
You have to pause for five minutes.

1744
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,110
- I didn't know.
- That was unnecessary.

1745
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,810
I didn't know. I had no idea.

1746
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,520
What was that for?
We're wasting time.

1747
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,790
We're standing
in the middle of the road.

1748
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,420
You should have avoided me.

1749
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,690
What are we doing?

1750
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:23,170
- We can't play without him.
- I mean...

1751
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:24,790
(They unnecessarily stop
for 5 minutes.)

1752
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:25,830
This is driving me nuts.

1753
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,330
- We can't play without him.
- What am I doing all day?

1754
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:29,330
(5 minutes pass.)

1755
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,540
(She's sorry.)

1756
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,440
Five minutes have passed.
You can start moving.

1757
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,440
- From now on,
- Don't do that.

1758
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,750
- stop doing weird things.
- I'm sorry.

1759
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,610
- My gosh.
- You need to have...

1760
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:40,850
a general understanding
of the rules.

1761
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:43,190
It took us so long to get here.

1762
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,580
- What's this?
- We're here.

1763
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,580
What's this?

1764
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,860
- What's this?
- Candies?

1765
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,630
(Why are there candies?)

1766
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,130
This 3-person mission for
the 2nd digit of the passcode is...

1767
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,520
Candy in My Mouth.

1768
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,020
- Candy in My Mouth?
- The person playing...

1769
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,000
has to roll a candy on the table...

1770
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,330
and get it in the mouth
of the person across from them.

1771
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:03,170
If more than two of you succeed,
you win the mission.

1772
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,460
- I'll start.
- Go over there.

1773
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:07,040
You can't move your face
once you get in position.

1774
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,500
- Open wide.
- You look like a snake.

1775
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,040
(He scored in one shot.)

1776
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,380
- This is how you do it.
- That's too bad.

1777
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,710
(This is how you do it.
You must say "start.")

1778
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,920
(You should have told us
in the first place.)

1779
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,980
Starting.

1780
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,480
(Jae Suk to Kwang Soo)

1781
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:28,330
(Rolling)

1782
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:29,900
Oh, gosh.

1783
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,630
- I couldn't finish it.
- Should we?

1784
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:33,330
Starting.

1785
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,130
(He tries it for real.)

1786
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,610
(It goes in.)

1787
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:46,350
Okay!

1788
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,850
We win if I succeed.

1789
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:50,290
- This one is new.
- Go ahead.

1790
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:52,750
(Kwang Soo to Jae Suk)

1791
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:53,810
Jae Suk.

1792
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,610
(Jae Suk!)

1793
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,250
Your teeth alignment is too...

1794
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,020
- Why does that matter?
- You have to go lower.

1795
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,150
Your front teeth are like a door
that's blocking your mouth.

1796
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,690
Right? His teeth are blocking it.

1797
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,230
You can't cross the line.

1798
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,830
(He rolls the candy toward
Jae Suk's impregnable teeth.)

1799
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,060
(Touch)

1800
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:15,980
(It touches his hand and goes out.)

1801
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,040
(He failed to cheat with his hand.)

1802
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,350
- You try it.
- Me?

1803
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:22,610
(If So Min succeeds,
they win the mission.)

1804
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,940
Jae Suk's mouth is smaller
than you think.

1805
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,610
- Roll it slowly.
- Starting.

1806
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,480
Don't roll it too fast.

1807
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,630
(She ignores...)

1808
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:30,980
(Kwang Soo's advice.)

1809
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,600
(It flies like a bullet,)

1810
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,730
(goes in,)

1811
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:37,730
(then bounces back.)

1812
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,060
- It went in.
- It almost did.

1813
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,790
- It went in, then came out.
- It went in.

1814
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:42,830
- My tooth broke.
- Jae Suk.

1815
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,630
I heard it.

1816
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:46,230
That was three cushion.

1817
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,520
(A masse shot is banned here.)

1818
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,210
It bounced three times.

1819
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,310
If I had dental implants,
I would have lost them.

1820
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:00,690
Fail. If you want to go again,
eat a lemon.

1821
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,020
Gosh, lemon.

1822
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,150
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's pick a person.

1823
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,690
- Okay.
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1824
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,000
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1825
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,520
Me?

1826
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:11,400
Hurry up.

1827
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,400
Hurry.

1828
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,940
It's vitamin C.

1829
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,630
Eat.

1830
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:23,900
Chew.

1831
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,110
Let's go again.

1832
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,210
I'll go first.

1833
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:28,670
You first?

1834
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:30,190
It's okay.

1835
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,520
I can eat it, but you're not even
paying attention to me.

1836
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,790
(He's fine with eating it.)

1837
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:35,150
(They're unconcerned.)

1838
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,250
- Starting.
- "Starting"?

1839
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:39,500
(We'll see about this, So Min.)

1840
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,400
How do I get it in there?

1841
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,330
(Fail)

1842
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,400
This is difficult.
His mouth is difficult.

1843
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:50,440
Let's use your mouth.

1844
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,130
Your teeth are closing the entrance.

1845
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:54,400
(They switch to So Min's mouth.)

1846
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:56,610
She has a big mouth.

1847
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:57,670
Good.

1848
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,380
- Okay.
- I'll do both.

1849
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:01,210
Can I succeed twice?

1850
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,790
- You can.
- Starting.

1851
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:04,880
(He'll roll and get two candies in.)

1852
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:12,790
Okay.

1853
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,420
(It's like she sucked it in.)

1854
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:18,000
(If he gets it in Kwang Soo's mouth,
they with the mission.)

1855
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,020
Starting.

1856
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:23,770
(Can Jae Suk give them the win?)

1857
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:30,150
Okay.

1858
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:31,150
(Goal)

1859
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,940
(It attacked his molar.)

1860
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,710
(This is a valuable win
that costed his molar.)

1861
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:40,380
Okay! We did it.

1862
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,150
(It's the three-cushion billiards
master's 2 shots, 2 kills.)

1863
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:44,960
- The mission was a success.
- Okay.

1864
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:46,190
This is the important part.

1865
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:49,360
If you are less than
the majority of snakes,

1866
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,860
I'll provide you with the passcode.

1867
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:52,900
I'll give you the second digit.

1868
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,040
Among you,

1869
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,230
I care about what Kwang Soo is.

1870
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,440
- there are...
- It's less.

1871
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,770
(If Kwang Soo is a snake,
they don't get the password.)

1872
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:00,330
- less than the majority of snakes,
- See?

1873
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:01,810
- so you get the passcode.
- Are you human?

1874
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,040
- I am.
- I told you I am.

1875
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,810
(Snakes are less than the majority,)

1876
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,850
(so Kwang Soo's identity is...)

1877
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:11,150
(Running Man.)

1878
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:14,960
(I would feel better
if I was a snake.)

1879
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,130
(Nobody trusts him.)

1880
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,420
(Then Ji Hyo's identity is...)

1881
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:24,630
(a snake.)

1882
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,630
(Did Jae Suk just meet
a fellow Running Man?)

1883
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,630
Kwang Soo, I'm human. He's a snake.

1884
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,400
We're human, human, and snake.

1885
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,400
(So Min is saying
she's a Running Man.)

1886
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,330
You know that I'm human, right?

1887
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,040
- Yes, you're human.
- You are.

1888
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,770
- I'm human too.
- I'm certain about you.

1889
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:39,400
- I'm certain.
- Because earlier...

1890
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,610
You're human.

1891
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:42,810
I'm not sure yet.

1892
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,440
- Kwang Soo, I'm human.
- Hey.

1893
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:45,980
- Come this way.
- Passcode.

1894
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,880
- Passcode.
- The second digit is...

1895
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,880
Second digit.

1896
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,330
- 3.
- 3?

1897
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:53,130
- Okay.
- Three.

1898
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,960
What was it?

1899
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,330
- The first one?
- We can't share.

1900
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:58,230
- I'm not sure.
- I'm human.

1901
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:00,130
(He goes to the back.)

1902
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:01,270
I'm human.

1903
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,170
What are you doing?

1904
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:06,400
(He crawls low
and secures his target.)

1905
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,540
Why did he steal it?

1906
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:10,040
- He didn't rip my name tag.
- He can still steal it.

1907
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,020
(He runs away.)

1908
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,670
Jae Suk might be a snake.

1909
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,380
If Jong Kook is human,
Jae Suk could be a snake.

1910
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,810
(Who out of Jae Suk and So Min
is a snake?)

1911
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,420
(So Min, who's likely a snake,
tries to call somebody.)

1912
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,230
Bye, snake.

1913
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,790
Snake.

1914
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:28,060
(They keep insisting
the other person is a snake.)

1915
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,030
- Yes.
- Kwang Soo, I'm human.

1916
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:32,160
With Se Chan...

1917
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:33,790
I'm human. I'm serious.

1918
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:36,910
I didn't even stop you.
It's better to have a human take it.

1919
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:39,410
You know, right?
Let's go for mission number six.

1920
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,440
- How many people?
- Five.

1921
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,500
- Because...
- Let's go there first.

1922
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:46,240
Tell Se Chan to come too.

1923
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,150
Let me call Suk Jin.

1924
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,990
(He hides the briefcase
before he goes inside.)

1925
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,410
(He enters the mission location.)

1926
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:55,450
Where is the briefcase?

1927
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,690
Don't tell people that I have it.

1928
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:59,120
- Where is it?
- I hid it.

1929
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,160
Where did you hide it?

1930
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,530
If humans win,
do they share the money?

1931
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:03,900
- That's right.
- Kwang Soo.

1932
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,070
I will believe in you.

1933
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:06,830
- You are human.
- The winner distributes money.

1934
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:09,130
- I am human. If you are human...
- Promise you will share money.

1935
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:10,700
- Of course.
- What will be the ratio?

1936
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:12,160
- 5 to 5.
- Okay.

1937
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,870
- 5 to 5?
- 5 to 5.

1938
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,630
- I will hide it here.
- Where are you going?

1939
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,950
(Glancing over)

1940
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:23,540
(Kwang Soo brings the briefcase.)

1941
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,990
(She takes off the name tag
from Kwang Soo's jacket.)

1942
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:27,190
Is it mine now?

1943
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,660
- Give it to me. Give it to me.
- What?

1944
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,420
(Ta-da)

1945
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,320
Give it to me.

1946
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:36,600
- Give it to me.
- I will take this to the end.

1947
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:38,120
I will put this on.

1948
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,740
I shouldn't have come here.

1949
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:40,790
(He regrets his decision.)

1950
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:42,660
Give it to me. Stop it.

1951
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,130
(Grabbing)

1952
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:45,940
Stop it.

1953
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,440
(How could you take off the name tag
from my jacket?)

1954
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,440
(This is the end of a deal breaker.)

1955
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,910
Stop it.

1956
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:54,040
My briefcase! My briefcase!

1957
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,910
My briefcase.

1958
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,910
(She tries to protect the briefcase
and name tag.)

1959
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,120
Stop it.

1960
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,860
My goodness.

1961
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,780
Hold on.

1962
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:06,080
You know...

1963
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:08,420
Know that I am human.

1964
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:09,920
I am human.

1965
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,620
- I am human.
- Firstly...

1966
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:13,200
Give it to me.

1967
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:15,030
Give it to me.

1968
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,700
Give it to me. Give up.

1969
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:18,160
If you stop, I will share the money.

1970
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,000
- Okay.
- All right.

1971
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,670
- Put it back on.
- Let's stop.

1972
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:23,240
Okay. I will put it back on.

1973
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,980
(They negotiate a ceasefire.)

1974
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,620
(I take it back.)

1975
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:29,410
(They rip off each other's name tag
endlessly.)

1976
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:35,780
(Putting on and taking off)

1977
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,820
Give up already.

1978
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,080
Give up.

1979
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,030
(So Min gives up first.)

1980
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,320
I am exhausted. I am exhausted.

1981
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,400
(The briefcase goes to Kwang Soo.)

1982
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,100
- I am exhausted.
- I shouldn't have entered this pit.

1983
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:48,440
- I can't stand her.
- Don't go.

1984
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,940
- Don't go.
- You are like a zombie.

1985
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,370
- Don't go.
- Get lost.

1986
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:53,130
(The end of the war)

1987
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:54,410
Hey.

1988
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:57,850
You need to trust me.
I am human.

1989
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,450
- Suk Jin.
- What is it?

1990
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:01,210
- So Min is insane.
- What?

1991
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:02,570
(He runs into Suk Jin,
Jong Kook, and Se Chan.)

1992
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:03,710
Here comes Jae Suk.

1993
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,850
We need to do a five-person mission.

1994
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:07,060
- Come in.
- Come in.

1995
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:08,860
So Min, why did you do that?

1996
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,280
- Hey.
- Jong Kook.

1997
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,080
This proves that I am human.

1998
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:13,790
In that case,

1999
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,250
the five of you should do
the mission.

2000
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:16,600
- That's right.
- I think...

2001
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,870
If you are human, it's likely
that Jae Suk is a snake.

2002
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,330
- You are right.
- I am a snake.

2003
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,440
Everyone knows that I am a snake.

2004
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,070
Let's complete this mission.

2005
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:29,740
The 5-person mission
for the 5th digit of the passcode...

2006
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,670
- is 5 in 10.
- 5 in 10?

2007
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:34,540
Complete 5 individual missions
in 10 seconds.

2008
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,170
If everyone succeeds,
the mission is a success.

2009
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,450
I can do this.

2010
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:41,360
(They try the missions many times.)

2011
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,690
(They succeed
the 1st 4 individual missions.)

2012
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:43,880
Good job.

2013
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,990
I succeeded so many times.

2014
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:47,490
(With the upright water bottle,
the mission ends successfully.)

2015
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:48,560
We did it.

2016
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:51,120
Before we hear the passcode,

2017
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,790
- he should leave.
- What?

2018
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:54,030
This is information for us.

2019
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:55,630
I played the game with you.

2020
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:57,330
Let's see if the snakes are
a majority.

2021
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,500
Are the snakes a majority?

2022
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,370
- No.
- No.

2023
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,000
- The snakes aren't a majority,
- I knew it.

2024
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,980
so I will give you the number.

2025
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:06,310
We got it.

2026
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:09,040
The 5th digit of the passcode is...

2027
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,950
- 2.
- 2. Okay.

2028
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,780
(The 5th digit
of the passcode is 2.)

2029
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:17,120
(Only two digits remain!)

2030
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,120
Where is the briefcase?

2031
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,160
(Kwang Soo goes
to pick up the briefcase.)

2032
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:23,230
(However)

2033
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:25,290
(I put it right here.)

2034
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:26,420
Did someone rip off your name tag?

2035
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:28,130
- For goodness' sake.
- What?

2036
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:29,460
Someone stole it.

2037
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:30,940
- Who took the briefcase?
- This is intense.

2038
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,030
No one leaves.

2039
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:34,200
(Everyone, stop.)

2040
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,610
(They get locked in.)

2041
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:36,910
No one leaves.

2042
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,170
- Where is the briefcase?
- Who is it?

2043
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:39,410
Who touched my briefcase?

2044
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:40,780
I was going to rip off
your name tag.

2045
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,820
- I don't know.
- I don't care who took it...

2046
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,710
as long as a Running Man wins.

2047
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,120
Me too. I don't care
as long as a human took it.

2048
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,210
But...

2049
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:50,190
Jae Suk went outside
when we played a game.

2050
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:52,380
(So Min suspects Jae Suk.)

2051
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:54,530
I went outside
since there were five people.

2052
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:57,070
I see. Jae Suk went outside.

2053
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:02,660
Think about it. I went outside
since there were five people.

2054
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,770
- The briefcase was hidden.
- Where was it hidden?

2055
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,410
When Jong Kook and So Min were here,
I hid it.

2056
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:09,240
- I had no idea.
- There is no way Jae Suk knew.

2057
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,670
Only Jae Suk had time.
He didn't play the game.

2058
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,820
I didn't know
where the briefcase was.

2059
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:16,540
Let's say we suspect Jae Suk
and remove his name tag.

2060
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,490
If he has it,
will he bring the briefcase to us?

2061
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:19,650
Yes, he will.

2062
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:22,860
If Jae Suk has it,
he will bring the briefcase.

2063
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,030
I don't have it.

2064
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,560
- Rip off his name tag.
- Rip off his name tag.

2065
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,790
If he doesn't have it,
you must pause for five minutes.

2066
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:29,420
- Only the person who ripped it off.
- That's right.

2067
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,870
You could drink coffee here
for five minutes.

2068
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:35,070
- Was someone here?
- I guess someone was here.

2069
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:36,370
I should call people
who aren't here.

2070
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,630
Why are you trying to leave?

2071
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:39,370
(Don't even try.)

2072
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,830
(Jong Kook blocks the door.)

2073
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:43,000
- Suk Jin is a snake.
- It must be him.

2074
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,240
- Let me make some calls.
- It's obvious...

2075
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,870
- that he is a snake.
- He hid it somewhere.

2076
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:48,780
- He hid it somewhere.
- Where is it?

2077
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,210
- Where did you put it?
- Shall I remove his name tag?

2078
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,450
Rip off my name tag.
I really didn't hide it.

2079
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,190
I will rip off Jae Suk's name tag.

2080
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,120
You... Fine. Rip it off.

2081
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,690
- That will tell us.
- If that proves my innocence...

2082
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:01,060
If you are wrong,
you will have to pause.

2083
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,320
- I will do that.
- Go ahead.

2084
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:04,070
Go ahead. I really don't have it.

2085
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:05,790
(Ripping off)

2086
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,290
- Bring it to us.
- Okay.

2087
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,630
Since Se Chan took off
Jae Suk's name tag,

2088
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:12,160
- he must pause for five minutes.
- I told you it isn't him.

2089
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,480
(Jae Suk doesn't have
the briefcase.)

2090
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,940
- It isn't me.
- Someone else took it.

2091
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,670
- Shall we go out?
- Suk Jin took it...

2092
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:20,740
or Kwang Soo told a lie.

2093
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,520
He is leaving with a smile. Get him.

2094
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:23,580
I can move, right?

2095
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,320
Rip off his name tag.

2096
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,820
Kwang Soo, pause for five minutes.

2097
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,380
- What?
- See? It isn't me.

2098
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,660
- What is going on?
- Where is my briefcase?

2099
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,950
- Hurry up and put it back on.
- Where is my briefcase?

2100
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,790
- Where did it go?
- I didn't take it.

2101
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:35,060
I...

2102
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:36,600
Kwang Soo's name tag got ripped off.

2103
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,960
So Min, pause for five minutes.

2104
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,990
- It isn't me. Who took it?
- Who took it?

2105
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:42,700
Who took it?

2106
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,460
- It isn't me.
- It isn't you?

2107
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:46,000
Suk Jin, pause for five minutes.

2108
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,110
- What?
- Rip off everyone's name tag.

2109
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,170
The one who took it isn't here.

2110
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,450
Jae Suk, pause for five minutes.

2111
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:54,040
- It isn't me.
- It isn't you.

2112
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,350
Haha...

2113
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,690
- and Ji Hyo didn't come here.
- When did they come?

2114
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:58,780
- What?
- Did they sneak in?

2115
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,780
- What? Haha!
- What?

2116
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,210
Haha and Ji Hyo...

2117
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:05,030
- didn't come here.
- When did they come?

2118
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:06,320
- What?
- What?

2119
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,600
Haha!

2120
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,370
(They spot Haha as he passes by.)

2121
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,400
(Speak of the devil.)

2122
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,490
- What?
- It's Haha.

2123
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:17,070
What?

2124
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:18,830
(He tries to figure out
what's going on.)

2125
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:20,070
What? What?

2126
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,480
(Jong Kook gets Haha.)

2127
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,150
He ripped off Haha's name tag.

2128
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,570
- All right, Jong Kook.
- What?

2129
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:27,670
We will bring you the briefcase.

2130
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,950
- Okay!
- When did you take it?

2131
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:34,710
(Haha was the culprit.)

2132
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:36,950
Hey, why did you...

2133
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,920
What is this?

2134
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:40,420
You should have done better.

2135
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,920
I was just passing by.

2136
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:43,730
- Why did you pass by?
- Why did you pass by?

2137
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:45,660
- How...
- Why did you pass by?

2138
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:47,870
This could have remained a mystery.

2139
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:50,130
- He isn't a snake, but a rat!
- Why did you pass by?

2140
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:52,660
I was passing by in a hurry.

2141
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:54,070
You...

2142
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:55,610
- We did it.
- When did you take it?

2143
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:57,350
- We will bring you the briefcase.
- Okay.

2144
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:59,070
Jong Kook.

2145
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:01,120
- All right.
- Jong Kook,

2146
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,950
- open it if you can.
- I will give it a try.

2147
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:04,350
I can't believe it.

2148
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:05,620
(Life is all about
the right timing.)

2149
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,750
What? Okay.

2150
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:08,120
(The briefcase gets delivered
to him.)

2151
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,780
(Two numbers are missing
from the passcode.)

2152
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:14,160
(He goes from 00 to 99.)

2153
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,320
This is...

2154
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:18,400
- Thank goodness.
- Five minutes are up.

2155
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,240
- Thank goodness Jong Kook took it.
- He is trying to open it.

2156
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,400
(He is solving the passcode.)

2157
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:23,810
You know the order, right?

2158
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:25,700
- Jong Kook.
- You just need two more numbers.

2159
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,570
- We need to stop the snakes.
- Are you trying the numbers?

2160
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,370
- Did you open it?
- No.

2161
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:31,980
Hold on.

2162
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,710
Did you open it?

2163
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:34,980
- Hey, you...
- It's not like that.

2164
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,240
- Hold on.
- We just want to check.

2165
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,120
- Hey, what is this?
- You need to trust me.

2166
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,210
- I am human.
- We need to complete the passcode.

2167
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:41,710
We need to get the orders right.

2168
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:43,210
- For goodness' sake.
- Go to the tree.

2169
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:44,750
Hey, hey.

2170
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:45,920
Human.

2171
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:49,950
(A tall zombie chases after him.)

2172
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:53,100
(Snakes and Running Man
are meaningless before money.)

2173
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,370
Hey. Hold on.

2174
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:56,160
- Let's split the money.
- 5 to 5.

2175
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:58,030
- 5 to 5.
- That's my term.

2176
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,810
If you betray me, I will chase you
to the ends of the earth.

2177
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:02,280
- It will be troublesome for you.
- Okay.

2178
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,670
It's 5 to 5. Okay.

2179
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:04,810
Let's try the numbers.

2180
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,610
There must be one, right?

2181
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:08,170
There must be one.

2182
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:11,580
(When will I try all the numbers?)

2183
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:12,780
Let's go this way.

2184
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:14,450
- What is that?
- He is coming! Hurry up!

2185
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:15,710
(What is that?)

2186
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:18,530
(Jae Suk shows up with a ride.)

2187
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,120
- Hey.
- Hey, Jong Kook.

2188
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,120
He is coming.

2189
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,490
I am human.

2190
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:26,570
(I'm a Running Man.)

2191
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:28,160
- Hey.
- So Min is a snake.

2192
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:30,270
We need to get him.

2193
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:31,530
- Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo.

2194
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:33,870
All of us are human.
You know that, right?

2195
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:35,330
(Pondering)

2196
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:36,370
Kwang Soo.

2197
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,700
He isn't human.

2198
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,070
(Inching closer)

2199
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:41,710
This is endless, Kwang Soo.

2200
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,870
Kwang Soo!

2201
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,620
(Blinded by money,)

2202
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,280
(Kwang Soo attacks Jong Kook.)

2203
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,380
(Aren't Jong Kook and Kwang Soo
both a Running Man?)

2204
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:49,560
Rip it off, Se Chan.

2205
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,250
- The briefcase.
- The briefcase!

2206
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,620
(Jae Suk steals the briefcase.)

2207
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:54,790
- The briefcase!
- No, the briefcase!

2208
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,620
(Take the money and run.)

2209
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,200
I give up.

2210
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,630
This is where I stop.

2211
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:02,790
Jae Suk is a snake!

2212
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:05,610
- Why is he so greedy?
- He can share the money.

2213
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:06,700
I give up.

2214
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,530
Jae Suk.

2215
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:09,870
Open one side.

2216
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,040
- Kwang Soo.
- Open one side.

2217
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,210
Okay. Stay there.

2218
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:16,410
I will keep my promise.

2219
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,350
Let's share the money.

2220
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:19,950
This is driving me crazy.

2221
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,880
So Min isn't human.

2222
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:24,730
So Min is a snake.

2223
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,380
I am serious.

2224
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:30,060
(Both of us are a Running Man,
so let's divide the money in half.)

2225
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,490
(Confused)

2226
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:34,400
(At that moment, Suk Jin appears.)

2227
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,770
Did you open one side?

2228
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:38,440
- You are a snake, right?
- What?

2229
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,870
He is a snake, right?

2230
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:40,910
(What is he talking about?)

2231
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:42,280
- I think he is a snake.
- He is human.

2232
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,570
I think he is a snake.

2233
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:44,740
What is going on?

2234
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:47,850
Take it. Take it and go.

2235
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:50,690
Take it. Take it and go.

2236
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:51,850
- Run away!
- Hold him.

2237
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,620
- Hold him.
- I am holding him. Run away!

2238
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:54,690
Hurry up and run away!

2239
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:56,490
- Run away!
- Catch Suk Jin!

2240
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:58,280
- Run away!
- We have to catch Suk Jin!

2241
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,580
Go and open it.

2242
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:02,900
He's a snake. He was a snake!

2243
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:03,990
Be quiet.

2244
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:08,770
(Jae Suk's identity is a snake.)

2245
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:14,200
(While everybody was busy
checking each other's identities,)

2246
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:17,670
(Jae Suk stole the briefcase.)

2247
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:21,850
(They didn't notice it was gone,
and they kept on playing.)

2248
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:24,280
(Jae Suk leisurely walked away.)

2249
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,380
Haha.

2250
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:27,690
Take this. You have to hide it.

2251
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:28,950
- Okay.
- Do you understand?

2252
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:30,990
I took it,
so they'll only question me.

2253
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:31,990
Okay.

2254
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,250
(This is what confused everybody.)

2255
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,450
He's a snake.

2256
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,860
- He's a snake.
- Be quiet.

2257
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,400
- So Min is a Running Man!
- Be quiet.

2258
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:39,770
Quiet.

2259
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,030
(Snake Suk Jin earns a chance
to take it all thanks to Jae Suk.)

2260
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:47,440
(He tries numbers from 00 to 99
for the remaining 2 digits.)

2261
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:48,870
- Where did they go?
- Where are they?

2262
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,610
- Maybe they didn't open it yet.
- 8, 3, 2...

2263
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,240
What's the passcode by the way?

2264
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:54,870
Where did he go?

2265
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,080
Where is he?

2266
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:02,210
I can figure this out. 2, 0, 8, 3...

2267
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:03,620
And one.

2268
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,250
Have you seen Suk Jin?

2269
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:07,560
- He went that way.
- Thank you.

2270
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:11,200
One... This is taking too long.

2271
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,940
(Where is he hiding?)

2272
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:18,530
(At that moment,)

2273
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:19,910
(he finds Suk Jin.)

2274
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:22,570
Hey! This is taking too long.

2275
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,850
(He's shocked.)

2276
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,280
Hey!

2277
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,910
Goodness.

2278
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:33,120
(Kwang Soo ripped Suk Jin's
name tag off and takes the case.)

2279
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:35,490
Se Chan!

2280
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,060
Se Chan!

2281
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:39,530
- Throw it.
- Jong Kook!

2282
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:40,750
Throw it!

2283
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:42,660
Here. Go.

2284
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:46,160
Jong Kook! Come here. Jump.

2285
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,240
- Hurry.
- Come.

2286
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:49,790
- Sit. Put your back on the bench.
- Unlock it.

2287
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:51,330
8, 3, 2...

2288
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:54,240
(They guess random numbers.)

2289
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:55,570
What?

2290
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:56,870
Tell them.

2291
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,070
- It's open.
- It's open.

2292
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,740
- Not here.
- Oh, gosh.

2293
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:02,520
What's going on?

2294
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:05,040
- Hold on. Hurry up.
- Stop them.

2295
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,490
(Stop the other team!)

2296
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:07,580
Okay.

2297
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,420
(They open the briefcase with
passcode 8, 3, 6, 1, 2, 0.)

2298
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,560
- Okay.
- We opened it.

2299
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,660
- We can do it.
- Calm down, Kwang Soo.

2300
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:16,920
- Wait.
- Kwang Soo!

2301
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,320
We're on the same team.
We're all a Running Man!

2302
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,570
- We're all a Running Man.
- They're snakes.

2303
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:20,790
- Get rid of these snakes.
- Move.

2304
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:22,200
- Catch the snakes. Open it.
- Move them.

2305
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,940
- Open it.
- I will.

2306
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,310
Open it. Open it first. 1, 2...

2307
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:29,440
(The briefcase finally opens up.)

2308
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:30,540
Hold on.

2309
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:32,870
(Kwang Soo screams
after squeezing his hand in.)

2310
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:34,410
- Hold on.
- Hey.

2311
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:36,670
- Let go.
- I will.

2312
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:38,620
- I let go.
- Let it go.

2313
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:41,320
(He tries to seize it again.)

2314
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,880
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

2315
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:46,320
- The snakes are coming!
- I let go.

2316
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:48,120
- My hand is stuck.
- What's going on?

2317
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,730
(Grabbing)

2318
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:53,070
(Did Haha take the prize money?)

2319
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:54,070
What?

2320
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,700
- My hand is stuck.
- What's going on?

2321
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,440
(He steals it from Kwang Soo
at the last minute.)

2322
01:21:58,940 --> 01:21:59,960
What?

2323
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,500
(Race is over.
Haha took it, so the snakes win.)

2324
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:05,650
What happened?

2325
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:07,520
Kwang Soo.

2326
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,170
Kwang Soo.

2327
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:11,120
- This is amazing.
- You really are a snake.

2328
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:14,020
The victory goes to the snakes.

2329
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,020
Yes, snakes.

2330
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,210
(It's a sneaky win by the snakes.)

2331
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:18,280
We should have divided it
among ourselves.

2332
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,700
Why were you attached to
a small sum of money?

2333
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:22,530
- Leave.
- What?

2334
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,870
Humans, leave.

2335
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,600
You're sneakier than snakes.

2336
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,660
(It's an unfortunate ending
for the sneaky humans.)

2337
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:33,110
Anyhow, Haha's the one
who took the money at the end.

2338
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:35,240
- Haha was a snake. Snakes win.
- That was insane.

2339
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,280
He was a snake.

2340
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,410
- We almost had it.
- Luck just follows me.

2341
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:40,780
- Kwang Soo.
- If you weren't greedy.

2342
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,370
What's wrong with you?

2343
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:45,850
I thought you were human.
You were a snake.

2344
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:49,410
You're human,
but why do you live like a snake?

2345
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:51,230
- Loach.
- I don't even know.

2346
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,660
- You live like a snake.
- I don't know why.

2347
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:57,420
- Haha won the money,
- How should I do this?

2348
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,870
so please distribute it...

2349
01:22:58,870 --> 01:23:01,270
with the rest of your team
in any way you want.

2350
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:02,790
It's the new year,
so you have to be nice.

2351
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:05,630
I'm going to do well
for five years anyway.

2352
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:06,910
- Yes.
- Right.

2353
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,200
- Thank you!
- Here you go.

2354
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,670
- Good work.
- Thank you!

2355
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:10,870
- Thank you.
- Let's try our best.

2356
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:12,450
- I'll try my best!
- All right.

2357
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:15,980
I wish you a long life.
You have a lot to achieve.

2358
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:16,980
(He wishes Suk Jin a long life.)

2359
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,320
- 250 dollars.
- Thank you!

2360
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,280
I'll buy some tonic.

2361
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,620
(I'll take care of my health!)

2362
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,620
- What did he say?
- He's a disloyal subject.

2363
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,990
- Tonic.
- Yes, you have to be healthy.

2364
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:29,450
- Be happy!
- Thank you!

2365
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:30,990
This side now.

2366
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:32,730
- Take this.
- Oh, dear.

2367
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:33,990
Thank you!

2368
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:35,400
- Thank you.
- Us?

2369
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:37,700
- Us?
- Take it. I feel like it.

2370
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:39,770
- Is this extra money?
- Producers.

2371
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:41,670
- What's going on?
- Why are you being nice?

2372
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:42,810
- What's going on?
- Why are you doing this?

2373
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:45,810
I'm going to do well for five years.

2374
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,540
Writers,
you should go for a team dinner.

2375
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,910
- What's this?
- We all have to give it up.

2376
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,690
We all have to do it.

2377
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:54,580
Put it together.

2378
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,060
You should have a team dinner.

2379
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:57,450
Team dinner!

2380
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:58,820
My gosh.

2381
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:00,900
Team dinner!

2382
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,230
Chan Hee, you should get some tonic.

2383
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,730
Chan Hee, you should get some tonic.

2384
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:07,630
(He reluctantly gives it up
to the only person who's older.)

2385
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:09,790
(Thank you, Suk Jin.)

2386
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:11,740
- This is great.
- This is funny.

2387
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:14,000
- This is great.
- This is warm.

2388
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,130
(This is a fake laugh.)

2389
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:17,370
Chan Hee, eat some eels.

2390
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:19,700
I'm happy
we are ending on a cheerful note.

2391
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,620
- This is a heartwarming ending.
- It's warm.

2392
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:23,170
We didn't intend it.

2393
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:25,520
The Year of the Metal Rat has come.

2394
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,490
- Viewers, happy new year!
- Happy new year!

2395
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:30,580
(To all viewers who love
Running Man, happy new year.)

2396
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:32,450
(The thieves are here!)

2397
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,420
(Our target?)

2398
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:36,400
(Tear of Yondu!)

2399
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:40,530
(The legendary safecracker and
the cold-blooded hacker break in.)

2400
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:44,030
(Rookie thief Park Ha Na
and a petty thief who dresses up)

2401
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:47,630
(They only get 3 hours
in the ultra-luxury mansion.)

2402
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:52,040
(There are 9 thieves,
but only one piece of jewelry.)

2403
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:55,740
(There are traps lurking
inside the mansion to lure them.)

2404
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:57,950
(However)

2405
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:00,880
(Are there mysterious eyes
on the thieves?)

2406
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,780
(They're being watched through
hidden lenses.)

2407
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:07,250
(They hold their breaths.)

2408
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:09,530
(They must hide from surveillance
and steal the Tear of Yondu.)

2409
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,490
- It worked.
- Stop lying.

2410
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:13,290
(The Thieves: Tear of Yondu)
