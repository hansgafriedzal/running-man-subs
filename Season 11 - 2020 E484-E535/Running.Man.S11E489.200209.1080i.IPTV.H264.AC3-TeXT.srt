1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,100
- Okay.
- Hello.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,720
- Hello.
- Hi.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,340
I heard Suk Jin has
very good news.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,120
- I know.
- What news?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,290
- I don't know what it is.
- You posted about our show...

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,690
on social media
even before it was aired.

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,050
That's right.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,090
(Suk Jin spoiled the losers on
his social media before the show.)

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,700
- That's right.
- I saw that too.

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,090
How could he do that? My gosh.

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,640
I feel really bad, and I apologize
to the production crew.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,840
We shot it a while ago,
so I thought it was already aired.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,000
It's not like you're new
to variety shows.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
- So Min and I...
- You're not supposed to say that.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,210
You can't say that.
It's the spoiler.

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,470
No, it's not. The episode is aired,
so it doesn't matter.

17
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,420
Oh, really?

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,580
Will you pull yourself together? You
don't do things that you should do.

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,920
And you do what you're
not supposed to do.

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,210
- He never listens to others.
- Is he a green frog or what?

21
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,320
- Why did you do it?
- You know what?

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,990
I completely had no idea.

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,790
But about 30,000 people
read it immediately.

24
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,500
A lot of people read the post.

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,570
And they all said the same thing.

26
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,690
"Suk Jin, no!" "Spoiler alert."

27
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,360
- Please...
- They all said that.

28
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,110
"Suk Jin, no. Spoiler alert."

29
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,960
"Get it together, Suk Jin."

30
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,540
(Ji Suk Jin,
384,264 people like this post.)

31
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,180
What's funnier is
when I called him right away.

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,910
"Suk Jin." I said.
And he answered, "Hey, Chul Min."

33
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,580
"I just saw
your social media." I said.

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,520
"Did you? It's funny, isn't it?"

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,660
(Did you? It's funny, isn't it?)

36
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,160
Gosh, he's so tactless.

37
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,750
- He has no wit.
- My gosh.

38
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,250
(I thought he called me
because he liked my post.)

39
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,690
My gosh. So I deleted it right away.

40
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,800
(And there's a rising star
who's as popular as Suk Jin.)

41
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,070
Se Chan and Se Hyeong are
doing something together...

42
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,990
- On YouTube.
- on YouTube.

43
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,910
And it was categorized
as a kids' channel.

44
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,910
That's right. They think
it's a kids' channel.

45
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,910
- Really?
- Why?

46
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,350
- Why is that?
- Se Hyeong and you?

47
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,550
Is it a kids' channel?

48
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,220
Those who are in charge
watched their channel...

49
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,180
and thought it was for children.

50
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,820
- It's not like that.
- They looked like kids.

51
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
Their faces were automatically
recognized by the computer.

52
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,990
And it was categorized
as a kids' channel.

53
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,380
So you can't write comments
on their videos.

54
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,330
- Really?
- You can't. It's blocked.

55
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,300
- You can't leave comments?
- No.

56
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,970
(The video only has
childish mischief...)

57
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,160
(with a lot of screaming.)

58
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,410
(It's obviously a kids' channel.)

59
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,340
So we are classified as kids.

60
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,380
Isn't it good?

61
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,570
- Why?
- It's good. It sounds cute.

62
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,000
People say we look young.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,170
They play pool in the video.
How would they look like kids?

64
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,070
(Kids who play pool
eating some jjajangmyeon?)

65
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,350
I mean, just one video.
You're right.

66
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,380
There's a vlog.

67
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,160
- That's right.
- I'm talking about the vlog.

68
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,030
It's cute though.

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,560
Before we start today's race,

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,850
I asked you to bring something
meaningful to give someone...

71
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,760
and something you couldn't throw out
but wouldn't mind...

72
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,100
- if someone else did.
- Yes.

73
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,230
Let's find out
what you brought first.

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,760
I brought something
that's really useful.

75
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,630
- Me too.
- I brought something good.

76
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,970
- What's that? It's too big.
- To be honest,

77
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,570
I wanted to bring a treadmill.

78
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,410
Gosh, what's this? It's so big.

79
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,280
- This is so...
- Gosh, what is this?

80
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,410
Is this what Ji Hyo brought?

81
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,010
- Is there a person in it?
- Is it a motorcycle?

82
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,220
- Isn't this a motorcycle?
- No.

83
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,560
Is it a bicycle or what?

84
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,620
Hey.

85
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,980
(He just can't
stop spoiling things.)

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,100
Can't you pretend not to know it?

87
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,500
What is this?

88
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,030
- Is it a bicycle?
- I don't know.

89
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,190
He spoiled it again.

90
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,870
He just did it again.

91
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,440
He spoiled it again.

92
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,660
Is it a bicycle for kids?

93
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,340
- Spoiler alert.
- He did it again.

94
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,500
I like that character.

95
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,970
- There's only one.
- How did you bring a bicycle?

96
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,670
- Let's take a look.
- Okay.

97
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,750
- Please open it one by one.
- What is it? I want that one.

98
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,410
- Open the meaningful gift first.
- This is meaningful.

99
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,850
This is a meaningful gift.
I've given it a lot of thought.

100
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,560
I brought this
with one person in mind.

101
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,690
I have this in my restaurant.

102
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,000
- It's so...
- What is it?

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,190
(What is it that he has
in his restaurant?)

104
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,470
Let me tell you what it is.

105
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,220
(He brought it
thinking about one person.)

106
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,260
What is it?

107
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,570
(What's his meaningful gift?)

108
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,940
- This is it.
- I knew it.

109
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,440
I like to drink alone these days.

110
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,700
What is that?

111
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,880
That's...

112
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,070
I know what it is.

113
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,250
If you stick a bottle on it
and put a glass under it,

114
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,070
it pours you drinks.

115
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,720
(It's a drink dispenser
for those who drink alone.)

116
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,120
(This isn't PPL.)

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,510
It doesn't feel right
to pour yourself a drink, right?

118
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,250
But this makes it feel like
someone poured you one.

119
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,920
- That's right.
- I don't feel lonely.

120
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,320
I brought this...

121
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,790
- thinking about So Min.
- Me?

122
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,870
(Why did he bring
a drink dispenser for So Min?)

123
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,430
(Kwang Soo recited a poem
for So Min in Episode 471.)

124
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,510
(She has terrible drinking habits.)

125
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,300
(I saw you were rolling
your eyes drunk.)

126
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,580
(He revealed
her terrible drinking habits.)

127
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,670
No.

128
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,810
You got it wrong.

129
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,110
- I don't like to drink alone.
- I see.

130
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,240
(It's a lie.)

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,520
Shall we take a look
at the meaningless gift?

132
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,790
- What is it?
- Why is it so big?

133
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,890
- Isn't it a tent?
- No. This is...

134
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,790
something I treasured.

135
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,420
- I didn't want to get rid of this.
- You should...

136
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,920
pay money to throw out
something like this.

137
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,330
That's why I brought this.

138
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,120
- You need to pay to throw that out.
- You need a ticket.

139
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,290
- That's right.
- It's too big.

140
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,540
You're using our show to save money.

141
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,510
- To save 3 dollars?
- It's only 3 dollars.

142
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,080
- Gosh, Haha.
- Some people...

143
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,670
- might like it.
- What is it?

144
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,140
It's very meaningful.

145
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,670
- What is it?
- What's that?

146
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,540
- Gosh, what is this?
- It's Kim Jong Kook and Haha.

147
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,240
- There he goes again.
- It's our restaurant.

148
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,680
This is Jong Kook and this is me.

149
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,260
I just couldn't throw it away.

150
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,160
There he goes again.

151
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,160
- He's promoting the restaurant.
- This is PPL.

152
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,830
- Just throw it away.
- Hey, what's that?

153
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,420
This is the worst.

154
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,660
(He brought something
he wants to throw away.)

155
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,790
That's good.

156
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,200
Hey, it's nice.

157
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,040
It looks cute. It's cute.

158
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,710
- It's so cute.
- I know.

159
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,210
If you find it cute, scream.

160
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,540
(Screaming)

161
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,670
(His business partner is satisfied.)

162
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,280
- My gosh.
- It's cute.

163
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,610
- Is this Jong Kook?
- Yes, it's Jong Kook.

164
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,150
Jong Kook doesn't have
big eyes like this.

165
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,310
Are they big?

166
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,390
This needs to get changed.

167
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,220
Gosh, it's so cute.

168
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,460
That's ridiculous.

169
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,350
(Booing)

170
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,490
Just throw it away.

171
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,770
- People are dying to have this.
- Throw it away.

172
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,490
- It's so cute.
- Throw it out.

173
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,270
If you put it on the wall
and get an LED light,

174
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,860
- It's cute.
- It makes a good mood light.

175
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,160
That's true.

176
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,640
I brought something
that you would like.

177
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,010
- That's right.
- That sounds good.

178
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,470
Jae Suk brings something good
at a time like this.

179
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,310
This is also very meaningful
and easy to carry around.

180
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,910
It's not hard to take home.

181
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,020
All right.

182
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,760
You guys will love this.
This is popular these days.

183
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,480
(I see.)

184
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,220
(It's hot these days.)

185
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,160
(It's his album.)

186
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,530
It's called the Yu San Seul set.

187
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,270
(An assorted gift set
of Yu San Seul's goods)

188
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,360
We all are trying
to promote our business.

189
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,300
Why are you promoting
yourself on Running Man?

190
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,230
No. My parents would want this.

191
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,580
I can sign it for you.

192
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,780
Where's the bottle opener?

193
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,850
This isn't what you can buy.

194
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,580
- What did you say?
- I said a bottle opener.

195
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,220
- Where's the bottle opener?
- This isn't what you can buy.

196
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,290
What did you say?

197
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,950
(How dare you say that?)

198
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,150
Why are you being so sensitive?

199
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,310
A bottle opener.

200
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,460
(He's sensitive about Yu San Seul.)

201
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,790
I'm sorry.

202
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,460
Those are hard to get.

203
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,290
They are really popular.

204
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,200
All right, everyone.

205
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,860
I didn't bring anything useless...

206
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,530
- for what I want to get rid of.
- Really?

207
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,540
It's easy to carry around.

208
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,840
- Again?
- And...

209
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,710
I brought what you'd
find useful this season.

210
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,300
(A must-have item for this season)

211
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,510
What is this?

212
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,150
(A Halloween bucket)

213
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,810
- What?
- What's that?

214
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,350
(Unbelievable)

215
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,910
- What is that?
- Halloween is...

216
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,220
in October.

217
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,620
You just brought
what Ji Ho threw out.

218
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,660
What's that thing?

219
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,180
- Isn't it a chamber pot?
- No.

220
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,420
It's so insignificant.

221
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,720
Why would you say that?

222
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,920
- My gosh.
- I told you before.

223
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,160
There must be something else.

224
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,540
- There's nothing. That's it.
- Is that it?

225
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,360
- That's it.
- Unbelievable.

226
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,840
Isn't this nice?

227
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,300
You can use it when you paint.

228
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,100
To wash brushes.

229
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,510
(Laughing)

230
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,600
He's racking his brains.

231
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,020
And when you don't have much time...

232
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,470
and you don't need to buy much,
you can use this.

233
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,150
It's like a shopper bag.

234
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,740
You can use it as a shopper bag.

235
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,480
This isn't a shopper bag.

236
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,550
- It's plastic.
- Stay quiet.

237
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,030
What if Ji Ho wants it back?

238
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,460
- Does he know about this?
- To be honest,

239
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,560
Na Eun tried to take this back.
So I had to hide it.

240
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,220
- I had to give her something else.
- Seriously?

241
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,270
Yes.

242
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,430
I told Ji Ho about this.

243
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,660
He said he doesn't need it anymore.

244
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,470
- Ji Hyo.
- I'm curious about this. It's big.

245
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,170
- It's the biggest one.
- It looks like a motorcycle.

246
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,580
For a meaningful gift,

247
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,470
I brought this
thinking about So Min and Suk Jin.

248
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,850
Because Suk Jin is always...

249
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,910
- jealous of Jong Kook's thighs.
- Isn't this a motorcycle?

250
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,290
He was always jealous.

251
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,710
- And...
- It's really big.

252
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,050
- Wait. This is...
- Gosh, this is...

253
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,550
- It's a bicycle.
- This is nice. Are you sure?

254
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,160
(Suk Jin was right about that.)

255
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,530
- Is it a good one?
- It's really good.

256
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,140
Ji Hyo, I want this. Hey, Ji Hyo.

257
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,770
- This is really good.
- I want this.

258
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,740
This is mine.

259
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,780
- I wanted to buy a bicycle.
- This is expensive.

260
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,110
Why would you give this to us?

261
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,570
Ji Hyo, did you steal it?
It has a lock.

262
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,940
(It has a lock on it.)

263
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,480
Ji Hyo, I want this bicycle.

264
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,580
No, wait.

265
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,250
- I will ride it.
- Wait.

266
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,660
- It has her name on it.
- I'll take this.

267
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,890
This is new.

268
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,160
(Are you sure it's your bicycle?)

269
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,660
This is a road bike.

270
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,690
Gosh, this is good.

271
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,690
- Where are you going?
- He's so mischievous.

272
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,190
- Where are you going?
- Hey!

273
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,790
(The mischievous boy
steals the bicycle.)

274
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,540
He's so mischievous.

275
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,800
- Where are you going?
- Hey!

276
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,140
(He leaves the studio.)

277
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,200
- Jae Suk.
- This is...

278
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,700
You might get hurt.

279
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,150
It's perfect for your legs.

280
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,650
- Ji Hyo, when did you buy this?
- This?

281
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,440
Ji Hyo, what's this number?

282
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,910
You stole it. I'm sure she stole it.

283
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,410
Did she paint it?

284
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,760
- Does she still do that?
- She stole and painted it.

285
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,550
- You can't do that.
- This isn't right.

286
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,400
- Now, she even steals things.
- No.

287
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,370
- So did you paint it?
- I didn't steal it.

288
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,630
- Do you know the combination?
- No, I don't.

289
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,000
- What?
- What do you mean?

290
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
She stole it.

291
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,930
(It's my bicycle,
but I don't know the passcode.)

292
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,070
(She's turning herself in.)

293
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,340
- I don't know the combination.
- Why do you not know that?

294
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,040
After Ji Hyo turned 40,

295
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,570
- she started theft.
- No.

296
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,490
No, it's not like that.

297
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,150
- This is...
- Do you work two jobs?

298
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,310
- Ji Hyo, I just rode it.
- Yes.

299
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,210
It's not your size.

300
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,130
No. This is a pixie.

301
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,530
I guess her ex-boyfriend
was your height.

302
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,500
- Can you prove that it's yours?
- Try riding it.

303
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,560
- Ji Hyo, it's not your size.
- It's dangerous.

304
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,370
No. I'll show you.

305
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,590
Wait.

306
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,010
You can't even touch the ground.

307
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,830
Do you ride it like that?

308
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,200
(Levitating?)

309
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,510
Ji Hyo, this isn't right.

310
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,810
You're standing on your tiptoes.

311
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,990
I think she really stole it.

312
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,290
- I'm serious.
- No.

313
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,860
She couldn't just throw it away.

314
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,120
To be honest,

315
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,760
I gave this to Seong Mun.

316
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,860
- You just made that up.
- No, I'm serious.

317
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,290
I like that ad-libbing.

318
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,660
- That was nice.
- Well done.

319
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,400
If it was Seong Mun's
she would've said that sooner.

320
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,540
But she tried to ride it
as if it was hers.

321
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,200
I bought this for Seong Mun.

322
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,150
He uses public transportation.

323
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,910
- I felt bad so I bought him this.
- Okay. That's enough.

324
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,170
Let's move on.

325
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,790
(Okay. Let's move on.)

326
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,550
- Let's move on.
- All right.

327
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,890
- Let's say that.
- Okay.

328
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,290
- Just move on.
- Is Seong Mun okay about this?

329
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,580
Let's just move on.

330
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,890
I bought this for him,

331
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,530
- so it belongs to me.
- I feel bad for you.

332
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,730
No, listen to me.

333
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,420
She opened the door and took this.

334
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,040
No, I'm serious.

335
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,190
All right. What is the thing
you want to get rid of, Ji Hyo?

336
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,270
It's also big.

337
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,410
- It's a bicycle too.
- What? Is it a bicycle?

338
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,930
- She brought two bicycles.
- Why do you have so many bicycles?

339
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,150
What?

340
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,480
(Is she a bicycle thief or what?)

341
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,310
- She really stole it.
- What's this?

342
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,710
Gosh, what is this?

343
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,180
(A filthy bicycle)

344
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,710
She painted it.

345
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,310
It has a lot of dust on it.

346
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,760
- Hey.
- There are...

347
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,180
a lot of bicycles like this
in my neighborhood.

348
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,400
- No.
- Isn't this from "Um Bok Dong"?

349
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,500
No.

350
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,270
(Dirty)

351
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,930
(Um Bok Dong's old bicycle...)

352
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,040
(that he swept all cycling
competitions in the 1930s with.)

353
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,330
(Is this the bicycle?)

354
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,380
- He said Um Bok Dong.
- My gosh.

355
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,750
What is this?

356
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,650
- The tire is flat.
- This is horrible.

357
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,040
- I want to throw this away.
- This is for the trash.

358
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,180
It's so obvious
that she wants to get rid of it.

359
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,080
You should've at least
wiped it down. Look at the dust.

360
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,210
I received this as a present.

361
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,390
- When?
- It was a gift.

362
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,160
It's a bit...

363
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,950
- too small for me.
- It's too dirty.

364
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,760
(He was about to touch it
but stopped himself.)

365
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,690
He didn't touch it
because it looked dirty.

366
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,730
- It's too...
- He just pretended to touch it.

367
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,870
For some time, I rode this...

368
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,540
- from Ilsan to Gangnam.
- You must be good at riding it.

369
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,300
Mine are not objects.

370
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,880
I wanted to bring good presents.

371
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,650
- We had to bring meaningful ones.
- Right.

372
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,840
I couldn't sleep much
because I had to prepare this.

373
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,040
- I made a lunchbox.
- A lunchbox?

374
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,120
You're going to give these
to Se Chan.

375
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,290
(She's blatant.)

376
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,890
(Were they made for them?)

377
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,790
Look at that.

378
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,500
- I...
- She's very...

379
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,630
- She's very cute.
- They're not for me.

380
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,190
I've prepared this.

381
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,290
It's rice mixed
with butter and soy sauce.

382
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,370
- There are sausages and gimbap.
- They're heart-shaped.

383
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,510
- There's also jangjorim and eggs.
- This is amazing.

384
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,430
This is potato stir-fried with roe.

385
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,110
Seeing how there are cup noodles,

386
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,250
- it's not for me.
- It looks cute.

387
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,750
Look at this.

388
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,340
- Do you think this is for you?
- No.

389
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,790
Kwang Soo?

390
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,710
- She texted Se Chan this morning.
- What did she say?

391
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,950
She took a photo of this lunchbox.

392
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,360
She wrote, "This is enough, right?"

393
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,760
Wait. That means you two...

394
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,900
(Does that mean it's for him?)

395
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,230
What's going on?

396
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,320
There he goes again.

397
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,770
I asked him
if this would be good to bring.

398
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,060
- That's all.
- Why would you ask him?

399
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,610
You could've asked me.

400
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,170
What? It'd be weird to text
the rest of you in the morning.

401
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,330
- We were all up.
- It's...

402
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,110
(Laughing)

403
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,340
What's wrong with him?

404
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,440
(What's with him?)

405
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,840
(So Min and Se Chan
sitting in a tree)

406
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,440
What's wrong with you?

407
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,710
(Haha feels butterflies
in his stomach.)

408
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,120
Come on.

409
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,890
My heart is racing.

410
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,820
Why would yours race?

411
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,260
- I don't know, but it is.
- Come on.

412
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,030
This is an item
I want to get rid of.

413
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,790
Actually, I'd like
to apologize beforehand.

414
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,240
I can't really say it's something
I want to get rid of.

415
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,910
- It's... This is...
- Hey, what are you doing?

416
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,650
(It's a T-shirt of Jong Kook.)

417
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,910
- Why do you have that?
- Well...

418
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,120
- That's not it.
- Goodness.

419
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,410
Hear me out.

420
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,680
- Look.
- That's...

421
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,790
(Why does she have that?)

422
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,810
Why would you get rid of that?

423
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,050
- Just give it to me.
- Hear me out.

424
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,260
For Jong Kook's concert,

425
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,660
Se Chan wanted to make it special,

426
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,090
- so he made 10 of these.
- Right.

427
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,500
- He gave me one of them.
- He made it.

428
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,660
I really liked it,
so I took one home.

429
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,140
But when I wore it at home,

430
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,460
it felt like
there were just us two there.

431
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,610
(She felt like she was home alone
with him.)

432
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,510
(There was a certain man
in the room with her.)

433
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,750
- It really felt that way.
- I can understand.

434
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,940
- It seemed like we were together.
- Right.

435
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,410
When I laid this on the table,
it felt like he was watching me.

436
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,680
It was very frightening.

437
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,660
(It feels like
someone else is home.)

438
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,660
When I laid this on the table...

439
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,920
(It feels like
someone's watching me.)

440
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,420
Give it to me.

441
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,770
If you're mad at him,
you could pinch his nose.

442
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,740
Like this. Or...

443
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,830
you could do this.

444
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,240
(This is best for these weak two
who can't fight him.)

445
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,830
- That's hilarious.
- I like it.

446
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,570
- It's very meaningful.
- It's really cute.

447
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,170
- Next up is Suk Jin.
- Should I go?

448
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,750
After receiving the text,

449
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,480
I thought about the past 10 years.

450
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,790
- I...
- How about you take it out first?

451
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,860
(Jae Suk cuts him off.)

452
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,490
(Sure)

453
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,760
Gosh, that was refreshing.

454
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,790
- You wrapped it?
- I was happy...

455
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,530
to be able to give a present
to a fellow member.

456
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,770
- Did you buy that?
- So I went...

457
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,110
- to the department store.
- Seriously?

458
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,300
My wife came with me.

459
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,480
The moment I laid my eyes on it,
I was reminded of Kwang Soo.

460
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,840
Me? What is it?

461
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,700
My wife got it for him.

462
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,540
- Thank you.
- It was displayed,

463
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,280
- and she pointed at it.
- What is it?

464
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,080
- Thank you.
- We really bought this.

465
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,290
They couldn't wrap it,

466
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,660
- so my wife did.
- Really?

467
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,890
- She did it?
- We're so grateful.

468
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,730
Anyway, these are padded bottoms.

469
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,190
(Anyway, these are padded bottoms.)

470
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,900
He needs this.

471
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,140
It's...

472
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,200
- She got it just for you.
- It's real.

473
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,980
- Let me see.
- Suk Jin.

474
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,330
This won't do.

475
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,650
- It's enough.
- He needs more.

476
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,780
- Goodness.
- It's too thin.

477
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,070
- It's the best gift.
- How nice of her.

478
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,580
- That means she saw the movie.
- This is...

479
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,290
- This is...
- Don't be ridiculous.

480
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,680
She watched it.

481
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,230
(She saw his bottom in that movie.)

482
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,450
(He'll be forever teased
for his nude scene.)

483
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,030
(Cheer up, Kwang Soo.)

484
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,470
- All right.
- We thought of each other.

485
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,040
Thank you...

486
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,540
Yes, thank you.

487
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,440
- Next up is...
- Something to get rid of.

488
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,980
For that category,
I brought an electronic device.

489
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,180
- Really?
- Does it still work?

490
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,210
I want it.

491
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,950
We used this when we rented a car
in the States over 10 years ago.

492
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,310
(This item holds memories
from 10 years ago.)

493
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,050
- Is that a navigation device?
- It's a navigation device.

494
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,580
(It's an American
navigation device.)

495
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,620
(Laughing)

496
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,590
Does it even work?

497
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,790
- We set this in our car.
- That's...

498
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,000
This is the device.

499
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,890
It looks very third rate.

500
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,740
- That's because...
- I can see it.

501
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,240
When can we use that?

502
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,330
You can use this in the States.

503
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,780
In the States and Canada.

504
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,180
- So who'll use that?
- It's for Americans.

505
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,070
It's for the States and Canada,
and it displays Korean too.

506
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,020
If you say Niagara Falls,
it'll take you there.

507
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,140
How can we go there from here?

508
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,540
You need to be there.

509
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,050
(How can we go
to the Niagara Falls from here?)

510
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,260
You need to be there.

511
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,080
- Right.
- But we got it here.

512
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,320
American rentals all have
navigation devices.

513
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,820
You can't use this here.

514
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,290
- It's for the States and Canada.
- It's useless.

515
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,860
It'd be insane to set that up
on Ji Hyo's bike.

516
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,330
- And ride it in the States?
- And ride it in the States.

517
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,540
You could visit the Niagara Falls.

518
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,210
(Turn the device on, ride the bike,
and go to the Niagara Falls.)

519
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,240
It's nice.

520
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,070
(He doesn't sound that excited.)

521
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,710
- You don't sound too excited.
- What?

522
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,570
What? It's nice.

523
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,040
I thought you were talking to me.

524
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,250
It's better
than your Halloween bucket.

525
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,490
(Suk Jin attacks him.)

526
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,420
(How dare you call it so?)

527
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,110
"Halloween bucket"?

528
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,260
- At least, his is useful.
- Come on, now.

529
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,050
How could you call this so?

530
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,850
It's so pretty.

531
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,120
This is an electronic device.

532
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,620
This will be very popular
when Halloween comes.

533
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,670
- This was expensive.
- He's so harsh.

534
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,100
You can fasten it like this.

535
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,470
Next up is Kwang Soo.

536
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,060
- This is something you need.
- Okay.

537
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,940
- That's important.
- I brought one.

538
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,280
This is...

539
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,210
(Impressed)

540
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,250
You rarely use this at home.

541
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,980
- This is more for restaurants.
- What is that?

542
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,580
- Jong Kook would like that.
- It's a blender.

543
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,450
- Isn't that a blender?
- Oh, it's a blender.

544
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,610
There are various utensils inside
such as knives.

545
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,820
- Those are good for athletes.
- You're right.

546
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,150
Wook Min would like it.

547
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,260
That's probably about 1,000 dollars.

548
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,670
- Really?
- You're right.

549
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,590
(This big blender
is worth around 1,000 dollars.)

550
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,700
- Am I right?
- Are you serious?

551
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,740
- I want it.
- It's expensive.

552
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,940
- It is.
- Seriously?

553
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,740
Let's start off by grinding
Suk Jin's navigation device.

554
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,900
(Let's find out how good it is.)

555
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,870
(You're going to do what
to my navigation device?)

556
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,800
It can easily grind it.

557
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,070
- Is that so?
- Yes.

558
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,680
- You'll get brown-colored juice.
- Let's grind...

559
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,080
This is full of memories.

560
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,810
Let's grind it first.

561
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,760
This was very expensive.

562
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,190
And this is the item
I want to get rid of.

563
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,230
Jong Kook and I traveled
to the States before.

564
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,390
After having some drinks,

565
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,090
we became sentimental.

566
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,130
I bought this 300mm UGG boots then.

567
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,360
These are fur boots.

568
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,500
Those are the worst.

569
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,440
They look like
ancient Joseon footwear.

570
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,210
- I just couldn't wear them here.
- Why not?

571
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,100
- What?
- I wear them these days.

572
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,480
- But they're too big for me.
- Try them on.

573
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,280
We should give them to Han Gi Beom.

574
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,220
Suk Jin loves these boots.

575
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,310
I love them.

576
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,880
I brought something else.

577
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,920
I found this in my storage room.

578
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,490
What is that?

579
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,550
(They're curious.)

580
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,690
What is that?

581
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,820
- What is that?
- That looks familiar.

582
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,770
- It's a Halloween item.
- It's a Halloween item.

583
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,630
It looks familiar.

584
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,940
- What is that?
- What could it be?

585
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,100
- Nine years ago,
- Right?

586
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,710
Haha gifted this to me.

587
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,450
I knew it.

588
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,180
I remembered it.

589
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
Seriously?

590
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,310
How was I able to remember that?

591
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,310
- It's so dusty.
- We were at your house that day.

592
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,750
- It was before you got married.
- Right.

593
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,550
You told me...

594
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,810
to take whatever I needed
from your house.

595
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,030
I picked a hat, but you said
I couldn't have that.

596
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,350
Instead, you told me to take this.

597
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,620
(Take this instead of the hat.)

598
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,230
- You said this was a genuine gift.
- Seriously?

599
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,790
- What's it for?
- What do you do with that?

600
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,000
- I have no idea.
- What's that for?

601
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,890
- I remembered.
- I don't know what it's for.

602
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,940
- It looked so familiar.
- I think you lit a candle inside.

603
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,100
- You need to lit a candle inside.
- I see.

604
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,370
I tossed this in the storage room
nine years ago,

605
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,870
and I finally retrieved it today.

606
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,110
- It's the worst.
- I had forgotten about this.

607
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,280
Yes.

608
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,790
I feel bad for Haha but...

609
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,750
- How could you?
- This was in your closet.

610
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,310
That haunted house is full
of our memories!

611
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,580
That's why I couldn't throw it away.

612
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,880
- These could be a Halloween set.
- You're right.

613
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,350
- Right.
- Let's put them together.

614
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,200
We'll celebrate an early Halloween.

615
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,290
- Right.
- It's a Halloween set.

616
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,060
It didn't look that nice on its own,
but as a set,

617
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,670
- It looks nice, right?
- it looks nice.

618
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,290
- You can hang it here.
- They look nice.

619
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,060
All right.

620
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,600
I can totally remember that day.

621
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,070
- You're right.
- I'm feeling nostalgic.

622
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,440
- Who's up next?
- It's me.

623
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,300
It's Se Chan's turn.

624
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,680
He's So Min's future boyfriend.

625
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,020
(So Min's future boyfriend
will introduce his items.)

626
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm talking in future tense.
He'll become her boyfriend.

627
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,080
I think all of you will want this.

628
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,850
Did you have
anyone specific in mind?

629
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,930
You wanted So Min to have yours.

630
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,730
- I'd also like her to have this.
- What is it?

631
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,090
They'd be a good collaboration.

632
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,790
- There are many items for her.
- All right.

633
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,940
- What is it?
- They'd be a good collaboration.

634
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,770
(What is this item that will
work well with Haha's?)

635
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,600
- All right.
- What is that?

636
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,970
It's a soda maker.

637
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,130
It's a soda maker. I'll give you
the can of carbon dioxide as well.

638
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,540
- It's a set.
- That's really nice.

639
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,810
Put a glass of water here...

640
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,040
- then press this.
- It turns into a carbonated drink.

641
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,720
- The carbon dioxide enters it.
- I know.

642
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,490
In what way
is sparkling water good for you?

643
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,920
It has a kick.

644
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,930
- The gas kicks your neck.
- So Min,

645
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,030
it'll give your heart a kick.

646
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,650
Love will surge from it.

647
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,930
Love will kick your heart.

648
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,000
Isn't this decent?

649
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,770
Yesterday, I asked Se Chan
to join me for shaved ice...

650
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,560
after church, but he just bolted.

651
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,240
- Right.
- He ran away again.

652
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,330
He always does.

653
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,010
What a cold idiot.

654
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,740
(What a cold idiot.)

655
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,340
(He's clueless
when it comes to love.)

656
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,510
Unbelievable.

657
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,780
- She gave him an opportunity.
- That idiot.

658
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,250
- Gosh.
- I had no other choice.

659
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,250
So Min officially made a move.

660
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,610
What's so hard about
joining her for shaved ice?

661
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,050
I was busy. All right then.

662
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,420
(He draws a line.)

663
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,430
Here's the item I wish to discard.
I received it as a gift recently,

664
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,000
and it's of a well-known brand.

665
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,470
However, I looked into it...

666
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,030
- and it was a fake.
- Really?

667
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,170
And it was a fake.

668
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,040
- Someone gave you an imitation?
- It was a fake?

669
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,510
That's why...

670
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,600
Hey!

671
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,640
- Why?
- You're throwing away our memory.

672
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,540
(The moment Kwang Soo sees it...)

673
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,140
(Kick!)

674
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,340
(You'll throw away our memory?)

675
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,250
- What is it?
- Is it a memory?

676
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,290
Kwang Soo must've
given it to Se Chan.

677
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,350
(It must be something
Kwang Soo gave him.)

678
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,880
- It is.
- Isn't that of...

679
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,190
- a famous brand?
- It is.

680
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,290
- It's a speaker.
- Isn't it a speaker?

681
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,620
- That's right.
- It's a speaker.

682
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,930
Who on earth would
give you an imitation?

683
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,730
- It's not.
- It is.

684
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,060
- But...
- You had no idea...

685
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,560
that this was an imitation
of a well-known brand.

686
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,060
I knew that, but...

687
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,130
- It was just adorable.
- I thought it'd suit him.

688
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,970
Still, how could you?

689
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,830
Once you hear how it sounds,

690
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,710
you'll understand
why I want to give it up.

691
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,710
- Give us a demonstration.
- Well...

692
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,610
(Unclear sounds)

693
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,990
(What's with the quality?)

694
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,190
Are we listening to a phone?

695
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,190
Are we hearing the speaker?

696
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,220
Yes, the speaker. The music
is coming from the speaker.

697
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,030
(Among the swaying flowers)

698
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,960
Did you turn on an LP record?

699
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,430
(Among the swaying flowers)

700
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,170
(The sound quality is worse
than the speaker on a phone.)

701
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,440
- This...
- Did you keep this underwater?

702
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,710
The bass sound should
be louder and clearer...

703
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,900
- Are the speakers wet?
- Who knows?

704
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,070
No way.

705
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,130
What's wrong with this?

706
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,340
- It has an LP record option.
- Beats me.

707
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,920
It makes recent songs
sound like oldies.

708
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,280
- You're right.
- Right.

709
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,840
It sounded like Jang Beom June
with a cold.

710
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,880
The speaker comes
with a stuffy nose option.

711
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,290
It sounded like Jang Beom June
with a cold.

712
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,290
(The speaker has an LP option
and a stuffy nose option.)

713
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,290
It'll sound incredible
if you turn on old songs.

714
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,000
- Really?
- Yes, old songs.

715
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,060
How much was this? Two dollars?

716
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,040
Still, someone might want it.

717
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,510
First, this is my meaningful gift.

718
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,600
I brought a massager.

719
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,400
What's this?

720
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,540
It soothes any soreness you have
and it can be used as a weapon.

721
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,640
For a second,

722
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,420
I thought he was
bringing out a weapon.

723
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,180
Your calves, thighs, and everywhere.

724
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,450
Even your backside.

725
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,540
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

726
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,150
Don't you use a massage gun
powered by electricity?

727
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,350
(Anyone can tell
that a massage gun is better.)

728
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,050
But I use this too.

729
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,290
- I use this.
- The massage gun.

730
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,670
How could you?

731
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,290
- That's too loud though.
- It requires manual labor.

732
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,540
- That's too loud.
- You use a massage gun.

733
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,270
- But this is better.
- That feels good.

734
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,800
Unbelievable.
So what's the next gift?

735
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,980
I really want to throw this away.

736
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,010
- What is it?
- I don't know what to do with it.

737
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,140
I should've gotten rid of it
back then.

738
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,250
- But back then...
- Exactly.

739
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,040
How could you?

740
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,140
Are you kidding me?

741
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,290
Yes, this.

742
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,960
It's a life-size cutout of
Cristiano Ronaldo.

743
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,290
(A life-size cutout
of Cristiano Ronaldo)

744
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,460
- Hold on.
- Are you sure about this?

745
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,650
Can we air this on TV?

746
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,730
- Well...
- What can we do?

747
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,760
Please blur out his face.

748
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,770
He was supposed to visit my house
for "My Little Old Boy."

749
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,740
so I prepared this
to make the event memorable.

750
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,360
- That's right.
- But now...

751
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,100
- he's the most hated man.
- The whole nation hates him.

752
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,510
I don't want to leave it
in my house anymore.

753
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,630
I need to throw this away,
but I haven't had the chance.

754
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,450
I can understand your trouble.

755
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,450
That's something...

756
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,070
- I don't want it.
- I don't want that at all.

757
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,840
- On your way home...
- Gosh.

758
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,420
His and Haha's gifts are the worst.

759
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,750
Mine's perfectly fine.

760
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,460
(His and Haha's gifts
are the worst.)

761
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
(The two worst items)

762
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,150
It'll come with an autograph.

763
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,930
(Haha and Jong Kook's
cutout is way better.)

764
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,820
Jong Kook's second gift
is the worst of them all.

765
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,620
It's really something
he wishes to get rid of.

766
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,740
So you've all brought
your gifts today.

767
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,170
We asked you to bring them over...

768
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,440
to celebrate Suk Jin's birthday
and the release of So Min's book.

769
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,280
It's the Double Celebration Race.

770
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
(They celebrate Suk Jin's birthday
and the release of So Min's book.)

771
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,510
It's the Double Celebration Race.

772
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,640
Is it your birthday?

773
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
What about my birthday?

774
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
(He didn't understand it.)

775
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,020
It's your birthday.

776
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,190
Suk Jin, pull yourself together!

777
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,880
This must air around
the time of my birthday.

778
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,920
- Happy birthday.
- We asked you...

779
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,820
to prepare these gifts today...

780
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,930
so that we can celebrate
Suk Jin's birthday...

781
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,460
and So Min's debut as a writer.

782
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,470
Writer Jeon! Goodness.

783
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,730
This is amazing.

784
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,670
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

785
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,400
- Writer Jeon!
- It's embarrassing.

786
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,040
- Gosh.
- We also prepared a gift.

787
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,710
- Really?
- You guys prepared a gift?

788
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,510
Really? There's a gift?

789
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,680
- No way.
- What?

790
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,720
(Turbo's happy birthday song
is played.)

791
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,490
My gosh.

792
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,720
- Goodness.
- You're embarrassing us.

793
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,550
This embarrasses me, you know.

794
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,880
Gosh.

795
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,050
Stand in the center.

796
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,350
Look at this.

797
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,030
- Gosh.
- They used honorifics.

798
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,560
"Happy 55th birthday".

799
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,100
All right, Writer Jeon.

800
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,800
- "You Can Call Me..."
- "After a Drink".

801
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,180
I'm proud of her.

802
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,330
You heard that, right?

803
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,280
"You Can Call Me After a Drink".

804
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,450
A candle went out.

805
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,420
- Right.
- I guess I can call her.

806
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,340
(A candle went out.)

807
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,420
A candle went out.

808
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,250
It feels like my life
has just faded away.

809
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,520
Your life?

810
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,050
- What?
- It's a birthday cake.

811
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,650
A gush of wind blew, that's all.

812
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,260
- Wait, this went out too.
- The other one...

813
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,730
- What?
- It's back to normal again.

814
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,730
No!

815
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,170
(The other candle withered
like Suk Jin's feeble legs.)

816
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,560
(Happy 55th birthday)

817
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,270
(Say goodbye to his life)

818
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,560
What's happening?

819
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,980
(He identifies himself
as the candle flames.)

820
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,940
The wick dropped completely.

821
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,300
Like this?

822
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,710
- The wick...
- Just like his chin drops.

823
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,480
- I mean...
- I've never seen that happen.

824
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,920
- I'm perfectly fine, you know.
- Just look at it.

825
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,250
- All right.
- This is slightly embarrassing,

826
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,850
but thank you so much.

827
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,580
- Blow out the candles.
- Happy birthday.

828
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,460
- 1, 2, 3.
- So Min, go ahead.

829
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,530
(We wish So Min and Suk Jin
the best.)

830
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,200
Congratulations!

831
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
This seems out of the blue though.

832
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Tell me about it.

833
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,560
You will compete in two teams today.

834
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,790
So Min and Suk Jin
will be team captains.

835
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,130
Through the games prepared today,

836
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,630
So Min and Suk Jin will win gifts
after each round.

837
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,780
You will compete in three rounds...

838
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,250
and the team to win two rounds first
will be the final winner.

839
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,520
The winning team captain...

840
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,040
will win a chance
to obtain all the meaningful gifts.

841
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,050
- That's nice.
- They're in for a treat.

842
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,530
Or, they will win a chance
to choose between two curtains...

843
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,890
where one conceals a dud
and the other one...

844
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,050
conceals a 100-inch TV
that's worth 8,000 dollars.

845
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,290
- A 100-inch TV?
- Really?

846
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,730
- That's worth 8,000 dollars?
- You can choose...

847
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,440
between two options.

848
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,560
A 100-inch TV
that's worth 8,000 dollars...

849
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,940
(Their eyes open wide.)

850
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,330
(If you choose the dud,
you will obtain one of the wastes.)

851
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,330
- A 100-inch TV?
- No way!

852
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,780
The wall in your house
isn't even 100 inches long.

853
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,180
It isn't.

854
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,750
If you don't want the TV,

855
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,950
you may swap it for
a gift certificate of 8,000 dollars.

856
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,690
- A gift certificate?
- My gosh.

857
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,020
- Then it's truly a gift.
- All right.

858
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,880
If you choose the gifts
that the members brought,

859
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,550
your teammates will
all receive a prize badge.

860
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,430
If you choose to gamble on the TV,

861
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,150
they will only win a prize badge...

862
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,730
if you successfully choose the TV.

863
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,670
- All our teammates.
- Hold on.

864
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,000
Isn't this the most expensive prize
we've been offered?

865
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,090
That's right.

866
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,300
However, there's only
a 50 percent chance.

867
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,560
You can easily choose the dud.

868
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,970
I really want to win today.

869
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,940
It'll be upsetting if the captain
doesn't choose our gifts though.

870
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,040
I know.

871
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,450
(The team captains could risk
their teammates' chances too.)

872
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,280
The member with
the fewest number of badges...

873
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,340
will receive a penalty at the end.

874
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,540
Before we begin the race,

875
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,420
you two will choose your teams.

876
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,020
- Okay.
- How will it be done?

877
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,350
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Good.

878
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,430
- You'll choose your teammates.
- We have to win for them.

879
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,650
It'll be their gifts
you'll be playing for.

880
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,850
But the TV is too good
not to gamble on.

881
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,460
- You'll have to win.
- Exactly.

882
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,890
It's impossible for me
to lose to Suk Jin.

883
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,030
Don't be ridiculous.

884
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,200
- Oh, please.
- Come on.

885
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,240
(So how will
the rock-paper-scissors go?)

886
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,540
Rock-paper-scissors!

887
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,510
(So Min wins.)

888
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,980
(He truly is the weakest
Running Man member.)

889
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,340
Hold on a second.
Which gift was the best?

890
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,990
If I had known,
I would've brought a better gift.

891
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,750
Exactly. If only we knew in advance.

892
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,290
- Right.
- Okay.

893
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,460
I choose the sparkling water maker.

894
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,880
(She first chooses
the sparkling water maker.)

895
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,620
(So Min first chooses Se Chan who
brought the sparkling water maker.)

896
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,150
- All right.
- Of course.

897
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,890
The two youngest
are on the same team again.

898
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,670
First of all...

899
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,170
It's the sparkling water I like,
not Se Chan.

900
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,860
- We get it!
- We hear you.

901
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,040
I really need it.

902
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,060
Okay, fine.

903
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,470
Can't you take the calendar instead?

904
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,040
I want
the sparkling water maker too.

905
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,130
(Suk Jin gets greedy.)

906
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,740
- Seriously?
- Suk Jin...

907
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,540
But I won. Wait, hold on.

908
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,180
- What is it?
- Is this gray hair?

909
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,250
(Is this gray hair?)

910
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,640
- What?
- Let me see.

911
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,250
He'll die if you pluck that out.

912
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,250
Won't he?

913
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,960
- It's not hair, is it? I'm glad.
- Suk Jin,

914
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,260
- is that a udumbara flower?
- I'm glad it's not hair.

915
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,990
- Udumbara?
- What's a udumbara?

916
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,760
- No way.
- I thought of a goat.

917
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,050
Anyway, they're the weakest links.

918
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,290
(Team So Min, Team Suk Jin)

919
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,930
I can't believe this.

920
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,360
The gifts are the worst too.

921
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,440
You never know though.

922
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,040
So you now have your teams.

923
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,130
You'll change clothes
and begin the race.

924
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,010
- Got it.
- Okay.

925
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,870
- All right.
- Today,

926
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,800
my teammates agreed
to be considered as the same age.

927
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,140
- Jong Kook, Kwang Soo...
- There's something...

928
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,340
called the Jeon So Min Rule.

929
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,040
- Jong Kook, Kwang Soo, Se Chan...
- What?

930
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,290
Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.

931
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,790
I love calling just your names.

932
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,610
Just like the members of AOA,

933
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,820
- we'll stick to just the names.
- Sounds good.

934
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,430
- Then can we...
- Can I call you Kook?

935
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,580
- Of course.
- Kook!

936
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,890
- Kook.
- Kook.

937
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,030
- Look at him.
- Just so you know,

938
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,270
friends get into fights
while growing up.

939
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,440
What?

940
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,060
So Min, say that
we can't argue or fight.

941
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,830
You see, it's mean to hit
someone younger than you,

942
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,860
but it's okay
to beat up your friends.

943
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,240
- Of course.
- That's how...

944
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,280
we grow up and build our friendship.

945
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,750
- I'm sure you're all hungry.
- Yes!

946
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,020
The first game
you'll be competing in...

947
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,640
is Name the Dish.

948
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,840
- Name the Dish?
- That's right.

949
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,750
You'll be given 100 minutes.

950
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,690
Among the dishes sold in Seoul,

951
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,290
find the dish with the longest name
to win.

952
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,190
What is this?

953
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,820
Only the actual name
on the menu counts.

954
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,590
If the other team finds a dish
that has a longer name than you did,

955
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,270
you'll get to try again
within the given time.

956
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,590
Does a set menu count?

957
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,240
- As long as it's on the menu.
- Of course.

958
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,740
Does "something and something"
count?

959
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,630
- That counts too.
- It does?

960
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,510
But you can only order...

961
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,610
one portion.

962
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,020
The member who eats the dish
wins a prize badge...

963
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,810
regardless of the result.

964
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,520
We have to compete
against each other.

965
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,050
- We compete against each other?
- We compete against each other?

966
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,290
Only one member gets to eat.

967
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,790
Then it's a good thing
that we're all weak.

968
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,260
- It's a good thing.
- In that case,

969
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,150
- we're lucky.
- We have an advantage.

970
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,170
- It's not bad.
- I mean...

971
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,390
I have a chance.

972
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,790
You should have told us beforehand.

973
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,830
- You guys are so unlucky.
- It's war.

974
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,130
Hey.

975
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,100
- You picked the wrong guys.
- So Min is so unlucky.

976
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,870
If I had known...

977
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,940
I love my team.

978
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,750
We can just pick one randomly.

979
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,040
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- All right.

980
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,640
You can decide
how you pick one member.

981
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,950
Please get on the cars now.

982
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,190
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

983
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,260
(I think I picked the wrong team.)

984
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,430
- Let's go!
- What should we have?

985
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,820
"A dish with a long name".

986
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,230
(They start searching the Internet
right away.)

987
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,890
It's an Italian restaurant.

988
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,730
"Red wine oxtail stew
and creamy barley risotto".

989
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,060
- That's perfect.
- Where is that place?

990
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,470
- Let's go there!
- Hold on.

991
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,830
- Let me see.
- Ji Hyo did it!

992
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,270
- I have to see where it is.
- How many letters are there?

993
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,330
"Red wine..."

994
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,010
It's in another country.

995
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,180
Gosh.

996
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,340
(What were we getting excited for?)

997
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,100
We can go there
as long as we have a GPS.

998
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,370
- Hey.
- Get a GPS.

999
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,810
There are many restaurants
like this in Itaewon.

1000
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,720
- Hey, Suk Jin.
- What?

1001
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,310
"Their dishes not only have
long names but also taste amazing".

1002
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,020
"Woo Seul's restorative chicken..."

1003
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,960
"with abalone, mitten crabs,
and small octopus".

1004
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,460
- That's the place!
- Hold on.

1005
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,230
- Let's go there.
- Where is that place?

1006
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,360
- It's in Iksan. Gosh.
- That's too far.

1007
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,070
That would have been perfect.

1008
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,230
(Ji Hyo is counting something.)

1009
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,130
- I found 16 letters.
- Where is it?

1010
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,500
"Burgundy wine-marinated beef stew".

1011
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,570
- Let's go there.
- Where is it?

1012
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,800
- It's in Itaewon. Hold on.
- Let's go.

1013
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,670
- There are even longer names.
- They have really long names.

1014
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,750
"Roasted pork tenderloin
served with mustard sauce..."

1015
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,920
"and grilled eggplants".

1016
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,420
It has 22 letters.

1017
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,920
- Unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

1018
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,690
- Ji Hyo!
- It's not bad, right?

1019
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,820
You did it!

1020
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,420
Ji Hyo, good job.
We have two masters...

1021
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,920
of Internet searching.

1022
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,020
All right.
I'll try searching the Internet.

1023
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,130
Hold on. 1, 2, 3, 4,

1024
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,130
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

1025
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,400
- 11, 12, 13, 14... It's 17 letters.
- What?

1026
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,230
- It's 17 letters.
- Can you find that?

1027
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,270
- What is it called?
- Hey.

1028
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,210
"Wings marinated in Analog Kitchen's
special soy sauce".

1029
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,440
- Is that the name?
- That's the name.

1030
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,420
- Is it in Itaewon?
- Yes, it is. It's not bad, right?

1031
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,940
- I can't find anything.
- Should we look some more?

1032
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,840
Let's look some more on our way.

1033
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,520
Hey.

1034
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,750
"The American mom's..."

1035
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,380
"Beef meatballs and French fries
made by American mom".

1036
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,860
- Unbelievable.
- Where is it?

1037
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,550
- Where is that place?
- The "American mom"?

1038
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,730
It says, the "American mom".

1039
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,360
Not the Korean mom,
but the American mom?

1040
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,590
- The "American mom"?
- That's right.

1041
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,040
Where is the place? It sounds nice.

1042
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,570
It's near Hongik University.
It's in Yeonnam-dong.

1043
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,440
Guys, let me tell you
what we'll have.

1044
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,340
It's 18 letters.

1045
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,570
"Carbonara with rich cream sauce
that fills your mouth".

1046
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,340
- That sounds good.
- I'm sure it tastes good too.

1047
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,650
- Nice!
- Nice!

1048
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,150
- I finally found something.
- Good job.

1049
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,110
- You did a good job.
- Se Chan, you're the best.

1050
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,110
While Kwang Soo was checking
his messages,

1051
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,610
- I've been searching the Internet.
- I can't find anything.

1052
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,210
I've been searching,
but I can't find anything.

1053
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,650
I found something.

1054
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,190
"Flavorful beef cream sauce risotto
served with ginkgo nuts,"

1055
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,250
"bell peppers, and mushrooms
with a touch of lemon".

1056
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,270
- How many letters is that?
- Kim Jong Kook!

1057
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,170
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Kim Jong Kook!

1058
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,000
- Where is it?
- It's in Itaewon.

1059
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,800
- Can you call them? It's closer.
- It's in Itaewon.

1060
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,840
- It's even closer.
- It's even closer.

1061
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,480
- Hey.
- Why couldn't you find this?

1062
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,800
Hey, what are you doing?

1063
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,480
- You're useless.
- I'm sorry.

1064
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,570
Try calling them.

1065
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,920
- Hold on.
- It has more than 20 letters.

1066
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,050
- What?
- What?

1067
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,520
It's closed on Mondays.

1068
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,820
- What?
- Really?

1069
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,090
Many restaurants in Itaewon
are closed on Mondays.

1070
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,710
- Yang Se Chan!
- Yang Se Chan!

1071
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,420
- Yang...
- Seriously?

1072
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,920
I can't believe this.

1073
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,920
- Are they really closed?
- They're closed on every Monday.

1074
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,630
Please go to the previous place.

1075
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,750
Yes. Jong Kook!

1076
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,020
(They're going to the place
Se Chan found in Yeonnam-dong.)

1077
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,130
Okay.

1078
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,500
That's so cute. "Okay".

1079
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,800
- Okay.
- Jong Kook!

1080
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,440
- "Okay. I admit it".
- Jong Kook, you're so cute.

1081
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,900
- Jong Kook!
- Okay.

1082
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,300
- You should work harder.
- Okay.

1083
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,980
Try it. You're so cute.

1084
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

1085
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,340
That's so cute.

1086
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,250
(Cute)

1087
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,670
I love everything that's cute.

1088
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,420
I respect everyone who's cute.

1089
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,790
- What are you doing?
- He's so stubborn.

1090
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,290
- I'm not good at it.
- Kwang Soo.

1091
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,960
Are you okay with Se Chan
being rude to you?

1092
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,520
Have you guys
ever been polite to me?

1093
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,090
(Irritated)

1094
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,630
Have you?

1095
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,820
- They've never been polite.
- Kwang Soo.

1096
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,320
Have you ever treated me
with respect?

1097
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,820
- Don't be like that.
- Kwang Soo.

1098
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,270
- Come on, you're good at this.
- Right.

1099
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,230
- Do it just once.
- Right.

1100
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,840
He's so stubborn.

1101
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,860
We've been begging him.

1102
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,800
- Is it so hard to say, "Okay"?
- Why is it so hard?

1103
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,840
Okay.

1104
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,670
(Kwang Soo can be so cute
in front of Jong Kook.)

1105
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,770
Good job.

1106
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,920
We're Team Okay now.

1107
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,790
We're Team Okay.

1108
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,110
(Team Suk Jin is going to Itaewon,)

1109
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,690
(while Team So Min is going
to Yeonnam-dong.)

1110
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,150
I should take my wife
to places like this.

1111
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,920
- He's lying.
- I know.

1112
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,860
It's just something
he says on camera.

1113
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,270
(He pretends to be a good husband
on camera.)

1114
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,690
I'd tell her when and where
we should meet.

1115
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,630
And she'd wonder what's going on.

1116
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,800
He's lying.

1117
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,540
We'd eat together.

1118
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,960
We'd have steaks.

1119
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,070
When Suk Jin says
he'd do something,

1120
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,380
he never actually does it.

1121
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,630
(Embarrassed)

1122
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,070
I shouldn't have worn long johns.

1123
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,250
- Did you think it'd be cold?
- I took mine off.

1124
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,250
I never wear long johns.

1125
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,440
You did the other day.

1126
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,980
It was exceptionally cold that day.

1127
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,880
Why would you lie?

1128
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,590
I rarely wear them.

1129
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,520
- I think we're here.
- We are?

1130
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,920
Good that we're here.

1131
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,630
Otherwise, Suk Jin would have
needed a special investigation.

1132
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,420
(It looks like he is appearing
before the prosecution.)

1133
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,690
Where is it?

1134
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,500
- I think this is it.
- This is it.

1135
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,670
Can we shoot here for a minute?

1136
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,770
We're going to eat.

1137
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,960
- Is that okay?
- It won't take long.

1138
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,170
Can we see a menu, please?

1139
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,770
We want the dish
with the longest name.

1140
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,800
- The dish with the longest name.
- Here it is.

1141
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,420
- Let's see.
- We came to the right place.

1142
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,250
- Nice.
- It smells so good too.

1143
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,290
- The food looks so good.
- This is nice.

1144
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,980
- Hold on. This is even longer.
- What is it?

1145
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,150
But it's sold out.

1146
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,130
(Sold out)

1147
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,980
It's already sold out?

1148
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,630
- Truffle...
- It runs out fast.

1149
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,900
It must be going well for you.

1150
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,960
I'll come back with my wife later.

1151
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,960
He's definitely not coming.

1152
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,500
(Can you tell?)

1153
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,710
Do you see that?

1154
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,040
Suk Jin is embarrassed.

1155
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,210
I can totally tell
what he's thinking.

1156
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,420
Only the names on the menu count.

1157
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,650
Can we order this?

1158
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,880
"Roasted pork tenderloin
served with mustard sauce..."

1159
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,090
"and grilled eggplants".

1160
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,090
- Can we order this?
- Yes, you can.

1161
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,480
- Is that all you need?
- Yes, please.

1162
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,820
It has 22 letters.

1163
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,230
"Roasted..." It has 22 letters.

1164
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,690
Please decide who is going to eat.

1165
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,020
- What should we do?
- Well...

1166
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,190
(Thinking)

1167
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,630
How about...

1168
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,630
we ask someone passing by...

1169
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,230
who should eat...

1170
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,540
among us?

1171
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,960
That's not okay. It's unfair.

1172
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,770
You have an advantage over us.

1173
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,880
They'll pick you.

1174
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,800
How about this?

1175
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,000
- We'll all be assigned a number.
- Right.

1176
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,570
- Let's do that.
- That sounds good.

1177
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,940
- Number 1, number 2...
- That should work, right?

1178
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,110
- What number do you want?
- I want number one.

1179
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,920
- No. I want number 2.
- Number 2? I want number 3.

1180
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,420
- I'll be number 1.
- I'll be number 4.

1181
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,880
Number three is nice.

1182
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,050
We'll ask someone on the street.

1183
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,550
- Just one person.
- Just one person.

1184
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,230
- Number 3 is nice.
- When there are 4 options,

1185
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,090
- people would choose number 3.
- All Koreans choose number 3.

1186
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,630
Each of the four is assigned...

1187
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,400
a number between 1 and 4.

1188
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,590
Can you choose a number
between 1 and 4?

1189
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,340
(What number
will the passer-by choose?)

1190
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,230
To be honest,
if we weren't shooting,

1191
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,210
we could have come here
with some friends...

1192
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,000
- That would be really nice.
- and eat together.

1193
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,170
That sounds so nice.

1194
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,900
(Suk Jin feels thirsty
and pours himself a glass of water.)

1195
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,380
(Staring)

1196
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,920
(Suk Jin, the oldest member,
fills his own glass first.)

1197
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,090
That does sound nice.

1198
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,320
Aren't you going
to fill our glasses?

1199
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,690
(He puts the bottle
back on the table...)

1200
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,880
(after filling his own glass.)

1201
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,290
- I was watching him.
- Gosh.

1202
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,130
- I knew it.
- Unbelievable.

1203
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,550
I knew what he'd do.

1204
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,630
I'm okay with him
filling his own glass first,

1205
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,400
- but I thought he'd fill ours too.
- I thought the same.

1206
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,770
I was watching him.

1207
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,270
I couldn't believe what I saw.

1208
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,940
- I'm sorry.
- He can fill his own glass first,

1209
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,900
but he should fill
the others' glasses too.

1210
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,130
(Disappointed)

1211
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,540
- I couldn't believe it.
- You're the worst.

1212
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,570
I'm disappointed.

1213
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,000
I had no idea.

1214
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,520
Here comes our food.

1215
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,980
(Their food is served.)

1216
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,440
- It looks delicious.
- What's this?

1217
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,690
- It's pork tenderloin.
- It's pork tenderloin.

1218
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,980
It looks fantastic.

1219
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,920
Let me just try slicing it.

1220
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,320
- Oh, my.
- Was this cooked sous-vide?

1221
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Let me explain.

1222
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,130
It's cooked at low temperature...

1223
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,300
- for longer than 10 hours.
- That's right.

1224
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,460
Is that correct?

1225
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,500
Is the result out yet?

1226
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,730
Please tell us.

1227
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,570
The person who gets to eat
the roasted pork tenderloin...

1228
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,400
served with mustard sauce
and grilled eggplants is...

1229
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,710
Please.

1230
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,800
(Nervous)

1231
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,710
- I'm nervous.
- I'm so nervous.

1232
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,900
This is driving me crazy.

1233
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,820
- Number 3.
- Number 2, please.

1234
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,670
(Between 1 and 4, what number
did the passer-by choose?)

1235
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,820
Congratulations, number one.

1236
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,340
(Number 1 is Jae Suk.)

1237
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,250
- Number one.
- Okay. Thank you.

1238
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,320
No way.

1239
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,550
(Devastated)

1240
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,690
No way.

1241
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,750
(Thank you for your time.)

1242
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,000
I can't believe this. Number one?

1243
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,360
(Jae Suk gets to eat
the roasted pork tenderloin.)

1244
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,630
- No way.
- Unbelievable. Number one?

1245
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,860
I'll try it.

1246
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,540
(He tries a big piece.)

1247
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,070
- Does it taste good?
- It tastes amazing.

1248
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,130
- How does it taste?
- It tastes like a sausage, right?

1249
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,270
Does it taste like a sausage?

1250
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,570
- You know how it tastes?
- I do.

1251
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,670
- It tastes amazing.
- I love it.

1252
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,820
It's delicious.

1253
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,610
- It looks so good.
- Are you going to eat all of that?

1254
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,190
We'll play rock-paper-scissors.
Give one piece to the winner.

1255
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,590
- Jae Suk.
- Just one piece.

1256
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,820
Rock-paper-scissors is boring.

1257
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,320
Do a talent show.

1258
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,630
- A talent show?
- It tastes fantastic.

1259
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,630
(What should I do?)

1260
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,400
I'll improvise a song
about mashed potatoes.

1261
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,750
That sounds good.

1262
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,320
<i>Let's eat mashed potatoes</i>

1263
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,070
<i>Mashed, mashed potatoes</i>

1264
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,960
(Jae Suk doesn't look impressed.)

1265
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,770
<i>Tasty, soft mashed potatoes</i>

1266
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
<i>It goes perfectly
with pork tenderloin</i>

1267
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,750
(The lyrics are
catchy and addictive.)

1268
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,110
<i>It's served with eggplants, mashed
potatoes, and pork tenderloin</i>

1269
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:34,190
<i>Please give me a bite, ooh</i>

1270
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,250
(He ends the song
in a seductive way.)

1271
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,520
That wasn't half bad.

1272
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,070
Gosh, Suk Jin.

1273
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,230
(Haha, you should just have a bite.)

1274
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,230
Hey.

1275
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,300
- You should just eat it.
- Hey.

1276
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,770
- You should just eat it.
- Does it taste good?

1277
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,540
- You should just eat it.
- My goodness.

1278
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,630
You should just eat it.

1279
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,230
Jae Suk completed the dish,
so he gets a prize badge.

1280
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,210
With 22 letters,
you currently hold the record.

1281
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,820
- Currently?
- Yes.

1282
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,840
Let's hit the road again.

1283
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,250
That was tasty.

1284
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,320
(They go to find a dish
with a longer name.)

1285
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,920
- We are here.
- This is the place.

1286
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,290
- Let's hurry up and eat.
- Let's go.

1287
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,750
- All right. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1288
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,360
- Okay.
- It's a matter of who eats it.

1289
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,250
Jong Kook, there is a dish
with a longer name.

1290
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,920
Cream-Sauce Pasta with a Whole Crab
and Popping Flying Fish Roe.

1291
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,400
- Paprika...
- This is legit.

1292
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,000
- My goodness.
- How many letters are there?

1293
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,210
- 19 letters.
- 19 letters.

1294
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,570
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

1295
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,340
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19...

1296
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,750
(Why does 19 come after 16?)

1297
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,570
- 17, 18, 19.
- 17.

1298
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,170
(Se Chan, 17 comes after 16.)

1299
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,980
What am I supposed to do with you
if you can't even count?

1300
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,750
- You can't count.
- I got nervous.

1301
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,480
- Which name is longer?
- Let's go in. There must be more.

1302
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,460
- Hello. Would it be okay...
- Hello.

1303
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,250
Would it be okay
if we have a shoot at a corner?

1304
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,750
- It won't take long.
- Thank you.

1305
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,090
- Thank you.
- Let's go in.

1306
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,570
- This is the place.
- Let's go.

1307
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,500
There is a dish with a name
that contains 19 letters.

1308
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,630
(My goodness!)

1309
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,840
- 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...
- Cream Pasta...

1310
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,270
- Hold on. 12, 14, 16, 18...
- Cream Pasta with Salted...

1311
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,400
- 22, 24,
- My goodness.

1312
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,380
26, 27!

1313
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,480
(There is a dish with 27 letters.)

1314
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,520
This is incredible.

1315
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,520
We will surely win.

1316
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,590
Please decide which member will eat.

1317
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,210
Shall we point to and eliminate
one member?

1318
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,290
Let's play Go Away.

1319
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,190
- Okay.
- Go Away.

1320
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,400
Go Away.

1321
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,570
- Point to one member. 1, 2...
- 1, 2...

1322
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,130
(Who will be eliminated first?)

1323
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,570
- Three.
- Go away.

1324
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,690
(Kwang Soo, Se Chan, and So Min
choose Jong Kook.)

1325
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:28,940
What? Three.

1326
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,670
(He gets all the votes.)

1327
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,800
Jong Kook.

1328
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,300
- When I wasn't looking...
- Jong Kook, I am sorry.

1329
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,070
- No.
- Jong Kook, I am sorry.

1330
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,440
Why weren't you looking?

1331
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,940
Okay.

1332
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,480
(How did this happen?)

1333
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,360
- Let's point to one member.
- Let's do that.

1334
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,790
(Point to Jong Kook.)

1335
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,520
Let's play Go Away.

1336
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,000
(When Jong Kook was looking away)

1337
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,130
(Tapping)

1338
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,190
(Point to Jong Kook.)

1339
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,730
- One person gets to eat, right?
- That's right.

1340
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,110
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

1341
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:03,360
Let's play the game
Jong Kook suggests.

1342
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,210
Okay. We will play the game
you suggest.

1343
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,770
Do you know me?

1344
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,770
Jong Kook.

1345
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,550
(This is bad.)

1346
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,940
- This is...
- You have nothing to do with me.

1347
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,420
- This is the beginning.
- It's okay.

1348
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,480
Suit yourself.

1349
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,320
Jong Kook, this is the beginning.

1350
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,550
Are you going to ignore us?

1351
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,980
I am going to have my own show.

1352
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,920
- I will hold the camera.
- No.

1353
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,500
I am going to use Instagram Live.

1354
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,460
- Jong Kook.
- It's okay. I am fine.

1355
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,840
That was delicious.

1356
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,670
- Everyone.
- Yes?

1357
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,630
You found a dish with 22 letters
and only Jae Suk got a badge.

1358
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

1359
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,110
The other team is eating a dish
that's 27 letters long.

1360
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,270
What?

1361
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,880
How does it have 27 letters?

1362
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,380
- How is it possible?
- Really? 27 letters?

1363
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,920
- What happens now?
- You hit the road again.

1364
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,050
- We need to find another dish.
- That's right.

1365
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,190
Let's surf the Web again.

1366
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,920
I don't think we will find
a longer name.

1367
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,860
Why don't we draw lots?

1368
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,920
Let's ask the owner to choose one.

1369
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,360
When the dish gets served,
we won't say anything.

1370
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,840
The person who is closest to it
gets eliminated.

1371
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,540
- It's a good idea.
- What do you think?

1372
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,440
The person who is closest to it
gets eliminated.

1373
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,940
- Let me answer a call from Haha.
- You are getting a call.

1374
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,440
- Haha.
- Which restaurant did you visit...

1375
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,570
to find a dish with 27 letters?

1376
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,520
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Hold on.

1377
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,610
Hold on.

1378
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,150
Hey.

1379
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,090
(The one who is closest to the dish
will be eliminated.)

1380
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,980
Se Chan.

1381
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,250
(He puts it in front of Se Chan.)

1382
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,690
(Se Chan, enjoy the dish.)

1383
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,270
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

1384
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,730
I hear you giggling
with your girlfriend.

1385
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,130
I think...

1386
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,770
- you need a scolding.
- Jae Suk.

1387
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,500
Jae Suk, I am done.

1388
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,380
You found a dish with 27 letters.

1389
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,610
Do I know you?

1390
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,570
(Anyang Loser
isn't through with them.)

1391
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,880
Sit here.

1392
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,550
I am sorry,

1393
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,590
but I don't want to share a table
with a stranger.

1394
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,650
There are other tables.

1395
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,790
What?

1396
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,320
Jong Kook is being the Anyang Loser.
This is suffocating.

1397
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,980
You just sat next to me.

1398
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,800
You just sat next to me.

1399
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,250
Okay. I am hanging up.

1400
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,770
Okay, Jae Suk. See you later.

1401
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,420
One person can eat, right?

1402
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,960
- The one with a longer noodle...
- The one with a longer noodle wins.

1403
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,440
Okay.

1404
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,630
(So Min carefully picks a noodle.)

1405
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,710
- You picked one. Lift it up.
- Okay.

1406
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,900
- It's long.
- What? Is it buried underneath?

1407
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,710
- It's long.
- What is going on?

1408
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,050
It's pretty long.

1409
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,210
- It's long.
- That's good.

1410
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,650
- It's long.
- Kwang Soo, it's your turn.

1411
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,380
I don't know what they are doing,
but it looks fun.

1412
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,820
- Yes.
- It looks fun.

1413
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,550
I used to have fun with them.

1414
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,190
- You can't change once you pick.
- The noodles go deep.

1415
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,250
- You can't change once you pick.
- You know,

1416
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,420
they are covered
with cheese and cream.

1417
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,820
You can only pick one.

1418
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,230
(After much deliberation,
he picks a noodle.)

1419
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,460
You are done.

1420
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,230
It's this one. Please let it short.

1421
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,670
It's over if it breaks.

1422
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:48,730
Please let it be short.

1423
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,340
(What?)

1424
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,940
(Is that it?)

1425
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,500
(It's obvious that So Min won.)

1426
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,050
Kwang Soo, come here.

1427
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,440
Look at this. Yours is ridiculous.

1428
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,480
You are done.

1429
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,980
The dish is mine.

1430
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,290
Come here.

1431
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:05,920
(So Min gets Cream Pasta
with Salted Pollack Roe and Bacon.)

1432
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,360
(Satisfied)

1433
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,960
- So Min, do you taste...
- It looks delicious.

1434
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,630
- all the ingredients...
- It looks delicious.

1435
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:13,860
in the name?

1436
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,090
Yes. It's tasty, but there is a lot.
I wish I could share.

1437
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,300
It contains
salted pollack roe, right?

1438
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,690
- Yes, it does.
- Salted pollack roe and cream.

1439
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:19,800
I see.

1440
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,710
You know,

1441
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,770
it's hard to find a dish
that's 28 letters long.

1442
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,500
I can only find one
that's 25 letters long.

1443
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,110
Why are they so good
at finding things?

1444
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,270
This is bad.

1445
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,750
- Jae Suk!
- Let's surf the Web.

1446
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,880
- What?
- Jae Suk!

1447
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,440
(Haha finds something
when they were about to give up.)

1448
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,690
- Hold on.
- What?

1449
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,150
- This one has 45 letters.
- What?

1450
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,690
(45 letters?)

1451
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,750
- 45 letters?
- Really?

1452
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,290
Look.

1453
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,000
It actually exists.
I can't believe it.

1454
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,860
(My goodness.)

1455
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,000
This is unbelievable.

1456
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,690
- Let's go.
- It's bibim guksu.

1457
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,770
- Bibim guksu has...
- Bibim naengmyeon.

1458
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,500
- Let's go.
- This is unbelievable.

1459
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,110
- This is...
- This is unbelievable.

1460
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,210
- This is incredible.
- It actually exists.

1461
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,670
I bet the production crew
didn't expect this.

1462
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,750
You can't beat...

1463
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,480
- 45 letters.
- Are they on the road again?

1464
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,020
- I think she is done.
- That's good.

1465
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,420
She ate with gusto.

1466
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,690
- She ate everything.
- I know.

1467
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,980
So Min's team succeeded
to clear a dish...

1468
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,710
that's 27 letters long.

1469
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,090
That's what matters.

1470
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,590
We should hit the road again.

1471
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,400
I don't think we should search
on the street.

1472
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,750
- Jong Kook.
- What?

1473
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,440
Sweet Melon, Parmesan,
Prosciutto That Has Been Cured...

1474
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,300
- for 24 Months, and...
- And...

1475
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,210
- Buffalo Mozzarella.
- Okay.

1476
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,570
- 30... 31 letters.
- 31 letters.

1477
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,650
Is that the name?

1478
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,150
- Are you sure it's the name?
- Hold on.

1479
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,570
- It's the name.
- This is the English name.

1480
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,480
- This is the English name.
- It's the name.

1481
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,420
- It's the name.
- What is this dish?

1482
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:43,880
- A pizza?
- Are you sure it's the name?

1483
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,360
It's on the menu.

1484
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:46,960
Are you sure it's the name?

1485
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,460
The English name is...

1486
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,250
They translated it into Korean.

1487
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,690
- You are right.
- This is driving me crazy.

1488
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,800
It's the name.

1489
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,170
- Where is the restaurant?
- Where is it?

1490
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,360
It's in Hongdae.

1491
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,730
- Hongdae?
- It's near.

1492
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,070
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1493
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:02,860
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors
this time?

1494
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,340
So Min can choose...

1495
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:10,000
a member to eliminate
just like she did the last time.

1496
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,520
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1497
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,480
That's funny because it wasn't me.

1498
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,020
- It wasn't me.
- Listen.

1499
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,520
- Even if someone else suggested it,
- That's right.

1500
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,110
the team captain makes
the final decision.

1501
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,980
- That's her responsibility.
- That's the weight of her position.

1502
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,860
"One who wears the crown
must bear its weight."

1503
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,000
That's her responsibility.

1504
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,800
- I can tell that you are a writer.
- Stop it.

1505
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,920
Stop it.

1506
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,270
- I am sorry, but it's a saying.
- It's a saying.

1507
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,590
- It's a famous saying.
- It's a saying.

1508
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:35,800
Is it a saying?

1509
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,300
"Must bear its weight."

1510
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,980
Shall we play fair this time?

1511
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,270
- Okay.
- Jong Kook isn't sullen anymore.

1512
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,900
- That's good.
- Shall we start anew...

1513
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,020
- with a round of applause?
- Okay.

1514
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,570
Let's start anew
with a round of applause.

1515
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,520
Let's start anew.
Let's clap the slate. 1, 2, 3.

1516
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,690
This is good.

1517
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,550
(It's hard to be the team captain.)

1518
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,690
This is good.

1519
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,690
This is a familiar neighborhood.

1520
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,250
We are in Hongdae.

1521
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,920
We will get off
as soon as we turn left.

1522
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,400
It just needs to be on the menu.

1523
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,670
- That's right.
- It just needs to be on the menu.

1524
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,440
Please stop here. This is the place.

1525
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,610
(Is it Haha and Jong Kook's
barbecue restaurant?)

1526
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,770
- The dish is...
- Hold on.

1527
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:14,940
- It just needs to be on the menu.
- It's on the menu.

1528
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,980
- It's on the menu.
- A dish with 45 letters?

1529
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,250
There is a dish with 45 letters.

1530
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

1531
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,980
Hello.

1532
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,020
Hello.

1533
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,020
(As soon as they enter,
Haha's friend, Geun Sik, appears.)

1534
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,210
- Hello.
- Hello.

1535
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,860
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1536
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,460
You look familiar.

1537
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,920
Let's sit down.

1538
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,320
Sir, please give us the menu.

1539
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,500
Please give us the menu.

1540
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,270
Let me remind
that it needs to be on the menu.

1541
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,400
- It's on the menu.
- It's on the menu.

1542
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,570
Why else would we be here?

1543
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,230
I have been to this restaurant
many times,

1544
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,460
- but I never saw such a thing.
- It's on the menu.

1545
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,630
- It really exists.
- It came to be in 2020...

1546
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:46,400
As an event.

1547
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,300
Since it's a special dish,
it's at the back of the menu.

1548
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,980
- It's at the back.
- It's on the wall too.

1549
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,070
- Is it on the wall too?
- It's on the wall too.

1550
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,840
- There it is.
- There it is.

1551
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,820
(It counts if it has been sold
as a dish on the menu.)

1552
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,250
(What's the dish?)

1553
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,960
- There it is.
- There it is.

1554
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,960
(Nino Maximus Keyser Soze Sonador
Sparta and Jack Sparrow's...)

1555
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,800
- Nino Maximus Keyser Soze...
- Keyser Soze...

1556
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,320
Sonador Sparta and Jack Sparrow's...

1557
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,900
Beloved Lutartha Sparta
Kook's Lovely Bibim Naengmyeon.

1558
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,940
- It actually exists.
- Let's see if it's on the menu.

1559
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,540
- Here it is.
- Here it is.

1560
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,630
This is the menu, okay?

1561
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,340
- It exists.
- It exists.

1562
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,270
Look at this.

1563
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:27,380
- It's obviously fake.
- Nino Maximus...

1564
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,650
It doesn't even have a price
next to it.

1565
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,710
(30 minutes ago)

1566
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,190
(Geun Sik.)

1567
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,590
(I'm doing Running Man right now.
Can you create a menu for me?)

1568
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,590
(What do you mean?)

1569
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,800
(Just make up a long name for
bibim naengmyeon on the menu.)

1570
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,020
(Do it right away.
I'm heading over there now.)

1571
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:46,340
(That's how the Nino Maximus Beloved
Bibim Naengmyeon got created.)

1572
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,730
Nino Maximus Keyser Soze
Sonador Sparta...

1573
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:51,270
and Jack Sparrow's Beloved...

1574
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,840
- Lutartha Sparta Kook's Lovely...
- Lutartha Sparta Kook's Lovely...

1575
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,300
- Bibim Naengmyeon.
- Bibim Naengmyeon.

1576
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,650
How many letters is that?

1577
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,340
It doesn't even have a price.

1578
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,270
It shouldn't cost too much.

1579
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,480
It's the same as any other
bibim naengmyeon.

1580
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,550
Sir, how much is bibim naengmyeon?

1581
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,650
- 5 dollars.
- It's all 5 dollars.

1582
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:06,920
It's five dollars.

1583
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,050
- That's cheap.
- You can just tell.

1584
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,130
If this is different from
the regular dish, I'll accept.

1585
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,460
(Show him that it's different
from the regular bibim naengmyeon.)

1586
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,590
Regular bibim naengmyeon is...

1587
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:20,770
Can you order
a regular bibim naengmyeon?

1588
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,960
The egg is...

1589
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,340
It's essentially the same thing.

1590
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,040
(He comes out of nowhere.)

1591
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:29,300
(He interrupts tactlessly.)

1592
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,480
What?

1593
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,340
- What did you say?
- It's half-and-half.

1594
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,710
It's half-and-half.

1595
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,650
The regular bibim naengmyeon...

1596
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,190
- True.
- comes with a boiled egg...

1597
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,650
- It's only a quarter.
- that's only a quarter.

1598
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,630
This is the restaurant's...

1599
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,590
- Right.
- special menu.

1600
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:47,130
- That's cheap.
- You can just tell it's cheap.

1601
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,500
Let me know
if this is too much for you.

1602
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,960
My mouth is getting watery.

1603
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,340
It's impossible to find a dish...

1604
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,960
- It's impossible.
- that's over 40 letters long.

1605
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,170
I'm done.

1606
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,210
(She finishes eating
with 3 minutes left.)

1607
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,900
- She's done.
- You have to approve.

1608
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,800
Ji Hyo finished it,
so please take a prize badge.

1609
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,800
(She gets a prize badge.)

1610
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,940
They have no choice, right?

1611
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,440
- What are they going to do?
- It's on the menu.

1612
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,820
It's on the menu.

1613
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,940
After some discussion,

1614
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,550
we've decided to approve
Ji Hyo's prize badge.

1615
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,230
(What about the mission?)

1616
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:25,980
Mission failed.

1617
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,000
(47 letters were disapproved.)

1618
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,270
If we approve this,

1619
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,950
the other team will try to
create a menu too.

1620
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,750
- That's true.
- We did think far enough.

1621
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,060
It doesn't matter if we win today.
We'll keep suffering.

1622
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,080
We at least got a prize badge.

1623
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,180
- That's at least comforting.
- Let's get going.

1624
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,250
(They earn a prize badge
and conclude the first mission.)

1625
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,390
Hey, weaklings.

1626
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,470
- Here they are.
- Oh, dear.

1627
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,500
- We heard.
- Oh, dear.

1628
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,040
Was it that difficult to find?

1629
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,540
You were so short on letters.

1630
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,910
So Team So Min won.

1631
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:03,310
That was close.

1632
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:05,350
Round one is now over.

1633
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:06,640
Let's move onto round two.

1634
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,120
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1635
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,390
Sit with your team.

1636
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,980
Shall we?

1637
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,310
Okay.

1638
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,930
His name is Se Chan from now on.

1639
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,830
- Sure.
- Se Chan.

1640
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,600
Se Chan.

1641
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,660
Sure, you can call it Se Chan.

1642
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,560
Come here.

1643
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,160
- Captain.
- I think...

1644
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:33,310
So Min has a strategy now.

1645
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:34,640
(He's trying to stir
something up again.)

1646
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,640
- Oh, gosh.
- My Se Chan.

1647
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,750
(She's trying to seduce Se Chan.)

1648
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,020
- What are you doing?
- My Se Chan.

1649
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,310
What is she doing?

1650
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:45,720
This second mission is a quiz
related to memorable commercials.

1651
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,120
Memorable commercials?

1652
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,850
It's called Aged Commercials.

1653
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,890
- This is ours to take.
- Good.

1654
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,390
We're at a disadvantage.

1655
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,100
The team that guesses more
out of the five commercials wins.

1656
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,160
Okay!

1657
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,600
After getting the answer right,

1658
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,790
you will act out the commercial
and fill in the missing line.

1659
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,430
- All right.
- The line.

1660
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:05,540
There are so many old people...

1661
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,370
It's a gathering of the old fossils.

1662
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,350
- They have so many old people.
- They're the old fossils.

1663
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,450
What are you saying?

1664
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,450
The youngest is 40 something.

1665
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,040
They're the aged ones.

1666
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,120
- They're the old fossils.
- My gosh.

1667
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,680
- We're all young.
- Excuse me.

1668
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,720
- You should join us.
- Aren't you...

1669
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,180
all old too?

1670
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,450
(This is a controversy.)

1671
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,480
We're not.

1672
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,100
- You're not?
- I'm old,

1673
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,020
- but they're not.
- They're old too.

1674
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,160
- They're not.
- They definitely are.

1675
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,430
You're all over 40.

1676
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,640
- No.
- That's true.

1677
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,830
There's 1 person who just turned 40.

1678
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,640
- Still.
- I'm a newbie.

1679
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,480
- I'm a new 40.
- Newbie.

1680
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,730
- We're at a disadvantage.
- We're going to lose.

1681
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,040
We're at a disadvantage.

1682
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,640
We're going to win for sure.

1683
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,250
- Let's do this.
- Whoever calls out,

1684
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,580
"Let me answer,"
will get to go first.

1685
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,660
Here's the first question
for Aged Commercials.

1686
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,120
Play...

1687
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,160
- I'm going to get this.
- the first commercial.

1688
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,430
(It's a beverage commercial from
the 2000s with many catchphrases.)

1689
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,830
(Zo In Sung and Jun Ji Hyun's
emotional acting is the key.)

1690
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,020
I thought you were busy with work.

1691
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,890
- Is dating part of work too?
- Don't jump to conclusions.

1692
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,140
Why? Are you embarrassed of me?
Do I look pathetic?

1693
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,140
- Be quiet.
- Are you sorry?

1694
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,100
What's wrong with you?
Who are you to yell at me?

1695
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:14,910
I thought you were busy with work.

1696
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,100
What's this?

1697
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,180
What's wrong with you?
Who are you to yell at me?

1698
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,350
Have you ever bought me dinner
at a nice restaurant?

1699
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:24,540
Have you ever dropped me off
with your car like other people?

1700
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:30,430
(She got caught on a date with
somebody that's not her boyfriend.)

1701
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,160
(Commercials back then had stories.)

1702
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,120
- Was there a commercial like this?
- I've never seen it.

1703
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,390
Is this a commercial?

1704
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:36,520
I've never seen it.

1705
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,370
Don't you have a sense of pride?

1706
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,200
Get yourself together!

1707
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,540
(Blank)

1708
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,910
(This is the product.)

1709
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,580
Liars...

1710
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:54,750
Is love enough for love?

1711
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,250
(The actors' enthusiasm
made this commercial shine.)

1712
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,410
I don't remember the line,
but I remember seeing it.

1713
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,020
- I don't know. I have no clue.
- This is so long.

1714
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,160
Wait.

1715
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,450
- We have to act this out?
- This existed?

1716
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:06,730
We have to do this?

1717
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,020
You just need to
make it sound similar.

1718
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,790
This is for So Min and Se Chan.

1719
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,930
- They have to do it.
- I'm looking forward to it.

1720
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,560
- They need to act.
- I'm going to be Yang In Sung.

1721
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,930
You'll become Yang In Sung.

1722
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,430
Here comes Yang In Sung.

1723
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,640
Personality controversy.

1724
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,270
He said "personality controversy."

1725
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:22,200
(It's a play on words.)

1726
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,750
If I do this,

1727
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,270
there'll be
a personality controversy.

1728
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,680
I saw that a lot
when I was young.

1729
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,450
- This...
- "Are you sorry?"

1730
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,810
I don't remember.

1731
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:33,810
The team that wants to go first
can start.

1732
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,660
If we go first, they'll copy us.

1733
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,160
- I think I know.
- They might copy us, so let's wait.

1734
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,330
We can't get it on our first try.

1735
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,230
- Right?
- Isn't this right?

1736
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,290
- Go.
- "Get yourself together."

1737
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:47,230
"I was never enough."

1738
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,330
- That's right.
- Okay. Go.

1739
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,560
- Let me answer.
- Go.

1740
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,270
You can start.

1741
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,100
- Please come up.
- Suk Jin wants to do it.

1742
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,580
Go, Ji Hyo.

1743
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,580
(Team Suk Jin's first attempt!)

1744
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,410
- Jee In Sung.
- Jee In Sung?

1745
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,720
Gosh, Jee In Sung.

1746
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,540
He has to worry about
his personality.

1747
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,950
His skin is oily.

1748
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,450
Is he a Jee Rogue?

1749
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,720
Jee In Sung.

1750
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:08,180
- Go.
- Come this way.

1751
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:12,390
Hey, you said you were busy at work,
but you were dating another guy.

1752
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,390
You said you were busy at work,
but you were dating another guy.

1753
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:16,730
(What?)

1754
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:18,020
What are you doing?

1755
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,330
That's not the commercial.

1756
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,270
- This is horrible acting.
- Stop it.

1757
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,100
- I can't do Zo In Sung.
- Just do the original.

1758
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,640
- I can't do Zo In Sung.
- Copy the lines.

1759
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,370
I thought you were busy with work.
Is dating part of work too?

1760
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,100
Don't jump to conclusions.

1761
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,640
Why? Are you embarrassed of me?
Do I look pathetic?

1762
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,580
- He's yelling.
- Be quiet.

1763
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,540
- Are you sorry?
- Have you ever bought me dinner...

1764
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,520
at a nice restaurant?
Did you ever pour water for me?

1765
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,290
Did you ever
open the car door for me?

1766
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,230
You did nothing for me.

1767
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:48,000
I guess you have a sense of pride.
Do you have a sense of pride?

1768
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,000
Get yourself together.

1769
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,830
(This is the blank part.)

1770
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:52,930
This is the important part.

1771
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,160
I was never enough.

1772
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,200
Good!

1773
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,000
(I was never enough!)

1774
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,500
Does she remember?

1775
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,200
Liars...

1776
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,230
(Liars!)

1777
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:05,040
I'll bury all of them.

1778
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,250
- What?
- What was that?

1779
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,270
- What?
- "I'll bury all of them?"

1780
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,120
- I followed my instinct.
- You don't say that...

1781
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,140
- in a commercial.
- You'll bury them?

1782
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,220
- Why would you bury me?
- I stayed true to my emotions.

1783
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,290
- When will you stop?
- Goodness.

1784
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,930
Number 1 and 2 were both wrong.

1785
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:18,930
- They were wrong.
- We were wrong?

1786
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:19,930
Both?

1787
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,950
- We're ready.
- What's number one?

1788
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,200
(They're excited to see
who's up for Team So Min.)

1789
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,790
- Jun Ji Min.
- I'm excited for them.

1790
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:28,200
Jun Ji Min.

1791
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:30,730
- Personality controversy.
- Yang In Sung.

1792
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,140
Saeb In Sung.

1793
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,580
- Please say, "ready, action."
- Ready, action.

1794
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,410
I thought you were busy with work.
Is dating part of work too?

1795
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:39,520
Don't jump to conclusions.

1796
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,410
Why? Are you embarrassed of me?
Do I look pathetic?

1797
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,790
Be quiet.

1798
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,680
- Are you sorry?
- What's wrong with you?

1799
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,390
Who are you to yell at me?

1800
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,930
Have you ever bought me dinner
at a nice restaurant?

1801
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:52,620
Have you ever dropped me off
with your car like other people?

1802
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:56,430
Hey, does it drive you nuts that
I'm dating somebody else?

1803
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,890
Does it make you mad
to see me like this?

1804
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,730
Does it make you mad?
I guess you have a sense of pride.

1805
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,310
Do you have a sense of pride?

1806
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:05,100
(This couple acts well.)

1807
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,500
Get yourself together.
Do you know what love is? Do you?

1808
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,950
"Do you know what love is? Do you?"

1809
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,180
"Do you know what love is?"

1810
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,810
Liars...

1811
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,410
don't get presents from Santa Claus.

1812
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,720
(He summoned Santa Claus.)

1813
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,720
You know that?

1814
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,020
(Is this a Christmas commercial?)

1815
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,020
Liars don't get presents...

1816
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,560
- from Santa Claus!
- Your hair.

1817
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,330
- Is number one wrong too?
- I think it's right.

1818
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:30,020
- It's incorrect.
- Is it similar?

1819
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,430
- It's wrong?
- Two?

1820
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,560
I'll give you a hint for number one.

1821
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:36,640
It starts with "Love is..."

1822
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,910
"Love is amusing to you, right?"

1823
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,140
- I'm right.
- What is it?

1824
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,540
- Is it right?
- "Love is amusing to you, right?"

1825
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:41,680
- Let's go.
- Go.

1826
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,950
We'll give it a try.

1827
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,480
I remembered.

1828
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,270
- This is the answer.
- I think you're right.

1829
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,910
- Let's do it.
- I thought you were busy with work.

1830
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,020
Is dating part of work too?

1831
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,310
- Get yourself together.
- Let's go!

1832
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:55,520
(Get yourself together.)

1833
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,430
Does love look like water to you?

1834
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:59,620
(Does love look like water to you?)

1835
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,120
- That's not right.
- Lairs...

1836
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,970
Liars...

1837
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,620
(Liars...)

1838
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,500
have no right to love.

1839
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,700
- For when you're 2 percent short.
- For when you're 2 percent short.

1840
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:12,770
(The performance is 2 percent short,
but the ending is perfect.)

1841
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,140
Only the second one is correct.

1842
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:15,770
I told you not to do it!

1843
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:17,370
The tone was similar.

1844
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:19,040
I told you not to do the second one.

1845
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,910
They didn't know about that one.

1846
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:24,020
Let me give you a hint.
This is a poor couple.

1847
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,250
This is a poor couple.

1848
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:27,720
- The woman lied to this man.
- A poor couple.

1849
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,730
Despite...

1850
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:32,250
their financial difficulties,
they loved each other.

1851
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:34,450
(Fiddling with his phone)

1852
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,660
It makes no sense.

1853
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,390
Jae Suk, you can't look it up.

1854
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,500
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1855
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,830
- What is wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

1856
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,370
- I didn't look it up.
- How could you be so shameless?

1857
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,560
I didn't look it up.

1858
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,000
- For goodness' sake.
- This is...

1859
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,730
He got a text.

1860
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,000
There is no way he got a text.

1861
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,310
Who was it? Who told on me?

1862
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,520
(He yells at the production crew
in embarrassment.)

1863
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:57,120
This is something
the elders say often.

1864
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,410
Give it a try.

1865
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,060
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer. This is it.

1866
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,930
- This is it. This is it.
- Let me answer.

1867
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,660
- This is it.
- I don't think it's correct.

1868
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,930
- It's correct.
- It's too old-school.

1869
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:07,120
It's what the elders say.

1870
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,120
You should try it.

1871
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,290
- Okay.
- It's too old-school.

1872
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:11,100
- Are you sure it's correct?
- It's correct!

1873
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,540
Does it drive you nuts
that I am dating somebody else...

1874
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,970
- and not working?
- It drives me nuts!

1875
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,660
Does it make you mad
to see me like this?

1876
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,910
- It makes me mad!
- Does it make you mad?

1877
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:20,200
I guess you have a sense of pride.
Do you have a sense of pride?

1878
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,870
- Yes, I do.
- Get yourself together.

1879
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:23,040
Okay. Check it out.

1880
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,410
(The second answer
has been revealed.)

1881
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:25,750
- Love...
- You're right.

1882
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:28,540
(If they get the first answer,
they will win.)

1883
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:30,520
doesn't put food on the table.

1884
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,180
- What?
- Is that the answer?

1885
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,250
Liars...

1886
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,390
Liars...

1887
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:43,620
- have no right to love.
- That sounds right.

1888
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:46,600
(Team Suk Jin's answer
is correct.)

1889
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,200
"Love doesn't put food
on the table."

1890
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:50,310
We shouldn't have given away
the second answer.

1891
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,730
I told you it's correct.

1892
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:52,930
Gosh,

1893
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,500
it's an expression old men use.

1894
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:57,080
I guess you have a sense of pride.

1895
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,680
Do you have a sense of pride?

1896
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,640
Get yourself together.

1897
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:02,810
Love doesn't put food on the table.

1898
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,220
It's correct.

1899
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:07,910
(Suk Jin really is an old man.)

1900
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,480
Liars...

1901
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,830
have no right to love.

1902
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,290
Is love enough...

1903
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,470
for love?

1904
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,770
(We could have won.)

1905
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,230
We revealed the second answer
too early on.

1906
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,430
- Seriously.
- I remember the commercial now.

1907
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:25,140
Their performance was incredible.

1908
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:26,980
They filmed it hundreds of times.

1909
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,270
How would you know?
That might not be the case.

1910
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:33,270
- They are excellent actors.
- They filmed it for a day...

1911
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:34,580
to get an okay from the director.

1912
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:35,910
I had no idea
about the first answer.

1913
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:38,120
Here comes
the second aged commercial...

1914
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,950
- you barely remember.
- Okay.

1915
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,290
We remember that period of time.

1916
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:43,350
Let's go.

1917
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,830
Here is the second question.

1918
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:48,160
- Play.
- But I don't remember...

1919
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,560
(It's a coffee commercial
from 2008.)

1920
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,160
Da In, are you wearing makeup?

1921
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:53,660
- She is wearing a skirt too!
- Go away!

1922
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,700
I know this one.

1923
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,270
I auditioned for it.

1924
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,680
Really?

1925
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,180
- She is wearing a skirt too!
- Go away!

1926
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,700
She is wearing makeup!

1927
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,980
(She is waiting for her crush.)

1928
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:08,180
Sometimes,
lies are necessary for love.

1929
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:13,450
Hey,

1930
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,430
I think I have a fever.

1931
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,230
Of course, you need wits
to fall for those lies.

1932
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,060
I wish you luck.

1933
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,770
- This is...
- Why...

1934
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,660
It was a popular commercial.

1935
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,500
It was incredibly popular.

1936
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,600
I don't remember it.

1937
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,430
- People parodied it.
- That's right.

1938
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,310
I just remember the woman's line.

1939
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,910
(Although I auditioned for it,
I don't remember the whole thing.)

1940
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:38,370
"Hey, I think I have a fever."

1941
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,870
Maybe this is the answer.

1942
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,120
"Do you like me feverishly?"

1943
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,560
- For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

1944
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,560
(The comedian's ad-lib
makes them speechless.)

1945
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:51,950
When the woman,
Ryu Hyun Jin, spoke,

1946
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:53,200
the man laughed.

1947
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:55,250
(Ryu Hyun Jin?)

1948
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,730
Suk Jin, Ryu Hyun Jin
is a baseball player.

1949
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,230
Her name is Da In.

1950
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:59,470
- Suk Jin.
- Yoo Da In.

1951
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,390
- The man's name is Lee Hyun Jin.
- He mixed up the names.

1952
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:03,910
- Suk Jin, you are unbelievable.
- Lee Hyun Jin.

1953
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:06,270
Don't you remember the man's line?

1954
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:07,580
- I don't remember it.
- You auditioned for it.

1955
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,480
- "Are you in a lot of pain?"
- Let's try it.

1956
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,810
Let's see what we come up with.

1957
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:14,140
Let's see what we come up with.
Ji Hyo, try it.

1958
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,140
"Hey, I think I have a fever."

1959
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,480
(Suk Jin and Ji Hyo get ready.)

1960
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:20,450
- This is...
- Is this university for the elders?

1961
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:22,890
Is this university for the elders?

1962
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:25,080
- The university...
- The university for the elders.

1963
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,430
(Team Suk Jin gives it a go!)

1964
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:29,700
Go.

1965
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:32,560
- Hey.
- Yes?

1966
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,160
- What...
- That was so late.

1967
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,870
How could you address the principle
that way?

1968
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:38,100
How could you address the principle
that way?

1969
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:41,640
- You should bow to him.
- The president of the university.

1970
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:44,540
(Suk Jin failed to graduate
and became the principle.)

1971
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:48,580
- I can't do this.
- How many years did he move down?

1972
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,750
I can't get immersed in it.

1973
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,810
I have no idea
what kind of commercial this is.

1974
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:55,120
Let's do this one by one.

1975
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,450
(A forbidden romance between
the principle and a student?)

1976
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:57,680
"Hey, I think I have a fever."

1977
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,290
"Hot water is pouring out!"

1978
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,620
That's how
this commercial should go.

1979
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,290
Take my hand.

1980
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:08,100
Hey, I think I have a fever.

1981
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:11,700
You are burning up.

1982
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:15,080
That could be the answer.

1983
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,680
- That was the worst.
- That could be the answer.

1984
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,250
- That was the worst.
- What was that?

1985
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,370
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1986
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,680
- We have an idea.
- It's our turn.

1987
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,810
- Aren't you going to go?
- Let me answer. We have an idea.

1988
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:24,580
- Sit down.
- Do this.

1989
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:29,120
What a scary underclassman!

1990
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:32,580
(Kim Jong Kook, the queen
of the PE Department)

1991
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,230
That's cute.

1992
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,270
(I should have gone out the back.)

1993
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:43,470
- Hey, I think I have a fever.
- Put his hand on your forehead.

1994
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,640
(Please spare me.)

1995
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,700
What are you doing?

1996
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,310
(I think I have a fever, okay?)

1997
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,750
I think my hand is warmer.

1998
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,640
- What? Is it incorrect?
- Is it incorrect?

1999
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,310
- Was it close?
- It's correct.

2000
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,080
- It's incorrect.
- No, it's correct.

2001
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,910
Come on. It's incorrect.

2002
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,430
- Let me answer.
- Try it with Jae Suk.

2003
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,180
(Did they figure it out?)

2004
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,450
- Here we go.
- Ready, set, go.

2005
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:11,790
- Hey.
- Yes?

2006
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,560
- I think I have a fever.
- How hot!

2007
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,230
Your forehead is boiling up!

2008
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,970
Your forehead is boiling up!

2009
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,700
- What was that?
- "Your forehead is boiling up"?

2010
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,480
- What was that?
- That sounds ridiculous.

2011
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,810
- How hot!
- What was that?

2012
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:26,980
- This isn't it.
- Your forehead is boiling up!

2013
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,280
- Did you turn on the boiler?
- Come on.

2014
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,080
Is it incorrect?

2015
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,580
Come on, it's not a
commercial for a boiler.

2016
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,110
Give me a break.

2017
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,910
- "Your forehead is boiling up"?
- "Hey, I think I have a fever."

2018
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:40,290
I will give you
the first thing the man says.

2019
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,950
"Hey, I think I have a fever."

2020
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,660
"Being sick..."

2021
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,160
Let me answer.
"Being sick is the sign of youth."

2022
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,900
(The upperclassman's
warm consolation)

2023
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,110
Where did that come from?

2024
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,830
"Being sick..."

2025
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,280
"Makes you prettier."

2026
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,810
"Being sick makes you prettier."

2027
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,280
Let's go.

2028
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,540
- Give it a go. Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2029
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,220
Hey,

2030
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,220
I think I have a fever.

2031
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:05,110
Being sick...

2032
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,360
makes you prettier.

2033
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,860
(Being sick makes you prettier.)

2034
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,280
Is it correct?

2035
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,450
I think it's correct.

2036
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,930
(Will they succeed to get
two questions right in a row?)

2037
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,470
- It's correct.
- I think it's correct.

2038
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,820
"Being sick
makes you look prettier."

2039
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,690
- We did it.
- My goodness.

2040
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,440
- We did it.
- Our answer was very close.

2041
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,640
(Team Suk Jin's answer is correct.)

2042
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,200
That's good.

2043
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,500
(The answer)

2044
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,640
Hey,

2045
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,480
I think I have a fever.

2046
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,280
Of course, you need wits
to fall for those lies.

2047
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,720
Being sick makes you look prettier.

2048
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,250
I wish you luck.

2049
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,250
That makes my heart flutter.

2050
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:46,190
If we get one more question right,
we win.

2051
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:49,490
- So Min, we are nearly there.
- We need to do this.

2052
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:50,530
(Then Team So Min gets
2 questions right in a row!)

2053
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:52,270
I am Dongwon.

2054
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:54,660
- This is the final round.
- The final round.

2055
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,140
We barely managed to catch up.

2056
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,030
Let's go. We came this far.

2057
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:59,810
- Let's get this right.
- I had nearly given up.

2058
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:01,640
- This is the last question.
- We will win.

2059
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,980
- Here it comes.
- This is the last question.

2060
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,070
(Jang Na Ra, 18 years ago)

2061
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:07,370
We're just friends.

2062
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,020
I...

2063
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,040
never loved you.

2064
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:14,020
- I know this commercial!
- This is...

2065
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:16,750
- Kim Jae Won.
- Jae Won.

2066
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:20,820
I'm going to break you.

2067
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:21,900
Oh, my.

2068
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:26,770
Love is not...

2069
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:28,160
(Love is not...)

2070
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,770
"Love is not..."

2071
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:32,770
"It's..."

2072
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,140
That's the catchphrase.

2073
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,780
Gosh, my memory is blurred.

2074
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,900
Love is not a joke.

2075
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,370
That's a song title.

2076
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,240
<i>- Love is not a joke
- Love is not a joke</i>

2077
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:44,690
(Smiling)

2078
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,240
Love is not furniture.

2079
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,390
- It's science.
- It's science.

2080
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,320
(They are ridiculous.)

2081
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,750
It's a commercial
for a green plum drink.

2082
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,190
You have the right approach.

2083
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,230
- The drink is called Green Plum.
- Yes. Green Plum.

2084
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:56,770
"Love is not green"?

2085
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:57,990
Love is green.

2086
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:00,690
Love is not yellow, it's green.

2087
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:03,400
Love is not red, it's green.

2088
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,440
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer. This is it.

2089
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,240
They might get it right.

2090
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:10,980
We're... We're just friends.

2091
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,000
I never loved you.

2092
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,570
I'm going to break you.

2093
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,320
Okay.

2094
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,490
That was good.

2095
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:20,560
Love...

2096
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,530
is not pink. It's green.

2097
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,450
What?

2098
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,900
(Love is not pink. It's green?)

2099
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,970
Pink? Where did pink come from?

2100
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,430
Try it.
The two of you should try it.

2101
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:33,490
Try it.

2102
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,690
I think this is it.

2103
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,970
- I think this is it.
- They might get it right.

2104
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:37,240
- But...
- We're just friends.

2105
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,240
I never loved you.

2106
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,280
(Coldhearted)

2107
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,500
(Splashing cold water)

2108
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:47,370
(I am so upset!)

2109
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,820
That's so cold. That's so cold.
I am sorry.

2110
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,190
I am sorry.

2111
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:52,690
I am sorry.

2112
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:54,750
I shouldn't have messed with you.

2113
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:56,360
I am sorry. You must be upset.

2114
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:00,490
That's a comment
that would really anger So Min.

2115
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:03,100
I'm going to break you.

2116
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,900
- Narration.
- Female voice.

2117
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,070
Love is...

2118
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,190
not green.

2119
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,030
It's a green plum.

2120
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,970
(A green plum?)

2121
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:14,330
No?

2122
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,030
- My bad.
- It's okay.

2123
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,110
(What's the answer?)

2124
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,610
"Love is not green.
It's a green plum..."

2125
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:20,910
sounds kind of immature.

2126
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:22,320
This is it. This is it!

2127
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,540
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

2128
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,580
- Let me answer.
- You be the woman.

2129
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,390
- Be the woman.
- Go for it.

2130
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:28,190
Go.

2131
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,280
We're just friends.
I never loved you.

2132
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,730
I'm going to break you.

2133
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,320
(Flicking)

2134
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,660
(Glancing)

2135
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,120
(Why is he looking around?)

2136
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,660
He's unbelievable. He looked at
himself after splashing the water.

2137
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:46,030
(He's in the middle of an act,
but he still loves himself.)

2138
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,370
(He splashes the water...)

2139
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,650
(and scans himself.)

2140
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,150
Did you see him?

2141
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,680
He splashed the water.
He obviously splashed it on her,

2142
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,610
- but he looked at himself.
- In case he got water on it.

2143
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:57,780
That's sharp.

2144
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:00,080
- I got goosebumps.
- My bad.

2145
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,860
You're the worst.

2146
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:05,320
I always think this is the worst
moment, and he surprises me.

2147
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:08,230
(He's breaking his own record
for the worst moment for 10 years.)

2148
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:11,990
Love is not a fantasy.

2149
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:14,330
It's reality.

2150
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:17,070
(Is he making a confession?)

2151
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:19,000
- What was that?
- Wasn't that it?

2152
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,780
That's when you sign divorce papers.

2153
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,180
We thought of
"Love doesn't feed you."

2154
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,610
Here's a hint.
Haha and Ji Hyo's first try...

2155
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,650
- was very close.
- See?

2156
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:30,690
I said so.

2157
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:33,360
- Let me answer.
- Let's go.

2158
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,560
We'll go.

2159
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,750
(Get it right.)

2160
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,490
- Do it.
- We'll go.

2161
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,060
(He spots the water bottle.)

2162
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,100
Okay.

2163
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,470
I'll be Jang Na Ra.

2164
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,160
What are you talking about?

2165
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:48,070
- Why?
- What?

2166
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:49,240
You're Jang Na Ra.

2167
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,900
I mean... Am I?

2168
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:52,400
I'm the woman.

2169
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,810
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

2170
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,040
(Se Chan wins
and takes Jang Na Ra's part.)

2171
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,780
He was late.

2172
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,520
(Drinking)

2173
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,690
Hurry up.

2174
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:05,890
He has water in his mouth.

2175
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:07,190
Are you going to do this?

2176
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:08,990
(In a low voice)

2177
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:10,390
This is not the last game.

2178
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:12,730
We're just friends.

2179
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,290
I never loved you.

2180
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,570
(2 water strikes)

2181
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:22,530
You got your face washed.

2182
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:23,770
I'm going to break you.

2183
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:26,330
Love is not pink.

2184
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:29,310
It's green.

2185
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:32,180
- It's wrong.
- Let me answer.

2186
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,910
- No.
- Let's go for it.

2187
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,540
I'm going to break you.

2188
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,610
(Team Suk Jin's turn)

2189
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:39,350
Pink is not the color of love.

2190
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,520
- It's green.
- That's the answer.

2191
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,150
(Are pink and green colors correct?)

2192
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:45,730
- You were 99 percent correct.
- What?

2193
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,060
Let me answer!

2194
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,120
What is it?

2195
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,290
(He's certain.)

2196
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:51,790
This is the last time,

2197
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,270
- so Jong Kook and I'll go.
- Okay.

2198
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:54,360
Jong Kook.

2199
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,400
(Are you going to challenge me?)

2200
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,740
Good.

2201
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:58,140
(He gets a new water bottle.)

2202
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,070
Use the old water, punk!

2203
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:02,940
(This country has a water shortage.)

2204
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:05,240
I drank from it.

2205
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,310
This is the last time.

2206
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,650
- Is it me?
- Yes.

2207
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,240
(This is the last question,
so I might as well...)

2208
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,490
(Hold on.)

2209
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,560
He loaded his gun.

2210
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,820
Let's go. Ready, action.

2211
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:17,360
(Water Sniper Kwang Soo is
fully loaded.)

2212
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,150
(He's speechless.)

2213
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:21,490
We're just friends.

2214
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,190
I never loved you.

2215
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:27,900
(This is a water bomb.)

2216
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,610
(It turns into a trashy drama.)

2217
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:32,830
(The water slap follows
the kimchi slap.)

2218
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:35,870
This is improbable. Good ad-lib.
This is ad-lib.

2219
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,610
(The male lead is mad
because this is improbable.)

2220
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:39,310
(The female lead is unafraid
because this is the last question.)

2221
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:41,570
What are you going to do now?

2222
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,980
I understand why he's mad.

2223
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,820
- I'll hit the other person.
- I understand.

2224
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,890
- Me too.
- I understand.

2225
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,360
Pink is not the color of love.

2226
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:50,780
It's green.

2227
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,120
- That's exactly what we said.
- That's what we said.

2228
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,560
What was that? Let me answer.

2229
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,450
- What was that?
- Isn't that what we said?

2230
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,290
He's in deep trouble.

2231
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:01,190
- Here's a hint.
- What was that?

2232
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:05,500
"Love is not the pink..."

2233
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,530
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2234
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,400
(We missed our chance.)

2235
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,610
- Go, Jong Kook.
- Can we go?

2236
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:13,650
What's he going to do?

2237
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:16,040
- How many bullets do you need?
- Give me all of them.

2238
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,820
What do you mean?

2239
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:20,390
- The answer is important.
- Okay, good.

2240
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:21,950
- You might forget the lines.
- Fine.

2241
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,530
Let's go.

2242
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:26,390
You'll get water on the cameras.
Move back.

2243
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,650
Something will happen.

2244
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:28,690
(He doesn't know where to look.)

2245
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:30,470
Say your line.

2246
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,570
(He's petrified.)

2247
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,240
We're just friends.

2248
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,900
(Trembling)

2249
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,480
- Next.
- I...

2250
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,280
(He predicted his fate.)

2251
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,240
(It's a super muscle mist for
moisturizing the aged skin.)

2252
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,040
I never... I never loved...

2253
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:53,520
(Kwang Soo is becoming moisturized.)

2254
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,860
I never loved... I never loved you.

2255
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,280
(He's dripping tears or water.)

2256
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,650
I'm going to break you.

2257
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:02,790
Love is not the pink hue.

2258
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:04,470
It's the green hue.

2259
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,160
(Correct)

2260
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,360
Good job.

2261
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,740
- Good job.
- Okay!

2262
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:12,200
I didn't think
my underwear would get wet.

2263
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,200
We did it.

2264
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,000
My underwear got wet.

2265
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:17,150
(Answer video)

2266
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:20,240
Love is no the pink hue.

2267
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,440
(Answer video)

2268
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,910
It's the green hue.

2269
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,580
Our team is amazing.

2270
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,730
- That was too bad.
- We turned it around.

2271
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:34,360
That was a drama without a script.

2272
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,270
We have the final scores, but
there are 1 to 2 funny commercials.

2273
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:38,860
- Let's watch them.
- Would you like to?

2274
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,860
I'll give a prize badge
to the winning team.

2275
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,070
That's good.

2276
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,470
Queen, would you like to dance?

2277
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:45,900
I remember this.

2278
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:46,900
(Shim Eun Ha and Han Seok Kyu were
young stars 20 years ago.)

2279
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,110
"Hello, I'm Han Seok Kyu."

2280
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,900
If I'm a queen,

2281
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,870
what are you?

2282
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:55,980
I'm...

2283
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,040
(Blank)

2284
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,410
It's long.

2285
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:00,890
That was so long.

2286
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,690
It's so long. Why is it so long?

2287
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:07,400
"I'm Dr. Romantic."

2288
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,530
("I'm Dr. Romantic.")

2289
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:17,740
"I'm Dr. Romantic 2."

2290
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,640
Who's number two?

2291
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:22,640
- Who's number 2?
- I'm number 3.

2292
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:24,980
If I'm a queen, who are you?

2293
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,040
I'm accompanying the queen
right now.

2294
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,650
All right.

2295
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:31,390
- "Accompanying"?
- We were right.

2296
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:34,060
Haha got the answer,
so he gets a prize badge.

2297
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,320
(Current Number of Prize Badges)

2298
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,190
(Team So Min, Team Suk Jin)

2299
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:40,060
As I promised,

2300
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:43,620
So Min can choose a gift.

2301
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:45,030
Really?

2302
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:47,860
You can choose the meaningful gifts
brought by your team members...

2303
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:50,640
or take a chance to win
a 100-inch TV...

2304
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,570
that's worth 8,000 dollars.

2305
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,040
Can I decide now?

2306
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,480
(Will she choose the heartfelt gifts
from her team members?)

2307
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:06,890
(Or will she be greedy
and go for the 100-inch TV?)

2308
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,930
(What is So Min's decision?)

2309
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:14,030
I'll try for the 8,000-dollar TV.

2310
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,730
- Think about it.
- So Min.

2311
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:19,030
- What are you doing?
- We have nice gifts.

2312
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:21,970
There's nothing here
worth 8,000 dollars.

2313
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,900
- I wouldn't hesitate.
- Why?

2314
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,610
You might get a dud.
That's possible.

2315
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:27,940
You'll get nothing.

2316
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,530
- Rather than getting those,
- Is a dud better?

2317
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:30,900
- I'd rather go for the TV.
- Go for it.

2318
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,350
That's your style. I agree with you.

2319
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:35,540
If I take this,
will you install it at my house?

2320
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:36,870
(She's cute.)

2321
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:38,240
(He's flustered.)

2322
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,360
You don't need to install anything.
You just leave it there.

2323
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,220
- You leave it.
- "Will you install it at my house?"

2324
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:43,990
- So Min, please choose.
- Gosh, So Min.

2325
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:45,080
I choose the TV.

2326
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:47,750
Then switch spots with Ji Hyo.

2327
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:48,790
Look towards it.

2328
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:50,490
She might finish it.

2329
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:52,530
I should have won!

2330
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:55,740
If she wins the 100-inch TV,

2331
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,940
everybody on this team
gets a prize badge.

2332
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,160
- Everybody? All of us?
- Yes.

2333
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,110
If she wins the TV,
you all get a prize badge.

2334
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:02,700
I have a question.

2335
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,370
What if both are duds?

2336
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:06,650
- Jong Kook, can you check then?
- Okay.

2337
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:08,240
You know what?

2338
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:12,350
If I were you,
I would have done the same.

2339
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:14,060
All right.

2340
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,890
- Good.
- Jong Kook checked.

2341
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:19,230
If I win the TV and cash it in...

2342
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,790
(She's here to make a deal.)

2343
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,600
She's trying to make a deal with me.

2344
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,530
I'll give you 5,000 dollars.

2345
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:26,900
5,000 for you, and 3,000 for me.

2346
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,160
Go back immediately.

2347
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,330
Everybody, let's vote.

2348
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:31,770
Line up on either side.

2349
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:32,830
Do I get something?

2350
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:35,900
If I win the gift card,

2351
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,810
- I will...
- Will you give us some?

2352
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,240
It's 8,000 dollars, right?
I'll share 3,000 dollars.

2353
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,410
Through a lottery.
That's if I win.

2354
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:44,150
Please line up on either side.

2355
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:45,350
I'm sure it's this one.

2356
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:47,280
It's difficult when it's 3 on 3.

2357
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,580
(She thinks hard.)

2358
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:50,650
I...

2359
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:52,860
You're giving us 3,000 dollars.

2360
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:53,930
(Contemplating)

2361
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:57,990
will go with my team's choice
and pick number one.

2362
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:00,690
- Okay.
- They're too blue.

2363
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,190
- So Min chose...
- Is she stupid?

2364
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,270
number one.

2365
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:05,700
I wish you luck.

2366
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:09,070
- I think it's this side.
- Let me have some of it.

2367
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:11,480
- Is this her final decision?
- This is her final decision.

2368
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,500
One...

2369
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,820
What will happen to the 100-inch TV?

2370
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:15,870
(Instead of choosing
the members' gifts,)

2371
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:16,910
One,

2372
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:18,150
(she chose the TV.)

2373
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,240
two,

2374
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,580
(What's the result?)

2375
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,580
three.

2376
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:25,120
- What's that?
- Hey!

2377
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:28,120
(Dud!)

2378
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,190
Three.

2379
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,430
- What's that?
- Hey!

2380
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:33,490
What was that? What's wrong with me?

2381
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:35,030
Did you not switch it around?

2382
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:36,660
Did you not switch it?

2383
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,740
- Did you not switch it?
- Jong Kook checked.

2384
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,740
- Really?
- Was it like this earlier too?

2385
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:43,400
And So Min,

2386
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,200
we're the unlucky ones.

2387
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,740
I was going to choose this side,
but they were all blue,

2388
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,370
so I went for my team.

2389
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:53,280
It's too early to give up
because you have to choose...

2390
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,780
- the useless gifts.
- Take Ronaldo!

2391
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,860
My billboard is pretty.

2392
01:21:56,860 --> 01:21:59,060
1, 2, 3.

2393
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,190
- Suk Jin.
- The navigation device.

2394
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:03,250
Use it when you go to the States.

2395
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,860
You should use it
when you go to the States.

2396
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:07,120
- This one.
- The navigation device.

2397
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,860
<i>Navigation of my life</i>

2398
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:11,860
I guess I'm unlucky this year.

2399
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:14,280
Actually,

2400
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,780
there was something...

2401
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,500
that Suk Jin and So Min didn't
know about today's race.

2402
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,780
(Something we didn't know?)

2403
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,820
(Before the shooting)

2404
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

2405
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,750
Is this a show in a show?

2406
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,620
- Se Chan, come over here.
- Hello.

2407
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:32,230
So Min isn't here.

2408
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:33,690
As you know,
two of the members aren't here.

2409
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:34,730
Right.

2410
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:36,360
Suk Jin isn't here too.

2411
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:38,970
- Hey, why would you say that?
- I'm sorry.

2412
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:40,860
- I didn't know.
- Right. Suk Jin isn't here.

2413
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,100
We didn't know.

2414
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,570
Today, we will have...

2415
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:47,160
Double Celebration Race
to celebrate...

2416
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,700
Suk Jin's birth
and So Min's book.

2417
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:49,780
(Double Celebration Race)

2418
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:52,400
But there's a secret
that the two captains don't know.

2419
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,720
There will be no 100-inch TV
to win in the first place.

2420
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,150
- I knew it.
- My gosh.

2421
01:22:58,150 --> 01:22:59,150
- I saw this coming.
- Really?

2422
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:00,150
There's no TV?

2423
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:02,080
All the choices are duds.

2424
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,120
But if the captains
press their luck too hard,

2425
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,950
whether they win games or not,
they won't get any prizes today.

2426
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,430
That's good.

2427
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:12,470
Actually, they both are greedy.

2428
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:13,470
That's true.

2429
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:15,970
If they don't choose
the gifts we prepared...

2430
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:17,860
They will get nothing.

2431
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,860
(If they don't choose the gifts from
the members, they will get nothing.)

2432
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,240
(And So Min doesn't know
anything about it.)

2433
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,070
(I want TV worth 8,000 dollars.)

2434
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:28,680
(And the crew members switched
the prizes accordingly.)

2435
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,990
(Jong Kook was in on it
with the crew too.)

2436
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:35,780
We kept switching the places
behind the curtains.

2437
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:38,120
Jeong Mi kept going
back and forth there.

2438
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,320
Did you plan the whole thing?

2439
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,060
So Min and Suk Jin were
the captains of today's race.

2440
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:44,660
If they pressed their luck too hard,

2441
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:47,860
their team members wouldn't
get any prizes.

2442
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:49,970
And the members knew about it.

2443
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:50,970
What?

2444
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:53,240
Why did you not tell me about it?

2445
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,900
We kept telling you to pick this.

2446
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,780
I told you to pick this.

2447
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:58,680
- I said that too.
- Right.

2448
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,700
I...

2449
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,650
You were blinded by 8,000 dollars.

2450
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,220
I knew it when I saw her eyes.

2451
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,910
She wouldn't listen to me anyway.

2452
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,280
She seemed so greedy.

2453
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,110
She would never listen to us.
We should've given up sooner.

2454
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,360
Her eyes were full of greed.

2455
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,430
You should've told...
What about you?

2456
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:14,620
If you were me, you would've
made the same choice.

2457
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,860
I would've been worse.

2458
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:19,270
I'm so resentful
that I didn't get to open it.

2459
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:21,660
Guys, I'm so sorry.

2460
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:23,860
I'll be a nice person.

2461
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:26,660
Let me announce the result
of today's race.

2462
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,640
Those who didn't
win a single badge...

2463
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,610
are Suk Jin, Jong Kook,
and Kwang Soo.

2464
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,650
I didn't win a single badge.

2465
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:34,350
They didn't lose the game,
but they didn't get a badge.

2466
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:35,780
Can you let one of us
off the hook?

2467
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:37,690
- I'll do that.
- Since it's my birthday.

2468
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:38,890
- Let's make it 2 people.
- 2 people.

2469
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:39,890
Okay.

2470
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,410
The one who picks So Min's name
will be excluded.

2471
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:44,430
All right.

2472
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:46,230
Open it as I count to three.

2473
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:47,450
(Who's the lucky one
to get excluded?)

2474
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:49,650
(Kwang Soo and Suk Jin
will get the penalty.)

2475
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:51,160
- My gosh.
- I picked it.

2476
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,620
Gosh, Jong Kook picked her name.

2477
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,400
- I got excluded.
- You picked it.

2478
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,770
- My gosh.
- You're so lucky.

2479
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:56,770
I didn't expect this.

2480
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:59,740
You just got me a cake
to celebrate my birthday.

2481
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:02,370
(He got a birthday cake
and the penalty.)

2482
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,440
Let's do this.

2483
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:06,980
1, 2, and 3.

2484
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,040
My goodness.

2485
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,820
(A salute to celebrate his birthday)

2486
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,520
It's so red.

2487
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,450
It's red today.

2488
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:17,020
Kwang Soo got it just right.

2489
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:18,780
Gosh, it looks so good.

2490
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,580
You look cute.

2491
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,950
It's so cute.

2492
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:24,790
(Crowded and alienated)

2493
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:27,030
Say something to Suk Jin.

2494
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:28,690
Suk Jin doesn't look funny.

2495
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:29,740
(Suk Jin doesn't look funny.)

2496
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:30,900
(Funny and not funny)

2497
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,140
Bye, Suk Jin.

2498
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,640
My gosh.

2499
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,610
Things are not going well in 2020.

2500
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,370
(Good things will come
your way, Suk Jin.)

2501
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:40,280
- You have no luck.
- I'm so unlucky.

2502
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:43,040
- You don't look funny.
- It's not funny at all.

2503
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,650
(Contestants of
Running Man Dance Challenge)

2504
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:47,150
(Creaking dance, Kang Han Na)

2505
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,150
(A humorous dancer, Heo Kyeong Hwan)

2506
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:52,250
(The ambiance suddenly turns cold.)

2507
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,450
(The clock is ticking differently
in their phones.)

2508
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:57,570
(They should feed, lodge, and clothe
themselves in the circle of time.)

2509
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:58,900
(Time is fair.)

2510
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,660
(Time is unfair.)

2511
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:03,030
(The same events repeat
for everyone.)

2512
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:04,360
(Bad timing)

2513
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,270
(The locked door of time)

2514
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:08,900
(If you want to survive,)

2515
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,480
(find the room of time
and steal time.)

2516
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,720
(Success and failure will be
decided only in 10 minutes.)

2517
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,740
(Join hands with someone
you can trust.)

2518
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,650
(However...)

2519
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:21,490
(There are time controllers
in yellow who are watching you.)

2520
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,020
Is it over?

2521
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:25,750
(Who's the one to get away
from the time circle?)

2522
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,430
(Running Countdown)
