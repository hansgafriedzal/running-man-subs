1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,390
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,450
- Suk Jin finally...
- That's right.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,770
- started his YouTube channel.
- I did.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,770
- YouTube.
- "Ji Suk Jin World".

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,030
<i>"Ji Suk Jin World"</i>

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,600
How did you know that?
Thank you so much.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,770
You asked us
to mention it in the show.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,580
- Don't say that. Stay quiet.
- "Ji Suk Jin World"

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,350
I was originally going to start
a talk show,

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,100
- but...
- Actually,

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,010
Suk Jin wants
to make it a talk show,

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,510
- but I'm worried about it.
- I see.

13
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,120
You're not a good talker.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,790
(Straightforward)

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,620
(He's known as a poor talker.)

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,150
He just rambles on.

17
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,980
My nickname is Jee Talk.

18
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,720
I can't believe this.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
Hey!

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,330
- You're Jee Talk.
- This is crazy.

21
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,370
You always talk about yourself.

22
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,330
He's funny when he's a guest.

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,790
- I know.
- That's not true.

24
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,900
I shot the first video,
and it was really fun.

25
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,710
- Was it fun?
- Because I talk about myself.

26
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,800
Suk Jin, I watch your video
when I can't fall asleep at night.

27
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,510
(It helps eliminate insomnia.)

28
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,510
- I just sleep listening to it.
- It puts me to sleep.

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,620
You should sleep with the video on.

30
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,440
- That's right.
- It works.

31
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,550
- It's really funny.
- A lot of people recently...

32
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,320
started their own channels. Suk Jin
started "Ji Suk Jin World."

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,790
Jung Jun Ha started
"Ox Head Rice Soup."

34
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,520
I heard you came up with that name.

35
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,820
- Right. I did.
- For Jun Ha?

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,630
- I joked that it was the best name.
- It's a really strange name.

37
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,630
- What?
- "Ox Head Rice Soup".

38
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,490
It became the talk of the town
because it's strange.

39
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,160
- Really?
- Sure.

40
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,600
- It's somewhat addictive.
- I know.

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,380
Yours sounds a little lame.
It just sounds like a pun.

42
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,880
- It's a pun.
- Right.

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
Don't you think so?

44
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,380
- Hang on.
- He sounds upset.

45
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,820
Are you hurt?
Why do you sound like that?

46
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,520
- Why are you so huffy?
- Anyway,

47
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,120
I promise that I won't get
any help from you guys.

48
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,990
- Suk Jin.
- I'm serious.

49
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,910
- Can I give you some advice?
- What?

50
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,660
They say singers live
lives that are like their songs.

51
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,320
- That's true.
- And so do the TV shows.

52
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,020
So "Ji Suk Jin World" might
end up as your own world.

53
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,430
- That's right.
- Oh no.

54
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,690
- Seriously.
- What should we do?

55
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,770
Suk Jin, you seem
very disappointed.

56
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,210
- I'm not disappointed. I'm furious.
- What?

57
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,380
(Jee Talk explodes with anger.)

58
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,800
- What?
- Suk Jin.

59
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,510
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

60
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,070
What a mean thing to say.

61
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,520
- I'm sorry.
- Suk Jin.

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,650
I'm so sorry.

63
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,150
- That's just mean.
- I apologize.

64
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,250
I was about to curse at you.

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,730
But I held it back
so you wouldn't cry.

66
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,200
Actually, I find So Min's book
more interesting than your channel.

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,250
I see. Is it fun?

68
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,460
- It's fun, isn't it?
- I just can't stop reading it.

69
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,020
The reason I can't
stop reading it is...

70
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,530
because I don't understand
what it means.

71
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,030
So I have to keep reading it.

72
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,710
I just don't get it.

73
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,210
You just have no literary sense.

74
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,430
I have no idea what this means.

75
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,500
Read it for us.

76
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,340
"It was weaker than I thought."

77
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,210
"It was softer than steamed eggs."

78
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,150
"The earthen pot
hasn't gone cold yet."

79
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,450
- What?
- "It wasn't thick."

80
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,450
This is okay.

81
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,520
"The spoon touched
my heart immediately."

82
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
- What does that mean?
- The title is "Again."

83
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,930
It's "Again." It means my heart...

84
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,280
- My mind is...
- Is this a publication party?

85
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Ms. Jeon.

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,900
- We're doing this right.
- Ms. Jeon.

87
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,200
- She does sound like a writer.
- Is this a publication party?

88
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,400
"Again" is about
before you fall in love again.

89
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,870
When your love ended,
you thought you'd be very stiff.

90
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,500
But you were still weak
and even softer than steamed eggs.

91
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,610
So it's still easy for you
to have someone in your heart.

92
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,080
- Then...
- All right then.

93
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,900
Then you should publish
a commentary on this book too.

94
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,620
Like the key.

95
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,310
We would need a commentary.

96
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,710
- Like a director's cut.
- Exactly.

97
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,150
What is this?

98
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,710
There's a bookmark.

99
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,120
- It's a bookmark.
- You can use this.

100
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,180
- What's this?
- It's a bookmark.

101
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,230
A bookmark.

102
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,620
You should keep this in your wallet.

103
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,730
Me?

104
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,900
- You can keep it in your wallet.
- Okay.

105
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,120
Se Chan said it's fun.

106
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,900
Don't ask that.

107
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,210
Before we start the race,
we will have two guests today.

108
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,580
- Are we having guests today?
- Please come on in.

109
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,980
Who are they?

110
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,180
(Who are today's guests?)

111
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,370
- Hello.
- Is she Han Na?

112
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,450
- Han Na.
- Is it Han Na?

113
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,450
- Han Na.
- It's Han Na.

114
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,450
Han Na is here.

115
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,620
Han Na, you should be here
with us during the opening.

116
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,210
- Han Na is always...
- You don't need to wait.

117
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,080
- I know.
- You should start with us.

118
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,150
- Han Na.
- Happy New Year.

119
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,620
You're wearing a formal suit.

120
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,360
- A formal suit?
- Long time no see.

121
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,400
- Han Na.
- Yes?

122
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,930
You have a new stylist now.

123
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,620
- You look pretty.
- I like your clothes.

124
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm wearing something for the fall.

125
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,030
- It's pretty.
- Do you like it?

126
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,240
- I can't believe this.
- Thank you for coming the long way.

127
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,610
You should welcome me.

128
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,770
His clothes are hilarious.

129
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,240
Kyung-hwan has changed
his style a lot.

130
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,900
- He looks different.
- I know.

131
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,780
Gosh, Kyung-hwan.

132
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,440
- What happened?
- What happened to you?

133
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,510
- What happened?
- I'll bite all you guys.

134
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,990
I guess...

135
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,290
about two of us will be...

136
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,920
let go this spring.

137
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,450
(He feels threatened
by their frequent appearance.)

138
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,250
There will be a reorganization
taking place this spring.

139
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,430
It's good
that Suk Jin brought it up.

140
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,430
- Sure.
- I'm very grateful.

141
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,500
(Good self-assessment)

142
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,300
What are you talking about?

143
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,540
Then the average age of the members
will be lowered.

144
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,800
That's right. Anyway...

145
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,440
Thank you.

146
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,550
we should think about...

147
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,310
- Han Na's frequent appearances.
- I see.

148
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,140
And Kyung-hwan is here too.

149
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,510
- All right.
- Why do you think...

150
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,360
I started my YouTube channel?

151
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,090
- Is it his big picture?
- Sure.

152
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,790
- He's so cool.
- I know.

153
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,160
- He has a big picture.
- He's so mature.

154
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,660
He's really mature.

155
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,250
- I guess...
- He's the oldest one here.

156
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,300
there wasn't a plan,
but they might think about it.

157
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,490
(A commission on Suk Jin's
retirement has been established.)

158
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,260
- Exactly.
- Aren't I right?

159
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,970
- It wasn't a plan.
- The directors will start to move.

160
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,000
"Is he that cool? Then we should
go forward with the plan."

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,780
They started
to write down something.

162
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,050
"Suk Jin said okay."

163
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,510
It's an early retirement.

164
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,880
Today...

165
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,310
- Please pay attention to guests.
- Kyung-hwan is here.

166
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,990
- These days...
- Kyung-hwan, relax.

167
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,800
You're throwing out
your chest too much.

168
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,550
- Why is he throwing out his chest?
- Just relax.

169
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,300
Why are you so nervous?

170
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,730
- I have to do something.
- But...

171
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,840
- I should at least show my chest.
- About Kyung-hwan.

172
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,170
I'm very happy to see
Kyung-hwan on our show.

173
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,680
But he's never been
much of a performer.

174
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,910
Han Na is always good.

175
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,800
- She shows a lot of funny things.
- She's funny.

176
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,280
But Kyung-hwan is...

177
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,620
- I know that.
- Kyung-hwan is different.

178
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,220
I guess the directors
are quite tenacious.

179
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,310
- But I think...
- They don't give up.

180
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,660
- They wait until it works.
- Until he shows something.

181
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,430
Actually, a few days ago,
I met a kid on the street.

182
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,230
The kid called me
"the guy from Running Man."

183
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,030
- He watched you on TV.
- I appeared a lot.

184
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,260
But there are a lot
of bad comments about me.

185
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,530
Kyung-hwan, what do you mean?

186
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,340
"I'm Kyung-hwan's fan,"

187
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,300
"but I don't want to see him
on Running Man."

188
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,110
(I like Kyung-hwan, but I don't
want to see him in Running Man.)

189
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,500
It's positive and negative
at the same time.

190
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,200
"Did you watch Running Man?
Kyung-hwan is unbelievable."

191
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,500
- You're unbelievable.
- "He was not funny in the show."

192
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,010
People say stuff like that.

193
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,050
That's quite unique though.

194
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,380
You're here a lot
as a guest who's not funny.

195
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,590
When I was here last time,

196
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,590
I got my part cut
during the opening.

197
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,360
And I got water splashed
over me at the end of the show.

198
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,930
- It just doesn't seem right.
- It doesn't seem right.

199
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,230
You're saying
it's somewhat unbalanced.

200
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,030
It's just unbalanced.
That doesn't seem right.

201
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,870
So I want to keep things
balanced today.

202
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,630
Please pay a lot
of attention to me today.

203
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,130
- I'll try my best.
- All right.

204
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,610
I bet Chul Min likes you.

205
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,800
He keeps calling you.

206
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,500
I got a wedding invitation
from him as soon as I got here.

207
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,370
I get 200 dollars
for doing the show.

208
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,980
But I have to give him
a monetary gift of 100 dollars.

209
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,420
I'm here to make 100 dollars today.

210
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,790
- Hey.
- It's only 200 dollars.

211
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,590
You should think about
the next show Chul Min will work on.

212
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,790
You should worry about yourself.

213
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,750
Things aren't going well now.

214
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,450
- You should be prepared.
- You're being funny today.

215
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,030
- You're good.
- You're on a roll today.

216
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,360
- It's the reorganization season.
- Kyung-hwan is funny...

217
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,390
- when he doesn't try hard.
- He's funny.

218
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,970
- You're good.
- You're funny.

219
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,870
- You've been here a lot.
- That's right.

220
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,240
So you don't have to try so hard.

221
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,430
If you keep farting,
you might end up pooping.

222
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,110
- I don't like that.
- I'll poop.

223
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,300
- Don't say that.
- You can't poop here.

224
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,870
- Okay.
- Be careful.

225
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,920
The crew members are tenacious.

226
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,420
They didn't want to give up.

227
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,590
He's the guest we don't give up on.

228
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,120
And there's good news...

229
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,860
about Han Na.

230
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,680
- She's hosting a radio show now.
- Right.

231
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,160
She recently posted a video...

232
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,390
with ZICO.

233
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,170
Se Chan told me about it.
"Did you watch it?"

234
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,100
"Han Na danced with ZICO."

235
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
"I watched the video by chance."

236
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,970
"She's a terrible dancer."

237
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,930
(Se Chan said
she's a terrible dancer.)

238
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,870
(What was her dance like?)

239
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,410
(Squeaking)

240
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,740
(No groove)

241
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,720
(No composure)

242
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,940
- What?
- That's because Han Na...

243
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,990
danced right after Hwasa
and other good dancers.

244
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,310
- That's right. I watched it too.
- She was right after them.

245
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,120
I did it well. It's really hard.

246
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,310
Han Na.

247
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,730
- But you were a dance major.
- Right.

248
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,800
But it's different
from the dance moves of today.

249
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,100
I also thought she didn't
have the vibe.

250
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,560
She should have this feeling.

251
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,160
Han Na, why don't you show it to us?

252
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,940
- All right then.
- Please play...

253
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,310
- "Any Song" by ZICO.
- I can't dance alone.

254
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,370
- Suk Jin, dance with me.
- You tried it as well.

255
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,640
- Suk Jin did a good job.
- You two should dance together.

256
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,450
- It wasn't my official video.
- Just try it.

257
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,010
Suk Jin was like dancing
at his 60th birthday party.

258
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,990
- He was like this.
- Hey!

259
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,720
- Why would you say that?
- You will see.

260
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,650
- Let's give it a try.
- Dance with me.

261
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,690
Please play ZICO's song.

262
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,960
This is really hard.

263
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,020
- Han Na changes her face.
- Touch your nose, Suk Jin.

264
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,890
It's a performance.

265
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,260
I can't believe I'm watching this.

266
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,070
This is amazing.

267
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,660
- They're doing it.
- It's started.

268
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,760
(Before they start, please watch
ZICO and Hwasa's dance first.)

269
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,480
This is...

270
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,220
(Squeaking)

271
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,220
- What's that?
- That's not how you do it.

272
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,220
(That's not how you do it.)

273
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,880
Look at him.

274
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,230
Why is he being like this?

275
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,250
(He's acting cute
all of a sudden.)

276
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,470
It's not right. He almost hit her.

277
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,990
Look at Suk Jin.

278
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,970
It's a mess.

279
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,740
This is terrible.

280
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,870
It's so funny.

281
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,500
Isn't this right?

282
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
(Running)

283
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,770
It's just a random dance from him.

284
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,580
(She suddenly turns the wheel.)

285
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,990
It's so strange.

286
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,620
Something's not right.

287
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,090
Like I always say,

288
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,600
Han Na and Suk Jin are
a good duo.

289
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,150
- That's true.
- I agree.

290
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,600
All right then. Kyung-hwan,
dance in your own style.

291
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,940
- Me?
- He doesn't dance well.

292
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,240
"I'm dancing." Something like this.

293
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,700
- Can you do that?
- But...

294
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,130
I need someone to dance with me.

295
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,210
We have Ji Hyo.

296
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,210
(Ji Hyo is recommended.)

297
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,810
Ji Hyo just asked me whispering,
"What song this is?"

298
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,870
(She just asked me
what song this is.)

299
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,490
The song topped
all the music charts.

300
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,320
But she never heard it before.

301
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,620
Gosh, she's so...

302
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,380
She lives in a cave.

303
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,520
- Ji Hyo is so...
- She's like Robinson Crusoe.

304
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,730
That sounds just like Ji Hyo.
Ji Hyo.

305
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,420
You should do this
when the song starts.

306
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,920
Let's do this. Music, please.

307
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,130
The song suits your outfit.

308
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,570
You can just dance as you like.

309
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,740
Kyung-hwan and Ji Hyo.

310
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,570
(The song starts.)

311
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,770
- Ji Hyo seems to know something.
- There they go.

312
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,540
(Swaggering)

313
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,170
Kyung-hwan got it wrong,
but Ji Hyo is copying him.

314
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,380
(Ji Hyo copies what's wrong.)

315
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,120
- She's just copying him.
- This is nice.

316
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,330
(This is just a random dance.)

317
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,920
These are different dance moves.

318
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,060
- Ji Hyo doesn't know anything.
- Isn't this right?

319
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,470
She's never seen it before.

320
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,730
Ji Hyo doesn't know anything.

321
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,660
She has no idea.

322
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,660
She's never heard it before.

323
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,130
(Kyung-hwan is going too far
with his dance.)

324
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,310
What's that?

325
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,530
What's that?

326
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,500
Don't come near me.

327
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,010
That was good. Well done.

328
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,620
(They are so funny.)

329
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,090
Kyung-hwan, you're so funny.

330
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,860
- It was amazing.
- She's got the vibes of the 40s.

331
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,460
That was very good.

332
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,780
This is Ji Hyo's new character.

333
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,200
Ji Hyo has found her new character.

334
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,700
- This is who she is.
- Right.

335
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,200
She doesn't know
what's going on in the world.

336
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,790
She's like a frozen woman
who's back after a long time.

337
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,940
We're going to start the race now.

338
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,970
We were going to shoot this show
in Europe in February,

339
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,210
so we already finished
making an on-the-spot survey.

340
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,530
But we decided not to go...

341
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,500
- because of the current situation.
- I see.

342
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,980
So we will have an Indoor Special
in this building for the time being.

343
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,410
- Good.
- It's hard...

344
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,740
to shoot a show with a lot of people
in the open air now.

345
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,220
So before the race,

346
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,750
I'll hand out some phones first.

347
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,860
Phones?

348
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,120
- They have numbers on them.
- They have numbers.

349
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,160
- What's that?
- We should pick a good number.

350
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,240
I want you to take turns
and pick a phone.

351
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,260
Can I just pick one?

352
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,100
- I want number 3.
- I'll pick number 4.

353
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,740
- Number 3.
- I'll go with number 2.

354
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,870
You're not supposed to see
what's on the phone yet.

355
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,310
They all have different things.

356
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,480
Now you can check
the phone you chose.

357
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,540
Okay.

358
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,910
This is important.

359
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,480
What should we do?

360
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,540
What? Time?

361
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,510
(Yang Se Chan)

362
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,720
- What is...
- What is this?

363
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,120
It shows a time.

364
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,380
You're not supposed
to talk about it.

365
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,250
(So Min's stopwatch, 30 minutes)

366
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,230
(Jae Suk's stopwatch,
2 hours and 10 minutes)

367
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,120
(Kyung-hwan's stopwatch,
3 hours and 10 minutes)

368
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,260
(Se Chan's stopwatch, 50 minutes)

369
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,570
Please push the start button
all at the same time now.

370
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,900
- It's running down.
- I pressed it.

371
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,480
How much time do you have?

372
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,770
It's running down.

373
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,400
I guess some of you
don't have much time.

374
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,240
Please hurry.

375
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,740
You're given a random time
on your phone.

376
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,910
- Time is ticking.
- The second you run out of time,

377
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,910
- you'll be eliminated.
- What?

378
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,020
You will get eliminate
when the time runs out.

379
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,650
(Eliminated?)

380
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,190
- It's too soon.
- Then...

381
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,290
I don't have much time left.

382
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,700
But each of you has
your special circles.

383
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,490
While you stay in the circle,
the countdown is paused.

384
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,130
- I see.
- It sounds fun already.

385
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,570
- I should stay in the circle.
- Let me tell you where they are.

386
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,840
They are in the studio
on the second floor.

387
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,480
And your time is ticking even now.

388
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,170
You should hurry
and find your circles now.

389
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,640
- It's on the second floor.
- We have to hurry.

390
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,980
- Let's go to the 2nd floor.
- The 2nd floor?

391
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,220
We have to go to the second floor.

392
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,510
The second floor?

393
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,880
We have to hurry.

394
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,950
(Kwang Soo is going up the stairs.)

395
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,620
I can't believe this.

396
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,010
It's coming down
from the fifth floor.

397
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,150
This is faster.

398
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,620
Over there.

399
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,920
Circle? What circle?

400
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Where is it? I don't have time.

401
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,230
(Where on earth is the circle?)

402
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,490
Is it here?

403
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,530
(He finally finds the studio.)

404
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,570
This is it.

405
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,660
Is it here?

406
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,870
(As he put his foot on the circle,)

407
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,210
(it turns green.)

408
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,270
Okay.

409
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,080
I don't have much time left.

410
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,980
Is this the circle?

411
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,140
Jong Kook, you have to hurry.

412
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,240
It stops once you get on here.

413
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Step on it and pause the stopwatch.

414
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,380
This is it.

415
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,640
Move over.

416
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,410
(The other members
rush to the studio too.)

417
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,010
- What?
- Hey.

418
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,420
You can pick any circle you want.

419
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,690
- What do I do?
- Gosh.

420
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,360
It's done. I lost too much time.

421
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
- Me too.
- Me too.

422
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,890
- I'm doomed.
- It's so close.

423
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,290
If I get eliminated, can I go home?

424
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,370
- Can we?
- I guess we can go home.

425
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,890
Let me tell you something.

426
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,070
This is an individual game,

427
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,130
Indoor Special Part 1,
Running Countdown.

428
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,630
- Cool.
- Okay.

429
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,480
- This is an individual game.
- I like it.

430
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,770
You should stick to the timetable
that you're given today.

431
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,320
The last one to survive...

432
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,370
after the Name Tag Elimination race
will be the winner...

433
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,140
- and get a prize.
- There's the Name Tag Elimination.

434
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,750
The members who are eliminated
during the mission...

435
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,720
will be the judges here.

436
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,090
You will be the judges
in the yellow costumes here.

437
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,120
- I see.
- It will be humiliating.

438
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,830
You will help the crew members
with the shooting.

439
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,990
- We can't go home.
- We're not going home.

440
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,240
- It will be fun to be a judge.
- No.

441
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,890
- It sounds like fun.
- It must be hard.

442
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,530
Judges will just watch the game.

443
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,840
- I might be on TV longer that way.
- That might be true.

444
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,740
(He'd become a judge
to be on TV for a longer time.)

445
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,270
- Just keep trying hard.
- Okay.

446
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,670
- I'm just saying that.
- Don't give up too soon.

447
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,140
While you sit
in the circle like that,

448
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,950
the countdown is paused.

449
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,410
- Okay.
- Once you leave the circle,

450
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,510
the time will run down again.

451
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,720
That's amazing.

452
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,380
The time will keep running even when
you eat or go to the restroom...

453
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,730
- once you leave the circle.
- Really?

454
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,700
Do I have to stay in the circle
the whole day then?

455
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,370
I should've gone
to the restroom sooner.

456
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,630
You can move around.
It will just take some of your time.

457
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,990
- I'm in trouble.
- Some of us...

458
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,840
might have very little time left.

459
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,400
Right.

460
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,630
How much would it be?

461
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:03,140
He doesn't have
much time left for real.

462
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
This is too harsh.

463
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,090
Let's not do this to him.

464
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,880
Can I give my time to Suk Jin?

465
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,060
- This is sad.
- Please.

466
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,320
Hang on.

467
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,230
Is Ji Suk Jin World
where he ends up?

468
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,020
Suk Jin.

469
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,100
Thank you.

470
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,890
You should get out of the circle
and complete your mission...

471
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,390
while the time runs down.

472
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,130
The team
who completes the mission...

473
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,210
will get a chance
to win more time...

474
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,810
by investing their time
to spin the roulette.

475
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,870
Can we do that?

476
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,000
- We play games to get more time.
- We need to do that.

477
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,910
Or you will get a chance
to find out how much time...

478
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,740
a person you pick has left.

479
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,990
It's an individual game.

480
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,350
You can win twice as much time
as your investment.

481
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,510
"Twice as much"?

482
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,780
You can steal time from others
as much as you invested.

483
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,960
- Gosh.
- That's good.

484
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,390
You can also give time to others
as much as you invested.

485
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,650
There's also a dud.

486
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,230
You can steal from who's
in first place plus 20 minutes.

487
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,600
These are the five sections.

488
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,790
After you change
into your team uniform,

489
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,470
we will start the race.

490
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,110
Do we get timed
when we get changed?

491
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes, it will be counted.

492
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,770
- Come on.
- Seriously?

493
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,640
You're being strict.

494
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,350
Then I'll get changed here.

495
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,850
- Let's stay here.
- I'll get changed here.

496
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,640
Your team uniforms are set
in the waiting room.

497
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
I should hurry.

498
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,090
Jae Suk is going.
Can you bring mine?

499
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,820
- Jae Suk.
- No.

500
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,620
- Bring mine.
- Bring mine too.

501
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,800
- We'll lose time if we go.
- I don't have much time.

502
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,960
- I really don't have much time.
- Me neither.

503
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,770
I think I'm okay.

504
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,370
- He must have a lot of time.
- I know.

505
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,570
I'll tell my stylist to come.

506
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,960
I'll call someone too.

507
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,430
- I'll ask someone to bring it.
- Could you ask for mine too?

508
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,900
Can you bring my clothes?

509
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,670
I don't even have my phone.
I didn't bring it.

510
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,170
- Goodness.
- Ji Hyo, do you have...

511
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,320
access to the Internet
on your phone?

512
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
- On this phone?
- Yes.

513
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,150
- Yes, I do.
- You're completely disconnected.

514
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,290
That's not true.

515
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,590
(In the waiting room)

516
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,450
Are you here for the clothes?
You can't.

517
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,920
- Why not?
- You can't.

518
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,770
Do you think I don't have a stylist?

519
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,500
- No.
- You can't do this.

520
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,040
I said no.

521
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,400
You can't take these for them.

522
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,970
How dare you?
Kyung-hwan, take it away.

523
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,610
You can't do this.

524
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,310
She's here.

525
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,080
- Push them hard towards me.
- Han Na.

526
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,440
Why isn't mine here yet?

527
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,210
Play fair and wait until we leave.

528
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,150
(What?)

529
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,530
(Jae Suk and Kyung-hwan take
Kwang Soo and Se Chan's clothes.)

530
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,500
Jae Suk, I don't have time.

531
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,560
These are Kwang Soo's.
Where are mine?

532
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,070
Where are my clothes?

533
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,220
Give them to me now. Goodness.

534
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,800
(Kyung-hwan steals
Se Chan's clothes.)

535
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,840
No, give them to me.

536
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,870
I really don't have much time. Look.

537
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,280
All right, go. Let's go.

538
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,470
(Jae Suk stole
Kwang Soo's clothes.)

539
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,850
(He plans to go far away.)

540
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,210
Wait, I'm using up my time.

541
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,210
(Kwang Soo is the only one
without his clothes.)

542
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,950
Where are my clothes? What?

543
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,150
- Give them to me.
- He stopped me...

544
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,360
from bringing them to you.

545
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,530
- Who?
- Jae Suk.

546
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,690
- What? Who?
- Jae Suk did.

547
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,420
- Jae Suk?
- It was Jae Suk.

548
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,500
Goodness.

549
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,960
(He gets playful again.)

550
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,270
What's wrong with Jae Suk?

551
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,340
That's the reason why Jae Suk is
on Running Man.

552
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,200
- He's such a trickster.
- Just to tease you.

553
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,850
I suppose Kwang Soo doesn't have
much time.

554
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,200
My clothes.

555
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,620
(He goes to find his clothes.)

556
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,670
Okay.

557
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,620
(Why is he coming back?)

558
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,150
Is he going to carry it?

559
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,620
What? It's Jae Suk's.

560
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,530
He's going to hide it.

561
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,420
It's dirty from the start.

562
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,890
What's wrong with Jae Suk?

563
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,160
(He goes to the 2nd floor after
hiding the clothes on the 1st.)

564
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,730
Where is he?

565
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,310
(Why is he in the elevator?)

566
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,010
(Were you looking for me?)

567
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,050
Let's die together.

568
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,850
Come on.

569
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,440
We don't have time.
Go and find them.

570
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,250
- Where are they?
- Go.

571
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,250
(He gets on the elevator.)

572
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,820
Kwang Soo has...

573
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,090
his clothes downstairs,

574
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,860
but he took the wrong elevator.

575
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,190
He should be going down,
but he went up instead.

576
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,770
Kwang Soo did?

577
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,620
It's getting worse.

578
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,890
Wait.

579
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,730
It's going up.

580
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,780
- Yes.
- They're going to the sixth floor.

581
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,780
Kwang Soo.

582
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,470
- He's so funny.
- Okay.

583
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,620
Why is he sitting here?

584
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,590
- You moved your seat.
- He moved his own seat.

585
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,440
Come back to your original spot.

586
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,560
Why did you do such a thing?

587
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,760
- That wasn't necessary.
- Wait.

588
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,260
You focus on the wrong things.

589
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,390
He loves Running Man, doesn't he?

590
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,390
Right.

591
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,420
I almost lost my mind
for the last two weeks.

592
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,390
I think he loves it.

593
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,040
Let's have a shoot every week.

594
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,310
He's a big fan.

595
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,510
He's one of those
who love Running Man.

596
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,340
It's inside out.

597
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,440
Hey!

598
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,350
(He gets playful again.)

599
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,170
It started.

600
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,210
Their fight is endless.

601
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,480
How will they survive
without Running Man?

602
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,410
They're on the show just to do that.

603
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,090
(Their precious reason why
they're on the show)

604
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,650
Do you see the look on his face?

605
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,560
(He's doing the same thing.)

606
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,620
Hey.

607
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,000
He might get an electric shock.

608
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,370
- It'd be funny if he passes out.
- I know.

609
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,840
- Why did he do that?
- Why did he do that?

610
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,970
I don't understand why he did that.

611
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,050
He's funny too. Why can't he
wait for Jae Suk to come back?

612
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,170
Darn it.

613
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,880
Why did he do that?

614
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,140
Why did he flip them?

615
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,020
It was to gain one more second.

616
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,880
- He ended up losing more time.
- Right.

617
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,180
He does a good job
of acting his part.

618
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,120
(After getting a break)

619
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,330
(Jae Suk gets playful again
for the third time.)

620
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,770
Seriously?

621
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,340
My goodness.

622
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,630
- It's deja vu.
- It's deja vu.

623
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,810
What is he doing?
He's doing it again.

624
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,470
- What's wrong with him?
- Why does he do that?

625
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,440
I don't understand why he put it
on top of the other.

626
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,140
Why did he do that?

627
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,640
Do the two of you have
a separate script?

628
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,790
- What's wrong today?
- We don't.

629
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,860
(It's the same story as last time.)

630
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,020
- He must have a lot of time.
- Right.

631
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,290
- He has free time.
- He does.

632
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,950
- He has additional time.
- That's why.

633
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,420
- Kwang Soo doesn't have much time.
- I don't think he does.

634
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,920
Isn't he already a judge?

635
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,030
- You can be a judge, Kwang Soo.
- You're wearing it backward.

636
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,570
(His top is on backward.)

637
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,370
It must say on the script.

638
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,270
"Kwang Soo wears his top backward."

639
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,610
(Do they get a separate script?)

640
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,870
"He makes a silly face
while panting."

641
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,550
(Everyone gets changed.)

642
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,910
(Current Time Status)

643
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,820
- Let's start the first mission.
- All right.

644
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
- We're off to a good start.
- We're finally starting.

645
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,590
You will play in 2 teams of 5.

646
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,220
Your first mission is
Finding Hidden Objects.

647
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,600
- Finding Hidden Objects?
- Hidden Objects.

648
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,870
Did they hide them in advance?

649
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,610
The leader of each team will look at
a picture with five hidden objects.

650
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,460
Find each object...

651
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,540
from the Running Man office
on the 16th floor...

652
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,580
and bring it back to succeed.

653
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,970
Bring five objects in a relay.
The first team to finish wins...

654
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,210
- Is it a relay?
- and gets to spin the roulette.

655
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,410
It's a relay.

656
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,140
- Today...
- The 16th floor is far from here.

657
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,710
- I know.
- Sixteenth floor?

658
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,790
It's quite far.

659
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,820
(Is that so?)

660
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,220
Discuss and divide into two teams.

661
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,290
Do we discuss it?

662
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,720
The two guests can pick
their team members.

663
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,000
That's right. Kyung-hwan.

664
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,120
I pick Se Chan.

665
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,190
(His first pick is Se Chan.)

666
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,370
He knows the building structure,
and he's sharp.

667
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,730
- I pick Jong Kook.
- Okay.

668
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,460
You made a good choice.

669
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,110
Kyung-hwan, pick Jae Suk.
He has a lot of time.

670
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,580
- Does he?
- He was relaxed before...

671
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,610
- because he has free time.
- That's why he went around.

672
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,850
Okay, I'll join you.

673
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,780
Okay, I'll join you.

674
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,080
So Min.

675
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,760
(He selects whomever he wants.)

676
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,120
I got it.

677
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,480
She doesn't have much time.

678
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,950
It was so that you can be together.

679
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,330
It was so that you can be together.

680
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,330
(She gets time with Se Chan.)

681
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,420
- He's setting it up.
- He is.

682
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,800
- You're thinking like the staff.
- Okay.

683
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,930
I should set them up.

684
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,600
(Team Han Na and Team Kyung-hwan)

685
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,840
Please sit with your team.

686
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,540
Come to where the team leader is.

687
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,870
- Go, Suk Jin.
- Did you change the seats?

688
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,440
We have to sit with our teams.

689
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,200
- We should split in half.
- Come here, Suk Jin.

690
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,870
Go slowly, Suk Jin.

691
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,020
(Time passes when they stand up.)

692
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,050
Hey.

693
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,620
(Jae Suk grabs Suk Jin's jacket.)

694
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,880
(Go slowly, Suk Jin.)

695
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,210
(The time ticks away helplessly.)

696
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,120
(Suk Jin kicks back but misses.)

697
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,360
- Suk Jin.
- Darn it.

698
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,420
- Suk Jin.
- Darn it.

699
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,420
Go.

700
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,920
- Go.
- Why you...

701
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,130
- Gosh.
- He lost 10 seconds.

702
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,810
That brat.

703
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,780
What did you say?
Do you mean a brat?

704
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,430
"That brat".

705
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,780
Please pick the first player.

706
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,120
When it starts,
come up and uncover it.

707
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,250
Find an object, say it out loud,
and go upstairs.

708
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,320
To the 16th floor?

709
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
You have to decide the order
in advance.

710
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,450
- Really?
- Yes.

711
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,290
- To avoid confusion, go this way.
- Okay.

712
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,420
- Let's do that.
- Otherwise, it's confusing.

713
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,060
- Go, Han Na.
- Let's start with Han Na.

714
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,030
Let's do that same.

715
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,620
- Go this way.
- Start with Se Chan.

716
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,300
- Okay.
- Since I have time, shall I start?

717
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,930
- Okay.
- How much time does Jae Suk have?

718
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,340
I know. He must have a lot of time.

719
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,400
Shall I go?

720
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,080
To distinguish the teams,
one of you will wear this.

721
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Han Na.

722
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,010
She's so fast.

723
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,580
- Han Na.
- You dropped one.

724
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,480
Why are you telling us to wear them?
Make the other team wear them.

725
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,590
Aren't these for us?

726
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,790
- She's nice.
- She is.

727
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,020
Han Na is nice.

728
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,860
Is it only for one team?

729
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,090
Yes.

730
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,600
This will be taken into account
during the reorganization.

731
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,800
This will be taken into account
during the reorganization.

732
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,570
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

733
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,840
Will Suk Jin run for anything
to win points?

734
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,430
Did you hear what Suk Jin said?

735
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,660
"Han Na, why did you take them?"

736
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,930
This will be counted.

737
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,200
- It's considered during evaluation.
- Of course.

738
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,110
The producers' behavior
is suspicious.

739
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,440
The producers' behavior
is suspicious.

740
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,370
Everyone is taking notes, Suk Jin.

741
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,050
Let's get started.

742
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

743
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,210
Get ready, set...

744
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:15,380
- Go.
- Do I go too?

745
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,860
- Isn't Jae Suk starting?
- We start from that side.

746
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,600
Goodness.

747
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,030
- I thought you were starting.
- What's this?

748
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,500
- Let us see it.
- What's this?

749
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,460
(Finding hidden objects
for Team Han Na)

750
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,470
Why is it this way?

751
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,810
(Se Chan also checks his picture.)

752
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,700
(Finding hidden objects
for Team Kyung-hwan)

753
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,670
Se Chan, sit down and look.
Let us look too.

754
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,090
Can you sit?

755
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,560
Should we find this?

756
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
(I don't have a clue.)

757
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,260
You only have to spot one.

758
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,650
(The viewers can join in too.)

759
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,030
(Looking closely...)

760
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,500
I see one. Can I spot it out?
A mouse!

761
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,840
(I see one. Can I spot it out?
A mouse!)

762
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,540
(Is there a mouse in this drawing?)

763
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,040
(A mouse)

764
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,310
Hold on.

765
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,750
Go!

766
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,750
A mouse!

767
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,140
Go!

768
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,050
- Hurry up and get one.
- Spot one for starters.

769
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,520
(Se Chan runs to the office
to find a mouse.)

770
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,750
Han Na, at least spot something.

771
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,750
A mouse...

772
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,650
(Every second counts.)

773
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,680
A mouse.

774
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Let's go.

775
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,260
(Se Chan's familiar with
the building layout.)

776
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,030
I don't have much time to spare.

777
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,420
Han Na, at least spot something.

778
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,960
Spot an object in there.

779
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,160
- A flower!
- Find the hidden object.

780
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,190
A flower!

781
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,630
A flower being there isn't odd.

782
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,160
No, this.

783
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,080
This. I see this. The pointer.

784
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,640
Okay, go.

785
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,350
- The pointer.
- Okay, go.

786
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,850
- Okay.
- Find one.

787
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,120
- Where are you going?
- Where are you off to?

788
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,250
(Where is she going?)

789
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,760
(Han Na urgently runs off.)

790
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,120
(Am I going in the wrong direction?)

791
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,210
You should go that way.

792
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,950
I don't know
the layout of the building.

793
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,060
- What's wrong with you?
- What about that pointer?

794
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,760
What about that pointer?

795
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,160
You have to find one
on the 16th floor.

796
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,300
- Sorry about that.
- You made her waste time.

797
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,540
Goodness.

798
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,630
(Han Na heads toward the elevator.)

799
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,840
Someone pressed the down button.

800
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,340
It's on the 16th floor, right?

801
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,170
It's my first time in this building.

802
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:19,210
I'm on the 2nd floor,
so I can't run upstairs.

803
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,880
Right? Right.

804
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,060
(She gets on the elevator
she waited for.)

805
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,680
(What?)

806
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Wait.

807
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,600
(She's lost for words.)

808
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,570
(There's no button
to the 16th floor.)

809
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,800
I have to go to the 16th floor,
so why isn't there a button?

810
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,370
(Her first trip to SBS isn't easy.)

811
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,510
What now?

812
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,010
(The elevator Han Na took
doesn't go up to the 16th floor.)

813
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,440
Sir, does the clock stop
during lunchtime?

814
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,670
Or will the time keep running?

815
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,750
Yes, it'll keep running.

816
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,120
Then we can just eat here.

817
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,940
You always...

818
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,910
address him as "sir"
with these types of challenges.

819
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,060
He might answer me more kindly.

820
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,590
It has become a habit.

821
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,380
Sirs, you're all doing great today.

822
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,380
(The Alchemist of Titles)

823
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,650
- Right?
- She won't know this.

824
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,800
Han Na would never know.

825
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,600
So it's here.

826
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,030
Can I take any one of these?

827
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,600
(Se Chan sees...)

828
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,370
(a mouse.)

829
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,340
Can't I just take this?

830
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,670
Is that it? Okay, that's simple.

831
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,280
Can it be this easy?

832
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,510
I must've found an easy one.

833
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,520
(He manages to save a lot of time.)

834
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,290
Where could Han Na be?
Wait, she hasn't come by.

835
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,320
Okay.

836
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
(Meanwhile, Han Na...)

837
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,860
Over there... Should I go there?

838
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,360
(She runs and runs
throughout the unfamiliar layout.)

839
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,460
Why won't this respond?

840
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,220
(The elevator won't respond to her.)

841
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,390
Hello?

842
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,960
What is this?

843
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,000
(The elevators at SBS
aren't easy for first-timers.)

844
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,200
What's going on? It didn't stop.
Wait, hold on.

845
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,130
Hold on.

846
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,130
No...

847
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,750
That elevator
must not stop on this floor.

848
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,820
It must travel straight
to the 16th floor from the 1st.

849
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,880
Gosh, it's going down again.

850
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,450
(Meanwhile, Se Chan returns.)

851
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,760
Okay, I'm good.

852
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,220
- He's here.
- Here's the mouse.

853
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,950
- It's a relay.
- Already?

854
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:12,060
It's a relay, so who's next?

855
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,960
All right, hurry up.

856
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
Spot it as fast as you can.

857
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,920
So we're spotting for others?

858
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,890
We're spotting objects
in the same drawing?

859
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
So Min, listen to me
while you look for the object.

860
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,540
Make a left right away
and take the stairs down.

861
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,040
(Se Chan explodes with charisma.)

862
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,280
Make a left right away
and take the stairs down.

863
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,670
Head to the main hall
and take the elevator on your right.

864
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,140
Take the elevator
up to the 16th floor.

865
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,250
(They all get butterflies
in their stomachs.)

866
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,320
That was cool.

867
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,640
- The one on the right?
- Yes.

868
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,760
- Which one?
- The right. Keep looking!

869
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,650
- The shortcut to love.
- That was manly.

870
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,150
Take the right elevator up.

871
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,120
Maybe he'll be waiting for her
at the top.

872
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,650
With a rose in his hand...

873
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,160
and flipping over a sketchbook.

874
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,390
I see one. It's a whistle.

875
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,730
(Meanwhile, she spots a whistle.)

876
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,370
(That is correct!)

877
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,460
- Go.
- A whistle?

878
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,470
Yes, a whistle.

879
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,780
Just know that you're
walking into an office.

880
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,850
Oh, dear. What now?

881
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:07,290
Take a left and go down the stairs.

882
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,850
(She recalls what Se Chan said.)

883
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,650
Yes, this goes up to the 22nd floor.

884
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,560
Sorry, guys.

885
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,560
(She gets on the elevator
that heads to the 16th floor.)

886
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,560
Did I use up about five minutes?

887
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,690
Oh, gosh.

888
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,370
(She's in a rush
due to the lack of time.)

889
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,890
I don't have a lot of time.
Please get on.

890
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,040
Go ahead.

891
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,540
Gosh.

892
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,730
(So Min)

893
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,510
I need to be on the 16th floor
as fast as possible.

894
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,630
If I don't, I'll die.

895
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,640
(She spreads false rumors.)

896
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,750
I don't have much time.

897
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,850
(While the urgent So Min
speaks nonsense...)

898
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,750
We need to win
in order to gain more time.

899
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,940
- Yes, the roulette.
- Right.

900
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,150
We need to win this.
Where on earth is Han Na?

901
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,530
I didn't see her
on my way back here either.

902
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,560
(I didn't see her
on my way back here either.)

903
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,060
Just know that.

904
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,360
- Did she go to the bathroom?
- She doesn't know how to get there.

905
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,460
Doesn't this look like
a commercial for an apartment?

906
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,570
Right.

907
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,370
It's her first time
in this Mok-dong building.

908
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,930
Right, she doesn't know
the layout of this building.

909
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,310
But then Ji Hyo mentioned
that she hosts a radio show.

910
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,670
Her radio show is for KBS,
so Ji Hyo apologized.

911
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,050
She is disconnected from the world.

912
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,050
(Disconnected from the world)

913
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,640
- Ji Hyo...
- Unbelievable.

914
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,910
She tries though. Do you know what
she was doing on her phone earlier?

915
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,210
She was listening to ZICO's song.

916
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,590
(She was listening to ZICO's song.)

917
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,220
- So...
- Still...

918
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,920
- She was listening to his song.
- I see...

919
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,620
- that she's trying.
- She does.

920
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,600
Ji Hyo, choose one or the other.

921
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,070
If you want to generate laughter,

922
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,040
keep staying disconnected
from the world.

923
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,070
(It's best to put up a wall.)

924
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,100
That's right.

925
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,540
I honestly didn't know.

926
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
You don't have to.
Not everyone has to anyway.

927
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,810
Which recent songs do you listen to?

928
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,510
Recent songs?

929
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,750
I know what it is.

930
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,120
- What is it?
- "Y" by Freestyle.

931
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,850
("Y" by Freestyle)

932
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,480
(The 2007 song
is a recent release for Ji Hyo.)

933
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Do you know the mini homepage?

934
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,050
- The mini homepage!
- Want some acorns?

935
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,210
The famous BGM on mini homepages?

936
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,090
That's what you listen to, right?

937
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,760
It's as if she was frozen in time.

938
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,120
"Y" by Freestyle.

939
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,360
(Suk Jin joins in on teasing her.)

940
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,760
I don't think you know the song.

941
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,220
Must one know it?

942
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,160
- Well...
- "Must one know it?"

943
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,930
- What's the point in knowing that?
- Then...

944
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,840
why would you tease her
for not knowing it?

945
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,130
Suk Jin, the producers
are making suspicious movements.

946
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,340
I glanced at them and there were
ticks next to his name.

947
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,440
- The number of ticks...
- Suk Jin.

948
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,370
They seem to be up to something.

949
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,550
(We hope that he can do better
on variety shows.)

950
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:22,090
Suk Jin will soon
open his own hotline.

951
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,360
Mr. Noh will make his move.

952
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
(The CEO of Suk Jin's agency
will make his move.)

953
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,760
"Mr. Noh, I need you here."

954
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
(Mr. Noh, I need you here.)

955
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,760
"Take a stroll around
the SBS Variety Department for me."

956
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,460
Run!

957
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,070
Run, Han Na.

958
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,500
- Hold on.
- I think it's Han Na.

959
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,730
- Han Na, hurry up!
- Han Na.

960
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,630
Put it there in that blue basket.

961
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,670
- What took you so long?
- Ji Hyo's already standing.

962
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,370
Han Na must sit down first.

963
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,900
(Ji Hyo is confused too.)

964
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,280
- Not you, Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo must be fast.

965
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,440
(I was talking to Han Na!)

966
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,940
- Not you, Ji Hyo.
- What are you doing?

967
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,320
- You shouldn't sit.
- Of course, I shouldn't sit.

968
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,710
Why would you sit?

969
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,590
Could Ji Hyo be funnier?

970
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,290
I love how she can play
the cavewoman.

971
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,860
- I'm jealous.
- A snake!

972
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,650
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo
finds one quickly.)

973
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,870
- What? A snake?
- A snake.

974
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,070
There's a snake on the 16th floor?

975
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,270
- A snake.
- Gosh, Ji Hyo.

976
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,130
Ji Hyo finally has a new identity.

977
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,630
It's been a while since you had one.

978
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,940
Where do I find a snake?

979
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,040
(Ji Hyo)

980
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,210
A whistle.

981
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,750
Whistle, come to me.

982
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:27,850
Do you know where it is?

983
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,940
(She asks the cameraman.)

984
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,920
(Found it!)

985
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,480
(She's found the whistle.)

986
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,290
I found the whistle.
Will someone else look for this?

987
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,250
Should I hide it?
Whatever. Let's go.

988
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,830
All I need to do is get back safely.

989
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,560
Is this it? Should I take this one?

990
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,540
So Min should be back by now.

991
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,500
- She should be back.
- She's taking a while.

992
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,440
Who would have a whistle?

993
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
A whistle would be hard to find
since it's small.

994
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,150
Are you worried about her, Se Chan?

995
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,980
Yes, of course. We need to win.

996
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,850
(Look at you.)

997
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,120
- She should hurry back.
- Stop forcing it.

998
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
(Jong Kook quietly
lets out his inner voice.)

999
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
You're forcing it.

1000
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,380
(They're forcing
the relationship on them.)

1001
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,690
They're forced to act.

1002
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,560
He's forcing them.

1003
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,130
- Force...
- You make my life worthwhile.

1004
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,290
Haha does tend to force things.

1005
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,060
It's why he makes
people uncomfortable.

1006
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,960
He ruins what should be a success.

1007
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,000
He makes people uncomfortable.

1008
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,370
Things work when he's not involved.

1009
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,460
I want to be a part of everything.

1010
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,170
Don't people around you...

1011
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,580
ask about her?

1012
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,940
I have an eight-year-old nephew.

1013
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,750
He doesn't normally talk to me.

1014
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,710
Anyway, on New Year's Day,

1015
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,350
he asked...

1016
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,020
who I like on Running Man.

1017
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,650
I asked what he meant...

1018
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,730
and he mentioned Ji Hyo and So Min.

1019
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,290
- What about me?
- What?

1020
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,690
(Butting into the innocent question
by an 8-year-old)

1021
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,600
(Uncle Muscle is who Uncle Se Chan
is scared of the most.)

1022
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,790
- You can't put your name in there.
- Hold on.

1023
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,560
That's not what
his nephew was asking.

1024
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,130
Why would you be a choice?

1025
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,730
Of course, I should be.

1026
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,900
He was asking about
the woman he liked.

1027
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,400
I see.

1028
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,040
I see you want to cross that line.

1029
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,650
(Jong Kook is mostly
obsessed with Se Chan.)

1030
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,150
- I'm obsessed with you.
- If you were included,

1031
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,520
- I would've chosen you.
- Right.

1032
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,940
So I asked who he thought
I looked better with.

1033
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,920
He said So Min
and it felt odd for some reason.

1034
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,690
(It felt odd.)

1035
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,850
- What did Se Hyeong say?
- My brother seriously asked me.

1036
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,560
- Asked you what?
- On New Year's Day,

1037
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,060
we enjoyed gamjatang
and soju together.

1038
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,670
After having half a bottle
and a few words later...

1039
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,000
(What do you think about So Min?)

1040
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,100
"What do you think about So Min?"

1041
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,270
I was like, "What?"

1042
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,630
"How do you feel about So Min?"

1043
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,480
I told him that
there was nothing going on,

1044
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,040
but it feels odd
to receive those questions.

1045
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,540
Your family is curious
about you two too.

1046
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,120
- It makes them curious.
- It does.

1047
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,920
(Without knowing
what goes through Se Chan's mind,)

1048
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,150
(So Min rushes in,
blowing the whistle.)

1049
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,520
- She's here.
- She's here.

1050
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,830
So Min, put the whistle in the box.

1051
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,690
- Put it in the box.
- And switch.

1052
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,920
Okay.

1053
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,770
- Kyung-hwan, hurry up.
- Find an object.

1054
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,630
While talking,

1055
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,270
I completely forgot
about Kyung-hwan.

1056
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,210
- Right.
- Join in the conversation.

1057
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,830
I can't find anything.

1058
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,630
Kyung-hwan isn't good at this.

1059
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,900
He's not observant.

1060
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,500
I already found a mouse
on the girl's foot,

1061
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,670
so there's probably nothing else
on the left side.

1062
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,710
- I can't find anything.
- Focus on the right side.

1063
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,080
It gets harder and harder.

1064
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,420
Look at the forest.

1065
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,150
Okay. Wait!

1066
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,250
A brush.

1067
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,850
Run!

1068
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,650
- A brush.
- Run!

1069
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,580
- There was a brush?
- There was a brush?

1070
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,250
A brush is an object
that appears often.

1071
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,170
(Kyung-hwan has plenty of time.)

1072
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,370
I host a radio show here.

1073
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,460
I'm very familiar with this place.

1074
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,960
Don't worry.

1075
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,830
So Min, while you were away,

1076
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,580
Se Chan told us what happened
on New Year's Day.

1077
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,850
- What did he say?
- His family keeps asking about you.

1078
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,670
I'll be honest.

1079
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,310
My mom wants your phone number.

1080
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,520
My mom wants your phone number.

1081
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,380
(Their nephew, brother, and mom
are brought up.)

1082
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,130
(Their families are even more
interested in their relationship.)

1083
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,020
Why? I'd love to talk to her though.

1084
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,350
Her mom loves Se Chan.

1085
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,060
I visited my parents
on New Year's Day,

1086
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,170
and Mom told me seriously...

1087
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,670
- that I should get married.
- Really?

1088
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,770
And she added...

1089
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,230
that she wants me to marry
someone in show business.

1090
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,870
I told you, right?

1091
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,310
She had never said that before,

1092
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,130
so I asked her why. And she said,

1093
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,940
"Give me Se Chan's phone number."

1094
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,440
Unbelievable.

1095
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,620
She said,
"I think I should talk to him."

1096
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,580
It might happen earlier...

1097
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,120
than we expect.

1098
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,690
But tell your mother
not to call him.

1099
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,980
Hey, instead,
tell Suk Jin to stay out of it.

1100
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,290
Instead,
tell Suk Jin to stay out of it.

1101
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,630
(Suk Jin is being nosy.)

1102
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,250
- Her mother should tell him.
- It's none of his business.

1103
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,690
"Suk Jin, please stay out of it."

1104
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,290
Also, you should never
play with someone's feelings.

1105
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,630
- Suk Jin!
- What?

1106
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,770
Will you be heartbroken...

1107
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,270
if So Min gets married?
Why are you doing this?

1108
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,810
(Is Suk Jin having a crisis?)

1109
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,480
Why do you keep...

1110
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,940
What is that supposed to mean?

1111
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,480
- Why are you doing this?
- "So Min!"

1112
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,120
"So Min!"

1113
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,150
(He might show up at her door.)

1114
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,440
(So Min, I have something
to tell you. Open the door.)

1115
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,310
Never play with someone's feelings.

1116
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,120
At first, I thought So Min
was too good for Se Chan...

1117
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,750
That's enough.

1118
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,190
(Suk Jin is interrupted.)

1119
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,290
- Wait.
- Hey!

1120
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,150
He hit himself.

1121
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,060
(He threw his jacket...)

1122
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,940
(at himself.)

1123
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,130
(His jacket crash-lands.)

1124
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,440
- What did you do?
- Are you okay?

1125
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,600
- I heard a loud noise.
- The light turned off.

1126
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,500
Suk Jin, what did you do?

1127
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,670
In the pocket...

1128
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,900
My phone was in the pocket.

1129
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,500
His phone was in the pocket.

1130
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,650
(Ji Hyo comes back
with a fake snake.)

1131
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,620
- She's here.
- Ji Hyo.

1132
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,250
- Hurry up.
- Gosh.

1133
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,380
- Hurry.
- Let's switch.

1134
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,380
(The snake is handed in,
and Kwang Soo starts playing.)

1135
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,880
Kwang Soo, look at the trees.

1136
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,790
(Two objects have already
been found in the trees.)

1137
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,000
A cap.

1138
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,420
A cap is what the pig is wearing.

1139
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,290
Are you sure it's not a ladle?

1140
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,790
A ruler!

1141
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,460
Okay!

1142
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,540
A ruler!

1143
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,400
Okay!

1144
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,600
(He has to find a ruler
in the Running Man office.)

1145
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,540
(As soon as someone leaves...)

1146
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,380
I might be thinking too far ahead,

1147
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,650
but let's say you two get married.

1148
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,810
Then Suk Jin will officiate
your wedding.

1149
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,310
We're not getting married.
How could I marry Se Chan?

1150
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,350
I hate people like So Min.

1151
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,560
(Out of nowhere)

1152
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,850
(He suddenly announces
that he hates So Min.)

1153
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,500
What's with him?

1154
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,790
(Why would you suddenly say
you hate So Min?)

1155
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,870
Suk Jin!

1156
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,600
Someone must have hurt him.

1157
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,370
I hate it when people
play with someone's feelings.

1158
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,900
I wanted to have bingsu with him,
but he turned me down.

1159
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,900
Don't push her away.

1160
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,150
Go along with her.

1161
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,770
- Why didn't you do that then?
- Right.

1162
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,850
(Ji Hyo used to
push someone away too.)

1163
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,750
Then you'd be on
"The Return of Superman" now.

1164
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,790
(If only she hadn't
pushed him away.)

1165
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:43,420
(No mention of another show
has had more impact than this.)

1166
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,900
Gosh, that was strong.

1167
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,960
No, we were different.

1168
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,630
Gary and I were different.

1169
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,060
Hold on, guys.

1170
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,060
Think about which team will win.

1171
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,730
We'll find that out soon enough.

1172
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,480
We're more interested in those two.

1173
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,210
(Kyung-hwan is
searching for a brush.)

1174
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,540
Is someone here?

1175
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,250
(Kwang Soo is here
to look for a ruler.)

1176
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,290
- Hey.
- Hey.

1177
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,080
That was fast.

1178
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,750
What are you looking for?

1179
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,020
Lettuce.

1180
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,250
- Lettuce?
- Yes.

1181
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,690
- Did you say lettuce?
- Yes.

1182
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,850
It has to be here,
but I can't find it anywhere.

1183
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,460
Do you mean lettuce?

1184
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,670
Yes.

1185
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,540
(He finds a ruler in a file holder.)

1186
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,380
(I should hurry.)

1187
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,350
How did he find it?
This is driving me crazy.

1188
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,940
I'm in trouble.

1189
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,040
- I found a ruler.
- He's here.

1190
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,380
- He came back first.
- He found it.

1191
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,710
- That was fast.
- What happened?

1192
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,790
That was really fast.

1193
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,210
What happened to Kyung-hwan?

1194
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,580
Gosh, Kyung-hwan.

1195
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,380
Kyung-hwan can find his way.
He hosts a radio show here.

1196
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,520
- Hold on.
- The sky!

1197
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,690
- The chimney!
- Is there something on the chimney?

1198
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,650
- Just...
- A ruler!

1199
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,460
A ruler was just brought here.

1200
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,330
Please pay attention
to what others do.

1201
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,770
- Try looking at it from a distance.
- Why?

1202
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,210
- It's easier that way.
- Be quiet!

1203
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,210
- Try looking at it from a distance.
- A mirror!

1204
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,600
No mirror?

1205
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,710
A brick.

1206
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,810
A brick... What's this?

1207
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,770
Guys, he'll use up all your time.

1208
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,750
Give me a second.
I can't find anything.

1209
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,880
I've never done it before.

1210
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,080
Do we have reading glasses?

1211
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,120
(He might need reading glasses.)

1212
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,210
Just a second.
I really can't find anything.

1213
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,210
What's this? Hold on.

1214
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,380
This is hard.

1215
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,520
(The clock is ticking away.)

1216
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,960
Gosh, this is annoying.

1217
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,830
(Annoyed)

1218
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,500
Han Na, why did you pick Suk Jin?

1219
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,420
- Why did I do that?
- Why did you do that?

1220
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,040
- I'm regretting it.
- I apologize in advance.

1221
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,770
- He's here.
- What took you so long?

1222
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,870
- Kyung-hwan.
- Hand it in.

1223
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,210
- Is it hard?
- Start.

1224
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,710
- Is it hard?
- What are you doing? Hurry up.

1225
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,080
Look at the house.

1226
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,980
A brush.

1227
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,350
Oh, an envelope.

1228
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,040
(He already found an envelope?)

1229
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,880
(The envelope Haha found is...)

1230
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,520
(right here.)

1231
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
(Haha turns the game around.)

1232
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,230
What?

1233
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,650
Go!

1234
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,400
Let's go!

1235
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,020
(How could Haha
find an object so fast?)

1236
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,420
I need to pee.

1237
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,560
(He has to use the bathroom.)

1238
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,790
I have to run.

1239
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,710
(He's going up to the 16th floor.)

1240
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,960
It's here.

1241
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,810
I have to go to the bathroom.

1242
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:13,880
(I have to go to the bathroom.)

1243
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,500
I have to go to the bathroom.

1244
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,810
(He runs to the bathroom.)

1245
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,620
(He responds
to nature's call first.)

1246
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,920
After Suk Jin, it's your turn.

1247
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,440
You guys have
two more objects to find.

1248
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,420
But it's impossible.
You won't find anything either.

1249
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,120
There are two objects left.

1250
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,150
Suk Jin and Jong Kook,
you can switch if you want.

1251
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,520
Jong Kook, you should play first.

1252
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,920
- Suk Jin, go back to your seat.
- Jong Kook, you should go.

1253
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,600
- Really?
- Hurry up and go.

1254
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,770
I might not find anything either.

1255
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,790
It's impossible.

1256
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:37,960
It'd be funny
if he finds something right away.

1257
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,440
Please find something right away.

1258
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,730
A ruler was already found.

1259
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,130
A stethoscope.

1260
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,960
What?

1261
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,330
A stethoscope.

1262
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,080
What?

1263
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,770
(What did you say?)

1264
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,080
Hey!

1265
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,580
- Suk Jin!
- Gosh, this is crazy.

1266
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,580
- What's with him?
- Suk Jin!

1267
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,080
I can't believe him.

1268
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,080
- You can't look at it now.
- You can't do that.

1269
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,350
- I want to see it.
- You can't.

1270
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,520
You can't look at it now.

1271
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,250
(The stethoscope
only invisible to Suk Jin is...)

1272
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,000
(right here.)

1273
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,600
Where's a stethoscope?

1274
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,690
(He still can't see it.)

1275
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:09,870
- He can't find a stethoscope.
- Suk Jin.

1276
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,270
What's with you?

1277
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,230
This is driving me crazy.

1278
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,460
I can't believe him.

1279
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,230
A stethoscope was right there.

1280
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:18,440
Let's go.

1281
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,980
(Haha gets back in the game,
feeling a lot better.)

1282
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,250
(I have to run to the office.)

1283
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:23,880
Is this the right place?

1284
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,880
Is this the Running Man office?

1285
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,210
(This is how the Running Man
office hallway looks.)

1286
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,420
(I've been coming here for 10 years,
but it looks unfamiliar today.)

1287
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,520
This isn't the place.

1288
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,350
(Has it been renovated?)

1289
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,460
Is this the office?

1290
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,270
Which floor is this?

1291
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,290
Is this the ninth floor?

1292
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,690
(Is this the ninth floor?)

1293
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,440
Why am I on the ninth floor?

1294
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,710
How did I end up here?

1295
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,830
(I can swear I pushed "16".)

1296
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,480
(5 minutes ago)

1297
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,650
(Haha did push "16".)

1298
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,810
I have to pee.

1299
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,480
(But because of
the urgent call of nature...)

1300
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,670
I really need to pee.

1301
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,710
I have to go to the bathroom.

1302
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,420
(When the elevator stopped
at the ninth floor, he got off.)

1303
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,440
Gosh, I have to go to the bathroom.

1304
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:07,250
(Having to use the bathroom,
he failed to go to the 16th floor.)

1305
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,250
What am I doing on the ninth floor?

1306
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,850
(In the end, he decides
to climb the stairs.)

1307
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,460
A stethoscope is here?

1308
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,520
(Jong Kook is looking
for a stethoscope.)

1309
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,830
Was someone just here?

1310
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:20,940
Haha? Wait.

1311
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,900
Did he just get something from here?

1312
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,940
(Because he went to the bathroom,)

1313
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,540
(he's now training his legs.)

1314
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,100
- Jong Kook.
- You got here now?

1315
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,250
Where's Suk Jin?

1316
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,420
You got here now?

1317
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,250
I was on the ninth floor.

1318
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,120
Is Suk Jin playing last?

1319
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,560
What?

1320
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,060
(Haha is in pain.)

1321
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,020
(Jong Kook finds a stethoscope.)

1322
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,100
I have to run.

1323
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,730
(Almost at the same time,
Haha also finds...)

1324
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,330
Who should I say it to?

1325
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,690
Okay.

1326
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,730
I'm going back.

1327
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:55,900
(He can't run anymore.)

1328
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,330
- Jong Kook!
- Jong Kook came back first.

1329
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,330
- Jong Kook came back first.
- Okay!

1330
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,900
- Okay!
- Oh, my.

1331
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,580
- Gosh.
- Did you see...

1332
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,100
- I'm the only one left.
- Haha?

1333
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,540
He's here.

1334
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,980
My goodness.

1335
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,810
- Haha.
- Hurry up!

1336
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,980
- Go!
- Hurry!

1337
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,350
Is this a stethoscope?

1338
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,150
Is it? This?

1339
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,650
Forget about the stethoscope.

1340
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,630
- You should hurry...
- It doesn't look like one at all.

1341
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,630
They're the last players.

1342
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,270
Find something else.

1343
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,920
- Did someone find a brush?
- Yes.

1344
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,730
Next to that...

1345
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,100
It's a match
between horn-rimmed glasses.

1346
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,600
- What did you say?
- Only one pair is real.

1347
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,670
The big nose match.

1348
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:31,710
What is this?

1349
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,880
This definitely doesn't look like
a stethoscope at all.

1350
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,080
- Forget about the stethoscope!
- Please!

1351
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,580
- Please stop!
- Look for something else!

1352
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,440
I spotted a stethoscope right away.

1353
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,350
- We found a mouse, right?
- Yes, we did.

1354
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,290
Look at similar places.

1355
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,710
See? He isn't much better than me.

1356
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,190
- Focus on finding your item.
- Okay.

1357
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,480
This is driving me crazy.

1358
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,250
Just say anything, Jae Suk.

1359
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:53,690
A pipe.

1360
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,870
- No?
- A pipe.

1361
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,060
- Don't copy him.
- What is up with the two of them?

1362
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,500
- Is he a parrot?
- Seriously.

1363
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:02,630
A needle.

1364
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,500
- An envelope.
- We found it already.

1365
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Really? For goodness' sake.

1366
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,210
- You should know that.
- He didn't listen to the others.

1367
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,020
He is the younger version
of Suk Jin.

1368
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,350
They are neck and neck.

1369
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,190
- This is...
- How can Jae Suk be so bad at it?

1370
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,290
You found every item there is.

1371
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,790
Old fossil versus Super old fossil.

1372
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,480
A clothespin.

1373
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,730
A bag.

1374
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,690
Aside from the hat,
they look the same.

1375
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:27,790
Stop talking about us.

1376
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,290
- Seriously.
- Who is who?

1377
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,440
- They look the same.
- They're facing the same direction.

1378
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,690
- They are like decalcomania.
- This is insane.

1379
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:34,870
- They have the same pose too.
- Look at their pose.

1380
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,270
Their stance is the same.

1381
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,000
I don't see anything.

1382
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
- Hold on.
- Hurry up and find it!

1383
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,400
- Aren't there only four items?
- No, there aren't.

1384
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,480
Is there an additional item?

1385
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,980
I don't see anything.

1386
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,710
A musical note.

1387
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,040
Let's go! Let's go!

1388
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,460
A musical note.

1389
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,250
Let's go! Let's go!

1390
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,580
Old fossil, let's go.

1391
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,790
- Let's go.
- Old fossil, let's go.

1392
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,650
- Suk Jin can't go.
- What is this?

1393
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,060
A nail clipper.

1394
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,830
(Sighing)

1395
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,270
Suk Jin, the judges look worried.

1396
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,960
The judges look worried.

1397
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,810
You should get ready to be a judge.

1398
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:10,940
This is driving me crazy.

1399
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,630
The production crew drew it wrong.

1400
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,380
Does Suk Jin have a lot of time?
He hasn't passed away yet.

1401
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,810
- My goodness.
- I have a lot of time.

1402
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,480
He hasn't passed away yet.

1403
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,310
- My goodness.
- I have a lot of time.

1404
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,250
- "He hasn't passed away yet."
- For goodness' sake.

1405
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,790
- I mean...
- You might see the Grim Reaper.

1406
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,730
Maybe it says "Suk Jin is out"
in the picture.

1407
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,690
Maybe the item is a shoe
or a boot.

1408
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,370
These pigs aren't wearing shoes.

1409
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,940
I am saying it could be hidden
in the picture.

1410
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,940
Look at Jong Kook's
facial expression.

1411
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,130
We...

1412
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,230
If it weren't for the time,
he would have gotten up.

1413
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,750
Anger came after frustration.

1414
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,750
- Let's see it.
- I am just too curious.

1415
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,420
- I would gladly use three seconds.
- I will use my time.

1416
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,790
- A stethoscope.
- Apparently, this is a stethoscope.

1417
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,020
It's a stethoscope.

1418
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,540
What else would it be?

1419
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,960
Go back to your seat.

1420
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,730
- Did you find it?
- Did you find it?

1421
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,380
- My goodness, Suk Jin.
- Did you find it?

1422
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,380
Suk Jin.

1423
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,290
My goodness, Suk Jin.

1424
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,600
- He is so frustrating.
- What's the last item?

1425
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,460
- What is it?
- My goodness.

1426
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,540
- Maybe he is a spy.
- A thumbtack.

1427
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:13,790
- Maybe he is a spy.
- A thumbtack.

1428
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,540
(Is a thumbtack hidden
in the picture?)

1429
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:22,000
(In a suspicious-looking hat
is a thumbtack.)

1430
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,170
- You used it a lot in school.
- That's right.

1431
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,210
A protractor.

1432
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,210
A pencil sharpener. A crayon.

1433
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,540
Even if he had gotten the picture
the day before...

1434
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,620
Seriously.

1435
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,460
He would have claimed
that he got the wrong picture.

1436
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,330
This is just ridiculous.

1437
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:39,600
(At that moment)

1438
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,920
- He is back.
- Oh, dear.

1439
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:45,790
<i>Bye, bye, bye</i>

1440
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,600
What's the item?

1441
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,830
I am so annoyed. What's the item?

1442
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,500
Suk Jin, the last item is
a thumbtack.

1443
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,600
- Se Chan found it.
- I see it now.

1444
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,250
- I told you to look closely.
- I see it now.

1445
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,750
This is great.

1446
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,670
Thus, Team Heo Kyung-hwan won.

1447
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,020
(Team Heo Kyung-hwan won.)

1448
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,810
The winning team
must make a choice now.

1449
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,150
Please bring in the roulette.

1450
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,650
(Roulette)

1451
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,480
- There is a dud.
- There is a dud.

1452
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,130
- There is a dud.
- Get twice the invested time.

1453
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,690
If you get your time stolen,
you could become a judge right away.

1454
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,250
I don't have much time.

1455
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,000
It might be a bad idea
to spin the roulette.

1456
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,500
- That's right.
- Just don't land on dud.

1457
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,600
- If you...
- I'll invest 20 minutes.

1458
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,730
20 minutes.

1459
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,270
- 20 minutes?
- Spin the roulette.

1460
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,230
If I stand up to go to the roulette,
am I using my time?

1461
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,080
- Yes.
- You need to spin it really fast.

1462
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,310
Of course.

1463
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,150
- I don't have much time.
- Ask someone to spin it for you.

1464
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,150
Jae Suk! Oh, I shouldn't ask him
since he is unlucky.

1465
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,520
Oh, I shouldn't ask him
since he is unlucky.

1466
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,020
- Hey.
- For goodness' sake.

1467
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,150
Jong Kook, please spin the roulette.

1468
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,690
Sure. I will do it for you.

1469
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,920
- Please let me get a good one.
- Okay.

1470
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,190
- Here I go.
- You never know what you will get.

1471
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,290
All right.

1472
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,870
20 minutes!

1473
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,730
(In the worst-case scenario,
he will lose 20 minutes.)

1474
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,190
(What will happen to Se Chan,
the man with 40 minutes?)

1475
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,210
- What did he get?
- A dud?

1476
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,730
It's not half bad.

1477
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,170
Steal 20 minutes and
the invested time from the top 1.

1478
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:01,040
He will steal time from the top one.

1479
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,850
Steal 20 minutes and
the invested time from the top 1.

1480
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,380
He will steal time from the top one.

1481
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,480
I will steal time!

1482
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,150
You get 20 minutes
and the invested time.

1483
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:09,690
That means I get 40 minutes.

1484
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,520
- It's really nice.
- Jong Kook, thank you.

1485
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,560
- Okay.
- Who is the top one?

1486
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,960
You should tell us
who the top one is.

1487
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,420
I won't reveal who the top one is.

1488
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,920
- I see.
- That's reasonable.

1489
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,600
- Did I get 40 minutes?
- You got 40 minutes.

1490
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
- The top 1 lost 40 minutes.
- That's incredible.

1491
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,100
- So Min.
- So Min, you are up next.

1492
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:26,940
- 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes.

1493
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:28,810
- Should I spin the roulette?
- Who should do it? Jae Suk?

1494
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,210
- No.
- Jong Kook?

1495
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:31,330
I am sorry, Jae Suk.

1496
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,380
- Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook, please spin it.

1497
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,710
Jong Kook already used his luck.
Will he get a good one again?

1498
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,000
You are my favorite writer,
so I will do it.

1499
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,650
Here I go.

1500
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,920
(Jong Kook got the best choice
for Se Chan.)

1501
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,290
- I hope it's a good one.
- It's spinning.

1502
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,810
(How will he do for So Min?)

1503
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,060
- Please.
- It's not too bad.

1504
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,330
Steal the invested time
from another.

1505
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,190
- Okay, okay.
- Jong Kook, you are lucky.

1506
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,790
(Steal the invested time
from another.)

1507
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,920
- Okay, okay.
- Jong Kook, you are lucky.

1508
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,690
- You are lucky.
- Steal the invested time.

1509
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,940
- He must have some kind of luck.
- Seriously.

1510
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,670
- It's fascinating.
- Jong Kook.

1511
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:06,600
- My goodness.
- He is really good at this.

1512
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,880
Do you pick a member?

1513
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:11,270
Do I... Do you pick a member?

1514
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,080
- Yes. Whose time will you steal?
- Really?

1515
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:17,290
Pick someone who was in a hurry.
It means they don't have...

1516
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:18,460
- much time.
- Okay.

1517
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,190
Pick a target.

1518
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,560
In that case,

1519
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:28,250
I will steal 10 minutes
from Ji Suk Jin World.

1520
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:29,630
- Ji Suk Jin World.
- I will remember this.

1521
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:30,790
It's a good choice.

1522
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,830
Just you wait.
You know that I hold grudges, right?

1523
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,500
Does that mean you have
three minutes left?

1524
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:37,830
Gosh, you showed your true colors.

1525
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,380
You will be my target
in the next round.

1526
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,540
Okay.

1527
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:42,710
Kyung-hwan.

1528
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,480
Kyung-hwan, should I spin it?

1529
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,620
- An hour.
- Really?

1530
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,210
- You have so much time.
- No, no!

1531
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,690
- An hour.
- Really?

1532
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:55,150
- You have so much time.
- No, no!

1533
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,230
An hour.

1534
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,230
I wasn't done talking.

1535
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,250
- I spun the roulette.
- I wasn't done talking.

1536
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,230
Is it stealing?

1537
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:03,960
(Steal the invested time
from another?)

1538
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,000
It's stealing.

1539
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,560
Is it stealing?

1540
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,170
(He can steal an hour
from another.)

1541
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,210
It's stealing.

1542
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,270
Look at Jae Suk.

1543
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,130
- This is incredible.
- Look at Jae Suk.

1544
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,540
Look at Jae Suk.

1545
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,880
- You know...
- He can steal an hour.

1546
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,170
- An hour.
- You know,

1547
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:20,710
I was going to subtract 30 minutes
from an hour,

1548
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,480
but someone spun the roulette...

1549
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,310
- without listening to me.
- He came out on top.

1550
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,350
- That was incredible.
- Kyung-hwan, I did this for you.

1551
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,730
- That's right.
- I will steal...

1552
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,460
Jae Suk's time.

1553
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,420
Jae Suk's time.

1554
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,020
He might not have an hour.

1555
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,900
He is unbelievable.

1556
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,730
- No, no.
- Jae Suk is finished.

1557
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:42,810
- Is Jae Suk finished?
- I have enough time.

1558
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,270
- I have enough time.
- Not many people would be fine...

1559
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,600
after losing an hour.

1560
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,170
Is he still in the race?
I need that information...

1561
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,480
- to make my decision.
- But he lost an hour.

1562
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,310
- He is in the race.
- He is in the race!

1563
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,190
- I have enough time.
- How is he still in the race?

1564
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,190
That means he began
with over two hours.

1565
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,230
I will have Jong Kook spin
the roulette for me.

1566
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,790
- Okay.
- How much time will you invest?

1567
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,790
15 minutes.

1568
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,420
Gosh, that's so trivial.

1569
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,870
- 15 minutes.
- He has 40 to 50 minutes.

1570
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,770
He is so small-minded.

1571
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,940
- That's so trivial.
- He is so small-minded.

1572
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:15,630
- If you invest 15 minutes...
- I will invest...

1573
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:16,870
17 minutes.

1574
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:17,900
That's so trivial.

1575
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,540
- That's so trivial.
- He has 50 minutes.

1576
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,580
All right.

1577
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,350
If I try to do well,

1578
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,540
- I might not get a good option.
- Greed ruins everything.

1579
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:26,850
Here I go.

1580
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:27,920
(Jong Kook spins the roulette
for the third time.)

1581
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,440
Please.

1582
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:32,920
My business partner.

1583
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:34,880
Avoid the red ones.

1584
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,900
(Give the invested time to another)

1585
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,920
Okay! Okay!

1586
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,190
My goodness.

1587
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,040
Okay! Okay!

1588
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:47,540
The train...

1589
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:49,230
has stopped.

1590
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,560
Greed ruined his luck.

1591
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,000
He will have to give
17 minutes and 30 seconds.

1592
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,540
It's a bad option.
You need to give the invested time.

1593
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:54,880
Give it to me.

1594
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,850
- Give it to me.
- Haha, give it to me.

1595
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,380
Haha,
I will give it back to you later.

1596
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:02,210
- Really?
- I will give you 20 minutes later.

1597
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,710
Writer Jeon.

1598
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,560
I choose Writer Jeon. Jeon So Min.

1599
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,580
- Does he still trust So Min?
- I can't believe he trusts her.

1600
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,750
- Didn't he learn his lesson?
- Does he still trust So Min?

1601
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,420
So Min and I have...

1602
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,370
- a connection.
- I can't believe he trusts her.

1603
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,690
I will invest 30 minutes.

1604
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,960
- Do you have that much time?
- Jae Suk,

1605
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,460
that will leave you
with five minutes.

1606
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,710
Will you be okay?

1607
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:25,600
Does he have that much time?
He got an hour taken away.

1608
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,500
I can invest more time, okay?

1609
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,440
The moment he gets a bad one,
he will wear a yellow outfit.

1610
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,020
That's not true.

1611
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,380
I am...

1612
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,750
quite relaxed.

1613
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,650
I am quite relaxed.

1614
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:40,420
I think you will get a red one.
What are you going to do?

1615
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,750
(What will he get for himself?)

1616
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,950
(Dud)

1617
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:56,070
- Oh, dear.
- You're in trouble.

1618
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,300
(His 30 minutes become a dud.)

1619
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:02,200
- Dud.
- You're so unlucky.

1620
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,760
- It's so strange.
- Good.

1621
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,470
He was too confident.

1622
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:06,930
- It's so strange.
- How embarrassing.

1623
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,200
I'm blushing for him.

1624
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,100
- What is it then?
- Do you lose time?

1625
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,300
- You lose time?
- Jae Suk.

1626
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,850
You do lose the time.
I'll deduct 30 minutes.

1627
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,280
(12 minutes left
until the 1st judge is ready)

1628
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,890
How is this possible?

1629
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:20,410
- He's so rich.
- Where is the judge outfit?

1630
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,910
- Does he still have time left?
- I have enough.

1631
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,050
He had over 1.5 hours.

1632
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,850
- Do you have enough?
- Yes, I do.

1633
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:26,850
- I have enough.
- How much time did you have?

1634
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,300
I bet he has 15 minutes left.

1635
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,990
- Can he eat?
- He has 15 minutes left.

1636
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:32,840
- Give him a potty.
- What?

1637
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,870
(Current Time Status)

1638
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,970
You need two people to get the food.

1639
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:40,200
Jae Suk has spare time,
so he should go.

1640
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,930
- You should go.
- Oh, gosh.

1641
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,950
I can definitely go.

1642
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,300
He lost everything.

1643
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,240
It'll take a while
if we have to go outside.

1644
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,590
It's lunchtime now.

1645
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:53,390
We ordered from the gimbap place
across from SBS.

1646
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,720
Two of you have to go and get it.

1647
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,030
It'll be nice for
Se Chan and So Min to go.

1648
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,490
Right, two of you can go.

1649
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,160
- Why?
- Why don't we...

1650
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,820
just pick spoons randomly?

1651
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,370
- Should we pick spoons?
- Yes.

1652
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,390
I have to go with Kyung-hwan.

1653
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,160
- See you later.
- I have time to spare.

1654
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,370
Go get bulked up.

1655
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:11,470
Bulk up?

1656
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,340
Let's see how fit he is.

1657
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,570
I'm going downhill.

1658
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,180
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1659
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,780
- Are you rich?
- What?

1660
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,050
You have a lot of time, right?

1661
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,240
I have enough.

1662
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,220
Maybe I shouldn't have taken
Jae Suk's time away.

1663
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,220
He's talking much less now.

1664
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:29,950
He's talking much less.

1665
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,050
I agree. He's talking much less.

1666
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,260
I usually leave him alone,
but I interfered this time.

1667
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:37,430
It's a bit tight now.

1668
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,870
(He's anxious and restless.)

1669
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,340
I'm so unlucky.

1670
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,370
Jong Kook.

1671
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,910
Oh, dear.

1672
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,780
I should stand up, but I can't.

1673
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,640
- Here's the bibimbap.
- It's all right.

1674
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,680
- That looks good.
- Jong Kook.

1675
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,740
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1676
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,890
Please take what you want.

1677
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,390
Are there tables?

1678
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,490
We have trays.
Please take them if you need them.

1679
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,850
- Where?
- Is it self-serve?

1680
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:02,850
Yes.

1681
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:03,850
Get mine too.

1682
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,620
Se Chan, get mine.

1683
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,720
You should have used
the 17 minutes on me.

1684
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,620
(Se Chan takes his time
using the self-serve.)

1685
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,100
I realized.

1686
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,800
It's so good to have time.

1687
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,740
(She steals Se Chan's cutlery.)

1688
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:24,010
(The petty offender DNA squirms
inside of her.)

1689
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,140
It's so good to have time.

1690
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,370
(When did you take that?)

1691
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,410
What?

1692
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,050
So Min.

1693
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,120
Where's mine?

1694
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,280
Here's yours.

1695
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,320
Se Chan.

1696
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,550
It's because you took my spoon.

1697
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,390
Thanks.

1698
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,490
This is not fun.
I need to focus on work.

1699
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:42,890
Goodness.

1700
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,490
You took my spoon.

1701
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:47,660
You're not letting me work. Gosh.

1702
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:48,890
- Here.
- You little guy.

1703
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,510
Where did you get
the wooden chopsticks?

1704
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,030
Do you need some?

1705
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,100
Give him some wooden chopsticks.

1706
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,180
(He tries desperately
to save some time.)

1707
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,510
Kwang Soo, I have some here.

1708
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,090
- There are a lot.
- Give me a pair.

1709
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:05,240
Kwang Soo ran here...

1710
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,120
and took a pair of chopsticks,
but it was the wrapper.

1711
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,450
- I took the wrapper.
- It was the wrapper.

1712
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:10,550
(Please go away, wrappers.)

1713
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,390
Throw away garbage
in the garbage bin.

1714
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:15,160
- Why did you leave it there?
- There are so many here.

1715
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,990
Thank you for the food.

1716
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,300
Thank you for the food. Enjoy.

1717
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,200
(They all enjoy lunch together.)

1718
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,030
Stir-fried pork is so good.

1719
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:24,640
Gosh,

1720
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,840
I have to do well in the next game.

1721
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,740
(He really doesn't have much time.)

1722
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,120
You only realize
when you don't have much.

1723
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,950
I'm more desperate
because I used to be rich.

1724
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,780
After you eat,

1725
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,780
you have to clean up.

1726
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:42,850
We have to pick people.

1727
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:46,930
Please pick two people
to clean up the trays.

1728
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:49,030
Jae Suk's time might be over
while he cleans.

1729
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:51,100
Goodness.

1730
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,100
(He can't deny it.)

1731
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,340
Who wants to
brush their teeth with me?

1732
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,160
We can resume filming
feeling refreshed.

1733
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,030
You weren't planning
to brush your teeth?

1734
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,180
Flex.

1735
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,470
- Let's go.
- That's out of the ordinary.

1736
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:08,510
I'm sorry, but I can't feel
refreshed for the time being.

1737
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,140
(The poor get poorer,
and the rich get richer.)

1738
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,950
- My bad.
- Aren't you going to flex?

1739
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:13,850
Brushing teeth is a luxury.

1740
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:14,990
Is it?

1741
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,660
Let's play Race of Wits and
pick two people who'll clean up.

1742
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,760
I'll let two winners
spin the roulette.

1743
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,930
- Really?
- Really?

1744
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:24,260
Suk Jin is
already eliminated.

1745
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:26,160
- He is because he's not here.
- He's not here.

1746
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:27,740
Set...

1747
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,410
- We need one more person.
- Let's get started.

1748
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:30,640
Are you starting without him?

1749
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,570
Of course. He should have been
paying attention.

1750
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,570
We need one more person then.

1751
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,600
- Right.
- Right.

1752
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,450
Start.

1753
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:43,220
- If you stand up first...
- One.

1754
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,010
That was fast.

1755
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,320
- 2.
- 2.

1756
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,160
(They both did 2!)

1757
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:52,620
- Two of you?
- Why did he copy me?

1758
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:55,660
My gosh. He's driving me nuts.

1759
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,470
Two of you lost,

1760
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:00,100
so once Suk Jin comes back,
do rock-paper-scissors?

1761
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,930
Three of them can do
rock-paper-scissors.

1762
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,970
You have to pick two people
from the rest of them.

1763
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,570
Yes, we have to pick
the two winners.

1764
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,410
- Do we have to pick 2 winners?
- 2 winners.

1765
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,030
Start.

1766
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,600
One.

1767
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,550
- 2.
- 3.

1768
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,950
- 4.
- 5.

1769
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,490
Six.

1770
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,260
Jong Kook is out.

1771
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,260
- Were you not even trying?
- No.

1772
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,350
(How unpleasant.)

1773
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,050
I just wanted to enjoy my food.

1774
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,220
Fine. You have time to spare.

1775
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,890
- You must have a lot of time.
- You have time to spare.

1776
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,740
I have enough.

1777
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,260
- Five.
- Take it.

1778
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,870
What was that for?

1779
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:37,010
- He has a lot of time.
- Do you?

1780
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:38,510
- I have a lot of time.
- That much?

1781
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:40,280
Okay, next.

1782
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,850
He's so into this.

1783
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:44,950
Look at Jae Suk.

1784
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:47,640
- Set...
- He's back.

1785
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,220
Suk Jin, you have to do
rock-paper-scissors.

1786
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,510
- You got eliminated.
- Why?

1787
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,990
- Do rock-paper-scissors with them.
- Three of us.

1788
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,280
- Se Chan and Haha.
- Haha.

1789
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,090
- Cleaning up.
- One person.

1790
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:57,390
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1791
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:59,850
(He wins.)

1792
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:00,850
I won.

1793
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,470
Rich people are worse.

1794
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,240
Everything is working out
for you this year.

1795
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,490
That's so true.

1796
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,760
Everything will work out for me.
Your schemes don't matter.

1797
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,010
He blocked the sharpest spears.

1798
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:15,430
Okay, let's go again.

1799
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:16,950
This is cutthroat.

1800
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:19,140
Kwang Soo, are you desperate too?

1801
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,870
No, I'm not.

1802
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,410
Start.

1803
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,850
- 1.
- 2.

1804
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,640
- Three.
- Gosh.

1805
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,260
(Kwang Soo and Jae Suk are
desperate for more time.)

1806
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,720
- Both of you are out.
- You're out.

1807
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,930
You're completely out.

1808
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:32,390
Gosh, Kwang Soo.

1809
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,050
Only one person
needs to be eliminated.

1810
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,120
Ready, set, go.

1811
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,120
- 1.
- 2.

1812
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,200
What was that?

1813
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:40,490
- 1.
- 2.

1814
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:41,490
What was that?

1815
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:42,600
So Min is out.

1816
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:44,870
That was useless.

1817
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,410
Is it the two of them?

1818
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,680
Do we spin the roulette?

1819
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,280
As promised, Han Na and Ji Hyo,

1820
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,050
you get to spin the roulette.

1821
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,680
Why don't I get a chance?

1822
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,220
- You left.
- You...

1823
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,680
barely survived.

1824
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,850
- Really?
- Yes.

1825
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:00,510
(He plays dumb.)

1826
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,120
I don't understand
why I don't get to spin it.

1827
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,280
I get to spin the roulette.

1828
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,550
Why don't I get a chance?

1829
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:08,260
- I don't get it.
- When we suggested the game,

1830
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,220
you weren't there,
so you were eliminated.

1831
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,620
It's your fault you left
when the camera was on.

1832
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:15,260
We keep moving around when
the cameras are on. That's the idea.

1833
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:16,410
Anyhow...

1834
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:17,970
- That's the idea?
- Hey.

1835
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,470
Whose idea is that?

1836
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:20,680
Goodness.

1837
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,410
You shouldn't have left
to brush your teeth.

1838
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:24,970
- Okay.
- You first.

1839
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:28,320
How did I get a dud?

1840
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,780
Ji Hyo, how much
would you like to invest?

1841
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,590
- Let's go high.
- Me?

1842
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,160
Go high. Be cool.

1843
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,510
Be a big spender.

1844
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,720
Don't be like Jae Suk.

1845
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,720
I'll invest 10 minutes.

1846
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:39,390
- 10 minutes?
- You must be really poor.

1847
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:42,660
She probably has 25 minutes.

1848
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,800
- Do I spin?
- Yes.

1849
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:46,240
(Ji Hyo spins the roulette.)

1850
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:50,160
(Ji Hyo is good with chances.)

1851
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,570
(Where will she land on?)

1852
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,970
- She got blue right away.
- It's a dud.

1853
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,470
- Look.
- It's a dud.

1854
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:56,740
- She went from lucky to unlucky.
- Dud.

1855
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,220
You're getting more fun now.

1856
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,590
- Hey.
- She's unlucky now.

1857
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,160
It's better
the more unlucky you are.

1858
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,180
Han Na.

1859
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,550
Han Na, be bold.

1860
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,820
I'll invest 50 minutes.

1861
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:11,850
- She's rich.
- 50 minutes.

1862
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,660
(Everybody is surprised
she invested 50 minutes!)

1863
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,450
- She has time.
- She has plenty.

1864
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:17,260
She pretended like...

1865
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,970
- she was poor.
- Can I do that?

1866
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:20,030
She was running around.

1867
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:21,430
- 50 minutes.
- 50 minutes?

1868
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,240
- Okay.
- She has at least an hour.

1869
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,760
She had time.

1870
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,280
- "Give the invested time..."
- Start.

1871
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,010
"to another" sounds really good.
"Give the invested time to another."

1872
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,240
(She can gain 100 minutes
or lose 50 minutes.)

1873
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,410
Han Na.

1874
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,180
It's a dud.

1875
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,240
It's not.

1876
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,180
- Please, Han Na.
- "Get twice..."

1877
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:39,220
"the invested time."

1878
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,350
(She clasps her hands together.)

1879
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,090
- Please, Han Na.
- "Get twice..."

1880
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,760
"the invested time."

1881
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,990
"Steal the invested time
from another."

1882
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:52,030
- 50 minutes?
- Steal.

1883
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:54,470
(Her investment was a huge success.)

1884
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:55,870
Really?

1885
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:58,100
Somebody will get the yellow outfit.

1886
01:04:58,370 --> 01:04:59,840
- Can I decide now?
- Yes.

1887
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,740
Suk Jin.

1888
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:02,970
- Hey!
- Suk Jin.

1889
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:04,870
(Han Na gains 50 minutes,
and Suk Jin loses 50.)

1890
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,100
Hey.

1891
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,280
What's wrong with her?

1892
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,950
- Amazing.
- Why would you do that?

1893
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:12,180
She's creating a story for Suk Jin.

1894
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,590
I got disappointed at the thumbtack.

1895
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,680
- I knew it.
- Why?

1896
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:18,350
- She's creating a story for him.
- Thumbtack Suk Jin.

1897
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:21,930
- He's still alive.
- Yes, I'm still alive.

1898
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:23,200
(What is the result
of the scramble for time?)

1899
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:28,300
(Current Time Status)

1900
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,300
This game is called
Strawberry, St-raw-berry.

1901
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,700
- This is the worst.
- You have to be lucky.

1902
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:36,180
Please.

1903
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,240
(The awful strawberry game is back.)

1904
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,740
What's this?

1905
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,050
(Why? What is it?)

1906
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:42,120
(Strawberry for 1 beat)

1907
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,120
(St-raw-berry for 2 beats)

1908
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,390
(Strawberry, st-raw-berry
for 3 beats)

1909
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,410
(St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry
for 4 beats)

1910
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:47,760
(St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry,
strawberry for 5 beats)

1911
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,450
(St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry,
st-raw-berry for 6 beats)

1912
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:54,350
("Strawberry" is for 1 beat,
and "st-raw-berry" is for 2 beats)

1913
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:58,070
(You must say the terms accordingly
from beat 1 to 8.)

1914
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,530
Isn't it a difficult game?

1915
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,800
(It's a game
everyone struggled with.)

1916
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,390
We changed the rules a bit.

1917
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,410
You chant "I like strawberry" first.

1918
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:07,140
Let's say Haha goes, "So Min, four."

1919
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,280
Then she should go,
"St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry."

1920
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,450
The one who is called must do it.
Then the attack continues on.

1921
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:14,640
This is hard.

1922
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:16,620
The member who gets it wrong...

1923
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:20,950
must leave the circle
and stand at the back.

1924
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:22,760
- Really?
- This is bad.

1925
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,820
Is this a tournament?

1926
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,660
You can only sit back down
when the other team gets it wrong.

1927
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:29,050
If your team gets it wrong,
you keep standing up.

1928
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:30,890
The game will continue on that way.

1929
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:33,030
You could get eliminated
while you are standing up.

1930
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,700
(This is bad.
I don't have much time.)

1931
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,800
This is bad.

1932
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,840
It looks like Jae Suk will wear
the yellow outfit.

1933
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:44,950
Jong Kook and I will divide
the members into two teams.

1934
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,620
- The two of us?
- We are in the middle.

1935
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,120
He doesn't want to move.

1936
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,280
(He doesn't want to lose any time.)

1937
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,120
- Let's change the seats.
- Okay.

1938
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,510
Se Chan and Haha, go over there.

1939
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,050
The team
that gets 12 points 1st wins.

1940
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:58,760
This is so nerve-wracking. Hold on.

1941
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,490
- My heart is about to burst.
<i>- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

1942
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:02,320
<i>- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry
- St, st, st, st</i>

1943
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,620
<i>- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry
- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

1944
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,030
(I need to win and get more time.)

1945
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,970
The two captains will decide
which team attacks first...

1946
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,570
- with rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

1947
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:09,660
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1948
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,640
(Team Jae Suk will attack first.)

1949
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,530
- Okay!
- This is important.

1950
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,800
- We need to win some points.
- Okay.

1951
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,240
(Jae Suk is distracted.)

1952
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,410
- Show us an attack like an awl.
- Let's go.

1953
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:22,240
<i>- I like strawberry
- I like strawberry</i>

1954
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:24,450
<i>- Ha Na, seven</i>
- What?

1955
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,050
He said "Ha Na."

1956
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:31,660
(As soon as the game started)

1957
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:34,350
(He yelled, "Ha Na, seven.")

1958
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:36,160
(He changed her name
from Han Na to Ha Na.)

1959
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,720
- Ha Na.
- He said, "Ha Na, seven."

1960
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,700
- Let's start over.
- I heard Ha Na.

1961
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,200
Hold on.
Please overlook this mistake...

1962
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,030
because Jae Suk is really nervous.

1963
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,370
- I am sorry.
- He said Ha Na.

1964
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:47,470
He is really nervous.

1965
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,280
Okay. I understand.

1966
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:50,680
Start.

1967
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:53,140
<i>- I like strawberry
- I like strawberry</i>

1968
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:54,820
<i>Se Chan, eight</i>

1969
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,350
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry,
st-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

1970
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:00,160
<i>- Jae Suk, three
- I like strawberry</i>

1971
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,050
(I like strawberry)

1972
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,850
Why did you say,
"I like strawberry"?

1973
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:06,930
(He showed his nervousness
by repeating the intro.)

1974
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:08,490
(Jae Suk is so embarrassing.)

1975
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:09,550
I am in trouble.

1976
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:13,640
(Jae Suk is the target of the day.)

1977
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:14,870
Go.

1978
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,340
- Go and stand in the back.
- Jae Suk.

1979
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:19,300
- He is so embarrassing.
- Hurry up.

1980
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,910
Hurry up and play the game.
So Min, hurry up.

1981
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,140
(His clock is ticking.)

1982
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:24,680
<i>I like strawberry</i>

1983
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,680
(He copies Jae Suk.)

1984
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,320
<i>- I like strawberry
- I like strawberry</i>

1985
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,590
<i>- Suk Jin, seven
- Strawberry</i>

1986
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:35,760
(He said "Strawberry"
in a weird way.)

1987
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,860
For goodness' sake. He got me.

1988
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:40,650
Start.

1989
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,900
<i>- I like strawberry
- I like strawberry</i>

1990
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,800
<i>Ji Hyo, three</i>

1991
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:46,100
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1992
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,160
What was that?

1993
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,970
(She said "Strawberry, st-raw-berry"
after missing two beats.)

1994
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:53,030
(Ji Hyo is the worst at this game.)

1995
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:54,530
- Go.
- She has no sense of rhythm.

1996
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:55,570
(Suk Jin is in and Ji Hyo is out.)

1997
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:56,810
This is so hard.

1998
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:58,010
What's the current score?

1999
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:00,770
<i>- I like strawberry
- I like strawberry</i>

2000
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,870
<i>- Haha, six
- St-raw-berry</i>

2001
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,780
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

2002
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:06,450
<i>- Jae Suk, seven
- Traw</i>

2003
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:11,950
(Traw...)

2004
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:13,060
What is wrong with him?

2005
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,430
(Kwang Soo explodes.)

2006
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,620
"Traw"?

2007
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,160
(He babbled something
about a strawberry.)

2008
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,100
No one got a chance to play.

2009
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,400
"Traw"?

2010
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,990
I don't think
he understands the rules.

2011
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,730
Just hurry up and change...

2012
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:24,840
- into the judge's uniform.
- All right.

2013
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:25,900
I still have time.

2014
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,530
We are behind by so many points.

2015
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:30,200
<i>- I like strawberry
- I like strawberry</i>

2016
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,850
<i>- Han Na, three
- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

2017
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,370
<i>- So Min, six
- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

2018
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,280
<i>- St-raw-berry
- They are good.</i>

2019
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,350
<i>- Suk Jin, three
- St-raw-berry</i>

2020
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,190
(He said "St-raw-berry"
in a strange way.)

2021
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:46,490
- All right.
- It's "St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry."

2022
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,150
Play rock-paper-scissors
and the winner sits down.

2023
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,930
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

2024
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:55,840
(He loses.)

2025
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,860
- What is he going to do?
<i>- Rock</i>

2026
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,560
(He lacks composure,
skills, and luck.)

2027
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,400
- Ji Hyo, that little...
- He has the worst luck today.

2028
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,110
He has the worst luck today.

2029
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:04,240
Start.

2030
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,610
<i>- I like strawberry
- I like strawberry</i>

2031
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,370
<i>- Kyung-hwan, seven
- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

2032
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:10,980
<i>St-raw-berry, hey</i>

2033
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:13,190
<i>- For goodness' sake.
- Kyung-hwan, seven</i>

2034
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,310
(Strawberry, st-raw-berry)

2035
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:16,780
(St-raw-berry, hey)

2036
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,560
(He takes himself out.)

2037
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,990
(Kyung-hwan's wrong answer
makes everyone laugh.)

2038
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:22,650
My heart aches.

2039
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:24,730
Kyung-hwan! Come on!

2040
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:25,770
(Jae Suk is tense.)

2041
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:27,470
- That was hilarious.
- We don't have much time.

2042
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:28,530
- Didn't we win?
- Start.

2043
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:30,660
<i>- I like strawberry
- I like strawberry</i>

2044
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,230
<i>- Suk Jin, three
- St-raw-berry</i>

2045
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:36,440
(He enunciates his wrong answer.)

2046
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,010
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

2047
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:41,440
(So Min goes back in!)

2048
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,070
Gosh, I need to sit down.
This is driving me crazy.

2049
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,020
(Jae Suk continues to lose time
as they play the game.)

2050
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,280
<i>- I like strawberry
- I like strawberry</i>

2051
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,890
<i>- Ji Hyo, seven
- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

2052
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,190
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

2053
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:53,860
<i>Haha, three</i>

2054
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,100
(Babbling)

2055
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:58,730
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

2056
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:00,600
(Kyung-hwan goes back in
this time.)

2057
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,770
Why do you win all the time?

2058
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,730
Why do you win all the time?

2059
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,360
- Why do you win all the time?
- Why do you lose all the time?

2060
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:07,700
<i>- I like strawberry
- I like strawberry</i>

2061
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,010
(The game continues on.)

2062
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:11,180
<i>- Jae Suk, three
- Straw</i>

2063
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,510
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

2064
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:13,910
This is driving me crazy.

2065
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,980
Hurry up. We don't have time.

2066
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:19,350
<i>- Jae Suk, seven
- Staw, raw-berry</i>

2067
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,310
(Staw, raw-berry)

2068
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:22,450
"Raw-berry"?

2069
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:23,950
(He can't believe himself.)

2070
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,360
<i>- Jae Suk, six
- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

2071
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,300
(He calmly succeeds this time!)

2072
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,360
<i>Jae Suk, six</i>

2073
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,560
(He had it right. But...)

2074
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,560
(He attacks himself.)

2075
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,270
- "Jae Suk, six."
- That's too much.

2076
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,360
- That's too much.
- "Jae Suk, six."

2077
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:39,510
- I am sorry.
- This is heartbreaking.

2078
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:41,680
- I made a mistake.
- This is heartbreaking.

2079
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,940
Hurry up. We don't have time.

2080
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:44,480
- Why do you keep saying that?
- Hurry up.

2081
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,700
- I like... Hurry up.
- What's the point...

2082
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,410
- of hurrying up?
- We don't have time.

2083
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:48,480
We don't have time.

2084
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,980
<i>- I like strawberry
- We are going to lose.</i>

2085
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,090
<i>- Han Na, three
- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

2086
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,620
<i>- Jae Suk, eight
- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

2087
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,730
(He calmly defends himself.)

2088
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:00,490
<i>- Han Na, three
- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

2089
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:02,320
<i>- Come on!
- Kwang Soo, eight</i>

2090
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,060
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry,
st-raw-berry</i>

2091
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:07,270
(Jae Suk has about 2 minutes left,)

2092
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:09,490
(but the rally continues on.)

2093
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:10,730
<i>- So Min, seven
- St-raw-berry</i>

2094
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:13,400
(When will this end?)

2095
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,870
<i>- Se Chan, eight
- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

2096
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:16,850
<i>- Hurry up!
- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

2097
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,980
<i>- Jae Suk, two
- St-raw-berry</i>

2098
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:20,150
That little...

2099
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,780
(He ignored the beat.)

2100
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:26,410
(Feeling pressed for time,
he ended the game.)

2101
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:29,360
(Team Jong Kook wins
with a score of 12 to 7.)

2102
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,190
He got angry. "St-raw-berry!"

2103
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,230
Just how little time does he have?

2104
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:35,490
That was so funny.

2105
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:37,520
- The game ended.
- Did it end?

2106
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,300
- We lost.
- You lost.

2107
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,730
- This team will spin the roulette.
- Okay.

2108
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:43,560
- Han Na, do you want to go first?
- Shall I go first?

2109
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,440
This is Han Na's second time
spinning it.

2110
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,530
I will invest...

2111
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,640
an hour.

2112
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:52,900
(She invests 60 minutes.)

2113
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,370
Han Na, you might get
"Give the invested time to another."

2114
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,690
- What?
- Then please give it to me.

2115
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:59,150
- There is that option.
- That's right.

2116
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:01,110
Han Na, I am begging you.

2117
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:02,650
Han Na.

2118
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,020
I will spin it.

2119
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,820
You should give it to someone
on your team.

2120
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,150
(What will be the result
of Han Na's big investment?)

2121
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:11,620
- Han Na could finish someone off.
- You never know.

2122
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:15,190
Han Na, please help the poor.

2123
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,770
Steal the invested time
from another.

2124
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:19,030
Steal the invested time.

2125
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:21,640
Steal the invested time.

2126
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,640
(She gets
"Steal the invested time.")

2127
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,050
She will finish someone off.

2128
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,680
Han Na, you are so cool.

2129
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,270
I didn't know I would get that.

2130
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:30,980
That's incredible.

2131
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,850
Kyung-hwan has...

2132
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:34,190
a lot of time, right?

2133
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,020
(Startled)

2134
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,860
- Kyung-hwan has a lot of time.
- You have a lot of time too.

2135
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,150
Hey.

2136
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,560
Finish someone off.

2137
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,900
I will pick someone
who has a lot of time.

2138
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,490
- I pick Suk Jin.
- Hey!

2139
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:47,730
You have a lot of time.

2140
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,140
(I pick Suk Jin.)

2141
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,440
You have a lot of time.

2142
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,730
- I...
- Suk Jin.

2143
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,570
- I mean...
- You stole two hours from me.

2144
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,480
She stole an hour and 50 minutes
from Suk Jin.

2145
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,610
Flex! Flex!

2146
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:00,150
An hour and 50 minutes?

2147
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:01,940
You said you have
all the time in the world.

2148
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,520
- Han Na is amazing.
- He is her target.

2149
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,650
I can't believe you!

2150
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,810
- This is driving me crazy.
- You have a lot of time.

2151
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,360
Hold on. The judges are talking
among themselves.

2152
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,390
- They are talking.
- Something is happening.

2153
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:11,760
Suk Jin is...

2154
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,760
Let me spin the roulette at least.

2155
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,260
- This round isn't over.
- That's not how it works.

2156
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,520
- Suk Jin is out.
- Is he out?

2157
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,120
Change into the judge's uniform.

2158
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,120
I should be able to spin
the roulette.

2159
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,100
It's effective immediately.

2160
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,360
- You are out.
- Why is everyone so happy?

2161
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,440
Hey.

2162
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:25,770
- Hey, you...
- The first judge, Suk Jin.

2163
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:29,870
Suk Jin, put on the judge's uniform
and help us as a staff member.

2164
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:31,350
- Let's move things along.
- He will lose the cameras.

2165
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:32,870
Put on the judge's uniform.

2166
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,370
Hey.

2167
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:35,480
My goodness.

2168
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,610
I can't believe it.

2169
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,940
My stomach hurts
from laughing too hard.

2170
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,520
This is hilarious.

2171
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,720
This is driving me crazy.

2172
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:43,060
- Okay.
- Look at Kyung-hwan.

2173
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:44,120
Look at Kyung-hwan.

2174
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,360
- Kyung-hwan is jealous.
- He is jealous.

2175
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:47,230
- Suk Jin.
- He wants to be a judge.

2176
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:48,490
(I want the spotlight
and screen time.)

2177
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:51,560
- Rules are rules.
- You should take off the cap.

2178
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,730
It's none of your business.

2179
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:53,990
(Forget it.)

2180
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:57,440
- What's wrong with you?
- I was being considerate.

2181
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,140
When you are done changing,
sit by my side.

2182
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:02,030
- Is he out of the picture?
- He's going off-screen?

2183
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,310
He'll help me with the shoot.

2184
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,150
Why do I need to sit here?
Do I get no screen time now?

2185
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:09,240
You fit in right where you are.

2186
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:11,940
- Be quiet.
- He doesn't look out of place.

2187
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:15,150
That outfit suits you better.

2188
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:18,280
Haha, how much time will you invest?

2189
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,260
I will go all in.

2190
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,320
- You will go all in.
- How much time is that?

2191
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,800
I can't say.

2192
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,440
Let's go!

2193
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,270
(In the best-case scenario,
he will get about 63 minutes.)

2194
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:34,370
(In the worst-case scenario,
he will become the 2nd judge.)

2195
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:37,550
(What will be the result?)

2196
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,940
- Steal the invested time...
- From the top one.

2197
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,180
Steal 20 minutes and
the invested time from the top 1.

2198
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,390
- Okay!
- That's good.

2199
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:46,150
Who is the top one?

2200
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,650
Will you reveal who the top one is?

2201
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,910
How much time did you have?

2202
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:50,230
Not much.

2203
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:51,690
(Haha gets 51 minutes and 46 seconds
from Kyung-hwan.)

2204
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:53,600
Everyone is getting a good one.

2205
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,600
Everyone is getting a good one.

2206
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,800
(He talks to himself.)

2207
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,990
(He glances
at the producer and the writer.)

2208
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,940
I'm sitting here as a staff member,
but they're whispering.

2209
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,900
I can't hear them.

2210
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:10,030
Wouldn't a banner be better?

2211
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:12,200
This is work.

2212
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,310
Go, Jong Kook.

2213
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:15,810
I'll do 30 minutes.

2214
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,350
- 30 minutes?
- Yes.

2215
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,690
I'll go.

2216
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:19,910
(Jong Kook invests 30 minutes.)

2217
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,690
(He can earn 60 minutes at most
or lose 30.)

2218
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:25,360
(What is the result?)

2219
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,260
- It's a dud.
- What's the matter?

2220
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:29,930
It's a good one. Wait.

2221
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,620
"Steal 20 minutes and
the invested time from the top 1."

2222
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,690
For real?

2223
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,190
You can steal 50 minutes from top 1.

2224
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:37,640
(Han Na is currently top 1.)

2225
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,810
- Okay.
- If I were you...

2226
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:40,980
I...

2227
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:43,140
(How much time will Se Chan invest?)

2228
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:44,650
50 minutes.

2229
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,310
Somebody will join me.

2230
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:48,550
It's all-in.

2231
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,910
(He tries the roulette.)

2232
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,220
One will join me.

2233
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:56,410
- Come. Is it a dud?
- Dud.

2234
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,090
What is it?

2235
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,800
- Twice.
- Yes.

2236
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,490
- 50 then? Do I get 100?
- 100 minutes.

2237
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,600
(He becomes a time millionaire.)

2238
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,360
That changes everything.

2239
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:12,270
That should have been me.

2240
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,110
You would have gotten a dud.

2241
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,180
Judges, please move the roulette.

2242
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,050
- Come here.
- Hurry up.

2243
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:21,720
Hurry. Move it.

2244
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,110
We have him.

2245
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:25,050
We have another judge.

2246
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:27,220
- We only need 1 more person.
- We only need 1.

2247
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,760
He won't try, so be careful.

2248
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,520
He won't try.

2249
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,800
- It's heavy.
- You have to lift it.

2250
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,300
He's the oldest.

2251
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,360
Suk Jin.

2252
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,560
He's only doing it
because the camera's on.

2253
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,770
He's only doing it
because the camera's on.

2254
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:43,810
(The camera's on.)

2255
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:46,940
- I know.
- Why is the old guy doing this?

2256
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:51,510
He had fun for 2.5 hours,
so he's working hard.

2257
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:53,480
Oh, gosh.

2258
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,520
(Play then work, YOLO Suk Jin)

2259
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,410
First place could have changed.

2260
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,940
Maybe I'll win...

2261
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,590
by default.

2262
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:05,280
The last race is called
Time Expedition.

2263
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,520
(Countdown Race Final Mission:
Time Expedition)

2264
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:08,650
It's going to be
Name Tag Elimination.

2265
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:11,360
If you rip off the name tag of
someone who has less time than you,

2266
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,230
you get to steal half of their time.

2267
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,270
(If they have less time than you,
you steal half of their time.)

2268
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,200
If they have less time than you?

2269
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,400
If you rip off the name tag of
someone who has less time than you,

2270
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,270
you get to steal half of their time.

2271
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,900
If you accidentally rip off the name
tag of someone who has more time,

2272
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,850
then only you lose
half of your time.

2273
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:30,610
Hold on.

2274
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:33,520
This is an unbelievable twist.

2275
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,720
Even if I rip Jae Suk's name tag,
I only get 3 to 4 minutes.

2276
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,980
(It's even less than that, punk.)

2277
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,100
Wait up.

2278
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,320
- Everybody will come at me.
- Wait up.

2279
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,060
The piranhas will rip him apart.

2280
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,140
If you hold hands
with another member,

2281
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,690
your times get combined.

2282
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,230
(If you hold hands,
your times get combined.)

2283
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:55,570
If you hold hands?

2284
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:58,110
Let's say Jae Suk has 10 minutes,
and Jong Kook has 70.

2285
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:00,070
If they hold hands,
their times become 80 minutes.

2286
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,050
If they rip off So Min's name tag
who has 20 minutes left,

2287
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:04,650
they can steal half
of her 20 minutes.

2288
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:07,190
Each person will earn five minutes.

2289
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,780
If they rip off the name tag
of somebody who has 90 minutes left,

2290
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,280
Jae Suk and Jong Kook will lose...

2291
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,520
half of their respective
remaining times.

2292
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,690
Once you let go
of each other's hands,

2293
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,320
you become weak again.

2294
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:20,300
I have to be fast.

2295
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:24,640
Let's say I have 11 minutes,
and Jae Suk has 10.

2296
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,810
I try to rip off his name tag,
but we accidentally hold hands.

2297
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:29,730
- Then you lose.
- Even if it's for a moment?

2298
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:30,940
- Correct.
- Okay.

2299
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,110
People will betray each other.

2300
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:37,940
It'll be a mess. You'll hold hands
and let go. This sounds fun.

2301
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:40,910
This sounds fun.

2302
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,390
- Suk Jin.
- Why is the judge talking?

2303
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,230
- Don't pay attention.
- What's wrong with him?

2304
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:47,320
- Sir.
- Don't pay attention.

2305
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,860
You were so loud.
How can we not pay attention?

2306
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:51,800
Don't pay attention.
I really want to play.

2307
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:54,800
- What am I supposed to do?
- You lost all your time.

2308
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,640
You don't get eliminated
when somebody takes your name tag.

2309
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,440
You only get eliminated
when your time runs out.

2310
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,530
The race is over when
there's one last person standing.

2311
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,310
Your name tags are hidden
inside this building.

2312
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:06,680
If you collect two name tags
of the same person,

2313
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,070
their remaining time gets revealed.

2314
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,150
If you collect
two of your own name tags,

2315
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:13,480
you earn an additional 10 minutes.

2316
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,650
- That's good.
- Inside the building is...

2317
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:17,780
also the special Room of Time.

2318
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:21,190
Room of Time opens without notice
at random locations,

2319
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,120
and only one person can use it.
It disappears after use.

2320
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,530
In order to use Room of Time,
you must pay...

2321
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,860
a third of your remaining time
as the admission fee.

2322
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,340
It's probably worth it though.

2323
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,070
Please move to
your starting locations.

2324
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:37,810
Your time won't run for now.

2325
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:41,150
Judge, please join us...

2326
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:44,410
(Is it time for
Judge Jee to step up?)

2327
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:46,650
and help us hide the name tags.

2328
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:50,060
(Help us hide the name tags.)

2329
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:53,020
- Tell us what happens later on.
- How cute.

2330
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,600
We're really curious
about that world. Let us know.

2331
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,990
- Let's get moving.
- Goodness.

2332
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,340
Han Na,
I'm going to remember this.

2333
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:04,060
(Judge Jee is hiding the name tags.)

2334
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:06,230
I'll put Jae Suk's name tag here.

2335
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:10,740
(Jae Suk laughed at him the most
for becoming a judge.)

2336
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,270
Jae Suk.

2337
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:13,740
(Take his name tag.)

2338
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:16,980
Han Na. This is a bonus.

2339
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,850
Here. Whoever sees it first
gets to take it.

2340
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:22,480
I'm done.

2341
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,260
Good luck, guys.

2342
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:25,890
(He hides the name tags
very poorly.)

2343
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:28,620
There are targets beneath me.

2344
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,860
I don't have to worry about
Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo or Jae Suk.

2345
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,800
The rest are tricky.

2346
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,360
I'm planning to...

2347
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,440
be loyal to Se Chan.

2348
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,530
I think Haha took...

2349
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:43,700
Han Na's time
because she was on top.

2350
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:46,870
Jong Kook probably stole
Kyung-hwan's time.

2351
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:51,280
There's a possibility
I might win by default.

2352
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:53,350
I'm either top 1 or 2.

2353
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:55,410
I'm sure
Kyung-hwan has more time than me.

2354
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,980
People on a similar level as me...

2355
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,620
are Han Na and Se Chan.

2356
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:06,270
Jong Kook probably has around
1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes.

2357
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:08,900
People know I have some time,

2358
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:12,030
so it won't be easy. Jae Suk first.

2359
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,640
Jae Suk...

2360
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,370
I don't know
if Jae Suk actually has no time.

2361
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,720
He was really nervous
during the strawberry game.

2362
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,050
(He can't be that nervous for real.)

2363
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:25,350
If he was serious, I would be
really disappointed in him.

2364
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,110
If that amateur side of him
was for real.

2365
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:30,060
(The amateur is still nervous.)

2366
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,520
Do you have a strategy?

2367
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:34,120
I have no strategy.

2368
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,560
I have to hold hands with somebody
before I die.

2369
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,430
I have to hold hands with Kwang Soo.

2370
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:47,400
- Start the race.
- I'm in trouble.

2371
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:51,200
I have no time to waste.

2372
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,810
(Jae Suk doesn't have much time.
Will there be a twist?)

2373
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:57,910
(Next week)

2374
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,410
(Room of Time is the key.)

2375
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:02,410
(They fight with honor
in the time war.)

2376
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:05,390
(The one who found Room of Time,
and the one who's about to avenge)

2377
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,650
(What will be the outcome
of this relentless time war?)

2378
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:09,730
(On one peaceful afternoon)

2379
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:12,320
(Shin Hae Sun
and Bae Jong Ok are here.)

2380
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,230
(Did they bring a catastrophe
with them?)

2381
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:20,110
(Why do they have
suspicious items in their cars?)

2382
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:22,810
(Jong Ok and Hae Sun incite
betrayal and conspiracy.)

2383
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:24,150
(And...)

2384
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:25,200
(100...)

2385
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,240
(lies)

2386
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:29,740
(There are numerous choices
for them.)

2387
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:33,590
(Regretful choices
and accumulating secrets!)

2388
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:36,860
(They run into traps
to test their luck.)

2389
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,860
(What is the cruel secret
that gets revealed at the end?)

2390
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:42,150
You betray.

2391
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:43,860
(Decide! Bag)
