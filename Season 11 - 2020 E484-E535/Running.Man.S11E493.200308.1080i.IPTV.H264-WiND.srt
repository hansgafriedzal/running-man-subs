1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,460
Ji Hyo.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,000
- She's ready to hit the slopes.
- Ji Hyo.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,170
- Come here.
- She's going to a bathhouse.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,840
- What are you talking about?
- Cavewoman Ji Hyo.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,400
- Come here.
- Come on here, Ji Hyo.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,730
Cavewoman Ji Hyo, come here.

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,280
You're precious...

10
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,640
in Running Man.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,170
Don't say things like that.

12
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,720
- That's too much.
- If it's strange, they can edit it.

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,580
- Ji Hyo would feel offended.
- Why would she?

14
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,150
Too much attention can
make her feel daunted.

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,650
- Right, Ji Hyo?
- Yes.

16
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,060
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo draws the line.)

17
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,560
He's getting criticized
from the beginning.

18
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,060
What did I do wrong?

19
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,160
- Hey, I just thought...
- What did I do?

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,460
you were an answering robot.

21
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,770
- "Yes."
- She sounds like a robot.

22
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,060
(I can't answer that question.)

23
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,030
- And today...
- Yes.

24
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,310
Last weekend,

25
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,030
something happened to Kwang Soo.

26
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,130
Kwang Soo is not here.

27
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,170
- There's unfortunate news.
- I feel bad for him.

28
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,640
Kwang Soo was in a car accident.

29
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,280
And he broke his ankle.

30
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,020
Unfortunately, he couldn't
join us in this show today.

31
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,460
That's right.

32
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,820
He needs to have surgery.

33
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,660
He called me a lot.

34
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,550
He said, "I'm going
to the bathroom now."

35
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,560
- I guess he felt bad.
- I know.

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,860
Suk Jin also broke...

37
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,530
his ankle before.

38
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,660
When? On a TV show?

39
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,210
- It was in the early 2000s.
- A metal pin...

40
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,360
But there were
no articles about it.

41
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,640
Was it newspaper back then?

42
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,330
- But...
- No one knew about it.

43
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,970
- There were articles about it.
- Newspaper?

44
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,250
- There were articles.
- Really?

45
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,140
In some kind of tabloid.

46
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,880
(He's a living modern heritage.)

47
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,940
- There were articles.
- He was called Comedian A.

48
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,780
Hey, it's not like I did
something wrong.

49
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,220
While he was shooting a show...

50
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,020
(He sounds like an old man.)

51
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,920
We hope Kwang Soo will get better
soon. It will take a while though.

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,190
- Please don't worry about him.
- Kwang Soo will be back soon...

53
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,920
- Yes.
- with a bright smile.

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,440
And we have Cavewoman Ji Hyo
who lives under a rock.

55
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,740
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo is
her new popular character.)

56
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,470
- She's popular.
- She's really popular these days.

57
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,830
- Right.
- Me?

58
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,440
- Am I popular?
- Cavewoman Ji Hyo.

59
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,580
- Don't you go on the Internet?
- Hasn't anyone mentioned it to you?

60
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,250
- I had no idea.
- She doesn't even know it.

61
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,750
She doesn't know it either.
I guess she does live under a rock.

62
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,250
Look at her outfit today.

63
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,310
That's what Kim Hye Soo used to wear
in the drama, "One of a Pair."

64
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,990
- "One of a Pair"?
- That's not true.

65
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,290
- It sounds like she's an old woman.
- That's a very old drama.

66
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,460
I was going to say that.

67
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,960
This was popular at ski resorts
back in the 90s.

68
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,670
- That's not true.
- The headband.

69
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,390
It looks really old.

70
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,040
Good. Even her fashion is getting
far from the trend.

71
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,710
Her wall is getting higher.

72
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,240
Good. I like that.

73
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,110
- It's "newtro."
- She lives under a rock.

74
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,050
- Ji Hyo.
- "Newtro"?

75
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,710
Good. I like her new character.

76
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,140
Let me introduce today's guests
who will join you today.

77
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,680
- Okay.
- Please come on out.

78
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,020
(Who are they?)

79
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,360
Please come on out.

80
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,830
- Today... My gosh.
- Who are they?

81
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,150
- Hello.
- Hello.

82
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,920
This is amazing.

83
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,830
(Kang Tae Oh, Lee Na Eun, Yura)

84
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,960
- Yura.
- It's Yura.

85
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,570
(Yura was a member of Girl's Day
with sexy charm.)

86
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,740
(Now she's back as an actress.)

87
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,640
(Na Eun is
the pretty center of April.)

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,890
(And she turned into an actress
being loved by teenagers.)

89
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,260
(A monstrous actor
with charisma, Kang Tae Oh)

90
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,200
(He showed off his poppin dance
in Episode 483.)

91
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,150
(He's a new all-around player
for variety shows.)

92
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,300
(Kang Tae Oh)

93
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,670
He's good.

94
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,570
(Yura, Na Eun, and Tae Oh
are here in Running Man.)

95
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,210
Yura, you haven't changed.

96
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,900
Thank you for coming here today.

97
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,270
- Tae Oh.
- He's here again.

98
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,550
- Tae Oh.
- Nice to see you.

99
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,740
Come here to the middle.

100
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,080
- It's Na Hee.
- Hey, Na Hee.

101
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,920
Na Hee, come here.

102
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,020
(She took 5th place with her
powerful voice in "Miss Trot".)

103
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,890
They all are very popular
these days.

104
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,550
- This is amazing.
- That's right.

105
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,020
Yura. Gosh, Yura.

106
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,120
- Yura.
- What about me?

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,570
You've become prettier.

108
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,040
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,540
- I knew it.
- Look at her fashion. It's modern.

110
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,070
- Modern?
- Did you say modern?

111
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,540
- It looks modern.
- Why would you say that?

112
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,050
Ji Hyo would feel
embarrassed to hear that.

113
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,870
Stand next to me.
Then you'll look modern.

114
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,340
It looks like
she's from 20 years ago.

115
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,210
Ji Hyo, you look like a bandit
from a distance.

116
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,150
Ji Hyo.

117
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,520
- You need a big chunk of meat.
- "Chunk of meat".

118
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,760
So...

119
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,560
I'm sorry.

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
Suk Jin is not feeling good today.

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,200
- That's right.
- You will have a hard time.

122
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,570
Are you putting too much energy
into your personal broadcasting?

123
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,960
- That's not true.
- Are you sure?

124
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,830
- Yes.
- Tell us how you've been doing.

125
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,400
Well...

126
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,270
I've been getting some rest.

127
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,580
- The whole time?
- I got some rest.

128
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,250
And I had some time
for self-improvement.

129
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,270
Self-improvement?

130
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,340
What did you do
for self-improvement?

131
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,020
- What did you do?
- Actually,

132
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,450
it means...

133
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,650
she stayed at home.

134
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,560
What did you do
for self-improvement?

135
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,960
For example, I studied English.

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,890
- Say something in English.
- No, I can't.

137
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,390
- Hey, Suk Jin.
- What?

138
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,460
She's just getting back...

139
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
to appearing on TV shows
after a long time.

140
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,530
And you ask her to speak in English?

141
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,870
She said she studied
English at home.

142
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,400
- That's too much.
- Hey, I'm just...

143
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,080
trying to spice things up
to make it fun.

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,730
(It more fun this way.)

145
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,380
Spice things up?

146
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,540
But you're not doing it right.

147
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,950
Why are you cursing at me?

148
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,950
He's become rough.

149
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,840
- He has a temper.
- I know.

150
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,580
He's changed
since he started his own channel.

151
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,480
- I'm very disappointed.
- Why?

152
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,220
I thought he never got mad.

153
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,760
I don't have a temper.

154
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,190
- Seriously...
- I'm smiling now.

155
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,430
- I'm not upset.
- You're throwing a tantrum.

156
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,930
I'm not throwing
a tantrum, you punk.

157
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,440
- He lost his temper again.
- I'm smiling now.

158
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,640
- You do sound upset now.
- No, I'm not.

159
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,460
(I'm not upset.)

160
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,370
Next, we have Na Eun here.

161
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,730
(She's a good singer and actress,
Na Eun of April.)

162
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,040
Na Eun is...

163
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,620
- the host of "Inkigayo."
- She's really good.

164
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,910
She's been in many famous TV shows.

165
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,020
"Inkigayo"?

166
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,690
Oh, that's right.

167
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,580
- That's right.
- I used to host "Inkigayo" too.

168
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,620
Did you do that?

169
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,690
(Ji Hyo was the host of "Inkigayo"
from 2007 to 2008.)

170
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,930
Hee Chul.

171
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,850
"Music Core"... I mean...

172
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,700
(Did she say "Music Core" in SBS?)

173
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,730
It's Inkigayo.

174
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,330
- How does it feel...
- Inkigayo!

175
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,460
(She zoned out there too.)

176
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,330
- She hosted "Inkigayo."
- I see.

177
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,880
Are you sure it wasn't "Best 20"?

178
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,880
Wasn't it "Gayo Top 10"?

179
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,270
- I thought it was "Gayo Top 10."
- That's what Jong Kook did.

180
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,540
Jong Kook did it?

181
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,120
I used to appear in "Gayo Top 10."

182
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,890
He was in the show.

183
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,750
I'm in the picture the cast
took together on the last day.

184
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,850
Really?

185
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,260
- With Son Beom Soo?
- Son Beom Soo?

186
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,720
(He was in the last episode of
"Gayo Top 10" with Beom Soo.)

187
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,220
He's really old.

188
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,090
(Turbo was a 1st place nominee
in the last episode.)

189
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,440
(Gayo Top 10, Final Results)

190
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,770
(Unfortunately, Turbo couldn't
take 1st place in the last episode.)

191
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,830
(Depressed)

192
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,010
I still remember the last episode.

193
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,080
That's amazing.

194
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,270
Next up is Tae Oh.

195
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,620
He's our friend.

196
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,120
- It's Tae Oh.
- Tae Oh...

197
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,890
- is a good dancer.
- His dance.

198
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,190
He danced with his neck.

199
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,620
That was great.

200
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,320
I heard Tae Oh...

201
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,690
- prepared something upgraded.
- Really?

202
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,190
- Did you prepare something?
- Let's watch it together.

203
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,350
I feel a lot of pressure.

204
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,090
- He did this.
- I'm a big fan.

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,130
Show us the dance.

206
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,570
Right.

207
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,000
He was really good back then.

208
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,440
<i>- Catallena</i>
- Good.

209
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,830
(He warms up himself
with extraordinary moves.)

210
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,880
- Look at that.
- Start it.

211
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,140
Let's go.

212
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,310
(It begins now.)

213
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,040
My gosh.

214
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,910
That's good.

215
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,320
(Face poppin)

216
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,080
- What is he doing?
- Push it harder.

217
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,520
(Crumpling his face)

218
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,330
What's that? What are you doing?

219
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,500
What's that?
What kind of dance is it?

220
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,640
(They've never seen
dance moves like that before.)

221
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,600
(Then he starts doing
his signature dance.)

222
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,210
(Creaking)

223
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,010
(They all burst into laughter
watching him dance.)

224
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,600
That was nice.

225
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,910
I liked it.

226
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,480
- Gosh, it was...
- That was nice.

227
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,710
- I liked it.
- That's new.

228
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,580
- How does he do that?
- It's like a pantomime.

229
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,760
Gosh, it was...

230
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,190
- That was nice.
- Seriously,

231
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,260
entertainers like us should
reflect on ourselves.

232
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,150
- It was like a pantomime.
- It's like a pantomime.

233
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,070
I think he's a good replacement
for Kwang Soo.

234
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,230
(They have the same jaw.)

235
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,770
He's too handsome
to replace Kwang Soo.

236
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,160
That's true. He's too handsome.

237
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,210
That's right. He's good-looking.

238
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,050
Next up is Na Hee.

239
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,420
(Singer-comedian Na Hee
took 5th place in "Miss Trot.")

240
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,280
She's been working
with her mini-album.

241
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,550
We should hear her sing.

242
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,550
- Na Hee, please sing for us.
- Go ahead and sing.

243
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,190
- Shout it out.
- Show us.

244
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,380
I need you to respond to me.

245
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,660
("Fox and Wolf" by Kim Na Hee)

246
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,330
(Singing)

247
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,090
Sing with me!

248
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,200
<i>I will only love you</i>

249
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,000
(She fascinates everyone
making heart shapes.)

250
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,100
(She's good.)

251
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,500
She makes unique gestures.

252
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,550
(Her gestures steal
the hearts of the audience.)

253
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,650
(I will love you)

254
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

255
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,690
She sings so well.

256
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,610
I couldn't help but notice
that she keeps making heart shapes.

257
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,620
- I do it without thinking.
- I see.

258
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,900
She turns her wrist like this.

259
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,590
Jae Suk, that's an L.

260
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,800
It's an L.

261
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,800
- Jae Suk.
- It's not a heart.

262
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,990
What is this?

263
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,200
(Flustered)

264
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,540
You just did this.

265
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,000
What is this?

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,830
You're not feeling very well today,
so just keep quiet.

267
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,000
(You're not feeling
very well today, remember?)

268
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,810
He told Suk Jin to stay quiet.

269
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,280
"You're not feeling well,
so just stay quiet."

270
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,510
Why are you being like that?

271
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,580
- You should rest.
- All I did was this.

272
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,980
He's trying to fill
Kwang Soo's absence.

273
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,290
Before we start the race,

274
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,190
we will pair up with a partner.

275
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,750
- Is it a couple race?
- 2, 4, and 5.

276
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,400
So there will be one man left.

277
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,090
- I know.
- There will be one man left.

278
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,090
You will decide your partner
with Dice of Love.

279
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,100
The six male members
will line up in order,

280
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,040
and the five female members
will throw the dice in turn.

281
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,840
And they will become a couple
with a man with the same number.

282
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,580
- I see.
- Okay.

283
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,110
- We should be careful lining up.
- So this is a random game.

284
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,840
- Please roll the dice now.
- Who should go first then?

285
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,380
- Should we go by age?
- Just stay still.

286
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,220
- Don't try to do anything.
- The men should line up.

287
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,030
The men should stand in line.

288
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,330
Let's play the rock-paper-scissors
and decide the order.

289
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,460
- Good.
- In order of good looks.

290
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,590
In order of good looks?

291
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,730
Ji Hyo wants you to stand
in order of good looks.

292
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,910
In order of good looks?

293
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,630
Then Tae Oh is in the right place.

294
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,100
- That's right.
- Jae Suk, come over here.

295
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,210
- This is about right.
- Come here.

296
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,600
- This is close.
- Jae Suk.

297
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,950
- It's about right.
- Come here.

298
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,450
- This is good.
- You should come.

299
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,010
We all are similar.

300
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,370
Let me judge it with a cool head.

301
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,010
- Jong Kook, move ahead.
- It's okay.

302
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,480
- Just go.
- Right.

303
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,240
Why are we doing this?

304
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
Why are you being like this to me?

305
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,830
- What did I do?
- Come here.

306
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,250
You should go over there.

307
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,430
- This is ridiculous.
- Just go.

308
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,850
- Gosh, you...
- Jae Suk.

309
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,360
Se Chan, say something.

310
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,130
- You should go backward.
- You can't be here.

311
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,170
(Move over, Jae Suk.)

312
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,630
You should go over there.

313
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,670
- Gosh.
- Move over, Suk Jin.

314
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,970
You two should be over there.

315
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,100
I can't believe this.

316
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,340
- All right. It's okay.
- This is right.

317
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,210
This is disappointing.

318
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,710
- Let me throw it.
- I have no choice.

319
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,980
1, 2, and 3.

320
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,060
(Which male member
will be Ji Hyo's partner?)

321
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,220
Number five.

322
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,800
(Number 5 is...)

323
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,090
It's Suk Jin.

324
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,700
- You picked a good one.
- Go to her.

325
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,260
You two look like a couple.

326
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,310
Did you see Suk Jin's face?

327
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,910
Since Ji Hyo picked him...

328
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,440
(Clenching his teeth)

329
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,310
- He's really funny.
- That's great.

330
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,600
- All right.
- You two look good together.

331
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,210
- It's Na Hee's turn.
- Na Hee.

332
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,920
- I'm number three.
- There's no number five.

333
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,580
- It's six.
- Jae Suk.

334
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,460
I'm Na Hee's partner.

335
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,580
- Jae Suk.
- This was apart.

336
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,220
Na Hee and I are a couple.

337
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,080
- Here I go.
- Okay.

338
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,900
(Who will be a couple with Yura?)

339
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,730
- Number 4.
- Number 4.

340
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,760
(Se Chan is picked.)

341
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,180
(Smiling broadly)

342
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,680
Se Chan is excited.

343
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,230
I guess Se Chan feels
comfortable around her.

344
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,840
(Frustrated)

345
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,470
So Min is upset,
but she's holding back her anger.

346
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,610
That's not it. Please...

347
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,420
I hope it will be number one.

348
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,880
Number one?

349
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,950
Okay. Number one.

350
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,320
Let's do this. They are numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

351
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,690
- Number 1 to 6.
- So you're number 1 or 4.

352
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,090
- Number 4 is also Tae Oh.
- Pick 1 or 4.

353
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,090
Please.

354
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,170
Number four.

355
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,070
(As So Min wishes,)

356
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,500
(will she pick 1 or 4
and become a couple with Tae Oh?)

357
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,260
Please.

358
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,710
Number four.

359
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,540
(Number 1)

360
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,150
(It's a party.)

361
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,150
She's really happy.

362
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,280
- This is fate.
- How did this happen?

363
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,110
That's amazing.

364
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,160
(Why is he dancing?)

365
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,030
Se Chan is pretending to like it.
Did you see that?

366
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,700
(He's caught.)

367
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,330
- I saw it.
- Did you?

368
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,530
- You saw that, right?
- He was dancing like this.

369
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,700
- That's not what he usually does.
- It's strange.

370
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,090
Stop it.

371
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,710
(She's just happy.)

372
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,080
All right. Jong Kook is...

373
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,870
- numbers 1, 3, or 5.
- Odd numbers.

374
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,870
- Odd numbers and even numbers.
- Haha is...

375
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,050
numbers 2, 4, or 6.

376
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,610
(Na Eun is the last female number.)

377
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,660
(Na Eun's choice will decide
who will go solo.)

378
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,930
Where is it going?

379
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,090
(Who will go solo?
Is it Jong Kook or Haha?)

380
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,490
One of them will be left alone.

381
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,830
One of them will be left alone.

382
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,630
Gosh, where is it going?

383
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,990
- Gosh, this is...
- What's the number?

384
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,170
- It's 3.
- 3!

385
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,540
(It's number 3.)

386
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,600
Number three.

387
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,180
It's Jong Kook.

388
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,130
(That means Haha is going solo.)

389
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,740
Haha is alone.

390
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,810
I wish Kwang Soo was here.

391
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,240
Haha is alone.

392
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,050
He likes it.

393
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,980
Okay.

394
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,980
I'm so unlucky.

395
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,060
(I'm so unlucky.)

396
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,210
I have no luck.

397
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,190
Nothing goes as I intended.

398
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,460
(They are done
picking their partners.)

399
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,400
(Couples)

400
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,530
Today, you will throw the dice,
and the number you get...

401
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,630
will decide prize or punishment.

402
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,860
It's Indoor Special Part 3:
Throw Double or Nothing.

403
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,860
I like things like this.

404
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,500
Three couples will win 20 dollars
each in each round.

405
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,580
After each round ends,
all couples get a chance...

406
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,110
to throw dice
and win additional prize money.

407
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,210
Really?

408
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,320
What is that?

409
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,610
Repeated numbers
eliminate the couples.

410
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,750
Repeated numbers or one
eliminate the couples.

411
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,330
Each couple will
roll the dice in turn.

412
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,460
If you meet the condition,
you will get prize money.

413
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,900
If you don't meet the condition,
you will be eliminated.

414
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,590
If you meet the condition
and survive,

415
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,460
you can decide whether
to continue or to stop.

416
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,200
If you choose to stop, it's over
with the prize money you win.

417
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,960
If you choose to continue,
you can try the next step.

418
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,500
If you succeed,
you will get prize money.

419
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,540
And if you fail, you will lose
all the prize money you've saved.

420
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,180
(If they fail, they will lose
all the prize money they've saved.)

421
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,580
The couple with the largest amount
of money will get a prize.

422
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,650
And the ones with the lowest amount
of money will suffer a penalty.

423
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,580
(The last 2 couples
will receive penalties.)

424
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,320
First, let's divide the team
into groups of 6 and 5.

425
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,580
Na Eun.

426
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,190
- Haha.
- Thanks.

427
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,830
You'll be teamed up
with the same colors.

428
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,960
- Red?
- Oh, no.

429
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,160
- Blue.
- Blue.

430
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,200
- Okay!
- Okay!

431
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,130
- We're too weak.
- I love this team.

432
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,670
- We're in trouble.
- I love this.

433
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,070
For the first mission,

434
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,360
you'll need to find your opponents
without laughing.

435
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,370
It's called
Don't Laugh Hide-and-Seek.

436
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,180
This must be one of those
"don't laugh" games.

437
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,470
The defending team of six
will get a makeover...

438
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,740
and hide within five minutes.

439
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,610
The other team...

440
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,050
will have to find them
in the given time.

441
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,610
If you smile or cry
once the game starts,

442
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,010
you'll be eliminated.

443
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,380
Both teams will take turns.

444
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,350
The team that finds
the most opposing members...

445
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,430
wins.

446
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,200
Please change
into your uniforms now.

447
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,490
- Let's go.
- Okay.

448
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,490
- Do we have to wear these vests?
- Yes, you have to wear it inside.

449
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,670
Why did we come in this way?

450
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Sure.

451
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,470
(She hands her jacket to him.)

452
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,650
Everyone likes to hand
their clothes to me.

453
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,580
It's as if I'm a hanger.

454
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,580
(Let's find out.)

455
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,460
(She naturally handed it over
to him.)

456
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,660
(They gave it to him.)

457
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,030
I've carried as many as seven items.

458
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,800
I have.

459
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,300
She must've done it often.
It was natural.

460
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,860
- You seemed like her butler.
- Right?

461
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,700
It was natural for both of us.

462
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,070
(You make me feel comfortable.)

463
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,670
Will we get full makeovers?

464
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,440
- Will the attacking team...
- The defending team.

465
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,810
Right. All of them?

466
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,910
What should I do?

467
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,310
There are many options.

468
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,680
What could be funny?

469
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,550
I think that headband
would be funny.

470
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,390
(It would be hilarious for sure.)

471
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,960
You wouldn't need to do anything,
and they'd all laugh.

472
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,720
The first mission is called...

473
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,400
Offense and Defense
Don't Laugh Hide-and-Seek.

474
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,460
"Don't Laugh".

475
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,370
It's easy. It's just hide-and-seek.

476
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,100
The defending team will hide.
The attacking team will be given...

477
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,030
20 minutes to find them as couples.
They will have to touch them.

478
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,440
However, if the attacking team
laughs while seeking them,

479
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,770
they'll be eliminated.

480
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,470
Even if one partner laughs,
both of you will be eliminated.

481
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,150
After that, the next couple will go.

482
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,740
The couple who finds
the most members wins.

483
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,120
If you find all of them,
we'll give you five extra points.

484
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,010
- Do you laugh easily?
- I really do.

485
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,090
You do?

486
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,520
(She answers cheerfully.)

487
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,200
That's not good.

488
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
- You can't be like that.
- You're giving me hope, Na Eun.

489
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,670
Pick which team will go first.
Who will hide first?

490
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,100
We'll look for you guys first.

491
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,110
- You will?
- Okay.

492
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,800
- We'll be the attacking team.
- Okay.

493
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,680
I think it'll be wiser
to make them laugh first.

494
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,240
- Right?
- Team Blue will hide first.

495
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,680
Go on.

496
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,540
Instead of trying to make
your disguise look funny,

497
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,350
you should make the situation funny.

498
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,210
How about this?

499
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,780
They open a cabinet,

500
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,360
and Se Chan and I
are kissing inside.

501
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,390
Yes.

502
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,320
(That was an unexpected idea.)

503
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,760
- What do you mean?
- Yes.

504
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,290
- That would be hilarious.
- That would be.

505
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,060
That's funnier than getting
a funny makeover.

506
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,730
- I told you.
- Imagine them opening the door...

507
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,530
You'll look like a couple.

508
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,000
- Go over there.
- Hey.

509
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,800
- You'll look like a couple.
- You don't think Haha will laugh?

510
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,970
Of course, he will.

511
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,000
You need to make them laugh.

512
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,070
(They arrive at the dressing room.)

513
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,890
(There are various tools.)

514
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,210
(What kinds of makeovers
will they get?)

515
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,360
Which class are you in?

516
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,050
- Class of 28.
- I see.

517
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,520
- What about you?
- Class of 10.

518
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,050
"Class of 10"?

519
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,990
(He's like an aged junior.)

520
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,560
- You?
- Class of 07.

521
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,720
He's my senior.

522
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,290
He's pretty much your grandpa.

523
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,290
No. He's...

524
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,100
- I'm much higher than him.
- Don't be absurd.

525
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,000
We knew each other
before we even debuted.

526
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,110
- That's irrelevant.
- This punk knew me beforehand.

527
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,410
So... You shouldn't address me
like that.

528
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,970
- I'm sorry.
- This is a public place.

529
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,120
- I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't say that.

530
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,620
I'm sorry for making you
feel uncomfortable.

531
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,770
When I was a newbie,

532
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,450
my seniors had
a misunderstanding about me.

533
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,190
- Why?
- They said I wasn't polite.

534
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,810
How did you greet them?

535
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,360
- This is how newbies say hi.
- It's like this.

536
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
- "Hello!"
- "Hello."

537
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,130
- I couldn't do that.
- You didn't have to shout.

538
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,520
"Hello." They were like this.

539
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,790
- "I'm fine." But he did this.
- But I...

540
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,130
"Hello."

541
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,760
(This was back when
he was a newbie.)

542
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,910
"Hello. Oh, hello."

543
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,910
They thought I was being impudent.

544
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,850
(Team Blue is getting dressed up.)

545
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,650
(What?)

546
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,740
(Is he coloring his lips
with a marker?)

547
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,780
Will this wash off?

548
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,660
- What are you doing?
- Will this?

549
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,720
Why are you coloring your lips
with that? We have lipstick.

550
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,990
- You do?
- Yes. Here you go.

551
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,020
(He's so clumsy.)

552
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,960
There's a variety of things.

553
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,440
(Yura is fascinated with the wigs.)

554
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,110
You'd look hilarious with that on.

555
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,840
- This isn't easy.
- What is that?

556
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,070
- Pippi Longstocking.
- Wear this.

557
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,500
- What's that? Should I?
- Yes.

558
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,210
- I think it's too small for you.
- We need to color our faces.

559
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,210
- Right?
- We need to color our faces.

560
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,210
(He's transformed.)

561
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,050
(Na Eun collapses
after seeing such a unique sight...)

562
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,520
(for the first time.)

563
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,720
Do I look funny?

564
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,460
- She really does laugh a lot.
- It's gone.

565
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,260
- What should I do?
- What should I do? It's so funny.

566
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,100
I think I'd laugh if, for example,

567
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,370
Na Eun went through so much
to look funny.

568
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,940
That would make me laugh.

569
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,180
We have only Ji Hyo to rely on.

570
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,310
We trust you.

571
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,620
(Sighing)

572
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,780
(Sighing)

573
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,750
- What's wrong?
- That's the first thing...

574
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,860
you said here.

575
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,900
You'd look hilarious just smoking.

576
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,100
(He tries to frame her.)

577
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,030
(Do they really joke around
like this?)

578
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,760
That would be perfect.

579
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,800
I'll wear that headband
and cross my legs.

580
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,030
(She plays along with it.)

581
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,530
- I bet they'll all laugh.
- That'd be hilarious.

582
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,770
"Come here."

583
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,420
So Min looks amazing. I knew it.

584
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,950
- What is that?
- It better be funny.

585
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,620
- Hold on.
- It better be.

586
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,810
I trust Se Chan.
You better make me look funny.

587
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,920
What is she?

588
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,250
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

589
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,890
Why did she do that?

590
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,020
- It's not funny.
- I've only just begun.

591
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,870
(What is this?)

592
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,560
- Hey.
- You and I will be a team.

593
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
- I'll do the same.
- What is this? I don't look funny.

594
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,730
I need to use black now.

595
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,180
- So what in the world is she?
- What am I?

596
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,380
I'll make up one once I finish.

597
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,070
What?

598
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,510
(He's just doing it as he goes.)

599
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,350
- See? It's working.
- Come on.

600
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,040
- It's not even funny.
- Hold on.

601
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,750
- It's not funny.
- What is that?

602
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,810
No.

603
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,050
- No, So Min.
- What is this?

604
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,160
See? They're smirking.

605
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,630
Do we have no dresses?

606
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,700
- Give me the mirror.
- It'd look funny.

607
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,160
Am I done?

608
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,220
Hold on. We need to match.

609
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,490
(She's not happy anymore.)

610
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,030
What is this?

611
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,440
Look at our directors' faces.

612
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,880
They usually laugh a lot.

613
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
(Meanwhile...)

614
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,070
Don't I look funny?

615
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,740
Don't I?

616
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,800
(She's happy
with her first attempt.)

617
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,970
Do I not?

618
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,810
We'll be...

619
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,090
Okay? I'll give you a sign.

620
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,920
If we were going to do that,
this wasn't necessary.

621
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,020
- It's more fun this way.
- No, it's not.

622
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,630
- Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

623
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,490
- Look at us.
- Will you turn on some music?

624
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,990
- Isn't this nice?
- It is.

625
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,670
- It is, right?
- Yes.

626
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,820
You have one minute remaining.

627
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,530
We need to hide.

628
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,140
- Do we hide anywhere we want?
- Let's hide.

629
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,910
(Team Blue is done.)

630
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,210
(Now, they just need to hide.)

631
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,180
Excuse me, but do you mind
if I hid in here?

632
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
I'll hide here.

633
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,270
- Like this.
- I'll cover you up. Hold on.

634
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,350
Are you done? Here we go.

635
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,650
10,

636
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,420
9, 8,

637
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,250
7, 6,

638
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,690
5, 4,

639
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
three,

640
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,020
two,

641
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,790
one.

642
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,490
First couple, please come in.

643
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,220
- We'll go first.
- Since you guys laugh the most?

644
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,960
- Right.
- Good luck.

645
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,110
- We'll go first.
- Good luck.

646
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,110
Good luck.

647
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,440
Goodness, Na Hee.

648
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,470
(He's nervous already.)

649
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,030
I laugh so easily.

650
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,240
You smile easily as well.

651
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,300
This isn't good.

652
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,950
You smile all the time.

653
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,980
There aren't many places to hide.

654
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,350
How about in here?

655
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,750
- There are people working.
- I think they're in here.

656
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,750
There are people working.

657
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,200
(Na Eun is hiding under this desk.)

658
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,600
(She could get caught already.)

659
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Is someone in there?

660
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,560
How should I move?

661
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,670
(I can't get caught already.)

662
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,340
(Something smells fishy in here.)

663
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,670
(Suddenly,)

664
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,470
(they hear music.)

665
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,000
(Na Eun is safe.)

666
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,810
(They look for the source
of the music.)

667
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,950
Wait.

668
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,590
This music is already
making me laugh.

669
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,540
Hey.

670
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,010
- Na Hee, I'm about to laugh.
- Yes?

671
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,980
No. I'm going to hold it in.

672
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,090
I'll slap myself to keep it in.

673
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,600
(Why is the soundtrack
for "Ghost" playing?)

674
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:41,060
(This sexy music leads them...)

675
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,680
(to this couple suffering
from jaundice.)

676
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,210
I did expect something like this.

677
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,540
(They look very passionate.)

678
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,570
(He bursts out laughing.)

679
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,690
(He bursts out laughing,
and they fail.)

680
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,690
(Did they have to go this far?)

681
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,220
Are you seriously going
to be like this?

682
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,930
Na Hee, what should I do?

683
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,870
Goodness. I did expect something.

684
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,960
I did, but I couldn't hold back.

685
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,370
Are you serious?

686
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,500
- This is cheating.
- Are you serious?

687
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,060
(Their makeover was worth it.)

688
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,110
- You've failed!
- You guys...

689
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,500
- You may leave.
- Na Hee.

690
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,850
You can't tell the others.

691
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,150
- You can't let them know.
- Don't tell the others.

692
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,240
- Na Hee, don't tell the others.
- The music...

693
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,470
Goodness.

694
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,350
I started laughing
the moment I heard the music.

695
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,980
I predicted
something like this though.

696
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,420
Even if you didn't laugh...

697
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,750
- You would've?
- Yes.

698
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,720
My eyes were brimming with tears.

699
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,860
(After the storm...)

700
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,820
(comes a moment to reflect.)

701
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,760
Se Chan, tell Kwang Soo
to come back soon.

702
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,030
Kwang Soo.

703
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,030
- Kwang Soo...
- We're trying this hard.

704
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,110
- Hurry back.
- Come back to us.

705
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,380
I had to paint my face
because you weren't here.

706
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,910
You and I were supposed to do this,

707
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,240
but So Min had to take your place.

708
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,010
(They miss Kwang Soo
even more today.)

709
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:04,810
(They realize it was spring
only after the flowers withered.)

710
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,390
I'm sorry.

711
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,130
We miss you.

712
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,820
(Kwang Soo, we miss you.)

713
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,670
Is it over already for them?

714
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,720
Unbelievable.

715
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,930
- It's over?
- Seriously?

716
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,460
Are you kidding me?

717
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,000
You're laughing?

718
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,370
- After what you did?
- Why are you still laughing?

719
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,110
- Sorry.
- Unbelievable.

720
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,000
I predicted their move but...

721
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,850
But it was still funny.

722
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,310
You need to prepare yourselves.

723
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,010
Wait, hold on a second, Ji Hyo.

724
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,390
Slap each other.

725
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,390
(Desperate measures
for Suk Jin and Ji Hyo)

726
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,420
(Let's make each other angry.)

727
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,320
(Are you ready, Suk Jin?)

728
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,130
Hey.

729
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,630
Let's go!

730
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,020
(He bursts into laughter
thanks to his partner's support.)

731
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,370
Let's get going.

732
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,370
You made me laugh even more.

733
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,670
We only have 20 minutes.

734
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,730
Hold back your laughter.

735
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,000
- Let's hold our laughter.
- That was nice, Ji Hyo.

736
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,500
That was nice.

737
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,340
- Good job.
- Punch me in the stomach.

738
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,380
- Go on.
- For real?

739
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,500
- Make me furious.
- Furious?

740
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,540
I'm not kidding.

741
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,810
Hold your jacket open.

742
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,980
(Groaning)

743
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,620
(She hits him hard
in the lower abdomen.)

744
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,750
(Was I too harsh?)

745
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,630
You hit my bladder.

746
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,320
Na Hee never does anything
half-heartedly.

747
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,340
- She never does.
- Okay, I'm mad now.

748
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,100
- It's not her style.
- Thanks, Na Hee.

749
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,440
Sure thing. Good luck.

750
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,610
- Let's go!
- Go for it.

751
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,380
Are they hiding?

752
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,500
(They carefully search
for the other team.)

753
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,850
Are we supposed to find them?

754
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,810
I thought that someone would be
disguised as a member of the staff.

755
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,480
Isn't this someone?

756
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,690
- The staff...
- No?

757
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,590
No, he's actually a staff member.

758
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,930
Found him.

759
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,590
You startled me.

760
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,720
(They spot Jong Kook
behind the pillar.)

761
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Are you Annabelle?

762
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Found him.

763
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
(Peekaboo!)

764
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,990
(He turns away.)

765
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,030
I found him.

766
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,400
Suk Jin is out.

767
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,300
- What?
- Suk Jin is out.

768
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,260
Seriously?

769
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,640
You...

770
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,800
What on earth are you wearing?

771
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,420
- Isn't it adorable?
- I locked eyes with him.

772
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,740
Jong Kook caught me off guard.

773
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,460
(My baby, we did it.)

774
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,280
Haha, go ahead.

775
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,090
- Go on.
- Why can't you hold your laughter?

776
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,930
I guess you could hold it.

777
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,200
It's easier since I'm alone.

778
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,750
- Since you're alone...
- It's doable.

779
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,600
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck!

780
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,060
Find them all to win five points.

781
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,530
Hold on.
Why do I suddenly want to laugh?

782
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,140
Ji Hyo, slap me.

783
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,110
I can't hold my laughter.

784
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,610
- Have Na Hee do it.
- Not Ji Hyo.

785
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,470
Ji Hyo's slap will only
make you laugh.

786
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,210
- Didn't it make you angry?
- It did.

787
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,740
Then hit the back of my head.

788
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
- How?
- Make sure...

789
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,810
we all hear it loud and clear.

790
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,810
(Na Hee's good at
taking instructions.)

791
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,540
(Thump!)

792
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,540
(What?)

793
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,520
(His laughter is long gone.)

794
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,220
(She smacked him hard
like he wanted.)

795
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,720
You're angry, right?

796
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,360
- That's how Na Hee is.
- Get going.

797
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,820
My stomach...

798
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
Good luck.

799
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,400
It was like
she drove a hole through mine.

800
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,030
- Na Hee, good job.
- Was it your fist?

801
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,140
Good one. I loved it.

802
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,910
Na Hee's got the hang
of these comedy sketches now.

803
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,300
- Exactly.
- She knows how to make it work.

804
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,730
She's aware of the force
she should put in.

805
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,300
- Na Hee...
- You know how it should be done.

806
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
(Haha found Na Eun and Yura
without laughing.)

807
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,740
What did they find so hilarious?

808
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,740
(Haha found Na Eun and Yura
without laughing.)

809
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:23,210
(However, the yellow ghosts
made him burst out laughing.)

810
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,430
You two are crazy! My gosh.

811
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,930
I can't believe you two.

812
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
(Thanks to So Min and Se Chan,)

813
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,230
(Team Blue ends
their defense round.)

814
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,640
Unbelievable.

815
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,500
Na Eun only looks cute.

816
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,570
Na Eun, your disguise
only looks cute.

817
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,210
- But...
- I thought it was funny.

818
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,910
They all look cute, right?

819
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,570
I saw him and the doll.

820
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,350
That's when I couldn't
hold my laughter.

821
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,380
- The others...
- He didn't have to do anything.

822
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,710
- They all...
- Isn't it hilarious...

823
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,810
how the baby doll is smiling?

824
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,620
- It's smiling.
- My baby.

825
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,930
- This isn't an easy one.
- Tell me about it.

826
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,590
I was standing behind the pillar.

827
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,200
He was standing behind a pillar.

828
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,600
I turned towards him
and there he was.

829
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,670
- Right.
- Anyone would've laughed.

830
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,460
- Right.
- So where's Tae Oh?

831
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,500
- Tae Oh?
- Is he still hiding?

832
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,000
- Tae Oh...
- Did everyone forget about him?

833
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,940
- Did we forget about him?
- Is that it?

834
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,910
(Meanwhile, under the table
in the director's office)

835
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,610
(Why isn't anyone coming?)

836
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,950
I think it's over.

837
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,470
Is it?

838
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,740
You can come out now.

839
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,010
(The game ended
with him under the table.)

840
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,920
Is it our turn now?

841
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,390
- Let's go.
- You'll see.

842
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,980
- Listen.
- You'd better be ready.

843
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,320
- Sure.
- Make it good, okay?

844
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,130
- Here.
- Jae Suk...

845
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,720
Jae Suk!

846
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,930
- Jae Suk!
- What?

847
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,400
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

848
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,230
Dress up like Choi Young In.

849
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,560
(Choi Young In,
Director of Variety Department)

850
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,800
- Director Choi?
- She's in her office.

851
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,180
- Got it.
- Sounds fun.

852
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,210
- I'll...
- It sounds like fun.

853
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,000
I'll dress up like Director Choi.

854
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,110
- It'll be hilarious.
- Borrow her glasses.

855
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,110
That'll be funny.

856
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,180
Director Choi.

857
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,070
- That's all you have to do.
- Director Choi.

858
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,210
You look exactly like her!

859
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,980
- Here you go.
- That's the best.

860
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,090
Borrow her glasses.

861
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,430
Would she lend me those?

862
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,460
(He heads out to borrow
her glasses and clothes.)

863
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,660
(Meanwhile, Team Blue...)

864
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,860
That's cute.

865
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,870
(Jong Kook is in love
with his baby.)

866
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,840
Look at how Jong Kook
doting on the baby.

867
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,910
I'll play with kids really well.
I never get exhausted.

868
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,610
The kids will get exhausted instead.

869
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,180
I should think about
having a kid of my own.

870
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,000
Kwang Soo's not here,
so I should step up.

871
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,920
How? Yes, go for it.

872
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,510
(The others are working
on their disguise.)

873
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,150
Ji Hyo's hilarious.

874
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,980
She is of an acting background.

875
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,980
(They make the final touches.)

876
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,480
I've tried everything else.

877
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,720
How hilarious.

878
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,130
Those who don't easily laugh
should go last.

879
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,320
Tae Oh and Jong Kook.

880
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,290
- Sure.
- Jong Kook,

881
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,900
are you taking the baby with you?
If you do, I'll laugh.

882
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,210
I'll leave it behind.

883
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,000
- Its eyebrows.
- You're worried...

884
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,640
that I'll make you laugh, right?

885
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,070
I was thinking
about taking it with me.

886
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,740
- Please don't.
- No?

887
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,540
It's too hilarious.

888
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,880
Are you all hidden?
Let's begin the game.

889
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,810
5, 4...

890
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,920
(The members of Team Red
are scattered.)

891
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Three...

892
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,010
(Will they be able
to successfully play defense?)

893
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,020
Two...

894
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,360
(Director Choi was absent,
so Jae Suk changed his disguise.)

895
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,550
One. The first couple can enter.

896
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,720
- We'll set the tone.
- Sure.

897
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,930
Right, show them how it's done.

898
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,730
We'll go next. You and Na Eun...

899
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,370
- can be our last resort.
- Sure.

900
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,960
Hold on. Let me get ready.

901
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,560
Laugh right now then.

902
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,970
(Laughing)

903
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,350
You're the one
who's making me laugh.

904
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,540
- Right, just get it all out.
- Got it.

905
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,070
(Tae Oh and So Min seem unstable.)

906
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,850
Pinch me when I'm about to laugh.

907
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,920
Sure. Meanwhile, I won't laugh.

908
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,010
Okay, then stay a few steps
in front of me.

909
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,480
- Got it.
- All right.

910
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,490
I doubt they'll be hiding though.
They'd want to make us laugh.

911
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,020
(Where is everyone?)

912
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,320
Here.

913
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,230
(Lips are held tight.)

914
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,610
(Hello!)

915
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,710
(Running)

916
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,970
(The blue avatar boy loves to run.)

917
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,740
(They're close to laughing.)

918
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,620
(A U-turn)

919
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,360
(They're challenged once again.)

920
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,010
(Dashing)

921
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,190
(He loves to run.)

922
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,480
Tae Oh, touch him.

923
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,720
- Tag him.
- We have to tag him, right?

924
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,670
We have to. Get going.

925
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,020
Get over there and touch him.

926
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,140
(While the avatar boy
is at a halt...)

927
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,460
(So Min...)

928
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,110
(So Min tags Haha.)

929
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,410
(There are only 4 people left.)

930
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,070
- Did you do it?
- Yes. Let's go.

931
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,450
(They managed to get past Haha.)

932
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,850
(Lips are held tight.)

933
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,350
You said you don't laugh easily.

934
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,850
I've got a runny nose.

935
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,920
(He doesn't laugh,
but he has a runny nose?)

936
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,890
Gosh, Haha.

937
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,420
I was close to losing it.

938
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,720
Haha...

939
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,460
Wait. What's that?

940
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,630
(They suddenly hear a song playing.)

941
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,100
Someone's here. What are they doing?

942
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,930
(Isn't this "Any song" by ZICO?)

943
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,730
Someone's here. What are they doing?

944
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,710
Hold on.

945
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,730
(Hipster ZICO)

946
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,800
(The disgusting Big Nosed Suk Jin)

947
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,490
(Suk Jin starts to dance...)

948
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,440
(and someone joins him.)

949
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,490
(Ji Hyo steals the attention.)

950
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,990
(What on earth is that?)

951
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,130
You've got to be kidding me, Ji Hyo.

952
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,860
Ji Hyo, you got them!

953
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,630
(She keeps a straight face.)

954
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,010
(Fully satisfied)

955
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,610
Our plan worked!

956
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,900
How can you not laugh at this?

957
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,070
Gosh, Ji Hyo. What are you doing?

958
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,820
What's up with you today?

959
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,550
No way.

960
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,110
- Almost everyone will laugh.
- Ji Hyo...

961
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,650
Just look at Ji Hyo!

962
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,630
- No one can top this.
- Hold on.

963
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,820
Are you all right?

964
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,190
What's wrong?

965
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,590
What happened to you? Are you drunk?

966
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,860
What's with you?

967
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,530
So Min, Tae Oh, you're out.

968
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,990
You can't tell your teammates
about what you saw.

969
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,630
I could deal with Suk Jin,

970
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,610
- but Ji Hyo...
- That was our plan.

971
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,800
Haha's the one who got me.

972
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,400
(Please look forward
to his fine work.)

973
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,420
I almost cried when I saw Haha.
Wait, where's Jae Suk?

974
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,550
(Music suddenly plays.)

975
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,880
(Someone is waiting.)

976
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,380
(Where is this music coming from?)

977
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,530
Jae Suk must have
prepared something.

978
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,650
(Is it Jae Suk?)

979
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,220
(So Min bursts out laughing
right away.)

980
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,190
You can't play music. It's cheating.

981
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,090
(Jae Suk shows up
with the sweet song, "Y" playing.)

982
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,400
It's cheating!

983
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,240
It's definitely cheating.

984
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,840
It's cheating!

985
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,710
(Jae Suk gets into the groove.)

986
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,170
You can't use music!

987
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,280
(The half-man half-llama creature
walks down the runway.)

988
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,990
(Swaying)

989
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,380
(All his four legs move
to the rhythm elegantly.)

990
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,260
No, Ji Hyo was still funnier.

991
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,420
Ji Hyo was even funnier.

992
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,220
- No one could beat her.
- She was incredible.

993
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,420
(Immersed)

994
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,400
- What happened? You laughed, right?
- It was so funny.

995
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,130
Our team has no chance. It's over.

996
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,360
- Is it that bad?
- It's over.

997
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,610
- Are they stronger than us?
- Yes, they are.

998
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,880
Are they taking this seriously?

999
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,530
- Every one of them is hilarious.
- They are?

1000
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,710
Really?

1001
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
- The second couple,
- What should I do?

1002
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,380
please enter.

1003
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,440
- To be honest, I cried, Se Chan.
- Let me try.

1004
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,150
- We'll try.
- You can do this.

1005
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,190
You guys try.

1006
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,590
How funny can it be?

1007
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,280
We're angry right now.

1008
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
- I'm really annoyed
- Get angry.

1009
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,720
- Yang Se Hyeong!
- "Yang Se Hyeong"?

1010
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,590
- Did you say, "Yang Se Hyeong"?
- Isn't that your name?

1011
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,860
- Let's go.
- You're unknown.

1012
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,300
I'm unknown?

1013
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,400
(Angry)

1014
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,440
- Hey.
- Yuri!

1015
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,530
- "Yuri"?
- "Yuri"?

1016
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,280
- Go, Yuri.
- You're laughing?

1017
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,740
- Go, Yuri.
- You're laughing?

1018
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,880
- You shouldn't laugh.
- Go!

1019
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,380
- Stop laughing.
- She thinks that's funny?

1020
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,610
This is not good.

1021
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,820
She thinks that's funny?

1022
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,420
(We should never laugh.)

1023
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,760
I think I'll laugh at
the most basic things. We're ready.

1024
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,860
- Okay, go.
- Let's go.

1025
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,490
Stay close to me.

1026
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,550
(They see someone
as soon as they turn the corner.)

1027
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,590
Hold on.

1028
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Wait.

1029
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,530
(Someone is there!)

1030
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,570
What's that?

1031
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,690
(His position looks extraordinary.)

1032
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,090
Is that Haha?

1033
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,710
It's Haha.

1034
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,280
- I think I'll laugh.
- Hold it back.

1035
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,530
We have to hold it back.

1036
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,900
I thought they would all be
hiding somewhere.

1037
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,780
(Haha is ready to run.)

1038
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,070
What is he doing? He's going to run.

1039
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,380
(Peekaboo!)

1040
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,990
(The avatar marathoner
runs down the hallway.)

1041
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,990
(The 1st crisis)

1042
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,630
(Running)

1043
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,030
(Being too focused on looking funny,
Haha touches Yura by accident.)

1044
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,900
(He continues running.)

1045
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,530
(The avatar boy doesn't realize
that he's eliminated.)

1046
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,380
(Se Chan and Yura manage
to overcome the crisis.)

1047
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,240
(Am I eliminated?)

1048
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,510
I'm acting right now.
I'm shooting a drama.

1049
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,380
I'm angry.

1050
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,440
I don't know how to laugh.

1051
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,780
I'm a person who can't laugh.

1052
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,010
Where are they? Where did Haha go?

1053
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,380
(Yura is imagining
she's acting right now.)

1054
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:25,220
(Suk Jin and Ji Hyo)

1055
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,130
(Suk Jin is waiting for them,
tapping on his nose.)

1056
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,170
Is this a haunted house?

1057
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,340
(Se Chan holds back his laughter.)

1058
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,360
(Suk Jin dances to "Any Song.")

1059
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,940
(Again, he is joined by...)

1060
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,940
(Hong Du Kkae's wife who
is wearing a blue headband.)

1061
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,050
(Se Chan bursts out laughing.)

1062
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,490
(Yura's lips twitch too.)

1063
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,220
Do you have to go this far?

1064
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,030
(The dancers keep straight faces.)

1065
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,650
They don't even know the dance!

1066
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,920
(They have no clue.)

1067
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,860
(Ignoring)

1068
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,900
(Suk Jin, Hong Du Kkae's wife,
ZICO, Han Na)

1069
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,630
Neither of them knows the dance!

1070
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,260
Gosh, we can't beat them.

1071
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,360
(These creative dancers
are improvising.)

1072
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,510
They planned it very well.

1073
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,570
What is this?

1074
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,800
They don't even know the dance!

1075
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,820
You can't dance to this song
if you don't know it! It's cheating!

1076
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,380
(The straight-faced dancer leaves.)

1077
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,320
What do you think of Ji Hyo?
Isn't her make-up realistic?

1078
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,090
- What is this?
- You can't beat her, can you?

1079
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,110
Isn't it so realistic?

1080
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,590
You even prepared a headband?

1081
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,960
This time...

1082
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,720
Let's say we didn't laugh there.

1083
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,820
Where's Jae Suk? I want to see him.

1084
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,030
We can never beat them.

1085
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,720
- Let's look for Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk...

1086
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,570
- Where's Jae Suk?
- Where is he?

1087
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,400
(Swaying)

1088
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,840
(4-leg swag)

1089
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,740
This is not okay!

1090
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,340
We can't beat that. What is that?

1091
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,050
He plays "Y" by Freestyle?

1092
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,010
That's insane.

1093
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,220
- He even plays music.
- We can't beat this.

1094
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,920
Ji Hyo, I'm proud of you.

1095
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,990
I think we should switch
with Jae Suk.

1096
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,760
- They laugh there, right?
- Yes, totally.

1097
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,530
They should enter from here
this time.

1098
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,880
- Or... Jae Suk!
- Yes?

1099
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,300
How about we switch places?

1100
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,690
- Jae Suk should be here?
- Yes.

1101
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,260
Gosh, Jong Kook.

1102
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,030
- They're hilarious, aren't they?
- I cried.

1103
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,440
I cried too.

1104
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,630
I cried for real.

1105
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,840
It makes you cry.

1106
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,670
I think we laughed
at the same place as they did.

1107
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,710
Like I said,

1108
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,970
when someone acts out of character,
you become worried.

1109
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,610
I'm worried right now.

1110
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,710
You know who I mean, right?

1111
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,070
Ji Hyo must have done
something unexpected.

1112
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,220
What's funny is that...

1113
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,220
- she doesn't even know the dance.
- Exactly.

1114
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,190
- All right.
- Okay.

1115
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,880
You can do this!
Please pass three people.

1116
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,320
Just pass three people.

1117
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,550
- We can do this.
- Na Eun, let's pass three people.

1118
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,420
(Will Jong Kook and Na Eun manage
to hold back their laughter?)

1119
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,130
- Brace yourself.
- I'm not going to laugh.

1120
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,130
It's not going to be funny.
It's just make-up.

1121
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,490
(They control their minds.)

1122
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,710
(A moment later)

1123
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,880
The winning team is...

1124
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,010
(Who wins, Team Blue or Team Red?)

1125
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,320
Team Blue.
Each member gets 20 dollars.

1126
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,940
(Team Blue wins.)

1127
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,280
- We lost?
- Yes.

1128
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,940
Jong Kook didn't laugh, so we won.

1129
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,050
I didn't think it was funny.

1130
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,690
(Even though Team Red was hilarious,
they lost the game.)

1131
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,820
- Can you hold back your laughter?
- Of course.

1132
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,900
(Jong Kook and Na Eun
are playing the game.)

1133
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,760
This is not funny.

1134
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,070
(They pass the blue-faced
marathoner easily.)

1135
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,070
(Embarrassed)

1136
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,570
Did we touch him?

1137
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,490
- We didn't.
- We should touch him.

1138
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,010
(They suddenly change
their direction.)

1139
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,840
We're used to this.

1140
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,670
- This way.
- We should touch them first.

1141
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,800
What are you doing?

1142
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,150
You're going to dance
to "Any Song", right?

1143
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,440
(They touch Jae Suk,
Na Hee, and Haha.)

1144
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
- Did you touch him?
- Yes.

1145
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,940
You're good at this!

1146
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,610
- You're good.
- Okay!

1147
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,010
When you changed your direction
to touch Haha, our plan was ruined.

1148
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,010
(Jong Kook and Na Eun win easily
by changing direction.)

1149
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,720
- They changed direction?
- Yes.

1150
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,960
Too bad.

1151
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,900
- The thing is...
- It's not over yet.

1152
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,900
(The llama shouts.)

1153
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,670
What do you mean?

1154
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,920
Who are you?

1155
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,190
- It's not over yet.
- Your face...

1156
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,130
Where are you going?

1157
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,970
Hey, where are you going?

1158
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,840
- Hey.
- It's not over yet.

1159
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,300
Where are you going?

1160
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,900
- Hey!
- Where are you going?

1161
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,650
(Where is he going?)

1162
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,740
Where are you going?

1163
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:09,320
(The llama gets in the elevator
without permission.)

1164
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,510
Where is he going?

1165
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,820
There aren't even any cameramen
following him.

1166
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,380
There aren't even any cameramen!

1167
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,090
Is he angry because I didn't laugh?

1168
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,280
All of a sudden?

1169
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,650
Did Jae Suk really leave?

1170
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,130
Is he gone?

1171
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,650
- The llama is back.
- Is he?

1172
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,190
What is he doing?

1173
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,090
What's with him?

1174
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,530
Where were you?

1175
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,360
Why did you leave
in the middle of the shoot?

1176
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,400
(The half-man half-llama creature
is freestyling.)

1177
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,760
He's still playing "Y" by Freestyle.

1178
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,670
- He looks so ugly, by the way.
- He's still playing that song.

1179
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,150
- Gosh, you're a mess.
- Where were you?

1180
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,510
If this competition had been
about looking ugly,

1181
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,280
we would have won.

1182
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,320
You would have won first place.

1183
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,780
- Seriously.
- You're incredible.

1184
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,460
The couple with the biggest amount
of money wins a prize.

1185
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,220
The couple with the smallest amount
of money...

1186
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,990
- will receive a penalty.
- There's a penalty?

1187
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,990
Let's throw the dice now.

1188
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,470
The couples who
don't get a repeated number...

1189
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,490
win 10 dollars and get to decide...

1190
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,010
whether or not
to move on to the next stage.

1191
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,110
- So we start at Stage 1?
- We always start at Stage 1?

1192
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,010
- Okay.
- That sounds fun.

1193
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,210
- We'll go first.
- Okay.

1194
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:10,780
1, 2...

1195
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,570
(Repeated numbers
eliminate the couples.)

1196
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,670
It's 4.

1197
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,510
If any couples get 4,
we'll be eliminated together.

1198
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,110
(Any couples who throw 4
will be eliminated.)

1199
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,090
- If you get 4, you're out.
- It's easy to get 4.

1200
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,280
Who's Na Hee's partner?

1201
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,820
- It's me.
- It's Jae Suk.

1202
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,960
(It's Jae Suk and Na Hee's turn.)

1203
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,400
Take your costume off now!

1204
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,550
(It gets in the way.)

1205
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,720
Jae Suk!

1206
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,320
After all that effort,

1207
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,190
he's disappointed by the fact
that not many people saw it.

1208
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,990
- I should avoid the same number.
- If you get 4, you're out.

1209
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,530
- If I get 4, I'm out?
- Yes.

1210
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,670
If I don't, I survive.

1211
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,070
(Repeated numbers
eliminate the couples.)

1212
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,840
(Will he manage not to get 4
and pass Stage 1?)

1213
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,780
It's 3!

1214
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,300
(He gets 3 and survives for now.)

1215
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,670
If anyone throws 3 or 4,
he or she is out, right?

1216
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,150
If you get 3 or 4, you're out.

1217
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,740
And I'll be out too, right?

1218
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,190
Yes. If anyone gets 4.

1219
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:54,110
(Will Tae Oh get something else
than 3 or 4?)

1220
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,860
- It's 5.
- Okay!

1221
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,130
(He gets 5 and survives for now.)

1222
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,800
- Okay!
- Good job.

1223
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,190
Yura, we should get 1...

1224
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,570
- We need 1 or 6.
- You should get 6.

1225
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,490
- 1 or 6?
- 1, 2, or 6.

1226
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,400
- What did they just get?
- They got 5.

1227
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,440
Just avoid 4.

1228
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,630
We need 1 or 6.

1229
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,840
(Se Chan and Yura have
a 50-percent chance to survive.)

1230
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,030
We need 1 or 6.

1231
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,570
(What's the result?)

1232
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,550
- It's 6!
- Okay.

1233
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,110
(They get 6 and survive for now.)

1234
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:21,650
- It's 6!
- Okay.

1235
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,190
- Okay.
- What?

1236
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,380
It rolled many times.

1237
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,460
They'll definitely fail.
This is not good.

1238
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,130
- Na Eun, you should throw it.
- Me?

1239
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,220
You do it.

1240
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,490
I...

1241
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,190
Please.

1242
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,800
(They need to throw 1 or 2
to pass Stage 1.)

1243
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,740
Please, 1.

1244
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,090
It's 2.

1245
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,030
(She got 2?)

1246
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,970
(You did it?)

1247
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,010
It's 2.

1248
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,300
How did you do that?

1249
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,400
We got 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

1250
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,970
- Na Eun!
- You need to throw 1 now.

1251
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,170
Unbelievable.

1252
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,920
- Throw 1!
- You need 1!

1253
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,340
(If Haha throws 1,
everyone will be happy.)

1254
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,780
- You'll be surprised.
- Throw 1!

1255
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,420
Throw 1, and it'll be perfect.

1256
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,610
(Haha is going
to make it or break it.)

1257
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,690
(After five successes in a row,
how will Haha do?)

1258
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,360
It'll be incredible if he throws 1.

1259
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,490
Don't throw 2.

1260
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,070
(He throws 2 and fails.)

1261
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,130
Who else got 2?

1262
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,340
(Jong Kook, Na Eun,
and Haha are eliminated.)

1263
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,360
Who else got 2?

1264
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,360
You got 2?

1265
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,530
I eliminated you guys.

1266
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,710
(Haha manages
to eliminate one couple.)

1267
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,030
You guys are eliminated.

1268
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,150
The rest of you get to decide
whether or not to go on.

1269
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,470
- We should!
- You should.

1270
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,920
You should.

1271
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,740
(Repeated numbers or 1
eliminate the couples.)

1272
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,780
- Go.
- Let's go.

1273
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,780
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1274
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,050
- Let's go.
- All right.

1275
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,190
(We won't sit out.)

1276
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,510
Na Hee, let's do this.

1277
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,220
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

1278
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,760
Avoid one or repeated numbers.

1279
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,900
1, 2. Let's go.

1280
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,300
(Will Ji Hyo and Suk Jin succeed
Stage 2?)

1281
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,070
One. They are out.

1282
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,760
(They lose 10 dollars
they won on Stage 1.)

1283
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,440
They are out.

1284
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,880
(Repeated numbers or 1
eliminate the couples.)

1285
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,670
(It's a festival for the rest.)

1286
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,650
(They enjoy another's failure more
than their own success.)

1287
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,570
- All right.
- How did we get one?

1288
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,880
I just need to avoid getting one.

1289
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,440
(It's So Min's turn.)

1290
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,320
She will get 1.

1291
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,190
(Repeated numbers or 1
eliminate the couples.)

1292
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,760
- 1!
- 1!

1293
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,650
(It's 1 again.)

1294
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:11,420
- Everyone is so happy.
- I can't believe it.

1295
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,630
(They showed everyone
the result of excessive greed.)

1296
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,860
Everyone laughed the loudest.

1297
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,990
Please let me avoid 1.

1298
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,240
- One.
- Okay.

1299
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,900
(They survived with 2.)

1300
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,170
It's usually hard to get one.

1301
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,300
- That's good.
- Seriously.

1302
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,340
- Three.
- Okay.

1303
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,740
(Se Chan and Yura succeed
Stage 2 as well.)

1304
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,070
(Se Chan and Yura;
Jae Suk and Na Hee got 20 dollars.)

1305
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,610
Will the two surviving teams
receive 20 dollars or keep going?

1306
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:30,780
- Keep going.
- We will keep going.

1307
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,840
"Odd numbers eliminate the couples."

1308
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,110
You just need to get an even number.

1309
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,510
Keep going.

1310
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,690
Aren't you going to move on
to the next stage?

1311
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,920
- You should. You should.
- Are you a coward?

1312
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,280
If you are a coward, stop here.

1313
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,760
- Let's keep going!
- Yes!

1314
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,400
You made the right call.

1315
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,800
- Just get an even number.
- Just get an even number.

1316
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,240
- An even number?
- Yes.

1317
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,260
I hope they get an odd number.

1318
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,070
Aren't the stakes too high
for Jae Suk to throw the dice?

1319
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:58,400
- Are you sure that's wise?
- Na Hee, do you want to throw it?

1320
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,780
Na Hee, we need an even number.

1321
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,800
Throw it high.

1322
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,070
- Throw it high. There you go.
- Okay.

1323
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,170
(She throws the dice for Stage 3
with energy.)

1324
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,110
(Odd numbers eliminate the couples.)

1325
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:13,010
(They will get 40 dollars
if the number is even.)

1326
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:15,650
(What will be the result?)

1327
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,530
Okay!

1328
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:18,900
(They succeed Stage 3.)

1329
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,860
(Jae Suk and Na Hee hit
the jackpot.)

1330
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,820
Okay. All right.

1331
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,400
- All right, Yura.
- Me?

1332
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,440
- You should throw it.
- Okay.

1333
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,440
Throw it high.

1334
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,530
- All right.
- Please.

1335
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,970
- Okay.
- Throw it high.

1336
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,110
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1337
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,570
(They will win 40 dollars
if they get an even number.)

1338
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,970
(Se Chan and Yura succeed
Stage 3 as well.)

1339
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,010
Let's keep going!

1340
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,440
(We won 40 dollars.)

1341
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,150
Will you stop here
and receive 40 dollars?

1342
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,320
- Keep going!
- Hold on.

1343
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,360
(They are on a roll.)

1344
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,650
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

1345
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,360
(In unison)

1346
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,070
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
You just need to get 5 or 6.

1347
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,300
The chance of success is higher.

1348
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,570
Keep going!

1349
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,800
(Jae Suk makes a decision
as people ask them to keep going.)

1350
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,860
Stop!

1351
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,610
(What?)

1352
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,670
(Stop?)

1353
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,210
You just need 5 or 6.

1354
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,740
- The chance of success is higher.
- We won't get those numbers.

1355
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,840
- The chance of success is higher.
- No, it isn't.

1356
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,590
- We won't get those numbers.
- Suk Jin.

1357
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:15,990
- Will you stop here?
- Yes.

1358
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:17,190
You won 40 dollars.

1359
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,420
- What will you do?
- Hold on.

1360
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,780
- You have to keep going.
- Keep going.

1361
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,780
Yura is on a roll.

1362
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,590
- You have to keep going, Se Chan.
- Keep going.

1363
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,760
5 or 6.

1364
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,720
Let's keep going!

1365
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,400
- Let's go.
- Good luck.

1366
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,990
(Se Chan and Yura decided
to give Stage 4 a try.)

1367
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:32,900
Let's do this.

1368
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,340
- Okay.
- This is Stage Four.

1369
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,360
Stage Four.

1370
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,360
- You need to get 5 or 6.
- 5 or 6.

1371
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,530
You need 5 or 6.

1372
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,710
(They will win 80 dollars
if they get 5 or 6.)

1373
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,110
The probability is too low.

1374
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,650
- Here I go.
- All right.

1375
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:45,840
- Please.
- Here I go.

1376
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,720
(She finally throws the dice
in Stage 4.)

1377
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,840
(She fails if she gets 1 through 4.)

1378
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,420
(Will Yura succeed to get 5 or 6?)

1379
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:55,590
Please.

1380
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,420
(She gets 5!)

1381
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,490
You did it!

1382
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,760
(They truly hit the jackpot!)

1383
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,360
(Their jaws drop.)

1384
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,800
You did it! Now, we will stay!

1385
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,070
Keep going!

1386
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,800
(They decided to stay.)

1387
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,880
- Go where?
- Hold on.

1388
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,780
- Will you stay now?
- Yes.

1389
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,840
- Let's stay. Let's stay.
- It can't be helped.

1390
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,440
There is no way we can get
the number we pick.

1391
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,150
- Will you stay now?
- Stay!

1392
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,720
- Stay!
- You won 80 dollars.

1393
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,010
That was impressive.

1394
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,130
- That was impressive.
- That was quite a feat.

1395
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,420
Se Chan and Yura are
in first place.

1396
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,260
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo and Haha are...

1397
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,190
- in last place.
- Okay.

1398
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,440
(The total amount of money)

1399
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:41,130
Ji Hyo, I have a personal favor
to ask of you.

1400
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,240
Would you please wear
the hairband today?

1401
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,530
Please wear it next week too.

1402
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,650
- Her hairband had a retro vibe.
- That's right.

1403
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,820
Why don't you wear
a ski outfit next week?

1404
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,440
It won't be fun
if I do everything at once.

1405
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,510
Ji Hyo's character...

1406
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,610
Haha, you are too excessive.

1407
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:02,420
- I just want to see it.
- You should stop.

1408
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,760
- Seriously.
- You are always like that.

1409
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,960
You ruined the romance
between me and Se Chan.

1410
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,630
You ruined so many romances.

1411
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,470
- It's not like that.
- He makes everyone uncomfortable.

1412
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,530
So many couples came to be
because of me.

1413
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,070
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Seriously.

1414
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,860
Nothing will work with your tactics.

1415
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,440
So many couples came to be
because of me.

1416
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:19,840
Some of them
are still happily married.

1417
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,510
You once ruined Jong Kook's romance
for real, right?

1418
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:27,280
- Right?
- I was too bored back then.

1419
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,510
(Haha is scary when he is bored.)

1420
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,320
- He ruined Jong Kook's romance.
- Haha's biggest problem is...

1421
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,760
that he gets too invested.

1422
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,010
Seriously.

1423
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,630
- He does it for fun.
- That's right.

1424
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,990
Romances get ruined
because he gets too invested.

1425
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,400
If it's a drama, you need to wait
until the sixth episode.

1426
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,170
He wants to see the conclusion
in the second episode.

1427
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,740
What does he want to see
in the rest of the episodes?

1428
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,990
I guess married couples are one...

1429
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,260
- because Byul keeps texting me.
- What does she say?

1430
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,210
"Seeing you and Se Chan
makes my heart flutter."

1431
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,340
She is ridiculous.

1432
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,840
I was like,
"Byul, don't be ridiculous."

1433
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,340
"Don't be like that, So Min.
Did you make up your mind?"

1434
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,900
She keeps sending me those texts.

1435
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,780
Byul wasn't like that
back in the days.

1436
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,970
Haha ruined her.

1437
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:01,220
For goodness' sake.

1438
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,320
I think it's better than any drama.

1439
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,340
(He is watching his favorite drama.)

1440
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,090
It makes my heart flutter.
It's insane.

1441
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,690
There are many things.

1442
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,760
What is that?

1443
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,220
- Ramyeon.
- Cilantro.

1444
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,260
Ramyeon.

1445
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,420
One of the options is stinky tofu.

1446
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,820
The winners of this mission
will win...

1447
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,170
a meal and 20 dollars.

1448
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,130
It's Crash Landing of Cards.

1449
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,970
It's named after our favorite drama.

1450
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:24,030
"It's okay."

1451
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,570
"It's okay."

1452
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,880
You will play the game 6 against 5.

1453
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,670
Each team will throw 12 cards
alternatively...

1454
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,220
and win the dishes they land on.

1455
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,320
You will have lunch
with those dishes only.

1456
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,780
If you cover a card
with another card,

1457
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,320
the bottom card won't count,

1458
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,150
and the card on top can move
to the desired spot.

1459
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,490
A card that lands on a blue square
will win you a point.

1460
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,690
A card that lands on a red square
or outside the menu board...

1461
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,760
- will lose you a point.
- The red squares are bad.

1462
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,360
We will be fine
as long as we avoid stinky tofu.

1463
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,740
Fermented skate will be bad too.

1464
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,170
I prefer fermented skate.

1465
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,760
Me too. I would die
if I eat stinky tofu.

1466
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,340
We need to divide the group
into teams of 6 and 5.

1467
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,070
- You are good at this.
- We have good members.

1468
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,940
Would it be okay if we practice?

1469
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,150
- No.
- No.

1470
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,320
No? Okay. I got it.

1471
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,090
- You said no.
- No.

1472
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,090
- No.
- Okay.

1473
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:12,420
- Okay. You said no.
- Never.

1474
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,920
That's Jong Kook's favorite line.
"No? Okay."

1475
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,320
- "You said no."
- Okay.

1476
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,090
I love it when someone says no.
Okay.

1477
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,800
Who should go first?

1478
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,090
Yura, do you want to go first?

1479
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,490
- You are lucky right now.
- Give it a go, Yura.

1480
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:23,670
You have good energy right now.

1481
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,400
- I think I will do badly.
- It's okay.

1482
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,490
You have two cards anyway.

1483
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,690
Yura.

1484
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,530
- Which one do you want?
- Throw comfortably.

1485
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,240
- Throw it anywhere.
- Ribeye or braised kimchi.

1486
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,070
- Here I go.
- That's good.

1487
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:36,110
- That's good.
- Fermented skate.

1488
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,280
(She gets fermented skate, chicken,
ribeye, and stinky tofu.)

1489
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,220
- That's good.
- Fermented skate.

1490
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,990
Fermented skate, stinky tofu,
and ribeye.

1491
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,720
- Three.
- You got stinky tofu too.

1492
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,960
- Chicken.
- You got...

1493
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,030
fermented skate, chicken,
ribeye, and stinky tofu.

1494
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,220
- The current score is 0.
- I will go first.

1495
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,530
Cover the card and get ribeye.

1496
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,530
- Let's aim for rolled omelet first.
- Jae Suk.

1497
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,590
Let's aim for braised kimchi first.

1498
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,940
- Braised kimchi?
- Yes.

1499
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,970
Let's eat rolled omelet.

1500
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:02,970
Jae Suk.

1501
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,740
We have vastly different tastes.

1502
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,510
- I don't want rolled omelet.
- This is my card.

1503
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:08,110
Raise your hand if you want
braised kimchi.

1504
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,440
Everyone wants braised kimchi.

1505
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,780
Raise your hand if you want
rolled omelet.

1506
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,240
See?

1507
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,220
I hate to break it to you,
but you won't get the dish anyway.

1508
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,780
(I hate to break it to you,
but you won't get the dish anyway.)

1509
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,420
Seriously.

1510
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,110
- How would you know?
- Don't waste your energy.

1511
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,720
- Just throw the card.
- I will aim for ramyeon.

1512
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,920
- Okay.
- I am okay with ramyeon.

1513
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,630
- I am okay with ramyeon.
- Ramyeon.

1514
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,960
- Avoid cilantro. I can't eat it.
- I love cilantro.

1515
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:29,260
I can't eat cilantro.

1516
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,070
Hold on.
Let's aim for rolled omelet.

1517
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:32,570
For goodness' sake.

1518
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,440
- We don't have the same tastes.
- Seriously.

1519
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,470
This is the worst.

1520
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:37,070
Someone else should go first.

1521
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,240
(I can't stand it.)

1522
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,630
(I won't do this.)

1523
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,740
- For goodness' sake.
- Hurry up and throw the card.

1524
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,970
Let me aim for what I want.

1525
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,740
- Aim for what you want.
- Let him eat rolled omelet.

1526
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:48,050
Let's go for the rolled omelet.

1527
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,110
(He gets ramyeon, cilantro,
and rolled omelet.)

1528
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,440
(They get 1 point in total.)

1529
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,150
- Ramyeon, rolled omelet, cilantro.
- Ramyeon, rolled omelet, cilantro.

1530
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,320
- Plus 1 point.
- 1 point.

1531
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,710
- It's one point, right?
- Yes.

1532
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,630
This combination is not bad
except for the cilantro.

1533
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,500
- Who's next? So Min?
- So Min?

1534
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,320
- So Min, let's have braised kimchi.
- Cover this up.

1535
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,630
Cover it up.

1536
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,590
- Should I cover it up?
- Writer Jeon.

1537
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,440
(Look at me, Writer Jeon.)

1538
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,460
(Looking)

1539
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,900
(She makes eye contact with him...)

1540
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,070
(and laughs.)

1541
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,940
- Writer Jeon.
- Writer Jeon.

1542
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,840
Strangely, I'm drawn to him.

1543
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,900
He looks interesting.

1544
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,840
(I'm drawn to him.
He looks interesting.)

1545
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,020
("Fantastic Faces
and Where to Find Them" by Jae Suk)

1546
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,420
Just saying.

1547
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,940
Writer Jeon. Writer Jeon!

1548
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,360
(She ignores Jae Suk
and throws her card.)

1549
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,250
- Writer Jeon.
- Writer Jeon!

1550
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,960
Chocolate.

1551
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,650
- Chocolate?
- You can eat ribeye with chocolate.

1552
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,170
- It's not bad. It's edible.
- It's not.

1553
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,230
- It's edible.
- Dessert.

1554
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,320
All right.

1555
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,540
(Na Hee, Ji Hyo,
Se Chan, and Na Eun go after.)

1556
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,040
I can reach this easily.

1557
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,900
- What?
- Don't cross the line.

1558
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,900
Oh, gosh.

1559
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,270
- He went over too much.
- It'll work.

1560
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,630
(Tapping)

1561
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,210
(What did he just do?)

1562
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,250
- Timid revenge.
- That doesn't look painful at all.

1563
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,710
Timid revenge.

1564
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:06,110
What did you just do?

1565
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,840
I was stretching.

1566
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,420
- I see.
- That was a weird stretch.

1567
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,230
Bring it back.

1568
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,730
If you keep doing that,
you'll get into trouble this year.

1569
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,320
(He warns Jong Kook
without making eye contact.)

1570
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,360
- He's not even looking.
- He's just talking.

1571
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,340
- You'll get into trouble this year.
- He's mumbling to himself.

1572
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,840
My elbow will be striking you
before I realize.

1573
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,270
(His elbow is probably soft
like water.)

1574
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,340
He didn't even say,
"I'll punish you."

1575
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,270
"You'll get into trouble this year."

1576
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,900
My gosh.

1577
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,320
- You can get to the ribeye.
- That's what I'm going for.

1578
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,020
(Suk Jin throws his card
after warning Jong Kook.)

1579
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,940
(I'm going for the ribeye.)

1580
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,940
Is it fermented skate?

1581
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,090
Ribeye.

1582
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:43,860
(He's at the boundary between
fermented skate and ribeye.)

1583
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,730
It's touching it.

1584
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:46,980
Fermented skate and ribeye.

1585
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,320
This is difficult.

1586
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,320
Zero points.

1587
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,860
- Come on.
- They'll take it out.

1588
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,170
- This is difficult.
- My teammates are awful.

1589
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,690
It was in between
fermented skate and ribeye.

1590
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,270
What should I do?

1591
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,090
Leggings, hurry up.

1592
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,230
These are not leggings.
These are shorts.

1593
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,270
Tights.

1594
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,340
This is easy to reach.

1595
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,670
Suk Jin did it too.

1596
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,340
(That's random.)

1597
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,300
Suk Jin did it too.

1598
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,020
(What's he doing?)

1599
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,340
(Rolling)

1600
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,250
What are you doing?

1601
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,320
Why did you kick the camera?

1602
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,790
Why are you so hyper today?

1603
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,090
Hold on.

1604
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,320
- He's angry.
- What were you doing?

1605
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,960
Why are you mad?

1606
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,090
- He's hyper even without Kwang Soo.
- What was that?

1607
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,630
- What was that about?
- Why are you mad?

1608
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,440
The camera was on,

1609
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,110
so I wanted to take
a water bottle swiftly.

1610
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:34,710
Why did you go on the elevator?

1611
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,270
I'm just curious.

1612
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,050
Why did you go on it?
What was your thought process?

1613
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,070
(The game continues.)

1614
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,880
- Ribeye!
- Ribeye.

1615
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,050
It's okay. It's not bad.

1616
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,520
It's their turn.

1617
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,590
(They're tied 2 to 2
with 1 person left on each team.)

1618
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,050
- This won't work.
- Tae Oh.

1619
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,150
- What should I do?
- Ribeye.

1620
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,360
- Should I try the ribeye?
- Ribeye.

1621
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,420
Ribeye.

1622
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,130
Should I try for the ribeye
and cover that up?

1623
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:00,730
That middle spot is the best.

1624
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:02,540
- The middle.
- Don't you think...

1625
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,090
the atmosphere is different?
When it was Se Chan's turn,

1626
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:07,170
Yura and Na Eun didn't do anything.
When it's Tae Oh's turn,

1627
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:09,000
they're cheering.

1628
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,070
(When it was Se Chan's turn,)

1629
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:12,150
(they looked from a distance
and weren't interested.)

1630
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,570
- I was hurt.
- When it was your turn.

1631
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,110
- They didn't do anything.
- I paid attention.

1632
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,250
Right.

1633
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:20,050
- This one.
- That's why So Min likes Se Chan.

1634
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,980
I have no competitors.

1635
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,020
She has no competitors.

1636
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,820
Both cilantro and rolled omelet.

1637
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,920
Okay.

1638
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,630
- Do you want all four?
- Yes.

1639
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,130
Do whatever you want.

1640
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,320
(Smiling)

1641
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,860
- Do you want all four?
- Yes.

1642
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,630
(Sweet guy Tae Oh)

1643
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:34,690
I just want the ribeye.

1644
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,670
- What do you want to eat?
- Ribeye.

1645
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,860
What do you think you're doing?

1646
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,500
(They're like lead characters
in a drama.)

1647
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,110
- What do you want to eat?
- Ribeye? Okay.

1648
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,340
Just that?

1649
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,610
(Season 2...)

1650
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:47,900
(of Romance in Running Man
starts in the middle of the game.)

1651
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,420
(What's going on here?)

1652
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,090
- Do whatever you want.
- I guess you're confident.

1653
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,320
I guess so.

1654
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,420
- What's going on?
- What do you think you're doing?

1655
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,250
- Good.
- Ribeye.

1656
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,150
- No dating!
- Just that?

1657
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,630
(No dating!)

1658
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,920
(Supporting character 1 explodes.)

1659
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,320
No dating!

1660
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,900
- Focus. Focus on the game!
- No dating!

1661
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,590
I hope he throws it out of bounds.

1662
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,400
Go for the stinky tofu
or the cilantro.

1663
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,900
(Amid the distraction,)

1664
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,440
(will he land on the ribeye?)

1665
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:17,110
Oh, dear.

1666
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:21,000
(He touched two cards.)

1667
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:22,840
- Good job.
- I touched two cards.

1668
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,880
- Good job.
- It's not bad.

1669
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,110
There's still the fried chicken.

1670
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,520
Thanks for taking away
the fermented skate.

1671
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,420
- We don't have the fermented skate.
- Thanks for that.

1672
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,980
Both are gone.

1673
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,590
- We still have the fried chicken.
- The ones on the bottom are gone.

1674
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:32,980
Go for the ribeye.

1675
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,250
- At the far end.
- The far end?

1676
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,250
Past ribeye.

1677
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,090
He might get stinky tofu too,
so isn't the center better?

1678
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,090
- No, the far end.
- I think he can do it.

1679
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,360
Should I make it stand?

1680
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,590
(Should I make it stand?)

1681
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,340
You can't make it stand.

1682
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,130
Why would you make it stand?

1683
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,610
- Here.
- A little bit closer.

1684
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:48,710
- A little bit closer?
- That's good.

1685
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:52,000
Since Kwang Soo is away,
he wants to be Kwang Soo now.

1686
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,300
(Imitation of Kwang Soo)

1687
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,480
You have to clean that up, Tae Oh.

1688
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,590
Right.

1689
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,980
You're supposed to
clean after yourself.

1690
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,250
That's the rule here.

1691
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,050
I'm going next.

1692
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,320
- My team.
- You can go.

1693
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,820
Where do you want me to aim?

1694
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,090
Can you get what you want?

1695
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:14,090
Cover the ribeye.

1696
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,590
- Should I cover the ribeye?
- Yes.

1697
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,040
- Ribeye.
- Don't worry.

1698
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,090
Jae Suk's on our side.

1699
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,440
He's on our side.

1700
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,340
He's stinky tofu.

1701
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,630
Jae Suk, you have to cover it up.

1702
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,170
- Jae Suk.
- Actually,

1703
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:26,800
I can throw it this way
and stop this side.

1704
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,770
- Do you know what I mean?
- Cover it up.

1705
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,020
- On top of the ribeye...
- This direction.

1706
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,880
You'll cover the ribeye
or jjajangmyeon.

1707
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,090
- Correct.
- Bluffing.

1708
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,250
Yes, he's bluffing.
Pretending to be fluent.

1709
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,320
The ribeye?

1710
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,860
- He's pretending to be fluent.
- Fermented skate.

1711
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,860
- Let's go, stinky tofu.
- Bluffing.

1712
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,860
Where are you aiming?
Are you aiming at the pupa?

1713
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,130
Where are you aiming?
You're pointing at the pupa.

1714
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,690
My team is driving me nuts.

1715
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,170
- I like your facial expression.
- All right.

1716
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:48,230
Confidence.

1717
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,440
Get ready to cheer.

1718
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,840
(Cheering)

1719
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,210
He told us to get ready.

1720
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,570
- That was practice.
- Get ready to cheer.

1721
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,750
Yu San Seul.

1722
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,320
(Can he kill 2 birds with 1 stone
and turn the game around?)

1723
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,920
(Please...)

1724
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:09,880
Yu San Seul.

1725
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,730
(He got the cilantro
and the fermented skate.)

1726
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,420
- He didn't get there.
- Here?

1727
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,090
- I almost got it.
- Hold on.

1728
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,270
You almost covered it.

1729
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,800
That was close.

1730
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,540
- Jae Suk sounds...
- I can't believe you blew it.

1731
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,230
so disappointed.

1732
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,130
Let's go again.

1733
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:28,230
Here's the final result.

1734
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,540
If you look closely,
this is touching the cilantro.

1735
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:31,800
I got two.

1736
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,800
- It's touching.
- It is.

1737
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,920
- This is touching for sure.
- For sure.

1738
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,050
- I agree.
- These ones.

1739
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:40,920
Hey. If you touch it,
you'll get in trouble.

1740
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,250
(Hey. If you touch it,
you'll get in trouble.)

1741
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,590
(Suk Jin, class leader
and guest teaser)

1742
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,050
You're so strict.

1743
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,590
- You'll get in trouble.
- I think he's mad. Are you mad?

1744
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:52,320
3 points for Team Blue and 2 for
Team Red, so Team Blue wins.

1745
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,730
The winning team gets 20 dollars.

1746
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:56,440
- We didn't even win once.
- We keep winning.

1747
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,170
- We went out of bounds a lot.
- We won.

1748
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,210
Nice.

1749
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:02,000
You'll get the food
you've landed on.

1750
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,440
I'm happy about the ribeye.

1751
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:05,110
This is actually ribeye.

1752
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:07,480
- Jae Suk loves ramyeon.
- That looks good.

1753
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,880
What should I do?

1754
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,020
- Smell the fermented skate.
- It's strong.

1755
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,590
The smell is overpowering.

1756
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,020
- It's strong.
- The smell is so strong.

1757
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,250
Can you come this way?
I can't handle the fermented skate.

1758
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,860
"Can you come this way?"

1759
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,150
It's so strong.

1760
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,000
"Can you come this way?"

1761
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,520
(It's time to eat.)

1762
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,730
I got it.

1763
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,460
Braised kimchi is amazing.

1764
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,090
Braised kimchi.

1765
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,460
This is amazing.

1766
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,800
(Haha and Jong Kook grill the meat.)

1767
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,070
This is a coincidence,

1768
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:39,400
but the two barbecue restaurant
owners are grilling the meat.

1769
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,400
Mr. Kim.

1770
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,210
Mr. Ha is doing a good job.

1771
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,980
You should come to the restaurant
and grill the meat!

1772
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,420
How strange.

1773
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,050
I'll try it.

1774
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:52,360
(She tries the meat
Jong Kook grilled.)

1775
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:54,880
You grilled it so well.

1776
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,020
I own a barbecue restaurant.

1777
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,050
(He confesses.)

1778
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,520
Meat restaurant owner.

1779
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,300
That was the most touching thing
I heard him say.

1780
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,710
You're not embarrassed anymore.

1781
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:12,570
For the final mission,
both partners have to do well.

1782
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,070
It's When Pull-up Bar King
Meets Quiz King.

1783
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,070
What's that?

1784
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,070
(Final Mission: When Pull-up Bar
King Meets Quiz King)

1785
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,940
It's a quiz? I'm done.

1786
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:19,820
You have to hang onto
the pull-up bar and answer the quiz.

1787
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,110
Each team has three couples,

1788
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,880
and one couple from each team
will compete at a time.

1789
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,590
While one person is
hanging onto the pull-up bar,

1790
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:29,690
the other person has to play
the Initial Consonant Game and win.

1791
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:31,360
- We have to be fast.
- The person playing the game...

1792
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,230
has to provide six words that match
the consonants and the categories...

1793
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,170
in the correct order
within five seconds.

1794
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,630
Whenever the person
playing the game is wrong,

1795
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,170
the person on the pull-up bar will
get sprayed by water guns...

1796
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:43,340
from the other team.

1797
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,730
As soon as the person
on the pull-up bar lets go,

1798
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,750
that couple loses.

1799
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:50,320
The team that takes
3 out of 5 rounds wins.

1800
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,170
Here's an example.

1801
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:55,520
- What's that?
- A country that starts with giyeok.

1802
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,960
- For this,
- Ghana.

1803
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,210
Ghana and "go".

1804
01:02:58,210 --> 01:02:59,730
- What?
- "Go" for English.

1805
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,150
- Go.
- Go.

1806
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,150
- Norway.
- The Netherlands.

1807
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,020
"Nature" for English.

1808
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,360
- "Nature".
- I think I can do that.

1809
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,900
France and "freedom".

1810
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,340
I see.

1811
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:11,540
This is hard.

1812
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,630
Let's divide the teams.

1813
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,980
The team with five people
will be at a disadvantage.

1814
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,000
I hope...

1815
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,880
- I don't get the same team again.
- I'm in last place.

1816
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,400
We were on Team Red the whole time.

1817
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,880
Gosh, again?

1818
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,020
- Please.
- Please.

1819
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,610
- All right.
- I'm red.

1820
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:29,820
(Haha picked red.)

1821
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:31,960
- Red.
- Okay.

1822
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,690
- I got blue.
- Okay.

1823
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,590
- Blue!
- Okay.

1824
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:37,090
- We got red.
- These are the teams.

1825
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:38,690
- Red, go that way.
- Are you red?

1826
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,230
- Are you blue?
- Yes.

1827
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,730
Good.

1828
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,440
- We won.
- Good.

1829
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,590
(Team Red and Team Blue)

1830
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,710
This is good.

1831
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:48,360
Our captain is useless.

1832
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,980
I'm not useless.

1833
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,670
You are. Why are you on this team?

1834
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:54,500
- Stop, dumbhead.
- We're in trouble.

1835
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,150
- I'll help you.
- Haha's team always loses.

1836
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,420
- We're so bad.
- Let's go.

1837
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,750
- Are you good at English?
- English?

1838
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:01,880
I am good
at listening comprehension.

1839
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,110
Do foreign words count as English?

1840
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,750
- Kimchi.
- My goodness.

1841
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:09,130
- Hey.
- What did you say just now?

1842
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,900
- What is wrong with him?
- Why?

1843
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,630
Do you know what he said?

1844
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:14,000
- What did he say?
- It was so bad...

1845
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,630
- that I got goosebumps.
- What did he say?

1846
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:16,800
So you want to pronounce it
as a foreigner would.

1847
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,360
- Kimchi.
- Does it count?

1848
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,440
- Of course not.
- Then saying...

1849
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,170
the bar strangely should count too.

1850
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:23,770
- Chair.
- Of course not.

1851
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,040
Floor.

1852
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,710
- Of course not.
- Kimchi is a pronoun.

1853
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,980
Look at their sorry state.

1854
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,440
My goodness.

1855
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,710
- They are showing their ignorance.
- They are a mess.

1856
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:36,420
He is the team leader.
Don't look down on him.

1857
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,920
- Am I the team leader?
- Yes.

1858
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,360
- Team Leader Haha.
- Yes!

1859
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,790
He looks weak.

1860
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:44,900
Team Young Boys...
I mean, Team Red...

1861
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,360
- Team Young Boys!
- Team Young Boys!

1862
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,630
- Team Young Boys.
- Team Young Boys.

1863
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:48,800
"Young Boys"?

1864
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,300
- You are 42 years old.
- Haha.

1865
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,190
You should keep your mouth shut.

1866
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,360
(Laughing)

1867
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,130
(He is an old boy.)

1868
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,270
- An old boy.
- You should keep your mouth shut.

1869
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,550
A couple from each team
should come forward.

1870
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:00,710
That couple should be...

1871
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,300
- Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.
- That's right.

1872
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,320
- Show them our color.
- Okay.

1873
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,290
So Min and Tae Oh should go first.

1874
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:07,790
- This is bad. What should I do?
- That would be the best.

1875
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,750
Yura, aim for the face.

1876
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,320
(Yura will shoot the water gun
at the other team.)

1877
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,550
(Aiming)

1878
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:17,230
(Why is she aiming at So Min,
a member of her team?)

1879
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,860
How am I supposed
to shoot at So Min?

1880
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,540
- Me? You aren't supposed to.
- Don't shoot at So Min.

1881
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,270
(You aren't supposed to.)

1882
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:26,170
(She quickly changes her target.)

1883
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,460
Are you okay with shooting at me?

1884
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,210
- Yura.
- That's too bad.

1885
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,300
That would have been very funny.

1886
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,940
Yura.

1887
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,980
- Shoot at the old man.
- Are you okay with shooting at me?

1888
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,610
Shoot at the old man with ease.

1889
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,020
It's time for the male members
to grab on to the bar.

1890
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,820
- Suk Jin, let's go.
- Start.

1891
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:41,940
Get ready,

1892
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,020
set, go.

1893
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,550
(They begin.)

1894
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,590
No, no. You need to hang
from your hands.

1895
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,730
No, no. You need to hang
from your hands.

1896
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,500
You can't do that. Let's start over.

1897
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,670
(That's cheating.)

1898
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,400
(The crew removes the platform.)

1899
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,590
- Be quiet.
- Bring it back!

1900
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,610
(Hanging)

1901
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:01,900
Hey! That's too soon!
Bring it back!

1902
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,270
Bring it back!

1903
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:04,400
(He raises his voice
because he is in a hurry.)

1904
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,400
Let's start over.

1905
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,550
You can't do that.

1906
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:09,380
- You can't pull yourself up.
- I am sorry.

1907
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,820
I used up my strength.

1908
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,190
- You shouldn't cheat.
- I am sorry.

1909
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,420
Suk Jin, you should go home.
You exhausted your energy.

1910
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,590
I'm out of strength.

1911
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:17,880
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1912
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:20,250
Get ready, set, go.

1913
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,500
(Animal
and Four-syllable movie title)

1914
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,750
Four-syllable movie title?

1915
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,130
- Four-syllable movie title?
- Let me answer.

1916
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,960
- 5, 4,
- Snake, "Grinding".

1917
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,770
3, 2,

1918
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,570
- "Grinding"?
- one.

1919
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,210
Do I need to answer all of them?

1920
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:34,300
That's right.

1921
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,230
(So Min's partner at the pull-up bar
suffers the penalty.)

1922
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,340
Let me answer.

1923
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,170
- 5, 4...
- Snake, "Bonobono".

1924
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:42,940
- "Bonobono"?
- It needs to be a movie title.

1925
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,440
- Let me answer.
- Snake.

1926
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,650
- "Foolish Brothers".
- Four...

1927
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:46,710
"Just Do It".

1928
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:47,940
Gosh, what starts with bieup?

1929
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,460
- Let me answer.
- Five...

1930
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,550
- What did you say earlier?
- Hey!

1931
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:52,550
- Snake.
- Two...

1932
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,730
- Hey!
- Snake.

1933
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:56,250
- One.
- "Foolish Brothers", Cheetah.

1934
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:58,300
Let me answer.

1935
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,900
(Dropping)

1936
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,770
Snake, "The Unjust".

1937
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,840
I can't do it.

1938
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,900
Team Blue failed.

1939
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,270
- Did we win?
- Did we win?

1940
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,360
You won.

1941
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,480
(Team Red wins 1 point.)

1942
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,900
We can win
by hanging onto the pull-up bar.

1943
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,900
I can't believe Suk Jin.

1944
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,710
This isn't easy.

1945
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,150
It's so hard.

1946
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,650
- It's hard.
- It's hard.

1947
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:24,290
Start from the side.

1948
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,690
- The side?
- Yes.

1949
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:28,230
- Are you doing it again?
- Yes.

1950
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,460
Haha doesn't have a partner.

1951
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,190
It won't be easy.

1952
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:33,020
- Na Eun, we need to win.
- Okay.

1953
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,230
We can do this.

1954
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:36,500
You can hang from the pull-up bar
as long as your feet are in the air.

1955
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,960
- You can pull yourself up.
- Really?

1956
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,460
Get ready, set, go.

1957
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,900
Object?

1958
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,710
Let me answer.

1959
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:45,800
- That's it.
- Five,

1960
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,250
- 4, 3,
- Lunchbox, donut,

1961
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:49,480
- 2, 1.
- blanket...

1962
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,380
(Time's up.)

1963
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,880
(So Min shoots the water gun.)

1964
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,690
(She shoots at his armpits.)

1965
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:57,210
Gosh, So Min is the worst.

1966
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,230
(So Min is like Kwang Soo.)

1967
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:01,960
Let me answer. Donut, donuts,

1968
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,750
- blanket, English,
- Two,

1969
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,400
- wall...
- Time's up!

1970
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,460
(Time's up.)

1971
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,460
(Trying to hang on)

1972
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,190
- He is going up.
- You should do the same.

1973
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,630
- Me! Let me answer!
- Five,

1974
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,270
- 4, 3,
- Circle. Hold on. What was...

1975
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:18,040
- Incorrect.
- 2, 1.

1976
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,300
(Time's up.)

1977
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,250
(Shooting water gun)

1978
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,770
Stop it, So Min!

1979
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,610
(Is it a bidet?)

1980
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:28,790
So Min!

1981
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:30,110
(She is having fun.)

1982
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,110
Gosh, So Min is the worst.

1983
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,320
- Let me answer.
- Five,

1984
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:35,850
- 4, 3,
- Lunchbox, donuts, blanket,

1985
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,760
- 2, 1.
- and... Hold on. Blanket.

1986
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,300
(Incorrect)

1987
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,500
So Min is the worst.

1988
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,690
(She is shooting water
into Jong Kook's shoes.)

1989
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:43,930
So Min.

1990
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,100
- My shoes are soaking.
- Let me answer. Lunchbox, door,

1991
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,730
- blanket, English,
- 4, 3,

1992
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,170
- wall, body.
- two...

1993
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,040
Nice!

1994
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,470
(He got all 6 words.)

1995
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:54,070
- Body!
- Body!

1996
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,400
Body!

1997
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,420
That's good. Let's go.

1998
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,350
Even my underwear is wet.

1999
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:00,850
Jong Kook, is your underwear wet?

2000
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:03,460
Gosh, So Min.

2001
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:04,590
(I am in trouble.)

2002
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:06,430
Let's have the female members
go up this time.

2003
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:08,150
You can put your feet up
on the pull-up bar.

2004
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:09,430
Do what's comfortable.

2005
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:10,960
Will I be able to do it?

2006
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,100
(Speaking quietly)

2007
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:15,800
Oh, So Min.
You're going up there? Great.

2008
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,860
Jong Kook.

2009
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,760
Although Kwang Soo isn't here today,

2010
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,730
you filled his position perfectly.

2011
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:24,400
Please don't be like that.

2012
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:26,810
- I will do it.
- Go ahead.

2013
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:28,970
Why are the women going up
all of a sudden?

2014
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,180
(I must ask.)

2015
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,510
Everyone must participate.

2016
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:33,640
Kwang Soo, hurry up and come back.

2017
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,310
I miss you.

2018
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,290
Get ready...

2019
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:39,430
- Set, go.
- My goodness.

2020
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:41,760
That's good.
That's a secure position.

2021
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:43,890
Set, go.

2022
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,560
(Four-character idiom and singer)

2023
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,300
- Singer? Four-character idiom?
- It will be hard.

2024
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,340
Which singer's name starts
with giyeok?

2025
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:50,690
Let me answer.

2026
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:52,390
- 5, 4,
- Gojingamrae.

2027
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,140
3, 2,

2028
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:55,360
- one.
- Kim Bum Soo.

2029
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,930
(Time's up.)

2030
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,310
(It's Jong Kook's water gun time.)

2031
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,510
Let me answer.

2032
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,550
(He cleanses her nostrils.)

2033
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,310
He shot into my nostrils!

2034
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,220
(He shot into her nostrils.)

2035
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:07,790
- Let me answer. Gojingamrae,
- 5, 4,

2036
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:10,590
- Kim Bum Soo, Polaris...
- 3, 2,

2037
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,480
- "Polaris"?
- That's not a four-character idiom.

2038
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,650
(Is "Polaris"
a four-character idiom?)

2039
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:14,820
Isn't it a four-character idiom?

2040
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:15,980
- Let me answer.
- Five,

2041
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,430
- 4, 3,
- Gojingamrae, Kim Bum Soo,

2042
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:18,520
- two...
- the Qing invasion of Joseon.

2043
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:21,360
(The Qing invasion of Joseon?)

2044
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,890
"The Qing invasion of Joseon"?

2045
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,560
What is up with you?

2046
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,140
"The Qing invasion of Joseon"!

2047
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:29,260
(Tae Oh's creative answer
makes So Min's armpits sweat.)

2048
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,810
I think I can do better than him.

2049
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,570
What are some examples?

2050
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:33,810
- I am bad at four-character idioms.
- Four-character idioms.

2051
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:36,010
Tae Oh, hurry up. Hurry up.

2052
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:37,250
What are some four-character idioms?

2053
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,850
- Baek... Byeok... Byeokje...
- Haha.

2054
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:41,050
Byeok Galbi?

2055
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:42,810
Gojingamrae.

2056
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:43,850
- Let me answer.
- Tae Oh, hurry up.

2057
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:45,310
- Gojingamrae, Kim Bum Soo,
- 5, 4, 3,

2058
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,520
- 2, 1.
- What was it?

2059
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,260
(Time's up.)

2060
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:51,630
Stop it! Stop it!

2061
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:53,930
Stop it!

2062
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:56,640
Let me answer.
Gojingamrae, Kim Bum Soo,

2063
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,430
- Bungwooyusin, Baek Jong Won...
- 3, 2...

2064
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,900
Baek Jong Won...

2065
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,430
- Baek Jong Won?
- Baek Jong Won!

2066
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,470
For goodness' sake.
You are the worst.

2067
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:06,380
- Hello, I am Baek Jong Won.
- You are the worst.

2068
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,050
Let me answer.

2069
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,010
Gojingamrae, Kim Bum Soo...

2070
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,640
Bungwooyusin,

2071
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,090
- Baek Jong Won...
- Let me answer.

2072
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:16,610
(They keep bringing up
Baek Jong Won.)

2073
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:19,260
Why do you keep saying
Baek Jong Won?

2074
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:20,790
Tae Oh!

2075
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:24,020
How did CEO Baek Jong Won become
a singer?

2076
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:25,760
Let me answer.
Gojingamrae, Kim Bum Soo,

2077
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,260
Bungwooyusin, Baek Z Young,

2078
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:28,690
Juju Club...

2079
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,170
(Juju Club?)

2080
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:31,890
- Juju Club?
- Juju Club!

2081
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,310
Is Juju Club a four-character idiom?

2082
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:34,510
I am slipping.

2083
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,180
- Are you at your limit?
- Yes.

2084
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,810
Come on down.

2085
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,510
- My goodness.
- It's over.

2086
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:42,880
Jipijigi, Juju Club.

2087
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,420
- We won.
- It's over.

2088
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,850
- We won. We won.
- We won.

2089
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:48,640
My mind went blank when I sat here.

2090
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,310
Jong Kook is incredible.

2091
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,090
- I look completely dry, right?
- Yes.

2092
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,630
My feet are soaking wet.

2093
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,960
The water went into my nose
and came out through my mouth.

2094
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:58,800
Your armpits are sweating too.

2095
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:00,890
- Oh, this?
- Yes.

2096
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,690
This time,

2097
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,060
- we will go.
- Okay.

2098
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,600
- Will you go this time?
- Okay.

2099
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,640
- Yura.
- I will answer the question.

2100
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,140
(Se Chan and Yura are up.)

2101
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,570
- Against Jae Suk...
- Hey.

2102
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,880
Yura, even if you hold on,
I won't be able to beat Jae Suk.

2103
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,250
- I should memorize his answer.
- That's right.

2104
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,770
- I should memorize his answer.
- Just wait.

2105
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:19,070
- In the end...
- I will just think of the last one.

2106
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,590
You're not on my team. I am sorry.

2107
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:24,090
- Jong Kook.
- Suddenly...

2108
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,650
(Belated realization)

2109
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:27,150
- Jong Kook.
- Suddenly...

2110
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:29,350
You always think
Se Chan is on your side.

2111
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:31,690
- I got confused.
- You are on my team.

2112
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:33,100
You are right. I got confused.

2113
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,300
(In Jong Kook's head,
his favorite member is in his team.)

2114
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,260
- Okay.
- I will wait until the end.

2115
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,340
I do everything by calculation.

2116
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,900
- Go with the flow.
- That's not how I work.

2117
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,670
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- I think first.

2118
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:42,760
You need to go with the flow.

2119
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,570
Only amateurs yell out answers
from the start.

2120
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:46,040
You need to look at the forest,
not the trees.

2121
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,510
- Se Chan.
- You need to look ahead.

2122
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,720
- Baek Jong Won was ridiculous.
- Jae Suk isn't that great.

2123
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,470
- I know he is bad.
- Let's do this.

2124
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:54,250
I go when I have
the right judgment in my head.

2125
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:57,010
Get ready, set, go.

2126
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:00,260
Good. That's good.

2127
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,130
Okay. Gosh, English is my weakness.

2128
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:05,100
I prefer four-character idioms.

2129
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,060
Let me answer.
"La La Land", landmark...

2130
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:10,890
Giyeok? Giyeok?

2131
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:14,670
My goodness. You shouldn't put...

2132
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:15,840
You shouldn't put water in my ears.

2133
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,900
You shouldn't put water in my ears.

2134
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:20,140
Which movie title starts
with giyeok?

2135
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:21,940
- Okay.
- Giyeok.

2136
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,750
All right. Let me answer.

2137
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:26,220
"La La Land", radio...

2138
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,310
He is going so slowly.

2139
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:30,980
(Has this video been slowed down?)

2140
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,460
Here I go. Let me answer.

2141
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,890
"La La Land", radio,

2142
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,600
- "A Violent Prosecutor", go,
- 3, 2, 1.

2143
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,890
That's not how you do it.

2144
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,460
- You need to stay calm.
- I was close.

2145
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,520
You need to stay calm. All right.

2146
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,760
Bieup?

2147
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,060
- There is one.
- Let me answer.

2148
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,340
- "La La Land", radio...
- 5, 4...

2149
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,840
- Let's start over.
- Let's start over.

2150
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,340
- Let me answer. Radio... No!
- 5, 4...

2151
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,040
- Let me answer.
- Incorrect.

2152
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:54,600
(Jae Suk begins to cheat
because he is nervous.)

2153
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,210
- What was that?
- You just need the last two.

2154
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:57,810
- You just need the last two.
- I am almost there.

2155
01:13:58,050 --> 01:13:59,610
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2156
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,050
"La La Land", radio,

2157
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:02,480
- Go Doo Shim.
- Go Doo Shim.

2158
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,260
(Go Doo Shim)

2159
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,680
Let me answer.
"La La Land", radio,

2160
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,980
"A Violent Prosecutor",
and thank you.

2161
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,000
No!

2162
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,460
Let me answer.

2163
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,130
"La La Land", thank you...

2164
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:15,360
Thank you.

2165
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,970
(He confesses.)

2166
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:19,190
- What's wrong with you?
- Slow down.

2167
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,260
(He calms himself down.)

2168
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,760
- Let me answer.
- Sexy.

2169
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:24,680
Let me answer. "La La Land", radio,
"A Violent Prosecutor"...

2170
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,210
(Jae Suk covers Se Chan's mouth.)

2171
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,770
You can't do this.

2172
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,250
He can't do that.

2173
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,920
- What was that for?
- He can't do this.

2174
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:33,610
- Don't disturb him!
- Go ahead.

2175
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:34,940
(Dangling)

2176
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,560
My bad.

2177
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:38,460
- You have to finish it.
- Na Hee, are you all right?

2178
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,650
- I'm okay.
- She's okay.

2179
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:40,680
I'm okay so far.

2180
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:41,760
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2181
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,630
"La La Land", radio,
"A Violent Prosecutor"...

2182
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,190
(Squeezing)

2183
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,600
Hurry up.

2184
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:50,760
Let me answer. "La La Land",
radio, "A Violent Prosecutor"...

2185
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,800
("La La Land", radio,
"A Violent Prosecutor"...)

2186
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,100
(Pressing)

2187
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:58,540
(Groaning)

2188
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,010
Let me answer.
"La La Land", radio,

2189
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,440
"A Violent Prosecutor", go,

2190
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:03,640
"King of Mask Singer"...

2191
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,720
("King of Mask Singer" is
incorrect.)

2192
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,180
2, 3. Hold on.

2193
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:07,590
- Let me breathe.
- Okay.

2194
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:09,510
- Start.
- Two...

2195
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,650
I'm at 2. 2, 3.

2196
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:13,020
"La La Land", radio,

2197
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:15,980
"A Violent Prosecutor", go,
"The Unjust", and body.

2198
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,320
Good job!

2199
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,800
(4-syllable movie titles, English)

2200
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:21,000
(He overcame Jae Suk's disruption
and won.)

2201
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,430
Did Se Chan win?

2202
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,760
- We did it.
- We did it.

2203
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,000
- It's okay.
- They can't win.

2204
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,230
My goodness.

2205
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,170
- Se Chan beat Jae Suk.
- Good job, Na Hee.

2206
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:29,810
- Good job.
- You did well.

2207
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:31,430
- Good work.
- I thought we were going to lose.

2208
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,900
Se Chan beat Jae Suk.

2209
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,050
- Good job.
- You beat Jae Suk.

2210
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:37,880
- That concludes the game.
- Is it over?

2211
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,940
It's over.
Team Red will get 20 dollars each.

2212
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,220
Yes!

2213
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,590
It's okay. We'll roll the dice well.

2214
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:47,090
Let's move onto the final dice roll.

2215
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,220
(How will the orders change
after the dice rolling?)

2216
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,690
(Each Couple's Amount)

2217
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:52,630
(Se Chan and Yura in 1st place,
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo in last place)

2218
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:53,670
Let's get started.

2219
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,760
First place takes
a Korean beef set today.

2220
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,600
- Korean beef set?
- We get a Korean beef set.

2221
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:01,060
Let's go in order.

2222
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:03,040
Back and forth?

2223
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:05,040
- From first place.
- Sure.

2224
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,100
I'll go.

2225
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:08,180
(What's Se Chan and Yura's
first number?)

2226
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,720
- Good.
- It was the wrong choice.

2227
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,380
- Two.
- Good.

2228
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:14,610
(They collect 10 dollars
and have a total of 150 dollars.)

2229
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,650
- So Min.
- So Min never gets second place.

2230
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:17,810
It must be Tae Oh.

2231
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:18,960
Good luck.

2232
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:22,890
- So Min went too far.
- Two.

2233
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,600
- 1.
- Is it 1 again?

2234
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,060
- Third place.
- Jong Kook.

2235
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:27,930
- Why?
- Why do I always get one?

2236
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,300
- Na Eun.
- I have a good feeling.

2237
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,800
Don't be discouraged.

2238
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,360
- Good.
- You can drop a digit.

2239
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,760
What should I avoid?

2240
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,310
1 and 2.
I doubt you'll get those numbers.

2241
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:36,930
You won't get those. Don't worry.

2242
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:39,210
You should have been more confident.

2243
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,310
Okay!

2244
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:42,470
- I did it.
- You did it.

2245
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:43,570
You did it.

2246
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:45,770
1, 2, and 6?

2247
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,420
I don't have room for mistakes.

2248
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:48,750
3, 4 or 5.

2249
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,010
You never know with him.

2250
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:52,220
(Can he beat the 50 percent chance
and avoid 1, 2, and 6?)

2251
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:55,350
- 3, 4 or 5.
- You never know with him.

2252
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:56,500
All right. Eliminated.

2253
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,500
(2 was a repeat,
so he's eliminated.)

2254
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:02,800
- All right. Eliminated.
- Did you get two?

2255
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,470
- Did you get two?
- It's okay.

2256
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,970
- I can't believe it.
- It's okay.

2257
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:07,040
We're done.

2258
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,100
It's my turn.

2259
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,180
(There are 2 teams eliminated,
and Haha is currently in 5th place.)

2260
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,710
(He was the solo competitor.
What did he roll?)

2261
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:15,270
- What would it be?
- It's okay.

2262
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:17,510
Yes!

2263
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:20,250
(He passes Stage 1 with 5.)

2264
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:21,940
- Haha survived.
- It's okay.

2265
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,150
- In a row.
- Suk Jin.

2266
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,760
You have to go.

2267
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,590
He'll be in last place
if he fails, right?

2268
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,590
- You need 3.
- I need 3 or 4.

2269
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,060
This is so hard.

2270
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,460
- As long as he doesn't get six.
- I hope he doesn't.

2271
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,930
It's three. I got it earlier.

2272
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,130
- Three.
- Okay.

2273
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,930
(He rolls it with confidence
and heads it.)

2274
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:39,300
(Was his header a good move?)

2275
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:41,400
- Three.
- Okay.

2276
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,310
- Four!
- He survived.

2277
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:46,710
- Okay.
- He survived.

2278
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,350
(They went from 0 to 10 dollars.)

2279
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,570
I survived.

2280
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:53,720
- Should I go again?
- I survived.

2281
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:56,560
Except for Se Chan
and Jae Suk's teams,

2282
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,480
everybody else has to decide
what they're going to do.

2283
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:00,260
I have to keep going.

2284
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:01,980
We're in danger.

2285
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,300
- We'll keep going.
- Go for it, Tae Oh.

2286
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,600
Show them, Tae Oh.
Let's turn this game around.

2287
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,970
- I have to avoid 1, right?
- 1 or repeated numbers.

2288
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,320
(In order to pass Stage 2,
he has to avoid 1 and repeats.)

2289
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,390
- Let's turn this game around.
- All right.

2290
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,000
Avoid one.

2291
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,900
Is it going to be Haha or us?

2292
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,010
(What will Tae Oh and So Min get
in Stage 2?)

2293
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:18,340
- Okay.
- Good job.

2294
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,570
It's three.

2295
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,350
(They're good for now with 3.)

2296
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,180
What is it?

2297
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,270
- Three.
- Next.

2298
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,140
I want to turn this around.

2299
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,590
I'll be upset if that happens.

2300
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,140
Are you keep going, Jong Kook?

2301
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:31,680
- We'll stop.
- You're stopping? Okay.

2302
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,890
(They're realistic
and want to avoid the penalty.)

2303
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:33,980
He's being safe.

2304
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,720
Both of us.

2305
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,430
- Keep going or give up.
- I have 30 dollars, right?

2306
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:39,320
If Haha...

2307
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,470
- You can give up.
- It's one or the other.

2308
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,190
If you definitely want to win,
then go for it.

2309
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,640
If you stop, you might lose.

2310
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:49,340
I think stopping might be better.

2311
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,400
Still go for it.

2312
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,470
I'll...

2313
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:55,010
(Depending on his decision,
last place might change.)

2314
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:57,640
(What does Haha decide to do?)

2315
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:59,570
I'll stop.

2316
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:00,720
(He stops at 30 dollars.)

2317
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,720
Okay.

2318
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,680
If he wins, we'll be tied.

2319
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:05,680
He might keep going. You never know.

2320
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:06,850
What do I need?

2321
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,520
- Everything but 1 or 3.
- As long as it's not 1 or 3!

2322
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,670
(Repeated numbers or 1
eliminate the couples.)

2323
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:15,520
(He's eliminated if he gets 1
or Tae Oh's 3.)

2324
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,860
Good job.

2325
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:19,040
- Please!
- He'll confirm it.

2326
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,230
- 1 or 3.
- Haha is taking his chance.

2327
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:23,380
(If he gets a number other than
1 or 3, last place will change.)

2328
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:27,380
(Suk Jin and Ji Hyo are currently
in last place. What is the result?)

2329
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:35,440
(He's eliminated with 1.)

2330
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,650
(I survived!)

2331
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:42,650
(Suk Jin and Ji Hyo are confirmed
for the penalty.)

2332
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,560
I told you.

2333
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,930
All right!

2334
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:47,320
I'm not alone!

2335
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:48,820
It's confirmed.

2336
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:49,860
(This is a solo paradise
and a couple's nightmare.)

2337
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:50,930
Success!

2338
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:53,040
I did it!

2339
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,260
Success.

2340
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,640
This is so much fun.

2341
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,680
I should have told Ji Hyo
to roll the dice.

2342
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,210
- That was a clean finish.
- We have to keep going.

2343
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:02,770
This is great.

2344
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,440
I'm okay with the penalty.

2345
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:06,250
So Min, are you going to stop...

2346
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,920
- or keep going?
- We should keep going.

2347
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,720
- We'll keep going.
- Clench first place.

2348
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,560
First place might change too.

2349
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:14,060
Yura, we're pretty safe.

2350
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,650
I'll be mad
if we drop to second place.

2351
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,930
Be confident.

2352
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:19,800
(He needs an even number
to pass Stage 3.)

2353
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:23,640
(Can So Min and Tae Oh
turn the game around?)

2354
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,810
(If they land on an even number,
they collect 40 dollars right away.)

2355
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,340
(They succeeded Stage 3.)

2356
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:31,640
I did it!

2357
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:34,070
(How could this be?)

2358
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,470
- You have to keep going.
- Go.

2359
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:36,920
- Go.
- Go.

2360
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,110
If you get 5 or 6,
you jump to 1st place.

2361
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,890
- If you get 5 or 6.
- I'll keep going.

2362
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:42,920
If you get 5 or 6,
you jump to 1st place.

2363
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,610
- What's going on? This is crazy.
- I know.

2364
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:47,150
Will So Min stop Se Chan?

2365
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:48,760
- I'll go.
- Throw it up high.

2366
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,850
- Tae Oh.
- High.

2367
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:50,890
(This is the last roll of the day.)

2368
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:51,960
Will she stop him?

2369
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:55,930
(1st place will
depend on this roll.)

2370
01:20:56,390 --> 01:21:02,260
(If it lands on 5 or 6, So Min
and Tae Oh will clench 1st place.)

2371
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:08,940
(They fail to turn the game around.)

2372
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,050
(That was close.)

2373
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:12,550
That was close.
I didn't throw it high enough.

2374
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:13,610
That was close.

2375
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,850
(Se Chan and Yura win.)

2376
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:18,960
- Yura.
- First place winners are...

2377
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,350
Se Chan and Yura.

2378
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:23,130
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo are
in last place.

2379
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:25,760
(He holds his hands up.)

2380
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:27,860
(It's time for
the prize and the penalty.)

2381
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:30,860
Yura is Princess Pyeonggang today.

2382
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:32,730
- Good job, Yura.
- We were a good match.

2383
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:34,310
You transformed Ondal the fool.

2384
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:38,100
I love beef so much
that my fanclub is called Marbling.

2385
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,400
- Is that right?
- And I won this.

2386
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,380
Yura is a big eater.

2387
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:42,550
- I know.
- I agree.

2388
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:44,180
Anyway, I would like to thank
the four guests.

2389
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:45,440
Thank you!

2390
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:49,250
Are there any guests
who are curious to experience this?

2391
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,790
- Hurry up.
- Sure.

2392
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:52,980
- I won't waste time.
- We have to accept the penalty.

2393
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:55,590
- Moreover, I hope Kwang Soo...
- Right.

2394
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:59,190
recovers and joins us soon.

2395
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,930
- Right.
- We'll be waiting for him.

2396
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:03,640
- Depending on his condition,
- Correct.

2397
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,860
we'll see when he can get back.

2398
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:08,710
I hope he returns in full health.

2399
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:10,570
Also, Producer Jung Chul Min...

2400
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:12,270
and Writer Mi Yeon.

2401
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:15,750
These are staff members who have
been on Running Man for a long time.

2402
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:18,220
They're going to be joining
a different show.

2403
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:21,290
- Thank you for all your hard work.
- Thank you!

2404
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:23,460
(Great work, everybody.)

2405
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:24,790
All right.

2406
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:27,150
I talked so much
with those two standing there.

2407
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:30,130
It's scarier
when you have to wait for it.

2408
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:32,630
- I agree.
- They're still waiting.

2409
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:34,670
- Let's get this done.
- Sure.

2410
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:38,190
Chul Min, is there anything
you'd like to say?

2411
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,930
(Goodness)

2412
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:42,040
Thank you for everything.

2413
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:46,570
I'll see you again on
a different show. Thank you.

2414
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:47,770
- That's it.
- All right.

2415
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:50,220
Good work, Writer Ji Young.

2416
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,640
Stop it! Let me take the penalty!

2417
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,920
Wait up.

2418
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,420
Gosh, he knows what I don't like.

2419
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:57,390
He keeps on doing what I don't like.

2420
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:58,460
(Why do you keep going?)

2421
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,590
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2422
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:04,020
All right. 1, 2, 3.

2423
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,170
(It's green whipped cream today.)

2424
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:10,890
You're Shrek. That was good aim.

2425
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:14,260
Great work.

2426
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,430

Yura, and Na Eun of April.)

(They're excited,)

2431
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:25,140
(but there's nothing set in stone.)

2432
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:28,050
(Make a schedule for MT.)

2433
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,350
(Their project is back
to square one.)

2434
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:32,480
(They fail to save it.)

2435
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,930
(Does his ambitious presentation
succeed?)

2436
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:36,320
(Zero point for you)

2437
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,000
(Laughing)

2438
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,600

Wait.

a mysterious gas leak incident.)
