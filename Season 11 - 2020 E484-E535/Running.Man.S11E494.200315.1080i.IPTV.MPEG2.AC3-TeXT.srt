1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,820
(A theme park in Yongin,
full of spring)

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,730
- Hello.
- The weather suddenly became cold.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,820
It's warm in here.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,590
Kwang Soo's
life-sized figure is here.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,070
- He's acting cool.
- My gosh.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,000
Gosh, Kwang Soo.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,530
- Kwang Soo.
- The life-sized figure...

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,640
You mean the figure, right?

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,400
- I did.
- It's his life-sized figure.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,080
- Look at the figure of Kwang Soo.
- Gosh.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,240
Look at the life-sized
figure of Kwang Soo.

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,440
- Suk Jin.
- What?

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
I like your outfit.

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,120
You're all dressed up today.

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,180
It looks very fancy.

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,280
Why do you have
tattoos on your arms?

18
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,220
What's wrong with your clothes?

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,700
- Why?
- What's with your clothes?

20
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,220
Mind your own business.

21
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,630
- Why?
- He's dressed up today.

22
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,340
He dressed carefully.

23
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,840
He really did.

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,430
He slurred the end of his sentence.

25
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,310
- What's wrong with my clothes?
- You should wear something...

26
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,840
that's age-appropriate for you.

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,910
What's wrong about this?

28
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,380
- Don't be intimidated.
- What's wrong about this?

29
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,920
(He shakes his fingers
feeling nervous.)

30
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,390
It looks very fancy.

31
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,020
- Look at him.
- Jae Suk.

32
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,720
You know this is
Park Saeroyi's hair.

33
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,320
- Gosh, no.
- Yang Saeroyi.

34
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,960
- Stop it.
- Yang Saeroyi.

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,080
Don't do that.

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,330
Is that the hair?

37
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,000
- My goodness.
- Yang Saeroyi.

38
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,020
Really?

39
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,660
What? What did he say?

40
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,660
- A character from "Itaewon Class".
- I see.

41
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,330
- Yang Saeroyi.
- Don't do that.

42
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,610
Is that the hair?

43
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,830
No, it's not like that.

44
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,940
My hair has always been like this.

45
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,470
And he had the same hair.

46
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,940
So it's "Dongducheon Class".

47
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,800
Stop it. Don't say that.

48
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,020
It's similar though. There are
a lot of foreigners in Dongducheon.

49
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,110
- My gosh.
- Why?

50
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,220
- You look nothing like him.
- Not even close.

51
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,520
Your face looks
totally different from his.

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,720
You should change it
a little next week.

53
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,130
- Yang Saeroyi.
- You should get a haircut.

54
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,720
Did So Min and Se Chan shoot
a TV commercial?

55
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Really?

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,770
Yes.

57
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,000
- Congratulations.
- Buy us a meal.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,890
- Buy us a meal.
- Of course I will.

59
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,940
Why did you not tell me?

60
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,270
I'm disappointed you didn't tell me.

61
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,410
What was the commercial about?

62
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,550
It's for the parcel service
of a convenience store.

63
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,710
Can I say this?

64
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,640
- A parcel service.
- Yes.

65
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,380
Even people in advertising know
that they are flirting.

66
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,590
Sure.

67
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,910
- They acknowledge it.
- Right.

68
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,750
- They admit it.
- It means they know that.

69
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,480
I can't say they accept it,
but they are interested.

70
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,750
That's right.

71
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,190
- It's a good thing.
- It felt strange...

72
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,500
as I took pictures with So Min.

73
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,400
Actually I think...

74
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,660
So what are we doing today?

75
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,290
We should be careful
with outdoor activities these days.

76
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,600
A lot of people feel bored
spending time at home.

77
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,940
That's true.

78
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,200
So today, we'd like to show
how to have fun at home.

79
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,250
It's called
Running Man Has Plans Race.

80
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,680
We should have plans.

81
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,150
We have two guests to join us today.

82
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,510
I asked the two guests
to bring something they can play...

83
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,690
with the members of Running Man.

84
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,850
So is this the guests' idea?

85
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,350
Please come on out.

86
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,590
What are we doing today?

87
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,660
Who are they?

88
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,660
My gosh. Look who are here.

89
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,290
Hello.

90
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,470
(Actor Jo Byeong Gyu,
Actress Im Soo Hyang)

91
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,130
There they are.

92
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,500
Soo Hyang.

93
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,380
(Jo Byeong Gyu played an immature
character in "Stove League".)

94
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,280
(He's in Running Man
for the first time.)

95
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,700
(All the dramas she appears in
become a huge success.)

96
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,280
(Rising actress Im Soo Hyang)

97
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,280
(She's active
even in variety shows.)

98
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,320
(She's the 9th member
of Running Man.)

99
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,630
(She's the next generation
multi-entertainer, Im Soo Hyang.)

100
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,820
(Jo Byeong Gyu and Im Soo Hyang
are in Running Man.)

101
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,530
Soo Hyang.

102
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,220
It's good to see you.

103
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,730
- Byeong Gyu.
- Hello.

104
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,290
All right.

105
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,100
Come here. We go to the same gym.

106
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,410
Byeong Gyu.
Have you been doing well?

107
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,530
- Hello.
- Soo Hyang.

108
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,700
My gosh.

109
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,440
Gosh, this is so nice.

110
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,180
Byeong Gyu, what is that thing
on your back?

111
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,850
I heard this is a retreat.

112
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,410
Is it for today? I see.

113
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,850
Puffed corn.

114
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,450
We just talked about this.

115
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,450
We will never go out today.

116
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,450
We will stay indoors.

117
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,950
I brought some games...

118
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,690
- we can play indoors.
- Really?

119
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,720
I brought some eggs.

120
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
What are the eggs for?

121
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,260
We can strike them on the head.

122
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,820
- It's a random game.
- Kwang Soo's not here today.

123
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,260
And I brought
some nutrition supplements.

124
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,260
- What are they for?
- Why?

125
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,410
- You can eat it when you're hungry.
- That's a good idea.

126
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,310
- When we're hungry?
- We can eat them.

127
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,700
I have bellflower root juice
and noni juice.

128
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,680
I like noni juice.
It's good for joints.

129
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,640
He brought all kinds of juice.
Did you have them at home?

130
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,070
Yes. These are what I have
at home. There's milk thistle.

131
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,380
- What?
- Does...

132
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,120
- your family...
- Medicine.

133
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,710
I've been suffering from
nightmares these days.

134
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,560
So I take these.

135
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,930
I'm sorry, but you've never been to
a retreat before, right?

136
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,130
Is this what do people do
at retreats?

137
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,130
- What kind of retreat is this?
- This is my first time.

138
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,940
- So I'm excited.
- He's excited. I know how he feels.

139
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,690
Byeong Gyu, you've never been
to retreats before.

140
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,310
I took some time off from school,

141
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,940
so I didn't go to school.

142
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,610
I got expelled a few days ago.

143
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,810
- You got expelled?
- You talked about it before.

144
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,110
My school asked me...

145
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,680
if I wanted to be expelled or
drop out, so I chose to drop out.

146
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,750
I didn't want to drop out
because it hurts my pride.

147
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,290
- So did you get expelled?
- Yes.

148
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,120
Why would it hurt your pride?

149
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,750
Your pride has
never been hurt, right?

150
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,630
(He doesn't know
the sweets and bitters of life.)

151
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,320
- He doesn't know anything.
- He knows nothing.

152
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,590
He doesn't know the time of day.

153
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,430
(Byeong Gyu embodies the immature
character in "Stove League".)

154
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,930
Byeong Gyu looked
just like this in the drama.

155
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,240
Right. It's a cheerful character.

156
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,260
He's a guy from a rich family.

157
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,700
He joins the company
through the connection,

158
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,900
but he takes
the employment exam again.

159
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,610
- That sounds great.
- He's handsome.

160
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,770
- You look sophisticated.
- You think?

161
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,840
Haha likes sophisticated people.

162
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,680
Look at Se Chan and him.
They look totally different.

163
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,750
Why would you compare us?

164
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,190
He's good-looking.

165
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,320
- Thank you.
- Byeong Gyu is very...

166
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,380
He's perfect for a guy
from a rich family.

167
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,080
Se Chan would never play
a character like that.

168
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,380
Me? It's impossible.

169
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,060
But in fact, there are...

170
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,630
a lot of rich guys
who look like this.

171
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,930
Jong Kook!

172
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,930
(There are a lot of rich guys
who look like this.)

173
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,930
(A rich guy in reality)

174
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,570
Jong Kook, my goodness.

175
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,170
- Hang on.
- That's true.

176
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,500
There's someone
who looks just like him.

177
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,960
- It's true.
- Wait.

178
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,500
I'm serious.

179
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,180
I think I've seen someone like him.

180
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,750
It's really...

181
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,200
Rich guys in reality
don't look like him.

182
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,550
- Most of them look like this.
- That's true.

183
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,690
- This is the reality.
- Exactly.

184
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,010
And we have Ji Hyo here.

185
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,750
She's called Cavewoman Ji Hyo
these days.

186
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,820
She lives under a rock.

187
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,950
Did you watch "Stove League"?

188
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,020
I watched only three episodes.

189
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,500
("Stove League" is the best
drama guaranteed by Ji Hyo.)

190
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,630
- You watched it anyway.
- You know what?

191
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,590
If Ji Hyo watched three episodes,
it means everyone watched it.

192
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,260
I'm serious.
I watched three episodes,

193
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,090
so I was very excited
to see him earlier.

194
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,070
It's amazing
that she recognized you.

195
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,830
Ji Hyo, did you watch
"Graceful Family"?

196
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,070
(Did she watch Soo Hyang's drama,
"Graceful Family" too?)

197
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,270
I will watch it.

198
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,570
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo is
the Great Wall of dramas.)

199
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,180
- My gosh.
- See?

200
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,510
Like I said, if Ji Hyo
watched three episodes,

201
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,920
It means
the whole nation watched it.

202
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
it means everyone watched it.

203
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,880
Ji Hyo, what is the movie
that you watched recently?

204
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,130
- Or VOD.
- "Number Three"?

205
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,560
What's the latest movie you watched?

206
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,630
"Green Fish".

207
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,130
- Just anything.
- What did you watch?

208
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,130
- "Christmas in August"?
- Nothing.

209
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,890
Isn't it "Harry Potter"?

210
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,460
Ji Hyo, please tell us.

211
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,630
- I watched it yesterday.
- Did you watch it yesterday?

212
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,630
On OCN.

213
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,670
(A cable movie channel)

214
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,830
You watched it on OCN?

215
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,980
It's surprising that Ji Hyo
watched OCN yesterday.

216
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,810
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo starts
to communicate with the world.)

217
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,380
- She's improved.
- Right.

218
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,010
I didn't watch it though.

219
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,920
It was on TV when I woke up from
my nap, and I fell asleep again.

220
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,620
- You fell asleep.
- Ji Hyo is always...

221
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,620
Whenever I ask her what she
did at home, she says she slept.

222
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,820
I had a sound sleep yesterday.

223
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,020
You did?

224
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,520
He goes to the same gym with me.

225
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
- Really?
- Yes.

226
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,230
We go to the same gym.

227
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,930
Were you a soccer player
in middle school?

228
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,670
I was a soccer player.

229
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,690
Really?

230
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,740
- You were?
- So I brought a ball.

231
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,830
When did you quit?

232
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,260
I played soccer until
the third grade of middle school.

233
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,330
Jong Kook wants to cast him again.

234
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
He's always like that.

235
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,400
I saw him at the gym.

236
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,120
I heard that a lot
from people around me.

237
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,750
If I join Jong Kook's soccer team,
I'll be dead.

238
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,440
(If I join Jong Kook's soccer team,
I'll be dead.)

239
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,510
No, you won't die.

240
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,710
- That's correct.
- You won't die.

241
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,380
- He knows something.
- You won't be dead.

242
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,490
(That's not true.)

243
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,860
We go to the same gym.
But I've been avoiding him...

244
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,730
because I was afraid
he'd want to play soccer with me.

245
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,000
Why did he not tell me that?

246
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,170
Be honest.

247
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,460
What did you hear
about Jong Kook's soccer team?

248
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,870
If I play soccer in the team,

249
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,200
I might throw up during a break.

250
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,700
(Throw up?)

251
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,610
They all have plastic bags
around their necks.

252
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,980
I was told to go there
on an empty stomach.

253
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,710
People take a break
while playing soccer.

254
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,990
But our team gets a rest like that,
I tell them this.

255
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,640
"If you want to chat,
you should go to a cafe."

256
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,150
- I know that.
- "Keep moving."

257
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,250
(They have to keep moving
in order to survive.)

258
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,230
So we talked to Byeong Gyu.

259
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,800
- And we have Soo Hyang here.
- Soo Hyang.

260
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,090
Soo Hyang.

261
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,320
Our Soo Hyang.

262
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,500
When I was in college,

263
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,960
we went on a trip for three days.

264
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,860
And there was a girl who stayed for
one day. She was dressed like this.

265
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,540
She left early.

266
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,910
She just has fun and leaves early.

267
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,310
- Have fun.
- She stays for a short time.

268
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,600
- And she's cool.
- Right.

269
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,070
She just stops by and says...

270
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,280
"I have a plan tomorrow.
You guys have fun."

271
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,870
She always has sunglasses
on her head.

272
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,650
Like I always say,

273
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,320
- Soo Hyang is very cheerful.
- Really?

274
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,890
- Once she gets carried away...
- No one can deal with her.

275
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,290
Do you have any
connections with So Min?

276
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,090
We drank with Kwang Soo
the other day.

277
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,670
(We drank with Kwang Soo
the other day.)

278
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,930
Oh, that was...

279
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,140
She doesn't remember it.

280
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,330
- I ran away.
- Why?

281
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,810
Gosh, she was unbelievable.

282
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,830
- Why?
- She kept playing games.

283
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,510
She kept playing games
and made me drink.

284
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,650
- She's a professional gamer.
- I ran away.

285
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,070
- Once she drinks...
- So Min.

286
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,320
Whenever you drink with people,

287
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,820
- they have a hard time...
- What made me like this...

288
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,080
is this show, Running Man.

289
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,210
I ran away at around 3 or 4 a.m.

290
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,660
I understand why you left.

291
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,850
So Min stays there until the end
even if it's 5 or 6 a.m.

292
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,590
If it was 3 or 4 in the morning,
it's just that she went home.

293
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,990
We can say she ran away.

294
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,270
I ran away.

295
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,640
That's unbelievable.

296
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,090
I have connections with Soo Hyang.

297
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,190
- What connections?
- Really?

298
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,700
- She went to my high school.
- Really?

299
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,140
I found it out when I got here.

300
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,510
When I was in high school,
she visited...

301
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,740
our school play.

302
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,470
- She went there as a celebrity.
- Right.

303
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,050
- I was a sophomore in high school.
- Really? So?

304
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,980
I asked her to take a picture
with me in the playground.

305
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,350
- What did she say?
- Did she take a picture?

306
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,320
She said she was busy,
so she had to leave.

307
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,030
(The celebrity ran away.)

308
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,590
- She didn't take a picture.
- He got her a blow.

309
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,120
You should say that I did.

310
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,120
- Keep going.
- You should say I took a picture.

311
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,030
He's getting her a blow.

312
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,140
I think she took a picture with me.

313
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,830
(That's right.
That's what you should say.)

314
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,470
This is membership training,
but we don't know anything about it.

315
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,870
This is Running Man Has Plans Race.

316
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,370
You should plan three things
you'll do with your friends...

317
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,150
and have fun.

318
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,050
But there's one condition
we ask for.

319
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,190
All the members
start with 10 R coins.

320
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,190
The top three members...

321
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,450
with the most R coins
at the last moment will get a prize.

322
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,220
The one with the least number
of coins will get a penalty.

323
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,430
(The one with the least number
of coins will get a penalty.)

324
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,120
You will write down the three things
you want to do and present them.

325
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,540
After the presentation, the rest
of the members will give marks.

326
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,230
The one with the highest marks
will be the host today.

327
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,280
And you will stick to the schedule
that the host planned.

328
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,570
- It will be fun.
- We should plan three things.

329
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,680
That's right.

330
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,340
The host will get...

331
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,650
10 R coins when each event is over.

332
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,190
I should come up with something
that people will like.

333
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,420
- I need something that people like.
- Something interesting.

334
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,690
After one event is over,

335
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,620
if you want to change
to another person's event,

336
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,800
you can always change it
through your votes.

337
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,860
- Here's the evaluation sheet.
- Okay.

338
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,300
So we have the evaluation sheet
for the plans.

339
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,540
As you can see, the sheet says
items like screen time,

340
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,100
realistic possibility, completeness,

341
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,200
- and attitude.
- We should give scores, right?

342
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,240
Yes. Five points for each item.

343
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,370
You can give a presentation...

344
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,070
- either in the digital way...
- What?

345
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,890
- or in the analog way.
- What's digital and analog?

346
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,790
I'm more comfortable
with an analog way.

347
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,110
- Me too.
- I will do it digitally.

348
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,390
I prefer analog.

349
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,560
I want to do it digitally.

350
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,350
I'll do it in the digital way.

351
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,820
- What?
- Sir.

352
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,120
(He turns out to be
an early adapter.)

353
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,460
- Sir. Wait.
- What?

354
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,300
Will you do this digitally?

355
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,490
- Sure. I can use a pointer.
- All you can do is...

356
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,600
search on a price comparison site.

357
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,730
That's good enough.

358
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,330
Suk Jin will do it
in the digital way then.

359
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,200
(Digital: Suk Jin, So Min,
Se Chan, Byeong Gyu)

360
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,650
(Analog: Jae Suk, Jong Kook,
Haha, Ji Hyo, Soo Hyang)

361
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,370
- We should move the table.
- Will you move it?

362
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,370
Okay.

363
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,580
(A laptop for digital)

364
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,840
They will use PowerPoint.

365
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,950
- This one?
- Yes.

366
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,890
(Is Suk Jin going to be okay?)

367
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,890
As you can see, the digital team...

368
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,820
can use the laptop here.

369
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,770
Do we get bonus points
if we make it look pretty?

370
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,960
(They can get more points
for completeness.)

371
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,990
Do we?

372
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,960
You see PowerPoint there.

373
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,140
What's that?

374
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,230
(Byeong Gyu runs the program
as soon as he hears it.)

375
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,570
I will show you an example.

376
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,870
You can use the program.

377
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,700
(I can barely see it.
What's PowerPoint?)

378
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,440
(He doesn't even know
how to use it.)

379
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,150
- What's that?
- I wonder...

380
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,420
Suk Jin.

381
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,610
Does he even know what it is?

382
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,820
Why did you go there?

383
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,210
Is PowerPoint...

384
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,580
It's Excel.

385
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,480
like sending text messages?

386
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,440
Suk Jin, do you not go
to the school for the elderly?

387
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,230
- What did you say?
- The school for the elderly.

388
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,230
(He's learning late in life.)

389
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,830
(What am I supposed to do?)

390
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,830
And we have tools
for the analog team.

391
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,310
What's that? This is too much.

392
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,970
I can't believe this.

393
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,150
That belongs to Suk Jin.

394
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,440
(What's the analog tool
that shocks everyone?)

395
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,450
- What's this?
- This isn't right.

396
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,760
(Inkstone?)

397
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,220
It's calligraphy,
the analog tool of Korea.

398
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,800
You should make it look good
in the same way.

399
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,400
- This is better.
- He needs one.

400
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,940
This reminds me of the time
when I learned calligraphy.

401
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,070
Actually,

402
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,640
- it's harder to do it digitally.
- I know. This is better.

403
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,730
This is better.

404
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,150
"Enter a subject."

405
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,100
(He says digital is better,
but he doesn't know what to do.)

406
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,920
There should be a time limit.

407
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,320
It's 15 minutes.
We have to finish it by 10:15.

408
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,290
If you don't finish it in time, you
will give a presentation like that.

409
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,690
Gosh. I did this when I was
in elementary school.

410
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,560
I liked to grind an ink stick
on an inkstone.

411
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,800
I like the sound.

412
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,360
You know what?

413
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,400
Calligraphy is all about sincerity.

414
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,700
I should forget all worldly cares
grinding an ink stick.

415
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,670
- As I grind an ink stick...
- I grind them all.

416
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,040
I melt the people
I want to grind on here.

417
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,150
(I melt the people
I want to grind on here.)

418
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,370
It kills my urge.

419
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,320
- As I grind this.
- Guys.

420
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,190
- All worldly cares in your mind...
- That's right.

421
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,610
(So Min already finished
producing the template.)

422
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,690
Can you do this?

423
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,610
I've never done this before.

424
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,660
(The senior member is
a two-fingered typist.)

425
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,030
All he can do is search
on a price comparison site.

426
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,320
Retreat... Hang on.

427
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,120
Wait. What do I do?

428
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,620
This is...

429
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,690
Suk Jin, you have a mouse
next to you.

430
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,040
- What?
- There's a mouse.

431
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,170
I have a mouse.

432
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,770
(He has a mouse that works fine.)

433
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,200
He just grabbed a camera
instead of the mouse.

434
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,940
(An up-to-date mouse?)

435
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,780
He just grabbed a camera
instead of the mouse.

436
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,650
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How would he do this digitally?

437
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,420
You fool. Don't be silly.

438
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,690
Hang on. This is page one.

439
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,580
Should I create page two?

440
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,760
New slide.

441
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,450
Gosh, I did it.

442
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,190
I think I created the next page.

443
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,690
How did you make the next page?

444
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,120
Can't you do that?

445
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,270
I don't know how to do it.

446
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,930
I know how to make page two.

447
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,230
You can press Enter.

448
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,360
(His bragging ended in 3 seconds.)

449
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,330
I can just press Enter?

450
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,370
- Yes. You can just press this once.
- My gosh.

451
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,010
(It's created immediately.)

452
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,910
- This is amazing.
- Just press Enter.

453
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,550
- Suk Jin is...
- It came up as I pressed Enter.

454
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,290
That's Shift. Press this key.

455
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,260
(He keeps pressing Shift.)

456
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
(Frustrated)

457
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,850
What's with him?

458
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,770
(He pressed the laughter key
instead of the Enter key.)

459
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,360
Thank you.

460
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,330
It looks like a grandson teaches
his grandpa how to use a computer.

461
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,570
It's like he's doing volunteer work.

462
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,810
An old man is here to learn.

463
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,940
Byeong Gyu looks like a college
student doing his homework.

464
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,210
And So Min looks like a girl
who's here for Byeong Gyu.

465
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,940
(She's obsessed with the guy
doing his homework.)

466
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,790
She doesn't have anything
in her laptop.

467
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,950
She just came here
to see Byeong Gyu.

468
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,030
That's right. I came with him.

469
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,260
Gosh, I still have
the calligraphy skills.

470
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,170
- You're good.
- I know.

471
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,270
I learned calligraphy
when I was in elementary school.

472
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,670
I should write down
the program for the first class.

473
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,010
The first class.

474
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,230
I should feed them
in the first class.

475
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,570
I thought about what to eat...

476
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,550
All right. It's ramyeon.
But what matters is...

477
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,050
what kind of ramyeon we are eating.

478
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,190
- Is it jjapaguri?
- What?

479
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,340
(What is he? He's scary.)

480
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,950
I guess that's what it is.
Jjapaguri.

481
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,390
Gosh, this is...

482
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,950
I want to add a picture of pillows,
but I don't know what to do.

483
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,060
Wait.

484
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,620
You can type pillow.

485
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,720
Then you can copy the picture.

486
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,490
His way of talking is so funny.

487
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,460
"You can type pillow."

488
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,960
(He was afraid
if Suk Jin might not hear him.)

489
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,270
Pillow...

490
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,570
Does anyone know
how to spell pillow?

491
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,550
- Pillow?
- It's pillow.

492
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,550
- P-i-l?
- P-i-l-l-o-w.

493
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,640
Pillow.

494
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,070
P-e-l.

495
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,410
- What are you talking about?
- It's p-e-l.

496
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,910
It's p-i-l-l-o-w.

497
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,120
- Isn't it p-e-l?
- It's p-i-l.

498
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,730
It's p-i-l-l-o-w.

499
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,420
It's p-i-l-l-o-w.

500
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,920
Of course.

501
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,820
It's 11:08am now.

502
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,570
It ends at 11:15.

503
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,900
(They pick up the pace
to finish it in time.)

504
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,980
Save the image.

505
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,240
Where's Save?

506
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,170
Jae Suk, Suk Jin is
about to swear now.

507
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,070
How do I save this image?
It's so annoying.

508
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,250
- Do you know how to save an image?
- Yes.

509
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,640
How do you know?

510
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,180
Save it in my heart.

511
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,290
Wait.

512
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,420
Watch this.
Look at the image and say,

513
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,790
"Save it in my heart."

514
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,350
- Then the image is saved?
- Sure.

515
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,030
If you want to save it
inside your eyes, do this.

516
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,590
Goodness.

517
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,970
- Press Ctrl, Alt, and Delete.
- What?

518
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,830
- Press Ctrl, Alt, and Delete.
- Ctrl.

519
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,830
Ctrl, Alt...

520
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,780
(He follows Se Chan's instructions.)

521
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,870
(He closes the program.)

522
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,450
What is it?

523
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,870
Everything's gone!

524
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,980
(That's the shortcut
for closing down a window.)

525
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,950
You have 15 minutes.

526
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,180
- I'm serious. We changed teams.
- Where is it?

527
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,880
So we're going to be strict.

528
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,350
Okay, okay.

529
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
Let's see.

530
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,060
You have three minutes.

531
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,820
Three? Hold on.

532
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,700
It's on my wallpaper.

533
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,230
I have a wallpaper of a pillow.

534
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,430
(He has a pillow wallpaper?)

535
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,470
(He's currently struggling
by himself.)

536
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,770
This is driving me crazy.

537
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,040
- You need to start it again.
- Wait.

538
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,870
(One can always learn new things.)

539
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,170
Goodness.

540
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,870
It's been 14 minutes now.

541
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,170
- We have a minute left?
- Hold on.

542
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,250
(They only have 1 minute left.)

543
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,050
In the past, we used to wait
until everyone was done.

544
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,220
But we won't do that anymore.

545
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,180
- Suk Jin, please stop.
- Okay.

546
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,350
Gosh.

547
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,490
(He's not finished yet,
but they're taking his computer.)

548
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,320
You're taking it?

549
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,530
They're taking our computers.

550
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,530
(What are their programs?)

551
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,420
Who should start first?

552
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,800
- Should I?
- Sure.

553
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,360
Hello, everyone.

554
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

555
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,810
- His looks so simple.
- I know.

556
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,010
Most retreats are full...

557
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,100
of games.

558
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,170
I'm sure you all have
various programs planned out.

559
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,720
But I believe having no set program
is the best.

560
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,870
That's what I believe.

561
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,950
(Eat ramyeon, With Kwang Soo,
Shouting in the silence)

562
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,290
- That's the most convenient.
- So...

563
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,290
I've simplified my program.

564
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,420
You're explaining everything.

565
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,560
- You are.
- Yes.

566
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,920
I refrained from taking up
too much of your time...

567
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,500
because I want you all...

568
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,090
to go home early.

569
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,100
That's lovely.

570
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,860
My program is very simplified,
and you can eat quickly.

571
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,100
The game won't take too long,
and you'll go home early.

572
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,980
- That's how my program will be.
- That's wonderful.

573
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,450
We'll be spending about six hours.

574
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,680
- That's how long it'll take.
- Six hours?

575
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,550
Wait, how long are we having
ramyeon for?

576
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,990
- Wait.
- Six hours?

577
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,610
- I thought it'd be simple.
- It is.

578
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,920
Will that program
even last that long?

579
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,960
Of course.

580
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,460
- Because...
- I think it'll take two hours.

581
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,150
Come on. We'll be chatting.

582
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,230
- Still, that's impossible.
- No.

583
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,800
We should let Byeong Gyu talk.

584
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,860
Right.

585
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,070
- Soo Hyang as well.
- That's nice.

586
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,100
- Don't you know me?
- What do you mean?

587
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,770
I'm a veteran host.

588
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,870
(You all know that.)

589
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,040
(His skills are acknowledged.)

590
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,900
- Right.
- That's it.

591
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,840
- I'll give you a high score.
- Okay. Thank you.

592
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,020
Right.

593
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,110
That was nice.

594
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,880
- I like it too.
- "Yoo Jae Suk".

595
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,080
Hold on.

596
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,410
"Attitude, one point".

597
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,490
(He's merciless.)

598
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,460
Now that I know
what you've given me,

599
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,820
you better watch out.

600
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,490
"He chats a lot,"

601
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,060
"but his material
isn't that detailed."

602
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,700
(He mainly focuses on chatting.)

603
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,820
- "Seven points".
- "Yoo Jae Suk".

604
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,770
He deserved five points
for "realistic possibility".

605
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,430
Next up is Jong Kook.

606
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,270
Your handwriting looks nice.

607
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,670
- All right.
- He's dexterous.

608
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,980
- Jong Kook.
- He wrote well.

609
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,840
(Random trashcan basketball,
A talk with Writer Jeon,)

610
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,340
(With Trainer Kook)

611
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,750
- That's wonderful.
- "Writer Jeon"?

612
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,790
What is that?

613
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,180
- What is that?
- "Writer Jeon"?

614
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,320
- I'm going to give you zero points.
- What is that?

615
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,560
Listen.

616
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,790
Who's "Writer Jeon"?

617
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,990
It's her.

618
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,650
I've published a book.

619
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,700
(It's me.)

620
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,770
He asked who Writer Jeon was.

621
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,820
(Giggling)

622
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,300
- You published a book?
- Yes.

623
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,540
We'll start off by staying loyal
to our show...

624
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,400
and playing a game.

625
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,070
You need to throw objects
into a trashcan.

626
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,740
- Random objects? That's nice.
- They'll be random.

627
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,570
Yes. It'll be entertaining
for our viewers to watch.

628
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,370
- It'll be a light game.
- That's nice.

629
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,640
After that, we'll eat...

630
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,320
and talk with Writer Jeon.

631
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,680
What if we don't have anything
to talk about?

632
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,320
We'll read her book.

633
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,820
- Her book?
- You'll open it...

634
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,320
to a random page
and have a chat with her about it.

635
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,620
Here's the last one.
People are very interested...

636
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,920
in watching workout videos
these days.

637
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,770
- I'm not sure about that.
- So...

638
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,770
- I'll teach you some moves.
- I don't like that.

639
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,830
They'll help you lose weight.

640
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm against that.

641
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,040
I saw how your manager almost died.

642
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,400
We'll be working out together.

643
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,870
- We'll work out together.
- Hold on.

644
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,250
I'm not sure about that.

645
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,640
You don't seem interested.

646
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,450
I'm interested in all of them.

647
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,680
- What's wrong?
- You've lost points...

648
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,020
since I don't like to read.

649
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,320
Come on.

650
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,380
I've given you a high score.

651
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,960
I love "A talk with Writer Jeon".

652
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,230
- Should I go next?
- Okay.

653
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,060
Okay. Haha.

654
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,620
You have nice handwriting.

655
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,000
"A Noisy Retreat Mission"!

656
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,270
(A Noisy Retreat Mission)

657
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,570
I don't like that.

658
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,540
- I don't like that.
- Why not?

659
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,780
- Try it.
- Let's hear him out first.

660
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,100
Here's the first program.

661
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,480
"Crazy Ping-Pong Match"!

662
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,320
I don't like that attitude.
I'll give you one point.

663
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,790
- I don't like that.
- I really don't.

664
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,490
Now comes the second program.

665
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,820
"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,
Hilarious Lunch Time"!

666
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,820
- We'll be having random ramyeon.
- Gosh.

667
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,700
- "Hilarious"?
- Ping-pong will be random as well.

668
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,800
This will be random as well.

669
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,770
- I'm going to give you one point.
- Don't you think it'll be fun?

670
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,130
"A Noisy Retreat Mission"!

671
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,070
- Sit down.
- It overlaps with his.

672
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,310
Sit down, you betrayer.

673
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,430
(He wants him to stop.)

674
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,840
- His attitude annoys me.
- Next up is Ji Hyo.

675
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,610
I look forward to her program.

676
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,550
- Ji Hyo.
- This is mine.

677
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,790
Is it a ghost leg.

678
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,840
It'll be very simple.

679
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,180
- What is that?
- "Nap for now"?

680
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,260
- "Nap..."
- We'll be taking a nap first.

681
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,260
(Nap for now)

682
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,460
(She wants to take a nap wherever.)

683
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,620
(It suits her.)

684
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,420
- And then?
- We'll eat.

685
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,070
- And then?
- And then, we'll nap again.

686
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,570
(They'll nap, eat, and nap again.)

687
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,360
What about our show?

688
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,770
- Come on, Ji Hyo.
- Hey.

689
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,970
Come on.

690
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,970
We'll shoot our show
while lying down.

691
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,480
"Screen time, zero points".

692
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,840
You're determined
not to shoot anything.

693
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,170
Byeong Gyu said he's been having
nightmares these days.

694
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,280
Have you actually seen anyone
have nightmares?

695
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,640
- No.
- Today, you'll be able to.

696
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,720
That's nice.

697
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,610
- Have those nightmares.
- What?

698
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,320
You may.

699
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,560
(She urges him to have nightmares.)

700
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,580
- This suddenly sounds fun.
- That's screen time right there.

701
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,680
That sounds fun.

702
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,700
Have your nightmares.

703
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,800
She's convincing.

704
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,160
- It's nice.
- Think about it.

705
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,390
Have you ever witnessed someone
having nightmares on the spot?

706
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,330
- No.
- This is your chance.

707
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,660
Byeong Gyu,
do you get nightmares often?

708
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,570
- Yes, I'll be having them today.
- He's been having them often.

709
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,070
What's "free time"?

710
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,980
You can take a walk.

711
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,510
- "A walk"?
- Yes.

712
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,550
That's original.

713
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,480
Where's the fun in taking a walk?
I'm curious.

714
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,550
Where is it?

715
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,380
- You need to meet a wild animal.
- Really?

716
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,960
You'll fight off the animal.

717
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,320
(Thanks to Jong Kook,
her program sounds more fun.)

718
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,030
She's won some points.

719
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,120
I think this episode...

720
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,730
- will be fun.
- Really.

721
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,760
I've given you at least four points.

722
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,850
Mine rose from 0 to 2 points.

723
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,850
Your score...

724
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,970
is higher than Jae Suk's.

725
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,860
- Me too.
- Really?

726
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,700
- Is it higher?
- She almost got a full score.

727
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,740
- Exactly.
- Hers is the best.

728
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,810
That's why she got a full score.

729
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,070
Goodness.

730
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,370
- Gosh.
- Soo Hyang is next.

731
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,050
(Next up is Soo Hyang.)

732
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,820
Why is she carrying a bag?

733
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,140
- It's the girl who left early.
- Why is she carrying a bag?

734
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,910
It's not her, is it?

735
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,880
- It's the girl who left early.
- She looks similar.

736
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,910
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

737
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,120
Hello.

738
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,800
Don't you have plans
in Gangnam later?

739
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,350
I'm running out of time,

740
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,920
- so I'll be quick.
- Right.

741
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,120
It's her.

742
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,470
"Welcome. This Must Be
Your First Retreat."

743
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,240
("Welcome. This Must Be
Your First Retreat.)

744
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,160
- I like her attitude.
- Me too.

745
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,170
Which segment during a retreat
encourages cooperation...

746
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,480
and is the most important?

747
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,840
- It's the games.
- Right.

748
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,480
- We need to play games.
- We'll get to know each other.

749
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,910
- She's good.
- That's why I chose family arcade.

750
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,340
In that segment,

751
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,550
there's Cry in Silence...

752
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,320
and Speak with Your Actions.

753
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Soo Hyang,
unlike your outer appearance,

754
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,850
your games are a bit outdated.

755
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,000
She's old-fashioned.
There's even the mafia game.

756
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,060
(Soo Hyang is old-fashioned.)

757
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,470
(Speechless)

758
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,770
She's flustered.

759
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,930
- This is retro style.
- I see.

760
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,930
- This is the trend.
- I see.

761
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,010
- Having plain ramyeon is boring,
- That's tasty.

762
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,100
so I'll cook kimchi fried rice.

763
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,980
- You'll be cooking?
- You'll be cooking?

764
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,980
Are you good?
Have you cooked it before?

765
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,070
She's good.

766
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,170
I'm good at making it.

767
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,640
I've had her dish before.

768
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,880
She's good.

769
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,260
This is a snack.

770
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,320
(She pulls out some jjondeugi.)

771
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,380
- Do you want some?
- This program sounds nice.

772
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,680
- Don't you?
- Yes.

773
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,150
You can try some right now.

774
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,850
- Okay.
- If you pick me,

775
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,360
- I'll let you have more.
- What's the reason?

776
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,420
Goodness.

777
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,730
I'll give you all of these.

778
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,860
- Our lunch will be...
- We'll...

779
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,200
- What are those?
- Gosh.

780
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,860
- What are those?
- You threw them.

781
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,860
(She pulls out packets of jjondeugi
from her bag.)

782
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,510
This is jjondeugi flex.

783
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,140
- You're right.
- This is jjondeugi flex.

784
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,370
Your score is rising.

785
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,110
- My gosh.
- Okay.

786
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,080
- I've given her the highest score.
- Me too.

787
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,790
- Let's move onto the digital ones.
- Yes.

788
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,720
- Suk Jin.
- All right.

789
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,790
(Suk Jin goes first.)

790
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,620
It'll be harder than you think.

791
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Let me introduce my program.

792
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,230
- Please look here.
- Okay.

793
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,890
Look here, please.

794
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:02,040
"If you want to have fun,
follow me!"

795
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,400
I hate it. "Attitude, zero points".

796
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,170
This is the title.

797
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,840
- We'll have some fun.
- Let's hear him out first.

798
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,340
It'll be fun. Let's move on.

799
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
Clap.

800
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,370
(Clapping)

801
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,050
- All right. Pillow fight.
- What is that?

802
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,720
- We'll be doing this.
- What?

803
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,320
- We don't have any pillows.
- What is that?

804
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,680
- This is...
- Pillow fight.

805
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,880
Where are the pillows, you ask?
It's here.

806
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,320
Here.

807
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,620
It took me eight minutes
to find this image.

808
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,770
- What's with him?
- Please do understand.

809
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,420
We could play "Find the pillow".

810
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,830
(No one knew he worked so hard
to find that image.)

811
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,090
I didn't notice it.

812
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,740
- I didn't notice it.
- Me neither.

813
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,810
Right.

814
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,900
Please understand
the effort I've put into this.

815
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,240
All right, next.

816
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,400
(Happy lunch time. Let's have)

817
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,140
Why didn't you finish the sentence?

818
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,340
You see...

819
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,370
This was when the staff
took my laptop.

820
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,680
What were you going to write?

821
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,610
- "Let's have a tasty meal."
- "Let's have..."

822
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,350
- Goodness.
- I had so much more to write.

823
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,890
I'm not kidding.
I can only give him a point.

824
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,960
Anyway, please be generous
with your points.

825
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,300
It was entertaining though.
Byeong Gyu is next.

826
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,700
- He did a good job.
- He worked hard on his.

827
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
Is Byeong Gyu good at these things?

828
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,900
- Yes.
- His looked really good.

829
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,360
Well, I am the youngest here.

830
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,600
Let's take a look then.

831
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,980
Sure.

832
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,900
Let's take a look then.

833
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,980
Sure.

834
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,310
(His presentation material
looks different right off the bat.)

835
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,840
- Nice.
- It looks good.

836
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,840
As you can see,
I laid the letters on the photo.

837
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,680
This isn't easy to accomplish.

838
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,490
- Really?
- But you don't have a computer...

839
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,880
- at home.
- Well, I was able to...

840
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,700
figure out the functions.

841
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,820
- He's the type to show off.
- Right.

842
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,860
Okay, Mr. Show-off. Noted.

843
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,500
I'm deducting two points for that.

844
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,540
- I'm deducting one.
- So he's arrogant.

845
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,630
I'll write down "arrogant."

846
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,630
- He likes to show off.
- That's right.

847
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,540
Anyway, let's move on.

848
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,240
- What?
- Wait, what's that?

849
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,640
Didn't it appear
from Kwang Soo's nose?

850
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,010
The letters came from his nose.

851
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,910
- How? Let's see that again.
- What was that?

852
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,280
If this was something
to brag about...

853
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,020
Can you do that again?
I didn't get to see it.

854
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,340
Gosh, look at that.

855
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,490
No way.

856
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,720
I did it myself.

857
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,350
I found this feature.

858
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,320
- He's showing off again.
- What?

859
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,350
He can't help himself.

860
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,000
You like to brag, aren't you?

861
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,590
You get what
I'm capable of now, right?

862
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,420
Okay, let's move on.

863
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,860
- First class...
- Beat Jong Kook.

864
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,970
That's right.

865
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,090
Why did you space out
his name like that?

866
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,430
So his grammar isn't that good.

867
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,370
- The spacing is odd.
- Byeong Gyu,

868
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,170
your grammar isn't that good.

869
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,450
"Bad grammar and a show-off."

870
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,510
(Bad grammar and a show-off)

871
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,140
A show-off.

872
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,570
Right. And next?

873
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,050
- Lunch.
- Lunch time.

874
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,680
I laid the letters...

875
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,350
- in front of the photo.
- Stop mentioning that.

876
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,530
You've said it enough.

877
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,730
"Annoyingly boastful."

878
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,460
I wanted my visual aid
to score me at least five points.

879
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,800
- Right.
- That you get.

880
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,000
- Five points.
- Of course.

881
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,800
However, your attitude sucks.

882
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,300
You're scoring zero points
as a presenter.

883
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,900
Still, I gave you five points
in terms of visual aid.

884
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,100
- Me too.
- Me too.

885
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,510
- That's right.
- Thank you.

886
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,510
All right.

887
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,480
It's "Rich, Poor, and Fun Retreat"!

888
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,010
What on earth is that?

889
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,280
To the next page, please.

890
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,670
First class, Cry in Silence.

891
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,720
- I had the same idea.
- It's not original at all.

892
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,250
How boring!

893
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,680
Third class,
Three Smartphone Games.

894
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,880
All right, fine. We get it.

895
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,730
What do you mean?

896
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,560
You've received the lowest score.

897
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,590
- Unbelievable.
- Well,

898
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,700
- photos and...
- This isn't enough to air.

899
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,890
This would've been funnier
with a photo.

900
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,090
I give you 1 to 2 points
for feasibility.

901
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,360
- So Min is the last one up.
- Sure.

902
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,710
Hello,

903
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,400
- I'm Jeon So Min.
- This is a nice start.

904
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,430
I'm sorry, but what is that?

905
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,710
- Why that photo?
- You're the face of Running Man.

906
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,870
- She's right.
- I see.

907
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,220
Let's move on to the next page.

908
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,610
Two,

909
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,720
Yum-yum Time!

910
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,580
- Yum-yum?
- At 50?

911
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,450
- Mamma mia!
- Unbelievable.

912
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,290
Let's all enjoy a cooking session.

913
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,420
- Here.
- That I don't want to see.

914
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
This is bad.

915
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,000
- Three.
- It started off all right, but...

916
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,460
- Next up is...
- I'm already over this one.

917
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,530
It's the third activity.

918
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,090
- You typed in a lot.
- Right.

919
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,800
Earlier, I saw that
"saand" was available.

920
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,740
- "Saand"?
- With two As?

921
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,330
(They spot a typo.)

922
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,710
She got the spelling wrong.

923
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,900
Saand?

924
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,100
- Am I wrong?
- You got the spelling wrong.

925
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,450
- That's not how you write it.
- Seriously?

926
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,400
"She reminds me of Byeong Gyu."

927
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,340
I only got the spacing wrong though.

928
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,840
"She's like Byeong Gyu."

929
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,720
Let's go treasure hunting.

930
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,080
- Next.
- Its feasibility...

931
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,490
- Saand...
- "Saand"?

932
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,490
(Saand)

933
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,880
It wasn't just a typo.

934
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,590
Writer Jeon?

935
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,590
- You...
- What a huge disappointment.

936
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,090
It's an honest mistake.

937
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,890
You had me fooled all these years.

938
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,630
For 30 years, you knew that
as the spelling of "sand"?

939
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,600
I had to type at a fast speed, guys.

940
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,400
You say you were in a rush,

941
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,810
but you typed them all
with two As.

942
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,210
- Exactly.
- Guys,

943
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,710
doesn't it sound like fun?

944
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,710
(She quickly wraps it up
with a cute gesture.)

945
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,520
You get one point for presentation
because of that annoying tone.

946
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,320
- Writer Jeon...
- Just so you know,

947
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,580
you startled me
with the spelling of sand.

948
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,880
- Gosh, I'm embarrassed.
- Stick to books from now on.

949
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,720
Soo Hyang has the highest score...

950
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,420
- while So Min has the lowest.
- Just stick to books.

951
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,460
- Really?
- I gave Jong Kook...

952
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,500
the highest score.

953
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,850
- I...
- Jong Kook...

954
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,320
- Right.
- His plan got good points too.

955
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,230
- Let me now read...
- All right.

956
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,390
- some of your comments.
- Sure thing.

957
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,360
Right.

958
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,830
Ji Hyo, why did you
give everyone the same score?

959
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,070
- Everyone?
- Mine too?

960
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,900
- Couldn't you be bothered?
- Mine too?

961
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,600
- You couldn't be bothered.
- That's not it.

962
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,450
It's my way of saying
that I'm fine with all the options.

963
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,950
Look. She gave me 4, 4, 4,
and 5 points, and it's 7 in total,

964
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,790
which is what she
also gave Jong Kook.

965
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,460
The same goes for Haha.

966
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,880
4, 4, 4?
Are you telling us to drop dead?

967
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,500
She wrote jjondeugi for Soo Hyang
and Yang Se Chan for Se Chan.

968
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,300
Are you kidding me?

969
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,300
Well...

970
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,360
- Was she writing in her diary?
- Were you scribbling?

971
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,970
What on earth is this?

972
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,070
- I wrote what was memorable.
- You were scribbling.

973
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,010
- Those were memorable.
- Goodness. Cavewoman Ji Hyo.

974
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,210
So let me read what Soo Hyang wrote.

975
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,210
Jae Suk.

976
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,640
"I almost fell for his words."

977
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,070
(This is how Soo Hyang
evaluated Jae Suk's program.)

978
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,570
"His eloquent presentation
grabbed my attention,"

979
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,840
"but he lacked sincerity."

980
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,520
- You finally came to your senses.
- Next is So Min's program.

981
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,610
"Doesn't sound like fun."

982
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,460
(Doesn't sound like fun.)

983
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,460
I bet that hurts.

984
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,730
- Hold on.
- She thinks it'll be boring.

985
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,700
But my program is the bomb!

986
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,500
I'm glad she didn't go harsher
than that.

987
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,070
Next up is Jong Kook's evaluation.

988
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,800
He wrote that
Se Chan's program is boring...

989
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,590
while Suk Jin's is no fun.

990
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,090
(Jong Kook's evaluation sheet)

991
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,600
Boring and no fun?

992
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,710
- What about So Min's?
- He wrote that Byeong Gyu...

993
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,540
bragged too much.

994
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,370
It's the same
as writing hate comments!

995
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,410
What? Hate comments?

996
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,520
Starting with Se Chan's,
what you wrote were hate comments.

997
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,080
- Yes, from mine...
- Gosh,

998
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,790
it really hurts to hear that.

999
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,520
Next up is Haha's.

1000
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,120
Jae Suk...

1001
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,060
"The Grand Award winner of 2019..."

1002
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,090
(The Grand Award winner of 2019...)

1003
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,620
This is what Haha wrote.

1004
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,700
"The Grand Award winner of 2019."

1005
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,630
"I still believe in Jae Suk..."

1006
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,830
Who are you kissing up to?

1007
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,860
- Unbelievable.
- Seriously?

1008
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,810
"We have the same ideas."

1009
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,480
Yes, that's why I wrote it.

1010
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,100
- Gosh.
- He wrote that Suk Jin...

1011
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,750
should only focus
on staying healthy.

1012
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,910
(From Haha to Suk Jin)

1013
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,410
(The words Haha
never got the chance to say?)

1014
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,990
Are we writing letters instead?

1015
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,580
"Only focus on staying healthy".

1016
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,960
- Gosh.
- Anyway, that's all.

1017
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,580
The points have been added.

1018
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,850
- Who's in first place?
- Who won?

1019
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,420
The programs in 1st and 2nd place...

1020
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,360
only were a point apart.

1021
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,360
So the winner by a point is...

1022
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,330
(Who won by receiving 1 more point?)

1023
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,600
- It's Jong Kook.
- Goodness!

1024
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
All right!

1025
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,800
Now I feel burdened.

1026
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,470
Soo Hyang's program
is in second place.

1027
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,010
So the first game you play...

1028
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,850
will be Random Trashcan Basketball.

1029
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,350
- Okay.
- Good.

1030
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,260
Everyone will receive
10 regular coins...

1031
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,390
and Jong Kook will receive
extra 10 coins for being a host.

1032
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,180
You'll all change...

1033
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,200
and play the game
suggested by Jong Kook.

1034
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,490
Let's go!

1035
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,490
(The retreat begins!)

1036
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,070
We'll now begin
the first item in today's program.

1037
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,430
Random Trashcan Basketball?

1038
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,870
- We...
- It won't be easy.

1039
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,510
What happens to the 10 coins
the host Jong Kook has?

1040
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,470
Must he hand them over
to the next host?

1041
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,870
The host will receive 10 coins
every session.

1042
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,350
- Every session?
- Really?

1043
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,050
Jong Kook can use those coins
however he sees fit.

1044
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,220
One more thing.

1045
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,780
The props needed
can be bought from the next room.

1046
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,990
So they're sold?

1047
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,850
We prepared props
needed for fun games...

1048
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,200
as well as snacks
and food ingredients.

1049
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,430
We can buy them?

1050
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,430
I explained the rules earlier.

1051
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,330
- Yes, perfectly.
- We all know the rules.

1052
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,600
You will compete in two teams.

1053
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
- Two teams?
- Yes.

1054
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,300
One from each team will come out...

1055
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,200
and choose a card with
various objects written on them.

1056
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:28,010
Your objective is
to throw them into the trashcan.

1057
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,700
The winning team...

1058
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,510
will receive five coins
from the staff.

1059
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,350
Simple, right?

1060
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,680
Nice.

1061
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,950
- How simple and clear was that?
- Sounds like fun.

1062
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,620
- I can't wait.
- It sounds exciting.

1063
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,330
- The winning team...
- Let's get on his good side.

1064
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,390
(They kiss up to him silently.)

1065
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,450
I will also hand out
the coins I have...

1066
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,600
to those who deserve it.

1067
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,970
- All right.
- Nice!

1068
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,200
(They keep kissing up to him.)

1069
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,300
Those bootlickers.

1070
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,410
- Let's decide the teams first.
- Right.

1071
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,530
How many people are there?

1072
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,640
- 9 people.
- 9.

1073
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,970
Right, nine.

1074
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,510
How about 3 teams of 3?

1075
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,350
3 teams of 3? Nice one!

1076
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,970
- No. 1 in place.
- No. 2 in place.

1077
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,180
I'm in place.

1078
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,320
(They immediately join Jong Kook.)

1079
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,220
- Unbelievable.
- Look at them.

1080
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,140
- Those bootlickers.
- Those suck-ups.

1081
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,220
Well, I guess we already
have one team then.

1082
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,330
(The host calls it.)

1083
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,220
(Team Jong Kook has been decided.)

1084
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,530
Nice!

1085
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,300
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, yes!

1086
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,300
(Nice!)

1087
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,330
So that's your team?

1088
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,600
- Yes.
- This is absurd.

1089
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,330
- This isn't right.
- I'm not one...

1090
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,700
to make things complicated.

1091
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,240
They came to me in a natural way.

1092
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,530
He's the best host.

1093
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,700
Then let's form a team ourselves.

1094
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,470
- Okay, good.
- Us three.

1095
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,470
We're a team of three too.
Are we good to go?

1096
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,120
- Yes, I like this team.
- It seems fun.

1097
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,780
- Nice.
- The ladies.

1098
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,220
- Nice one.
- Byeong Gyu, it's too bad.

1099
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,680
- Are we a team then?
- Yes.

1100
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,950
Good.

1101
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,050
I'm not sure
I'm okay with this team.

1102
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,680
Get over here.

1103
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,780
We're not that bad.

1104
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,830
(You'll grow to like us.)

1105
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,050
It's as if he's being
bullied by his uncles.

1106
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,450
Byeong Gyu, shut it.

1107
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,220
I feel like I'm being punished.

1108
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,700
(They have their 3 teams.)

1109
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,600
Please pick up the objects first.

1110
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,410
- All right. Se Chan...
- Se Chan, let's go.

1111
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,970
- and Haha, get going.
- Yes, sir!

1112
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,410
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1113
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,700
(Dashing)

1114
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
Unbelievable.

1115
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,800
Make sure they'll give us
a good laugh.

1116
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,510
Those bootlickers.

1117
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,280
- Those suck-ups.
- Those suck-ups.

1118
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:15,220
Wait. Oh, the trashcan.

1119
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,680
I see the props.

1120
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,120
Must we pay for these?

1121
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,680
The staff came well-prepared today.

1122
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,180
Tell me about it.

1123
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,450
Must we pay for this too?

1124
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,800
Yes.

1125
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,720
- Wait.
- Out of our own pockets?

1126
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,490
- Yes.
- No way.

1127
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,530
(Dashing)

1128
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,700
- There's an issue.
- Jong Kook!

1129
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,640
We must pay for the props.

1130
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,330
- What? You have to pay?
- Yes.

1131
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,600
- With coins.
- How much is it?

1132
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
It seems like
you'll have to collect, sir.

1133
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,100
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1134
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,280
There are a variety
of props back there.

1135
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,010
But none of them are for free.

1136
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,410
Unbelievable.

1137
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,890
What are you two doing?

1138
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,220
I'll never do...

1139
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,780
- Jong Kook's games again.
- At first...

1140
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,660
I've had it with these two.

1141
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,680
I'm looking for volunteers
who'll offer their coins...

1142
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,450
for our show today.

1143
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,530
I'll give you a prize.

1144
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,120
Jong Kook, then...

1145
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,720
- let's play Race of Wits.
- What?

1146
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,430
Make the losers pay.

1147
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,600
Hold him.

1148
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,700
(How dare you?)

1149
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,830
Kneel!

1150
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,780
How dare you...

1151
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,470
How dare you say that?

1152
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,100
You need a lesson.

1153
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,410
How dare you?

1154
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,010
- Our host was talking.
- Be quiet!

1155
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,080
Be quiet!

1156
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,410
- Be quiet!
- Okay.

1157
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,280
- I'll take care of him.
- Okay.

1158
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,080
Okay, good.

1159
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,820
How could you
just stand by and watch?

1160
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,580
Byeong Gyu, how could you?

1161
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,990
You deserved it.

1162
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,800
Please volunteer.

1163
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,760
Show me how enthusiastic
you are about the first round.

1164
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,800
Wait.

1165
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,760
Shouldn't the host pay
for the game tools?

1166
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,160
That's right. You should.

1167
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,260
That's how it works.

1168
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,970
What are you talking about, kid?

1169
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,830
Take care of him!

1170
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,140
How dare you?

1171
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,930
Okay, good.

1172
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,550
- Gosh, you guys...
- This is not okay.

1173
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,280
- My team is too weak.
- We'll bring some tools,

1174
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,220
and the losing team will pay
for them. What do you say?

1175
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,320
- That sounds great.
- Thank you.

1176
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,490
(I'm getting hot.)

1177
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,430
Jong Kook, Jae Suk is
getting ready to fight.

1178
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,100
(Ready for combat?)

1179
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,850
He's getting ready to fight!

1180
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,430
I'll let you fight.

1181
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,800
Do you want to do it?

1182
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,430
- Do you want to do it?
- Okay!

1183
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,260
- I was getting hot.
- Okay!

1184
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,930
I was getting hot,
so I wanted to change.

1185
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,010
Isn't it too white?

1186
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,410
- It's too white.
- You look so weak.

1187
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,550
- I was getting hot.
- You were getting hot?

1188
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,870
- He's getting ready to fight.
- Okay.

1189
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,410
- Pay participation fees.
- You have to.

1190
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,080
Each team will pay one coin.

1191
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,580
Each team will pay one coin?

1192
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,550
Each team gets to decide how to pay.

1193
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,780
If I like a team's method,

1194
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,550
- They'll win a point.
- I'll remember it.

1195
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,100
We'll fight.

1196
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,330
I love that.

1197
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,830
Byeong Gyu.

1198
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,800
- He thinks his teammates are weak.
- Byeong Gyu.

1199
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,530
Be quiet, will you?

1200
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,260
He's very brave.

1201
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,640
I love it.

1202
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,970
- That's definitely my style.
- Good job.

1203
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,680
I think the youngest member
should pay.

1204
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,200
(Soo Hyang is the youngest.)

1205
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,620
Ji Hyo, you're okay with it, right?

1206
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,580
Running Man is scary.

1207
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,180
They just steal your money.

1208
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,890
- We'll play Race of Wits.
- We'll play Race of Wits.

1209
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,050
That sounds good.
The three of you will play.

1210
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,220
- Okay.
- Ready.

1211
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,260
Can you say, "Start"?

1212
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,390
- Start.
- Start.

1213
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,530
- 1.
- 2.

1214
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,530
- 1.
- 2.

1215
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,470
(The game only took 3 seconds.)

1216
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,800
Give it to us.

1217
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,160
(Jae Suk is a fan of Race of Wits,
but he is not good at it.)

1218
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,530
- Pay.
- Is that it?

1219
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,910
- Of course.
- Of course.

1220
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,780
You didn't even sit
all the way down.

1221
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,910
That's not true.

1222
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,240
- Our team...
- Yes.

1223
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,450
I'll pay.

1224
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,550
(Touched)

1225
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,950
I was going to say, "I'll pay."

1226
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,580
- But you...
- My hand was in my pocket.

1227
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
- What should we do?
- Okay.

1228
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,820
I'll just remember you did this.

1229
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,490
You both pay
and give me my coin back.

1230
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,600
Stay out of this!

1231
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,950
- I can't believe them.
- All right, good.

1232
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,990
I'll volunteer to pay first.

1233
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,430
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

1234
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,970
- First of all...
- I'll go.

1235
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,390
- I'll go.
- She's taking the initiative.

1236
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,570
- You want to take the initiative?
- Yes, I'll go.

1237
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,100
- She's taking the initiative.
- She's taking the initiative.

1238
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,740
- 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2...
- My goodness.

1239
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,970
- So Min, I'll remember you.
- She's taking the initiative.

1240
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,550
- She's taking the initiative.
- She's taking the initiative.

1241
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,740
Taking the initiative
on a variety show?

1242
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,280
Taking the initiative?

1243
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,350
It's my style. You know it.

1244
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,580
- Unbelievable.
- Take the initiative.

1245
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,720
It's frustrating.

1246
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,550
The game hasn't even started,
and we're already having fun.

1247
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,120
Is this really a retreat?

1248
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,260
Are you sure this is not training?

1249
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,200
What is this?

1250
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,600
It's boot camp training.

1251
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,240
It's a variety show
boot camp training.

1252
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,780
- Why don't we do a talent show?
- That sounds good.

1253
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,530
Byeong Gyu is...

1254
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,140
- good at impersonations.
- I'd love to hear it.

1255
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,220
- What should I do?
- Try Lee Sun Kyun. You're good.

1256
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,370
- He does sound a little like him.
- He does.

1257
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,490
"Hello, I'm Actor Lee Sun Kyun."

1258
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,550
(Impressed)

1259
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,450
"Are you the only doctor?"

1260
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,990
"I'm a doctor too!"

1261
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,760
- That was amazing.
- He took the initiative.

1262
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,660
- I love it.
- "I'm a doctor too."

1263
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,070
Your score is very high right now.

1264
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,330
I'm looking for the MVP
of each team.

1265
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,570
Byeong Gyu is never shy.

1266
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,930
I bought two items.

1267
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,330
Hold on.

1268
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,410
Hey, you have to get a trashcan too.

1269
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,280
- I have to?
- Of course.

1270
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,680
Do we have to buy a trashcan?

1271
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,410
- Did you use all the coins?
- She must have pocketed some.

1272
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,050
I bet she pocketed some money.
Come here.

1273
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,780
- What are you talking about?
- Come here.

1274
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,640
So Min, we know
how much those items cost.

1275
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,410
- Exactly.
- What do you mean?

1276
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,390
This costs 1 coin,
and that costs 2 coins.

1277
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,050
- Come to your senses, okay?
- This costs one coin.

1278
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,680
Did you forget about
taking the initiative?

1279
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,350
I knew she might do that,

1280
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,390
but I didn't know
she'd really do that.

1281
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,120
- We knew she'd do that.
- It's no surprise.

1282
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,890
You guys are being ridiculous.

1283
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,390
I'll go buy a trashcan, okay?

1284
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,100
Fine, I'll buy it.

1285
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,930
She had many thoughts
in such a short time.

1286
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,640
It's over for So Min.

1287
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,140
You've finally come to your senses.

1288
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,640
- That's more like it.
- Right.

1289
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,410
How much money did she pocket?

1290
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,820
Seriously...

1291
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,120
All this costs 3 coins,
and she got only 2 items earlier?

1292
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,120
I didn't know you could buy a set.

1293
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,430
I love this. Okay!

1294
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,030
- Are you ready to choose a tool?
- Yes.

1295
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,550
We have to win this.

1296
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,830
- Draw one.
- Everyone draws one?

1297
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,390
This will decide your tool.

1298
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,390
- Okay.
- Draw one.

1299
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,890
- Hold on. If it's decided...
- You took two.

1300
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,390
I'm the host.
Why are you crossing the line?

1301
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,510
(Jae Suk is caught
trying to be the host.)

1302
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,530
Hold on.

1303
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,530
Haven't you learned your lesson?

1304
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,970
You want to be the host
all the time.

1305
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,510
Only do what I tell you to do.

1306
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,050
- Stand over there.
- Okay.

1307
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,510
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1308
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,240
Hand out the cards.

1309
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,820
(Jae Suk does as Jong Kook says.)

1310
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,510
- Here you go.
- Okay, good.

1311
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,180
- This is...
- Okay.

1312
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,850
a random selection.

1313
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:28,280
- One for Soo Hyang.
- Are you sure it's random?

1314
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,260
I got duct tape.

1315
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,330
- That's good.
- That's not bad.

1316
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,370
- It's pretty heavy.
- It's good. It's heavy.

1317
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,570
You always brag about
your basketball skills.

1318
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,030
- Show us.
- He's a point guard.

1319
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,490
- Point guard Haha.
- Shoot a three-pointer.

1320
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,530
You shouldn't throw it
like a basketball.

1321
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,760
It won't get in. Never.

1322
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,280
If you get it in,
I'll give you one of my coins.

1323
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,530
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

1324
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:47,970
But if you fail,
you'll give me one of your coins.

1325
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,180
- What is that?
- What?

1326
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,080
- Then I'll give you two.
- Okay.

1327
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,350
- It's 2 to 1.
- Deal.

1328
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,550
I think he'll get it in.

1329
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,850
- Never.
- I think he will.

1330
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,950
It doesn't get in if you throw it
like a basketball.

1331
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,120
Throw it like a basketball.

1332
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,620
(Suk Jin is sure
his investment will pay off.)

1333
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,160
(Haha is sure it'll get in.)

1334
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,080
(What's the result
of this reckless bet?)

1335
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,760
It won't get in.

1336
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,660
(It goes right in.)

1337
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,760
(Suk Jin's investment fails.)

1338
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,990
- Oh, my.
- Okay!

1339
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,100
- Did you see that?
- Why did you make such a bet?

1340
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,200
Wasn't that cool?

1341
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,240
- That was incredible.
- Take just one coin.

1342
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,300
Give me two.

1343
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,510
- It got in.
- Keep your promise.

1344
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,740
Gosh.

1345
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,850
Give me two.

1346
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,680
- I'll give you some later.
- Suk Jin hasn't changed a bit.

1347
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,320
Suk Jin is way behind now.

1348
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,820
I was sure it wouldn't get in.

1349
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,720
(Haha wins 2 coins.)

1350
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,950
- The 3 beautiful ladies.
- The 3 beautiful ladies.

1351
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,030
- I'm the youngest member.
- What did you get?

1352
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,430
I got a rubber ball.

1353
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,830
A rubber ball.

1354
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,660
- It's okay. You can do this.
- I can do this.

1355
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,740
You can't bounce the ball.

1356
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,070
Show us.

1357
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,370
It didn't get in.

1358
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,930
- That was close.
- That was close.

1359
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,410
(The small investor,)

1360
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,640
(Suk Jin, fails too.)

1361
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,580
- It flies.
- Fail.

1362
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:58,410
Next up is
Yang Saeroyi from our team.

1363
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,220
- I'm in trouble.
- Yang Saeroyi.

1364
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,780
A tissue?

1365
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,490
- You could crumple it.
- Crumple it.

1366
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,160
Crumple it into a ball.

1367
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,510
Do you want to make a bet?

1368
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,350
- He wants to make a bet again.
- Suk Jin loves making a bet.

1369
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,100
Why would you make a bet?

1370
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,030
- I can't believe you.
- It's 2 to 1.

1371
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,970
It's 2 to 1.

1372
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,220
- It's 2 to 1?
- It's 2 to 1.

1373
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,100
- Deal.
- Deal? Okay.

1374
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,030
I hope it'll get in.

1375
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,800
- I hope it'll get in.
- So do I.

1376
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,300
I can crumple it into a ball, right?

1377
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,680
- Yes, you can.
- Yes, you can.

1378
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,300
Crumple it as hard as you can.

1379
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,300
But don't crumple it too hard.

1380
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,620
- That's not okay.
- It'll get in.

1381
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,050
- Here's a new tissue.
- What's the point?

1382
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,140
This is not okay.
You crumpled it too hard.

1383
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,580
But a tissue won't get so far
if you don't crumple it.

1384
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,620
I mean...

1385
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,490
- This is ridiculous!
- This is not okay.

1386
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,260
- It's too easy now.
- No, it isn't.

1387
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,350
Hold on.

1388
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,490
- Why is it not okay?
- It's not okay.

1389
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,260
Why is it not okay?

1390
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,970
- It's okay to crumple it.
- You're on their side now?

1391
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,140
- She's on their side now.
- This is...

1392
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,330
It's not okay.

1393
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,140
I think it's okay to crumple it.

1394
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,030
If you crumple it,
it'll definitely get in.

1395
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,700
All right, everyone.

1396
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,970
- Let's take a vote.
- Let's do that.

1397
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:02,140
Raise your hand if you think
it's okay to crumple the tissue.

1398
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,820
(Byeong Gyu too?)

1399
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:05,950
Raise your hand.

1400
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:07,550
(Byeong Gyu raises his hand
right away.)

1401
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,220
- Good.
- Byeong Gyu.

1402
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,510
Byeong Gyu, how could you...

1403
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,620
- I can't believe you.
- Good job.

1404
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,890
- Good job.
- All right.

1405
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,580
- Okay.
- Wait and see.

1406
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,930
Byeong Gyu, I can't believe you.

1407
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,600
I just changed my mind.

1408
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,970
Byeong Gyu, how could you...

1409
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,870
It's 2 to 1.
Se Chan, please get this in.

1410
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,570
You can easily get it in.
The host is on our team.

1411
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,200
"Dongducheon Class" can
pull this off. Yang Saeroyi.

1412
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,930
(Se Chan finally throws the tissue.)

1413
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,780
(Suk Jin and Yang Saeroyi
made a bet on this throw.)

1414
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,740
(It's in.)

1415
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,510
(Oh, no.)

1416
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,080
Okay!

1417
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,180
Okay!

1418
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,930
(The investor is frustrated
at his loss.)

1419
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,030
Give me your coins.

1420
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,600
- I'll give you just 1.
- Give me 2.

1421
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,720
It was 2 to 1.

1422
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,890
It was 2 to 1. Give me 2.

1423
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,140
We need Kwang Soo...

1424
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,200
- to stand up to them.
- Give me two.

1425
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,700
- Without Kwang Soo...
- Okay!

1426
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,240
(There's no one to stop
Jong Kook's tyranny.)

1427
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,030
(In Jong Kook's world,
coins mean power.)

1428
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,200
What is Suk Jin doing,
sitting here?

1429
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,850
Of course, Se Chan got it in.

1430
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,010
Listen, guys.

1431
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:14,490
Since we became a team,

1432
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,220
you were exempt
from participation fees,

1433
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,240
which saved each of you
one coin,

1434
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,950
and then you won more coins
by winning the game.

1435
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,010
You guys...

1436
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,760
- The perfect host!
- The perfect host!

1437
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,180
Okay, good.

1438
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,660
You're being ridiculous.

1439
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,100
- Yang Saeroyi, sit down.
- Yes!

1440
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,390
- Haha, sit down.
- Yes!

1441
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,260
- Are you his pet?
- Yes!

1442
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,740
- Are you?
- You want to be too,

1443
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,160
- don't you?
- I do.

1444
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,600
- She wants to join us.
- Let me in.

1445
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,300
(Team Jong Kook is 2 points ahead.)

1446
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,510
(Jae Suk succeeds
with a backscratcher.)

1447
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,050
(The oldest beautiful lady fails.)

1448
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,600
(Team Jae Suk 1, Team Ji Hyo 0,
Team Jong Kook 2)

1449
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,780
Fail.

1450
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,620
- Byeong Gyu, it's your turn.
- Okay.

1451
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,120
- A shuttlecock.
- Use this.

1452
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,720
Can I crumple this into a ball?

1453
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,510
No, it needs to fly.

1454
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:52,950
You can't crumple a shuttlecock
into a ball.

1455
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,550
You have to throw it as it is.

1456
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,680
- Yes, you can.
- You can only crumple a tissue.

1457
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,990
- It should retain its shape.
- That won't do.

1458
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,300
- The viewers would be curious.
- That won't do.

1459
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,830
Then you should have used tissue
in its original form.

1460
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:02,890
I am talking.

1461
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,430
I am talking.

1462
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,030
You shouldn't have done that.

1463
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,410
(He changes his stance.)

1464
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,240
For goodness' sake.

1465
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,010
- Hey.
- You are the absolute worst.

1466
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,370
Byeong Gyu.

1467
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,140
He is like a treacherous subject.
He is like us.

1468
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,800
Byeong Gyu is like us.

1469
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:19,140
(Satisfied)

1470
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,910
- I will throw it as it is.
- Of course.

1471
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,950
- That's the way to go.
- Here I go.

1472
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:23,990
Okay.

1473
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,010
Get ready.

1474
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,520
(Where will
Byeong Gyu's shuttlecock go?)

1475
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:45,870
(Byeong Gyu fails.)

1476
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,330
(It was close!)

1477
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,060
(It could have been disastrous.)

1478
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,290
It should have gone in.

1479
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:53,540
It was close.

1480
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,940
I am the last one to go.

1481
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,880
- What are we going to do?
- I didn't peek inside.

1482
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,270
- Okay, Jong Kook.
- I will open it now.

1483
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,080
- 1, 2, 3.
- The last person to go.

1484
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,440
- What?
- What is it?

1485
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,670
Toy hammer.

1486
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,750
You can do it.

1487
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,250
Toy hammer. All right.

1488
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,750
Give him a round of applause.

1489
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,540
(Give him a round of applause!)

1490
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,060
Let's give him a round of applause.

1491
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:14,460
- Kim Jong Kook! Kim Jong Kook!
- Kim Jong Kook! Kim Jong Kook!

1492
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,020
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Kim Jong Kook!

1493
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,560
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Kim Jong Kook!

1494
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,400
(Jae Suk throws a rubber ball
in annoyance.)

1495
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,020
- He threw something.
- What did you throw?

1496
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,370
Something hit me.

1497
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,600
- How could you be so base?
- What?

1498
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,940
Even if I have nothing,
I won't live that way.

1499
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,940
For goodness' sake.

1500
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,270
Even if I have nothing,
I won't live that way.

1501
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,380
(He throws a headband in fury.)

1502
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,440
What is your problem?

1503
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,980
For those who clap for me,

1504
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,210
I will have another draw.

1505
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,580
- Kim Jong Kook! Kim Jong Kook!
- Kim Jong Kook! Kim Jong Kook!

1506
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:41,690
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Kim Jong Kook!

1507
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,080
For goodness' sake.

1508
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,580
Where did you learn to host a show?

1509
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,480
For those who clap for me,
I will have another draw.

1510
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,630
Hold on.

1511
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:53,920
I think someone is passing gas
little by little.

1512
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,100
(The talk of gas
makes everyone look at Suk Jin.)

1513
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,960
Suk Jin, don't pass gas.

1514
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,130
- Hold on.
- Is it you?

1515
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,170
Do you smell it?

1516
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,040
- All right.
- That means gas is leaking out.

1517
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,600
- Gas is leaking out.
- If you...

1518
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,980
If you tell us honestly,

1519
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,750
I will give you an R coin.

1520
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,940
(Jong Kook makes an offer.)

1521
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,210
I did it!

1522
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,440
(I farted!)

1523
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,650
I did it.

1524
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,790
Give me an R coin.

1525
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,380
- I did it.
- I did it, you jerk.

1526
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,520
- My goodness.
- Who did it?

1527
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,980
- I did it.
- I did it.

1528
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,560
I passed a bit of gas three times.

1529
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,600
(He comes clean.)

1530
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,560
(He reveals
how many times he did it.)

1531
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,330
(I did it.)

1532
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:31,460
- I admit it.
- This is ridiculous.

1533
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,400
- All right.
- Give me an R coin.

1534
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,230
Give me an R coin.

1535
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,380
- Are you sure you did it?
- Yes, I am.

1536
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,500
When you feel it coming,

1537
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,850
let me hear it.

1538
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,940
The sound of passing gas?

1539
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,650
I will let you smell it.

1540
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,080
I need to check.

1541
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,210
- Give me an R coin later.
- Stop passing gas.

1542
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:50,980
Didn't we win?

1543
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,250
No one asked you to do it.

1544
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,850
- What?
- Don't be like that, Jae Suk.

1545
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,020
I am sorry.

1546
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,400
Why are you sorry?

1547
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,900
Why are you sorry?

1548
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,330
What's the current score?

1549
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,670
Didn't we win?

1550
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:02,900
- You won.
- I don't know.

1551
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,000
- Is it over?
- This is bad.

1552
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,270
- You won.
- We won.

1553
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,870
- Then I won't do it.
- It was a clean win.

1554
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,880
- Let's sit down.
- All right.

1555
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,850
- Please congratulate Jong Kook.
- That's right.

1556
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,580
Let's receive the coins.

1557
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,040
Retrieve the coins
for the winning team.

1558
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,150
Yes, Jong Kook.

1559
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,350
Now...

1560
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:23,460
Aren't you going to use
the 10 R coins?

1561
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,580
- Which ones?
- The ones you received as the host.

1562
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,650
I will use them. I will use them.

1563
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,730
- Thank you, Jong Kook.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1564
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,230
You hosted the game without a hitch.

1565
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,630
Good job, everyone.

1566
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,670
- I sided with you earlier.
- Hold on.

1567
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:36,770
That orange hat is inching close.

1568
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,500
That orange hat is inching close...

1569
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,710
like a slow-witted fool.

1570
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,870
Firstly, I will award those...

1571
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,400
who helped me by my side,

1572
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,350
Se Chan and Haha.

1573
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,940
- Se Chan. Okay.
- Thank you.

1574
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,540
Haha.

1575
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,150
- Thank you, Jong Kook.
- All right.

1576
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,210
Now...

1577
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,690
This is really annoying.

1578
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,150
(Would you give me one?)

1579
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,230
Jong Kook.

1580
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,150
Hold on.

1581
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,730
- This is...
- What is it?

1582
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,900
You will be able to hear
the sound of passing gas.

1583
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,960
(Does he finally feel it coming?)

1584
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,190
Come here. Hurry up.

1585
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,810
(Suk Jin was gathering his energy
at a corner.)

1586
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,460
- Hold on.
- Be quiet.

1587
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,100
- Did you do it?
- It went back in.

1588
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,580
(The gas went back in shyly
because everyone was watching.)

1589
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,940
You might end up pooping.

1590
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,380
- Didn't you hear something?
- No.

1591
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,920
This is a new kind of show.

1592
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,790
- You can try anytime...
- Okay.

1593
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,190
when it comes to passing gas.

1594
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,520
Jong Kook, let's play the game
for three R coins.

1595
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,560
Let's do that.

1596
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,420
I will bet two R coins instead.

1597
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,370
- I will give you a chance.
- Okay.

1598
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,170
- Whoever succeeds first wins.
- That's right.

1599
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,400
(At that moment)

1600
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,710
Are you ready?

1601
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:48,730
Be quiet.

1602
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:52,040
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet.

1603
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,400
(Passing gas)

1604
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,250
(What?)

1605
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,670
(He passed gas for real.)

1606
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,940
(Suk Jin's action
causes a commotion.)

1607
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,120
For goodness' sake.

1608
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,520
What do you think you are doing?

1609
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,560
- He is the worst.
- What was that?

1610
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,080
I hate it.

1611
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:09,400
We should check his underwear.

1612
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,690
For goodness' sake.

1613
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,400
(Jong Kook is highly satisfied.)

1614
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,690
What is your problem?

1615
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,190
I won't do this.

1616
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,730
- Thank you.
- I am all for a new kind of show.

1617
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,330
It wasn't a bit of gas.

1618
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,710
He passed a lot of gas.

1619
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,980
- Suk Jin, I think you pooped.
- I lost too many R coins earlier.

1620
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,400
I think you pooped.

1621
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,270
- It's my turn.
- All right.

1622
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,710
It's my turn, right?

1623
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,480
It doesn't smell.

1624
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,310
How many coins will the winner get?

1625
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,210
The winner will get three coins.

1626
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,460
I will throw it lightly.

1627
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,520
(Will Suk Jin be able to succeed?)

1628
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,350
- That was hilarious.
- Be careful.

1629
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,920
(Suk Jin fails.)

1630
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,270
- That was close.
- He could have been the champion.

1631
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,290
Seriously.

1632
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,770
May I pass gas and try again?

1633
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,060
Why would you get R coins
with your bowel condition?

1634
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:53,830
I can pass gas.

1635
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,540
It was close, right?

1636
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,770
Aim for the middle.

1637
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:57,770
Let's go.

1638
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,580
Aim for the camera, So Min.

1639
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,880
- The camera?
- That's right.

1640
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,080
(Se Chan advises So Min
to aim for the camera.)

1641
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,710
(What will be the result?)

1642
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,790
That's right.

1643
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:09,750
You did it.

1644
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,060
So Min, I told you.

1645
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,250
- That's right.
- You did it.

1646
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,080
(The ball hits the camera
and goes in.)

1647
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,350
- It went in...
- How many R coins does she have?

1648
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,830
because you aimed for the camera.

1649
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,060
How many R coins does she have?

1650
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,670
Se Chan!

1651
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,810
(What? She is so forward.)

1652
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,060
- What are you doing?
- What was that?

1653
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,440
Se Chan gave me...

1654
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,810
- a tip.
- That's right.

1655
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,170
What is that on your left chest?
Is that So Min's name tag?

1656
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,880
(Is that So Min's name tag
on his left chest?)

1657
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,710
What? What is this?

1658
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,080
- My goodness.
- What is this?

1659
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:43,460
- Hey.
- Do you like Se Chan that much?

1660
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,480
What is this?
When did you put this on me?

1661
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,520
- How did you put it on him?
- How did it happen?

1662
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,230
Was it on your bag?

1663
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,420
How did it happen?

1664
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,900
(Be mine)

1665
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,130
(Jae Suk is at it again.)

1666
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,290
Jae Suk is the worst.

1667
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,400
- Good job, orange hat.
- Was it okay?

1668
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,730
All right.

1669
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,770
So Min.

1670
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,540
(The woman of the left chest,
So Min wins 2 coins.)

1671
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,100
So Min is the winner.

1672
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,580
- Seriously.
- She has everything.

1673
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,210
So Min is the winner.

1674
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,980
The first class came to an end.

1675
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,750
Will you do the same thing
for the second class?

1676
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,850
If four members agree,
you can change the program.

1677
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:15,750
- We must change it.
- Let's change it.

1678
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,060
We need to eat ramyeon.

1679
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,310
- Let's change it.
- Okay.

1680
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:20,230
- Let's change it.
- You turned on me right away.

1681
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,580
- Let's eat ramyeon.
- Ramyeon.

1682
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,580
(Whose lunch will be picked?)

1683
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,600
What should we do?

1684
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,960
Let's eat something. I am hungry.

1685
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,770
How about Yum-yum Time?

1686
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,000
We can go with this one.

1687
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,790
But the ingredients
will be chosen at random.

1688
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,460
Kimchi fried rice sounds nice.

1689
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,000
Soo Hyang's Ramyeon
and Kimchi Fried Rice sounds nice.

1690
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,440
- I like Soo Hyang's class.
- Me too.

1691
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,580
We will be able
to eat kimchi fried rice, right?

1692
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,440
- Let's go with Soo Hyang's class.
- Okay.

1693
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,480
(Ramyeon and Kimchi Fried Rice)

1694
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,150
- Okay. Kimchi fried rice.
- Does that mean...

1695
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,540
- You are the host.
- Am I the host?

1696
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,580
That's right.

1697
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,120
Since Soo Hyang is the host,
she will receive 10 R coins...

1698
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,710
to lead everyone well.

1699
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:51,710
(She received 10 R coins.)

1700
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:52,830
Those give you power.

1701
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,830
Those 10 R coins give you power.

1702
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,850
- Gas gives you power.
- Gas.

1703
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,790
- That was hilarious.
- Thank you.

1704
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,630
I will return the badge.

1705
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,460
We need a lot of money to buy
a pot and such.

1706
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,900
- How much...
- We need a pot.

1707
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,630
Let's check how much we need.

1708
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,060
- One ramyeon.
- I will go since I will cook.

1709
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,130
Hey.

1710
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,270
This is the place.

1711
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,080
(Soo Hyang shops.)

1712
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,670
I need more than three rice.

1713
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,690
If we have eggs,
fried eggs are good.

1714
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:21,880
Eggs. Let's make fried eggs
and eat with it.

1715
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,120
You brought eggs, right?

1716
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,150
Byeong Gyu brought these, right?

1717
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,460
Yes.

1718
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:28,520
Give me one coin,
and I'll give you all of these.

1719
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,130
- This is for everybody.
- Hey.

1720
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,560
Wait. Isn't this boiled egg?

1721
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,230
No, it's raw.

1722
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,900
- Really?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1723
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,540
If you don't trust me,
I won't sell them.

1724
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,500
- I'll have them for myself.
- Isn't this the only raw egg?

1725
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,670
No.

1726
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:44,670
- She's back.
- She's here.

1727
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,810
- Let's help her.
- There's a lot.

1728
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,620
She bought a lot of pork.

1729
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,270
If you obey...

1730
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,520
- my orders,
- Yes, ma'am.

1731
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,290
- I'll give you some coins.
- Sure.

1732
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,620
There's so much to do.
Please obey my orders.

1733
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,920
Please give us orders.

1734
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,580
We have to do it
even if you don't give us coins.

1735
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:03,830
Sure thing.

1736
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:05,520
- Of course.
- I like that attitude.

1737
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,230
We have to do it regardless.

1738
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,690
- I like that.
- Is that right?

1739
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,190
- Can you do this?
- What should I do?

1740
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,270
- Do this.
- What should I do?

1741
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:14,270
I'll do it.
I have to work for the money. Okay!

1742
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,500
I can make ramyeon very well.

1743
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,500
- Ramyeon chef.
- We can make it well.

1744
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,230
Please take care of the ramyeon.

1745
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:20,710
Sure.

1746
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,980
Are you not going to add eggs
in ramyeon?

1747
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,150
These are boiled eggs.

1748
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,210
No, these are raw.

1749
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,290
This is not fair. These are raw.

1750
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,980
What are you doing?

1751
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:31,420
He's trying to sell me eggs.

1752
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,080
- Can you wash this?
- Oh, gosh.

1753
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,290
Give me one.

1754
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:35,520
- Here.
- He's getting an egg.

1755
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,900
This is raw, right?

1756
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,100
Here's ramyeon.

1757
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,790
He brought eggs.

1758
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,130
(He brought eggs.)

1759
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,290
What? Hey.

1760
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,540
Why did you get eggs?

1761
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,960
- Eggs for that.
- Hey.

1762
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,980
- What's wrong?
- Hey.

1763
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,130
Take it back.

1764
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,600
- No.
- Take it back.

1765
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,170
I can't do that.

1766
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,400
- I can't do that.
- It was so cheap.

1767
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,770
How much was it?

1768
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:58,520
- How many did you buy?
- Nine.

1769
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,520
- What? How much was it?
- One coin.

1770
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,810
- One coin.
- Really?

1771
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,460
- It was 10...
- 10.

1772
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,620
for one coin.

1773
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,080
(It was 1 coin for 10 eggs.)

1774
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,080
(Come here, Byeong Gyu.)

1775
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,130
1 coin for 10 eggs.

1776
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:10,130
Come here.

1777
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:11,230
- Take it back.
- They're good.

1778
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,520
I didn't know about this.

1779
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,630
- Give it back.
- No.

1780
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,420
- Give it back.
- These are better.

1781
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,270
- This is from Seoul.
- Hey.

1782
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,460
- From Seoul.
- Give it back.

1783
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,940
- This is from Seoul.
- Give it back.

1784
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,670
You already bought it from me.

1785
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,440
Oh, gosh.

1786
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,400
These are not boiled eggs.

1787
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,000
I have raw eggs.

1788
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,710
If you give me one coin,
I'll add it.

1789
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,620
- In the ramyeon.
- These are actually...

1790
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,080
all boiled eggs.

1791
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,560
(Interrupting)

1792
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,020
all boiled eggs.

1793
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,250
- Really?
- Except one.

1794
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,520
(Cracking)

1795
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,690
- Give it back.
- What a swindler.

1796
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,560
(Give it back.)

1797
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,630
Come here.

1798
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:48,690
- No.
- Come here, Byeong Gyu.

1799
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,690
Listen.

1800
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:50,900
Kwang Soo is gone,
but he's the new swindler.

1801
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,230
That little guy.

1802
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,670
We checked them together.

1803
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:58,600
You said they weren't boiled eggs.

1804
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,210
They're boiled.

1805
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,440
Are these all boiled?

1806
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,020
They're all boiled except for one.

1807
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,350
They're boiled...

1808
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,210
(It breaks this time.)

1809
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,790
- This is the raw egg.
- This is it.

1810
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:09,790
(This is the raw egg.)

1811
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:11,310
- This is it.
- Oh, my gosh.

1812
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,020
- Why?
- Oh, gosh.

1813
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,520
Put it in here, So Min.

1814
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,790
What were you doing?

1815
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,130
Gosh, So Min.

1816
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:18,150
Is this my fault?

1817
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,730
- It was raw, right?
- I thought it was his fault.

1818
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:20,730
Oh, gosh.

1819
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,270
It was raw.

1820
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:24,370
Ramyeon is ready. We can eat.

1821
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:26,630
(Ramyeon is
the highlight of retreats.)

1822
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,670
This looks great.

1823
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:29,900
Give us some too.

1824
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,400
Put it in a bowl.

1825
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,210
There are many ingredients.
This kimchi is good.

1826
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,310
- This is so good.
- Kimchi is good.

1827
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,250
- This is good.
- It's so good.

1828
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,620
My gosh.

1829
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,440
(Slurping)

1830
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,120
Ramyeon is great during retreats.

1831
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,810
We only need to eat ramyeon.

1832
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:46,920
Ramyeon is good...

1833
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:48,730
when you eat together.

1834
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,920
Aren't you happy you bought
the eggs? You can taste it.

1835
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,520
Gosh, Byeong Gyu.

1836
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,440
I grew up poor.

1837
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,670
What does that have to do with this?

1838
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:04,230
You look like a rich boy.

1839
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:05,830
- No.
- No?

1840
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,400
People used to say about me.

1841
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,420
You look like you were born
during a war.

1842
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,420
(You look like you were born
during a war.)

1843
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,620
(A flower
that bloomed during the war)

1844
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,420
War Diary.

1845
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,790
My gosh.

1846
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,060
(Ji Hyo is busy eating
while helping Soo Hyang.)

1847
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,230
Ji Hyo.

1848
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:27,000
- I'm doing good, right?
- She's helping me.

1849
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,460
Did you see me?

1850
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,730
(Take this.)

1851
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,440
- Soo Hyang.
- Take it.

1852
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,870
You can't give it to her
like it's pocket money.

1853
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,540
(It's a secret!)

1854
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:39,230
When will the fried rice be ready?
I'm looking forward to it.

1855
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,150
- It smells good.
- It's almost ready.

1856
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,270
Soo Hyang, this looks good.

1857
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:44,650
It looks really good.

1858
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:47,150
I hope nobody is adding rice...

1859
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,420
to the ramyeon.

1860
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,710
- No way.
- I hope not.

1861
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:52,690
I hope nobody is adding rice...

1862
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,920
(He feels guilty.)

1863
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,130
(He doesn't know where to look.)

1864
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,130
You have to try this.

1865
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,250
They must be shameless.

1866
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,600
- That person must be...
- The worst.

1867
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,330
- You can't do that.
- They're not even human.

1868
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,440
They are not.

1869
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,130
She took so long to make it.

1870
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:09,810
What are you doing, Ji Hyo?
Are you making pork belly?

1871
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,810
- Yes, I'm making pork belly.
- Amazing.

1872
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,480
I have to make pork belly.

1873
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,150
- It's so hard being a host.
- This is good.

1874
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,670
I'm sweating right now.

1875
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,250
You're the mother bird.

1876
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,620
Soo Hyang is the best leader.

1877
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,190
I have to get paid.

1878
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,120
You should get paid.

1879
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,750
- This is so good.
- I should pay myself.

1880
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,190
Ji Hyo.

1881
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,520
Thank you for the food.

1882
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,100
- One for you.
- Thank you for the food.

1883
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,830
(We worked hard, so let's have them.
Thanks, Soo Hyang.)

1884
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:36,790
Thanks, Soo Hyang.

1885
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:40,000
- Ji Hyo deserves it.
- You should give her one.

1886
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,670
- We also...
- You're giving us more?

1887
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:42,900
- What an angel.
- You're an angel.

1888
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,230
- Angel.
- You're an angel.

1889
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:46,210
What hospital was it?

1890
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,270
They removed your wings
without leaving any marks.

1891
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,440
(What hospital was it?
They removed your wings.)

1892
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,350
(It's an angel plastic surgeon
who specializes in removing wings.)

1893
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:54,420
This is amazing.

1894
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,880
Good one.

1895
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,520
I like it.

1896
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,690
You like that?

1897
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:01,880
Soo Hyang is the best leader.

1898
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,290
Let's wrap up.

1899
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:05,630
You have to wrap up
the second program.

1900
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,460
- I'm still the MC.
- Will you change the third program?

1901
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:10,170
Or will you keep Soo Hyang's?

1902
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,230
- I'm the best captain.
- What was it?

1903
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,370
- I'm a good captain.
- Mafia Game?

1904
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:15,040
There's Cry in Silence.

1905
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,880
Cry in Silence is good.

1906
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,230
Hold on. Jae Suk has it too.

1907
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,150
- I have it too.
- Soo Hyang has it too.

1908
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,980
Me too. Se Chan's...

1909
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,170
Kwang Soo will select teams for us.

1910
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,710
- Really?
- Me too.

1911
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:28,350
- You have it too.
- I do.

1912
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,460
Let's go with Se Chan's.

1913
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,520
Kwang Soo will select teams.
We'll call him.

1914
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,290
Let's do Se Chan's.

1915
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:36,060
I can call Kwang Soo.

1916
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:37,230
- You didn't write it down.
- You can't.

1917
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:38,230
Why are you trying to steal his?

1918
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,290
- Why are you trying to steal 10?
- It's still Cry in Silence.

1919
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,130
I can call Kwang Soo.

1920
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:43,190
- Of course.
- Right?

1921
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:45,040
- Of course.
- Can we split 10?

1922
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,230
I'll split.

1923
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,170
He's going to split 10.
This is good news.

1924
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:49,230
Are you going to split right away?

1925
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,770
- We can split too.
- Let's hear him out.

1926
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:52,600
- I'll split too. I told you.
- What?

1927
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,500
Once I get 10 coins,

1928
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,810
- Right away.
- I won't keep any of them.

1929
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:57,170
- He'll split all.
- I will...

1930
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:59,080
- use them for a good cause.
- He'll use them all.

1931
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,620
- Se Chan!
- Se Chan!

1932
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,420
You can talk.

1933
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:07,420
Look. What's a good cause?

1934
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,560
They might split it
among themselves.

1935
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,730
- I'll give them to you guys.
- That's not true.

1936
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,330
- What about us?
- No way.

1937
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:14,520
- Give us some too.
- How many of us?

1938
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,690
Up to her.

1939
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,830
- Okay!
- We will...

1940
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:19,940
include up to him.

1941
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,100
What about me?

1942
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,900
- Come here.
- Look.

1943
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,810
As the number of people increase,
you get less coins.

1944
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,670
- I'll include up to her.
- I'll come.

1945
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,170
- I'll come.
- Up to her?

1946
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,310
Yes. Okay.

1947
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,540
- Don't do that.
- Are you guys good?

1948
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,620
Sure.

1949
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,710
- Keep your words.
- It's my...

1950
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,790
Cry in Silence.

1951
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:35,920
Keep your words.

1952
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,150
Jae Suk.

1953
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:39,190
- Keep your words.
- We trusted you.

1954
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,350
- He's a good host.
- Here's 10.

1955
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,520
- Don't worry.
- You're a good host.

1956
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:45,730
This guy is good.

1957
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,420
Don't worry.

1958
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,920
- He's good in recreation games.
- Give me one.

1959
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,000
This is finally
the springtime for the host.

1960
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:52,940
How warm.

1961
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:53,940
- Is this springtime?
- I feel at ease.

1962
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,900
- How warm.
- I'm Springtime MC Yu.

1963
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,500
- Springtime MC. I know you.
- Springtime MC Yu.

1964
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,400
I was waiting for this moment.

1965
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,210
I'll distribute the coins
equally later,

1966
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,670
- so don't worry.
- Wait.

1967
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:04,920
- Give us one each.
- Sure.

1968
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,980
- You have to give us 1.
- Give 1 each.

1969
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,440
- One each then.
- He's revealing his true colors.

1970
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,420
As I have said...

1971
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,460
You need to bring the headsets.

1972
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,920
We also have to divide the teams.

1973
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,420
We have to buy them.

1974
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,020
We have to split teams.

1975
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,690
I'll call Kwang Soo.

1976
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,790
Sure.

1977
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,230
- For teams?
- Ask him to split the teams.

1978
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,500
- Let's talk to him first.
- Sure.

1979
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,460
He's more relaxed now.
He used to pick up right away.

1980
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:29,900
- I know.
- When he was just injured,

1981
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,230
he picked up right away.

1982
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:33,080
He must be crawling around.

1983
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,810
- "He must be crawling around."
- He's not crawling.

1984
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,710
He won't pick up.

1985
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,920
I had the same injury before.

1986
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,250
Maybe he's not picking up
because it's you, Jae Suk.

1987
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,980
- No way.
- I hope you don't get hurt.

1988
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:45,980
You never know.

1989
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:46,980
- Suk Jin, don't get hurt.
- You never know.

1990
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,350
He won't pick up
even if you call him 100 times.

1991
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:50,230
- Oh, gosh.
- He might not like you.

1992
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:52,100
It would be so funny
if he picked up your call.

1993
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,690
You might not have his number.

1994
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,060
- He didn't...
- "This number is out of service."

1995
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,540
He didn't pick up my call.
Will he answer Suk Jin's call?

1996
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,630
That cannot happen.

1997
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:59,690
I agree.

1998
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,880
- This is a loyalty game now.
- I hope his call gets rejected.

1999
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,400
- This is a game.
- We called, and he didn't pick up.

2000
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,900
Who will he call back first?

2001
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,980
Let's bet one coin for that.

2002
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,440
- You sound confident.
- We should call him too.

2003
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,940
He must be sleeping.

2004
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,520
Suk Jin, let's bet one coin each.

2005
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,080
Let's do one each.

2006
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:21,730
That's not bad.

2007
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,420
- One each.
- Whoever gets the call first.

2008
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,190
The one who doesn't get called
will give up a coin.

2009
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,060
- Let's split the teams.
- Let's do that.

2010
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,690
- Let's do it.
- We'll do it.

2011
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,960
Let's split these three.

2012
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,460
It doesn't matter.

2013
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,170
- Split these three.
- We'll try our best no matter what.

2014
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,040
We have to split you guys,

2015
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,230
so let's send the chief that way.

2016
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,500
- I'm not the chief.
- Boss.

2017
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,080
- You're the boss.
- Should I go that way?

2018
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,770
- Leader.
- Should I move?

2019
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:46,710
- What about me?
- You should go twice.

2020
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,920
- Good idea.
- Do that.

2021
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,710
- Do that.
- Go twice.

2022
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:51,120
Look back.

2023
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,790
(Jae Suk will participate
in both teams.)

2024
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,060
Does the winning team get five?

2025
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:56,150
Seven.

2026
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:57,420
- 7?
- 7.

2027
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,900
- Do we split seven among ourselves?
- Right.

2028
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,730
What happens to Jae Suk then?

2029
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,440
Does he win no matter what?

2030
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,630
(Jae Suk returns
with the game props.)

2031
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,060
- Jae Suk.
- What was that?

2032
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,230
We have a problem.

2033
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,810
- What is it?
- Because...

2034
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:11,900
- Oh, dear.
- the winning team gets seven coins.

2035
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,310
Do you not get any?

2036
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,900
I have to get some.

2037
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,120
You'll win regardless of
which team wins.

2038
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,250
- It's unfair.
- But I am the host.

2039
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,420
- I should have that perk.
- No way.

2040
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,440
I have an idea.

2041
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,190
You should hand over three coins.

2042
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,150
The winning team has 5 members,
so each member can take 2 coins.

2043
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,560
- It's the perfect solution.
- He is right.

2044
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,290
- Hand over three coins.
- You are the host.

2045
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,850
- Why would I hand over three coins?
- You said earlier...

2046
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:32,730
that you will share all the coins.

2047
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,690
- Seriously.
- You changed your words.

2048
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,790
Excuse me. Answer this question.

2049
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,230
You have no intention...

2050
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:39,790
of sharing the coins
you received, right?

2051
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,960
If you continue to be this way,
I can't share them.

2052
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,310
- See?
- Hold on. What did you say?

2053
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,210
- What are you going to do?
- He changed his mind.

2054
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:48,310
What are you going to do?

2055
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,170
We can take those coins from you
with a bit of force.

2056
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:51,920
- My goodness.
- A bit of force.

2057
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,020
Guys, count me in.

2058
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,940
Don't involve yourself
in this matter.

2059
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,790
- Will you steal my coins?
- Listen.

2060
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,350
Would you lose everything
or hand over three coins?

2061
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:00,730
- Answer me.
- That's right.

2062
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,460
- That's good.
- Hand over three coins.

2063
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,130
That's good. That's perfect.

2064
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,400
All right. From the MC coins,

2065
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,560
- I will hand over three coins.
- That's a good idea.

2066
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,600
That's only fair.

2067
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,370
- That's right.
- You only used 10 percent.

2068
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,630
You only used 10 percent.

2069
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,100
Which team should go first?

2070
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,000
- Go to the production crew.
- Hold on.

2071
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,480
It's an incoming call.
Hand over a coin.

2072
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,710
(Is it Kwang Soo?)

2073
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:21,880
If it's Kwang Soo,
you need to hand over a coin.

2074
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,210
It's Kwang Soo.

2075
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,480
(As everyone but Suk Jin expected,
Kwang Soo called Jae Suk first.)

2076
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,770
- Kwang Soo.
- Hey, Jae Suk.

2077
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,980
Why didn't you answer
the phone earlier?

2078
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,250
I didn't know. I missed it.

2079
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,460
Suk Jin called you too.

2080
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,230
Yes, Suk Jin called me too.

2081
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:35,920
- Why did he call Jae Suk first?
- Why did you call me first?

2082
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,600
I did it without thinking.

2083
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:42,870
(The priority is ingrained
in his subconscious.)

2084
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,730
(Opening his pouch)

2085
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:46,960
Give it to me.

2086
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:48,900
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk?

2087
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:51,210
Kwang Soo, do you want to have
a video call?

2088
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,130
How is your current appearance?

2089
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,580
It's very bad.

2090
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,380
(The current appearance is
very bad.)

2091
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,020
Kwang Soo, rest up.

2092
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,520
- Call Suk Jin too.
- Okay.

2093
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,190
Forget it. This is good enough.

2094
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,480
(He refuses to be pitied.)

2095
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,650
It's okay.

2096
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,130
It would be a hassle to call me.

2097
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,850
I have nothing to say.

2098
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,020
- I have nothing to say.
- Forget it.

2099
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,060
- Forget it. There is no need.
- Forget it.

2100
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:17,000
- He is cool.
- He is calling me.

2101
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,690
- Kwang Soo is calling you.
- Forget it.

2102
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:19,830
Why didn't you answer it?

2103
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,540
- Forget it. There is no need.
- Are you sullen?

2104
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,210
No, I am not.
Have you ever seen me sullen?

2105
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:24,940
- I am never sullen.
- Are you sure?

2106
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,770
I am never sullen.

2107
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,980
- Why didn't you answer the phone?
- It's okay. Let's keep shooting.

2108
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,100
Let's keep shooting.

2109
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,750
- He is sullen.
- I am not sullen.

2110
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,510
- Why would I be sullen?
- This is hilarious.

2111
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,250
Hold on.

2112
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:38,350
The time limit is 100 seconds.

2113
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:39,510
- 100 seconds.
- Yes.

2114
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:41,960
Read the lips. Read the lips.

2115
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,550
- What?
- Copy the lips.

2116
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,650
Copy the lips.

2117
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:47,090
- Copy the lips.
- That's right.

2118
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:49,220
- Okay.
- Let's go. Get ready.

2119
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,300
(Team Haha starts first!)

2120
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,670
This four-character idiom
is well-known.

2121
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,710
- Washinsangdam.
- Wa...

2122
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,470
- Washin...
- Sangdam.

2123
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,180
(It's too easy.)

2124
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,770
Washinsara?

2125
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:04,510
Washinsang...

2126
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:05,750
Washinsarang.

2127
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:06,770
For goodness' sake.

2128
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,550
(Jae Suk smacks his forehead
in frustration.)

2129
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:10,790
Washinsarang.

2130
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:12,420
- Wa...
- Sarang.

2131
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:13,480
(It's as if there is a wall
between them.)

2132
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,090
- Washinsangdam.
- Wa...

2133
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,430
- What am I going to do with him?
- Washinsaram.

2134
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:21,090
- Washinsarang.
- He says it with confidence!

2135
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:24,140
Washinsarang.

2136
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,640
Washinsarang.

2137
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,890
For goodness' sake.

2138
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,140
Hey!

2139
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,640
(I delivered it perfectly!)

2140
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,710
Washinsarang.

2141
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,750
Washinsarang.

2142
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,270
My goodness.

2143
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:38,970
(Ji Hyo passes it on
without a hint of doubt.)

2144
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,050
- Washinsarang.
- I don't get it.

2145
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:42,720
Shouldn't they know the idiom
that starts with "Washin"?

2146
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,680
Washinsaya.

2147
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,350
- What?
- Go.

2148
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:48,760
- What?
- Washinsaya.

2149
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,000
- What even is "Washinsaya"?
- Washinsaya.

2150
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,000
Gwashinsarang.

2151
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,590
(Incorrect)

2152
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,560
(The game continues to be funny
even after 10 years.)

2153
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,870
This is too easy.

2154
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,230
- This is too easy.
- They should know this one.

2155
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,560
- They should know this one?
- Is it easy?

2156
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,210
Gyeolchoboeun.

2157
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:06,680
- It's easy.
- It's too easy.

2158
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,940
- Gyeolchoboeun.
- It's too easy.

2159
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:11,620
- Gyeolchoboeun.
- Come on.

2160
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,010
Gyeolchoboeun.

2161
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:16,790
Gyeolchoboeun.

2162
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,480
(It's the four-character idiom
I had used the last time.)

2163
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,520
Gyeolchoboeun.

2164
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,000
Keep going.

2165
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:27,930
(They will succeed at this rate.)

2166
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:29,830
Did they get it right?

2167
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:32,690
Endangered...

2168
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:33,930
What?

2169
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,900
(Where did "Endangered" come from?)

2170
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,430
What? Say it again.

2171
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:40,800
- Thank goodness.
- Endangered sign.

2172
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,210
Soo Hyang is ridiculous.

2173
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,970
Endangered sign.

2174
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,080
"Endangered sign"?

2175
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,140
Byeoljubuin?

2176
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,550
(Incorrect)

2177
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,250
(Amazed)

2178
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,980
This one is easy too. Seriously.

2179
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:54,050
(Ileonbangu)

2180
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,050
- Seriously.
- Here.

2181
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,130
Ileonbangu.

2182
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:01,300
- Yieon.
- Ileon.

2183
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,090
- Ileonmangu.
- Ileonbangu.

2184
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:05,370
(His veins pop up.)

2185
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:06,430
Hey!

2186
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,930
(He resorts to violence in the end.)

2187
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:10,060
Ileonmangu.

2188
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,970
- I am so annoyed.
- Ileon... Ileon...

2189
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,770
- Ileonmangu.
- I can't believe him.

2190
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,600
- I am so frustrated.
- Ileonmangu.

2191
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,080
I can't believe him.

2192
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:22,590
This mandu.

2193
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,290
"This mandu"?

2194
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:27,430
This mandu.

2195
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:28,890
How did she get "This mandu"?

2196
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,590
This...

2197
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:32,830
What are you saying?
I can't hear you.

2198
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,800
- Let me read your lips.
- Haha, your face...

2199
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,830
(He is fascinated by the sight.)

2200
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,300
This is driving me crazy.

2201
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,590
This mandu.

2202
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,400
Is this allowed?

2203
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:42,640
Go. Say it.

2204
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,800
- Say it.
- Deli Manjoo.

2205
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,940
This is driving me crazy.

2206
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,050
This is driving me crazy.

2207
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,180
- Hey!
- Is this allowed?

2208
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,470
- Hey!
- You only got the easy ones.

2209
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:53,750
- What?
- You only got the easy ones.

2210
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,220
It was "Ileonbangu."

2211
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,420
Ileonbangu. Gyeolchoboeun.

2212
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:58,650
- Ileonbangu.
- How did it become "This mandu"?

2213
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,260
- Washinsangdam.
- When did we have "Gyeolchoboeun"?

2214
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,960
Where did you get Deli Manjoo?

2215
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,460
I heard "Manjoo."

2216
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,260
Then I naturally thought
of Deli Manjoo.

2217
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,370
For goodness' sake.

2218
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:09,260
Wasn't it "This mandu"?

2219
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:10,670
So Min.

2220
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:12,300
Get ready.

2221
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:16,970
(Jirimyeolryeol)

2222
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:18,710
- My goodness.
- All right.

2223
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:22,380
Jirimyeolryeol.

2224
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,750
Jiinbyeolgyeo?

2225
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:25,720
- Jiri.
- Yi.

2226
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,220
- Ji...
- Yiyibyeolgyo?

2227
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,480
(They will fail too.)

2228
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,960
Yirimyeolryeol?

2229
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,150
Jirimyeolryeol!

2230
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:34,090
Jirimyeolryeol. Jirimyeolryeol.

2231
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,760
Jirimyeolryeol.

2232
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:38,150
- Byul.
- Myeol.

2233
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:39,960
- Ryeol.
- Byulli?

2234
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,870
(What is he doing?)

2235
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,840
(He leaves it up to Jong Kook.)

2236
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,970
Yiyibyeolli.

2237
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:48,640
Yiyibyeolli.

2238
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,640
Ours is too hard.

2239
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,680
- Yiyi...
- Yiyi...

2240
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,600
- byeolli.
- Byeol... Yibyeol?

2241
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:57,220
- Yibyeol. Yi...
- Yiyi...

2242
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,380
- byeolli.
- Byeolli.

2243
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,620
- Yiyi...
- Yiyi...

2244
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,890
(You are watching them play
Cry in Silence.)

2245
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,190
- Byeolli.
- Byeol.

2246
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,220
- Why are there three characters?
- Yiyi...

2247
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,690
- Yibyeolli.
- Byeolli.

2248
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,430
(It looks like they will fail.)

2249
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:18,540
They will fail.

2250
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,040
- Byeolli.
- Byeolli.

2251
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,900
Yiyibyeolli.

2252
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,800
(Incorrect)

2253
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,730
(Nangjungjichu)

2254
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,380
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

2255
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,220
Nangjujichu.

2256
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,140
(What?)

2257
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,420
Dangjuksilsu?

2258
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:40,460
Nangjujichu.

2259
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:42,630
(It's "Nangjungjichu.")

2260
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:44,720
Nang... Nang...

2261
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,020
This is a mess.
He forgot the four-character idiom.

2262
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,330
Nangwujicho.

2263
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:51,870
- What? What is up with him?
- "Nangwujicho"?

2264
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,690
(He is doing whatever he wants.)

2265
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,040
Jichu?

2266
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,170
What is it?

2267
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:57,800
Give it a try. Give it a try.

2268
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,210
What is it?

2269
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,270
Nangdokjihyo?

2270
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,880
- Dangyuji...
- Ji...

2271
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,310
Dangukjisu.

2272
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,250
- What?
- My goodness.

2273
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,790
- Dangukjisu.
- No way.

2274
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,680
- Dangukjisu.
- What is that?

2275
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,680
(It doesn't go well.)

2276
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:13,930
He must have gotten it wrong.

2277
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,130
Dangyujichu.

2278
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:21,690
- Furniture building.
- Furniture.

2279
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,430
- Furniture building.
- Furniture mistake.

2280
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,730
Hurry up.

2281
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:26,470
Furniture mistake.

2282
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,400
(Incorrect)

2283
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,710
Time's up.

2284
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,210
- How many did we get?
- I think we got one right.

2285
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,340
- It was hard to read lips.
- You got all of them wrong.

2286
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,680
(Both teams fail to win coins
and the last program ends.)

2287
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:38,470
All programs
of Running Man Has Plans ended.

2288
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,340
I will announce
1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners.

2289
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:43,340
(Who are
1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners?)

2290
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,850
- Jong Kook is 1st with 17 coins.
- Okay.

2291
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:50,330
Soo Hyang has 16 coins
and So Min has 15 coins.

2292
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:51,720
The three of them will win prizes.

2293
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,520
At the very bottom is...

2294
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,300
(Who will receive
an embarrassing penalty?)

2295
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,670
At the very bottom is
Suk Jin with 10 coins.

2296
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:00,970
Okay.

2297
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:02,370
It's because I lost in games.

2298
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,580
- Suk Jin made too many deals.
- I know.

2299
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,730
I didn't win once.

2300
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,600
The prizes will be revealed first.
Bring them in.

2301
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,810
Are there prizes?
I can't believe I will get a prize.

2302
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,720
Will Soo Hyang get one too?

2303
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:16,720
You will have a draw...

2304
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,420
- and receive a prize.
- Really?

2305
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,480
Yes, you will really receive
a prize.

2306
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,760
The prizes range
from a luxury massage chair...

2307
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,190
- to the members' autographs.
- Really?

2308
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,350
(There is a variety of prizes.)

2309
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:28,690
(1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners
will have a draw for these prizes.)

2310
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,760
I want this one.

2311
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,090
- I want this one.
- The prizes are nice.

2312
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:33,640
So Min, you should get a speaker.

2313
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,430
- I want it.
- This speaker is nice.

2314
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,730
This speaker is nice.

2315
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:38,140
Are these AirPods?

2316
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,080
Are there AirPods?

2317
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,180
(There is a pair
of the latest Bluetooth earphones.)

2318
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,580
AirPods.

2319
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,380
Is the massage chair
the most expensive prize?

2320
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:46,720
What is this?

2321
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:48,390
- What are these autographs?
- What are these autographs?

2322
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,220
- Autographs?
- What are these?

2323
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,850
- What are these?
- We were asked to sign name tags.

2324
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:54,180
- It's my face.
- It's my face.

2325
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,390
Will we have a draw?

2326
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:57,690
This is me.

2327
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:59,430
- My goodness.
- This is you, Suk Jin.

2328
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,090
- Is this a prize as well?
- It's a prize.

2329
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,060
How is a cardboard cutout
of Kwang Soo a prize?

2330
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,930
- Why would anyone want it?
- I can't believe it's a prize.

2331
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:07,600
It's trash.

2332
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,640
(They react strongly
to a shabby prize.)

2333
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,900
"It's trash."

2334
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:11,270
(My goodness.)

2335
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,400
It would be hard to throw it away.

2336
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:13,680
I will explain the rules.

2337
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:16,510
This will give you
the joy of winning a draw.

2338
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:18,120
It's the lucky prize draw.

2339
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,750
1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners...

2340
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,590
can take the 30 prize name tags...

2341
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:24,010
- and arrange them...
- Right.

2342
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,290
from 1 to 50 in random order.

2343
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:27,830
You can take
whatever number you pick.

2344
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:28,830
(You can take the prize
that's allocated to the number.)

2345
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,590
- Arrange the prizes.
- These?

2346
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:31,720
- Yes.
- Arrange them.

2347
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,650
We put these in random order.

2348
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:35,190
- Whatever you pick.
- You've all tried this before.

2349
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,520
This is Wolmido Island.

2350
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,540
Right.

2351
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:38,690
Then...

2352
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:39,840
Jong Kook, go first.

2353
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,900
Sure.

2354
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,670
- Is this how I do it?
- Yes.

2355
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,080
- If you pick eight,
- Yu San Seul's CD.

2356
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,540
you take 3.75g of gold.

2357
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,300
- I see.
- Sounds good.

2358
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,900
I'm going to cluster them
into lower numbers.

2359
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:50,640
- Low numbers?
- Yes.

2360
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,220
I'm going to cluster them
into lower numbers.

2361
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,750
First place will arrange them,

2362
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,390
and three remaining people
will pick.

2363
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:56,550
Go first, Jong Kook.

2364
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:58,590
I'll win something
as long as it's under 30.

2365
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:59,620
Jong Kook.

2366
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,180
- As long as it's under 30.
- This is nerve-racking.

2367
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:03,430
Jong Kook might win gold.

2368
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:04,930
Okay!

2369
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:06,930
- All right. He picked.
- I picked.

2370
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,000
- So...
- Silence!

2371
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,390
(Silence!)

2372
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:11,870
(Guy with the orange cap hollers.)

2373
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:13,060
Silence.

2374
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,640
- What did I do?
- You sounded like a senior.

2375
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,840
- You're a senior.
- Be quiet.

2376
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,540
- Good job.
- First place is picking.

2377
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:19,710
- I'm first place.
- My gosh.

2378
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:20,710
First place.

2379
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,550
- Low number.
- If he gets 30, it's nothing.

2380
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,250
- He's okay up to 30.
- Yes, up to 30.

2381
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,340
- Yes, up to 30.
- Wait.

2382
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:27,750
- Why?
- Low, right? Wait.

2383
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:29,120
You're good up to 30.

2384
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,550
First digit shouldn't be high.

2385
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,130
Why are you taking so long?

2386
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,520
Can he take this long?

2387
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:39,220
- I saw the first digit.
- Tell us what it is.

2388
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,670
(You saw it?)

2389
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:46,430
No, I didn't win anything!
1st digit is 3!

2390
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:49,260
(He shudders because he's so sad.)

2391
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:50,800
- What number is it?
- 34.

2392
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,510
- Oh, dear. It's a dud.
- It's a dud.

2393
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:53,510
(34 is a dud!)

2394
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,440
- It's a dud.
- Good!

2395
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:58,440
- It's you now.
- Second place.

2396
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,010
- Keep going.
- Soo Hyang.

2397
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:01,090
- Should I keep it?
- I think it's good.

2398
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:02,180
Change whatever you want.

2399
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,310
It doesn't matter.

2400
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,460
- I want this the most.
- I agree.

2401
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,720
- I want wireless earbuds the most.
- That's the best.

2402
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:11,130
All right. Soo Hyang is next.

2403
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,460
- Please pick one.
- I'm nervous.

2404
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,560
A dud is better than
something mediocre.

2405
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,590
She might win a massage chair
or wireless earbuds.

2406
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:19,040
(Let's see.)

2407
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,930
- She's taking a long time.
- She is.

2408
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,230
- Why?
- Did you get it?

2409
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,600
It must be something big.

2410
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,770
- What number is it?
- 20.

2411
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:28,970
(20!)

2412
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,770
16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

2413
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,510
(Sincerely autographed name tags
of Running Man members)

2414
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,720
Autographed name tags of
Running Man members.

2415
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:38,890
(She's ecstatic.)

2416
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,460
- What's wrong?
- Why?

2417
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,720
This is amazing.

2418
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,290
People fight for these.

2419
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:44,930
- This is a legend.
- Kids love these.

2420
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:46,190
- This is awesome.
- This?

2421
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:48,130
Kids love these as holiday presents.

2422
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:49,690
There's Jong Kook, me,
and everybody else.

2423
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:52,840
I came here, and you made me cook!

2424
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,870
(She throws them
because she's so deeply moved.)

2425
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:56,900
Take these.

2426
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,540
- So Min.
- Kids love these as presents.

2427
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,510
Fine. We'll address it to you.

2428
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:02,970
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2429
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:04,310
This looks interesting.

2430
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:05,470
- Okay.
- Okay.

2431
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:06,640
So Min.

2432
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,420
I really want to win something.

2433
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:10,510
- You don't need to be first place.
- Take the massage chair.

2434
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,390
- Air fryer.
- This is nice.

2435
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:13,550
- Air fryer.
- It's nice.

2436
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:15,390
- This is useful.
- Right?

2437
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:17,720
- I need an air fryer.
- What's this?

2438
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:19,890
- Okay.
- All right.

2439
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,300
So Min.

2440
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,830
What number?

2441
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:24,300
I got...

2442
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,930
- What's this?
- Did you win?

2443
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:26,930
What number is this?

2444
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,930
27.

2445
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,010
(27 is...)

2446
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:34,210
- Is it 27?
- Yes.

2447
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:35,340
Air fryer.

2448
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,310
Air fryer!

2449
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:43,510
(That's amazing.)

2450
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:45,150
- I wanted this.
- Air fryer.

2451
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,220
Jae Suk.

2452
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:48,020
So Min.

2453
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:49,090
- I wanted this.
- It's real.

2454
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:50,650
They really give it to you.

2455
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,720
So Min, you win the air fryer.

2456
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:53,760
Congratulations.

2457
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,020
(You get your prize right away.)

2458
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,390
Thank you.

2459
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:57,870
Thank you, everybody.

2460
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:59,370
There's a penalty as well.

2461
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:01,640
Last place will be treated as
noise cancellation.

2462
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:03,670
Suk Jin, during tomorrow's intro,

2463
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:05,710
- you will not have a microphone.
- Good.

2464
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,010
Excellent.

2465
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:10,880
(His audio will be missing.)

2466
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:11,970
- That's excellent.
- Great.

2467
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:13,940
- Just the intro?
- That's a great penalty.

2468
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,440
Suk Jin is the most energetic
during the intro.

2469
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:18,350
What will he do?

2470
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,680
Byeong Gyu and Soo Hyang
joined us today.

2471
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,960
- What did you think?
- They were the best.

2472
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,150
It was great seeing you.

2473
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:27,130
- I missed a teaser like him.
- I agree.

2474
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:29,630
I didn't mean to do it,
but I think I teased you too much.

2475
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:31,470
I would like to apologize.

2476
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:34,370
- All of a sudden?
- Now? Pretending to be nice?

2477
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:36,600
You have to keep going. You have to.

2478
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,140
- Personalities like you are rare.
- It's rare.

2479
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:41,470
I'm so happy
to see teasers like him.

2480
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:42,470
What about you, Soo Hyang?

2481
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,880
I was so happy to be here again,

2482
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,720
but am I taking these home
after working really hard?

2483
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,920
- People really like these.
- For sure.

2484
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,180
- Can I sell these?
- People like them.

2485
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,420
- Sure.
- For fan meetings abroad...

2486
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:56,550
- See you later!
- See you later!

2487
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,000
(Cruel exile has begun.)

2488
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,130
(He's the poor man without audio.)

2489
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,670
(They're surprised
to hear this music.)

2490
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:09,730
(The return of Kwang Soo
makes Suk Jin get up.)

2491
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,930
(Kwang Soo is back.)

2492
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:13,680
Isn't it "Kwang" for crazy
and "Soo" for water?

2493
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,550
(Kwang Soo was looking forward
to coming back, and he turns crazy.)

2494
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:18,810
This finally feels like Running Man.

2495
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:21,440
(Lee Il Hwa is waiting
for her kids.)

2496
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,920
(So are Park Mi Sun...)

2497
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,010
(and Hwang Young Hee.)

2498
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:28,480
(Kang Daniel is here
to find his mom.)

2499
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,850
(In order to become
the moms' kids,)

2500
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:33,150
(they try desperately.)

2501
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:35,300
(I'll rip name tags.)

2502
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,970
(Son, you can cut rice cakes.)

2503
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:40,500
(It's a serious war among the moms.)

2504
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,840
(Back slapping)

2505
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,430
(Tearing name tags)

2506
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,770
(Who will protect their mom?)

2507
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:48,080
(Protect Your Mom:
Another Rice Cake to the Ugly Child)
