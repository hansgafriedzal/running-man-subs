1
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,740
Hello.

2
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,110
- What is this?
- Are we going on stage?

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,410
Today, we're having
the Devil's Whisper Race.

5
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,110
We will have four captains with
their distinctive styles of acting,

6
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,050
- and they are waiting backstage.
- Captains?

7
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,710
- Do we have captains?
- Captains?

8
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,710
There are four captains.

9
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,420
You will be sitting on your chairs
turning your backs on them.

10
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,320
Each captain will take turns
on stage to make their appeal.

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,530
If you're curious about the captain,
you can press the button...

12
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,100
to turn your chair
and greet the captain.

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,340
This is like "Voice of Korea."

14
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,900
Right. It's like "Voice of Korea."

15
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,100
You have only two chances
to turn your chair each.

16
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,310
- Two chances.
- Twice.

17
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,000
The captain who makes
most members turn around...

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,750
will get to pick two members first.

19
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,450
Please bring in the chairs.

20
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,210
Just so you know, the button
doesn't turn your chair around.

21
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,320
You should turn it yourself.

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,990
- We know that.
- So it's not automatic.

23
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,850
It's manual.

24
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,090
Please pretend it's automatic.

25
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,530
I'll make it look automatic.

26
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,700
- It doesn't require energy.
- This is nice.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,320
I know. This is new.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,600
It's very unique.

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,170
- Let's begin then.
- Okay.

30
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,700
Please bring in our first guest.

31
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,810
- Don't look.
- I won't look.

32
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,140
I'm not going to look.

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,480
Who could it be?

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,540
I'm really curious. I really am.

35
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,280
(Busan Stone)

36
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,810
- What? It's a guy.
- It's a man.

37
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,650
- Hi.
- What?

38
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,260
Hello.

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,150
I'm Pengsoo.

40
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,950
- That's not Pengsoo.
- This is Maenggoo.

41
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,320
He sounds more like Maenggoo.

42
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,820
- He's not Pengsoo.
- Isn't it Maenggoo?

43
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,290
He's Maenggoo, not Pengsoo.

44
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,590
Hello. I'm...

45
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,730
Busan Stone.

46
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,090
- Stone?
- Please pick me.

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,640
He's a terrible speaker.

48
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,010
He sounds old. A stone?

49
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,780
- He has a nice voice though.
- I guess...

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,980
he's a singer.

51
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,250
- A cheerleader?
- Music, please.

52
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,750
I guess he's singing.

53
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,310
- Is he singing?
- He's singing.

54
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,570
If he's a singer,
we will recognize him immediately.

55
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,040
(The intro begins.)

56
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,890
(He has a low and deep voice.)

57
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,010
- What?
- Seriously?

58
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,820
- What?
- Seriously?

59
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,200
- Is he singing live?
- Who is he?

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,620
- Gosh, he's good.
- Who is he?

61
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,760
- He sounds good.
- I'm pushing it. I want to turn.

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,870
- I'm really curious.
- I want to turn around.

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,160
(He picked "Stone Block"
from the drama, "Itaewon Class.")

64
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,270
I think he's a singer.

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,280
He has a great voice.

66
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,180
I didn't like his speech...

67
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,810
Gosh, So Min.

68
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,870
(So Min is the first one
to push the button.)

69
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,120
(Who is the first guest?)

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,180
(Busan Stone)

71
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,550
What was that, So Min?

72
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,280
(Excited)

73
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,460
Who is it?

74
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,880
(So Min greets him with applause.
Who on earth is he?)

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,330
I don't regret my choice.

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,400
Hang on. This is...

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,870
(Fatal charms, strong presence)

78
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:36,270
(He's Actor Ahn Bo Hyun
with his class.)

79
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,580
(He shows off his vocal skills
that's just as good as his acting.)

80
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,710
I don't regret my choice.

81
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,280
- He's good.
- I think I know this voice.

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,810
I know. He sings well.

83
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,180
(Please turn around.)

84
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,880
(Should they turn around or not?
That's the problem.)

85
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,090
Wait. This song is...

86
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,330
(Shocked)

87
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,960
(He steps back in shock.)

88
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,030
Why?

89
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,810
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
- I'm so curious.

90
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,630
- Who is it?
- I'm curious.

91
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,030
- Kwang Soo.
- I want to push the button.

92
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,530
(He sings passionately
to make everyone turn around.)

93
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,940
It's not too late! Kwang Soo.

94
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,050
I want to push the button.

95
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,940
(Should I push it or not?)

96
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,120
I have to see him.

97
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,120
- "Itaewon Class".
- What? "Itaewon Class".

98
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,560
(Speechless)

99
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,090
I can't wait to see him.

100
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,750
(Hesitant)

101
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,830
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

102
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,660
(3 of them pushed the button,
and 5 of them didn't.)

103
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,000
(Saeroyi from Dongducheon is
excited to see the real class.)

104
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,630
(Making a bow)

105
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,180
- This is crazy.
- It really is.

106
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,970
I have a question.

107
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,970
I'd like to ask the man on stage.

108
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,990
On a scale of 1 to 10, how many
points would you give me?

109
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,060
- Why would he score you?
- What is he doing?

110
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,880
- Why would he give you marks?
- He's...

111
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,960
- What's that?
- Me.

112
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,790
He'd give zero points
because of your speech.

113
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,730
On a scale of 1 to 10,
what would it be?

114
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,820
I think highly of you,
so I'll give you seven points.

115
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,370
I was wondering...

116
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,430
Have you recently been in a drama?

117
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,470
Yes. I was in a drama
only a week ago.

118
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,000
- What?
- Only one week?

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,410
Hang on. Only one week?

120
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,000
I know what it is.
There's this drama.

121
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,070
It's "Itaewon Class."

122
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,680
- "Itaewon Class"?
- I guess that's him.

123
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,310
Is he Lee Seo Jun?

124
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,010
(Is he Lee Seo Jun
from "Itaewon Class"?)

125
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,940
(Suk Jin is really something
as he's heard.)

126
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,080
- He's Park Seo Jun.
- Gosh, Suk Jin.

127
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,250
- You're unbelievable.
- Who's Lee Seo Jun?

128
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,660
I'll give him zero points.

129
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,230
He got zero points.

130
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,450
(Right at the moment...)

131
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,520
(The countdown
to the closing starts.)

132
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,500
(They have only 2 chances
to turn around.)

133
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,630
Who is it? Is there someone else?

134
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,170
Time's up for the first guest.

135
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,610
- Really?
- I was going to turn around.

136
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,700
He sounds attractive.
I was about to pick him.

137
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,550
Now please bring in
our second guest.

138
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,850
I'll turn around this time.

139
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,070
I'll turn around
if it doesn't sound bad.

140
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,680
I'm really curious.

141
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,440
Hello.

142
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,940
It's a woman.

143
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,860
I'm Seocho-gu Golden Hand.

144
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,580
- Golden Hand?
- Yes.

145
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,320
(She's Ji Eui Soo who showed
her impressive acting...)

146
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,930
(as Jessica in the drama,
"When the Camellia Blooms.")

147
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,800
(She's a model and actress who will
bloom like a camellia.)

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,620
I'm Seocho-gu Golden Hand.

149
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,430
- Golden Hand?
- Yes.

150
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,260
- Does she live in Seocho-gu?
- Seocho-gu?

151
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,740
- She lives in Gangnam.
- Golden Hand?

152
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,000
Why is she Golden Hand?

153
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,870
I do need a golden hand.

154
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,140
(Silent)

155
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,550
- Aren't you going to sing?
- Aren't you doing anything?

156
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,180
- Are you performing?
- I'm doing it now.

157
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,420
We're getting ready
to show her talent.

158
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,250
They are bringing
some cooking utensils.

159
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,160
I guess she's preparing something.

160
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,560
That's why she's Golden Hand.

161
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,390
- Because she's a good cook.
- She cooks well.

162
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,470
Are you hungry?

163
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

164
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll cook for you guys.

165
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,170
Are you going to cook?

166
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,040
I've never seen someone who cooks
to show their talents.

167
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,870
Is she Big Mama, Lee Hye Jung?

168
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,310
I've never seen
anything like this before.

169
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,850
- She's using a knife.
- I'm curious.

170
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,720
- I wonder who she is.
- While she cooks,

171
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,310
I will show your caricatures
she drew at home.

172
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,560
- What?
- Did she draw us?

173
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,730
She's prepared a lot.

174
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,380
I guess she's skillful
with her hands.

175
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,450
What?

176
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,690
- My gosh.
- It's me.

177
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,800
- She's really good.
- Can I keep this painting?

178
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,870
- Sure.
- This is amazing.

179
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,430
Did she draw it herself?

180
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,870
That's so nice.

181
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,240
She's really good.

182
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,540
It's me.

183
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,740
- She's amazing.
- She didn't draw the mustache.

184
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,810
How did she know
I didn't have the mustache?

185
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,270
It doesn't have a mustache.

186
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,330
Show us the drawing of Jae Suk.

187
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,410
It looks the same.

188
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,700
Isn't it Se Chan?

189
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,180
That's not me.

190
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,420
It would've looked like me
with glasses on.

191
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,640
It's not Se Chan. It's me.

192
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,880
- I'm sure she majored in art.
- She is...

193
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,060
- an expert.
- She's very talented.

194
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,080
Have you ever met anyone of us
in person before?

195
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,230
- On a TV show?
- Yes.

196
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,890
- Or on a private occasion.
- It doesn't matter.

197
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,000
No, I've never met anyone of you.

198
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,040
Which one of us did you want
to meet the most?

199
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,540
I...

200
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,630
wanted to meet Suk Jin.

201
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,910
(He presses the button...)

202
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,930
(and turns around immediately.)

203
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,330
(Laughing)

204
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,910
(Shouting)

205
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,870
Suk Jin doesn't know who she is.

206
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,250
Suk Jin has no idea who she is.

207
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,810
He doesn't know who she is.

208
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,380
(A total stranger)

209
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,880
(He just pretends to be excited.)

210
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,290
He didn't even call her name.
What kind of reaction was that?

211
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,300
Suk Jin, don't do that.

212
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,320
What are you doing now?

213
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,500
I'm making pasta.

214
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,870
Guys. She's making pasta.

215
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,110
- And she peeled the tomatoes.
- Pasta?

216
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,500
She cooks well.

217
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,200
(Jae Suk turns around
tempted by the pasta.)

218
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,200
(I see.)

219
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,870
Jae Suk turned around.

220
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,440
(He keeps silent so other members
won't recognize her.)

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,810
Guys.

222
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,660
- Eui Soo.
- It smells good.

223
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,860
I didn't understand
why you'd cook here.

224
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,820
Let us taste the dish
so we can make our choice.

225
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,000
Please let us try it.

226
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,370
Let me see. I want to try it.

227
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,390
- I'm turning around.
- I want it too.

228
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,560
(He turns around
driven by the pasta.)

229
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,690
Gosh.

230
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,610
Hang on. Wait.

231
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,200
We've met before.

232
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,180
We've met before.

233
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,680
- When?
- When?

234
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,720
(We have never met before.)

235
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,540
Kwang Soo has a good memory.

236
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,950
(They appeared in the same drama.)

237
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,860
(Kwang Soo's right to be forgotten)

238
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,010
This is amazing.

239
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,230
(Jae Suk enjoys the pasta
in Haha's ear.)

240
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,360
Let me see.

241
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,050
I want to see it.

242
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,520
(Glancing)

243
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,660
She's really good.

244
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,870
This is driving me crazy.

245
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,070
(If they turn around now,
they can taste her pasta.)

246
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,610
(Finally...)

247
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,740
(Haha turns around
at the last moment.)

248
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,940
I'm not kidding.
It tastes really good.

249
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,110
- She cooks well.
- This is great.

250
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,210
This is crazy.

251
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,850
- It's like a restaurant dish.
- I don't regret my choice.

252
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,380
I'm serious.

253
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,750
It's the best spaghetti
I've ever had.

254
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,010
- Seriously.
- Is it that good?

255
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,190
We have two guests left.

256
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,360
- Here's our third guest.
- I can't turn around anymore?

257
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,090
- No, you can't.
- I'm so curious though.

258
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,230
Did you turn around twice?

259
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,550
- Let's see.
- I just couldn't hold it back.

260
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,960
He will go crazy.

261
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,730
Typical mischievous boys...

262
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,470
- can't hold it back.
- They can't.

263
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,630
Let's see.

264
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,610
(The third guest,
Songpa-dong Thumper)

265
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,370
(And a drum?)

266
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,000
(Who on earth is he?)

267
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,040
Hello.

268
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
- What? Wait.
- I like his voice.

269
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,080
Hang on.

270
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,350
I'm from Songpa-dong.

271
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,410
He sounds like Lee Byung Hun.

272
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,720
I'm Songpa-dong Thumper.

273
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,880
- He sounds familiar.
- I've heard of the voice.

274
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,730
(He's Song Jin Woo...)

275
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,500
(who performs in various shows
with his characterful acting.)

276
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,000
I think I know this voice.

277
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,940
(Is he showing his bare feet?)

278
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,030
What is he doing?

279
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,240
What? I heard some noise.

280
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,340
Is he a taffy seller?

281
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,640
Clap your hands.

282
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,750
(He asks them to clap their hands
with explosive sounds.)

283
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,220
(They start to clap.)

284
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,270
I'm sure it's him.

285
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,320
Who is he?

286
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,820
Is he playing the drums?

287
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,250
(Energetic)

288
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,150
(The drum sound makes
their hearts resonate.)

289
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,650
(Suk Jin is excited
to hear the drums.)

290
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,550
(He pretends to hesitate
with exaggerated gestures.)

291
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,830
(Pushing)

292
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,340
What?

293
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,030
What was that? Hey!

294
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,390
- I didn't mean it.
- You were hesitating.

295
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,660
You hesitated.

296
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Why did you pretend to hesitate
when you didn't?

297
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,870
Okay.

298
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,450
I knew it. It's you.

299
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,220
I don't want to turn around.

300
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,280
(The energetic drum
performance is over.)

301
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,320
I'm not curious.

302
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,650
By the way...

303
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,750
I have a question.

304
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,520
Yes?

305
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,730
Gosh, your voice...
Are you an actor?

306
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,960
Yes, I'm an actor.

307
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,200
(She doesn't want
to press the button.)

308
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,530
(What?)

309
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,160
(She didn't plan to turn around.)

310
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
No. Gosh.

311
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,130
- Hello.
- Hello. Have you been doing well?

312
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,980
- Yes.
- I pushed the button for her.

313
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,670
- So Min's response...
- I pushed it.

314
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,580
- She doesn't look too happy.
- Jae Suk pressed mine.

315
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,850
It was my last chance.

316
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,950
It's nice to meet you.

317
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,990
- Likewise. How have you been?
- Have you been well?

318
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,620
- Show us your talents.
- All right.

319
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,120
I'll lip sync.

320
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,150
- Lip sync?
- Yes.

321
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,410
- Lip sync?
- How will we be able...

322
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,830
- to watch him?
- We can't see that.

323
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,730
- If you're curious, turn around.
- I see.

324
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,830
If you're curious, turn around.

325
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,620
Right. Give me the music!

326
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,660
If you're curious, turn around.

327
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,870
(They're curious
but won't turn around.)

328
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,240
(Jong Kook enjoys the view.)

329
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,870
Oh, my.

330
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,710
- He's good.
- He's good.

331
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,370
- It's as if he's singing.
- It looks so realistic.

332
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,850
I'm so curious.

333
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,610
I can't take it.

334
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,770
(Haha and Ji Hyo turn around.)

335
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,620
(She likes what she's seeing.)

336
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,620
He's good.

337
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,280
(It's a Spanish song.)

338
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,360
He's good.

339
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,000
- You're good.
- You're really good.

340
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,390
You're good.

341
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,290
(My passion and joy
are all for you, senorita.)

342
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,370
I like it.

343
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,440
- It's so fun.
- He's good.

344
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,570
That's it.

345
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,400
- And...
- Lastly,

346
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,270
I have one last talent.

347
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,800
I can stand on my toe joints.

348
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,580
- What?
- On your toe joints?

349
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,610
Really?

350
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,820
(Everyone is surprised
by this unexpected talent.)

351
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,450
You're talking about what
ballerinas do.

352
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,320
(He stands on his toe joints.)

353
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,550
Can you do this?

354
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,150
This is worth watching.

355
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,830
- That's amazing.
- I can't believe this.

356
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,550
- How is that possible?
- My gosh.

357
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,750
(He really wants to see.)

358
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,260
(He can't take it anymore.)

359
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,570
(Shouting)

360
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,660
How is that possible?

361
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,340
(Kwang Soo shouts in shock.)

362
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,110
You can do that? What is that?

363
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,480
He can do it.

364
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,340
- You need to watch this.
- Okay!

365
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,170
- Is he a freak or what?
- How can he do that?

366
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,710
Can you do this?

367
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,850
- That's unbelievable.
- Can you?

368
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,720
- You're running out of time!
- He's amazing.

369
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,820
Time is ticking!

370
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,410
Sadly, your time's up.

371
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,620
- So many of us turned.
- Thank you.

372
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,250
- He's so talented.
- There's one last contestant.

373
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,100
Only Se Chan and Jong Kook
can turn around.

374
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,000
Really? Then are our teams fixed?

375
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,620
- That means...
- Let's do this first.

376
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,370
Please come on out.

377
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,840
(Hipster from Mt. Nam)

378
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
(Clickety-clack)

379
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,400
They're wearing heels, right?

380
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,740
(Hipster from Mt. Nam
looks interesting.)

381
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,740
(She's full of charisma.)

382
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,980
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

383
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,850
She has a great voice.

384
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,820
I won't talk much.

385
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,850
I'll just show you
how much swag I have.

386
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,880
- Swag?
- Swag?

387
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,090
Drop the beat!

388
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,910
(She's the last contestant
who has enchanted the members.)

389
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,330
I need to turn around!

390
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,000
(Lee Joo Young showed
her charismatic side...)

391
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,620
(on "Itaewon Class.")

392
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,100
(She's a rising star who has said
many famous lines.)

393
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,370
- Drop the beat.
- Drop the beat.

394
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,600
- I need to turn around!
- What is going on?

395
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,340
- I want to turn around.
- Can I not?

396
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,630
(She grooves to the rhythm.)

397
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,250
This is just my style.

398
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,450
Put your hands up,
put your hands up

399
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,450
(This is "Caution" by Tashannie.)

400
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,540
This song?

401
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,650
I love this song.

402
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,490
- What?
- Turn around!

403
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,230
Turn around!

404
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,650
(Shouting)

405
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,420
(He gets excited whenever someone
from "Itaewon Class" comes out.)

406
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,230
I'm so curious!

407
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,570
(Dancing)

408
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,130
(He dances to the beat.)

409
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,070
(It's a soulful performance.)

410
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,130
She's good. She really is.

411
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,400
- Put your hands up!
- She's good.

412
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,480
Put your hands up!

413
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,080
She's really good.

414
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,450
(It's like a singing contest.)

415
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,780
I'm glad I still have a chance.

416
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,200
(These two middle-aged men
dance along.)

417
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,970
(She tore up the stage.)

418
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,120
I really want to turn around.

419
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,020
- I'm so curious!
- I really want to.

420
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,200
Her voice...

421
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,940
and her appearance
contrast each other.

422
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,630
She's really good.
Isn't she, Jong Kook?

423
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,500
- I became nostalgic.
- Who is she?

424
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,800
Can you sing another song
by Yoon Mi Rae?

425
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,910
(The countdown begins.)

426
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,120
- I'm so disappointed.
- 3, 2, 1.

427
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,750
- You've run out of chances.
- You're right. Who was she?

428
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,650
I'm at a disadvantage here.

429
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,910
- Hello.
- Hello.

430
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,050
- Hello.
- You were so good.

431
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,520
- You were.
- "Itaewon Class".

432
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,020
- Goodness.
- They're from the drama.

433
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,370
They are.

434
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,970
She's Lee Joo Young.

435
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,740
You see...

436
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,760
I wanted to turn every single time.

437
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,970
- Me too.
- Me too.

438
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,400
We all felt that way.

439
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,270
I wanted to turn around
for the last stage.

440
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,580
- I know.
- I really did.

441
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,900
Your performance was outstanding.

442
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,400
But I had run out of chances.

443
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,950
Let's start with Ahn Bo Hyun.

444
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,540
He's very famous these days.

445
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,590
Jang Geun Won.

446
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,220
(He calls his character's name.)

447
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,750
You were a boxer.

448
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,320
- Right.
- Right.

449
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,620
- They're rivals.
- I love the drama.

450
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,230
- They are?
- What do you mean?

451
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,750
(Jong Kook just boxes for fun.
Ahn Bo Hyun is experienced.)

452
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,250
He used to be a professional boxer.

453
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,370
- I respect that.
- He was a professional boxer?

454
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,340
(Suk Jin suddenly approaches him.)

455
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,470
(He throws a jab.)

456
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,070
- Suk Jin, what was that?
- Did you look at his jab?

457
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,610
(Imitating)

458
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,440
It was a childish punch.

459
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,080
You'll fly away even before
getting punched, old man.

460
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,500
How dare you call me that?

461
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,870
- Old man.
- What did you say?

462
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,370
You'll fly away.

463
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,820
- Right.
- Watch out.

464
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,720
- All right.
- He has a huge fist.

465
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,750
You've once talked...

466
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,860
about Jong Kook's boxing posture
in another variety show.

467
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,750
- He criticized him?
- It was on "Radio Star."

468
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,920
- He criticized him?
- Yes.

469
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,020
- Really?
- So...

470
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,290
they asked him
about Jong Kook's posture.

471
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,940
He said it didn't look professional.

472
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,340
(He was being honest.)

473
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,710
He's forcing a smile.

474
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,260
He is.

475
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,270
You said that, right?

476
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,710
- He's forcing a smile.
- Well...

477
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,000
- You said that, right?
- Yes.

478
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,720
It was in 2018.

479
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,250
They edited it incorrectly.

480
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,510
That's what they did.
I respect him greatly.

481
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,380
- I admire him a lot.
- You said things before that,

482
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,990
- but they edit it like that.
- Yes, they did.

483
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,490
- Right.
- Next up is...

484
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,820
Seocho-gu Golden Hand,
Ji Eui Soo.

485
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,500
- Did you really draw those?
- Yes.

486
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,560
I bet it took you some time.

487
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,700
I spent three days on them.

488
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,000
She worked on them
for three days.

489
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,640
That's amazing.

490
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,070
You said you never met any of us,

491
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,340
- but we've worked together before.
- Really?

492
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,380
Yes.

493
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,070
- We both filmed "Dear My Friends."
- What?

494
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,950
- I can't believe she forgot me.
- What?

495
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,920
How could she not remember you
at all?

496
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,460
- I mean...
- Eui Soo.

497
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,160
She didn't think about you.

498
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,730
Was that intentional or what?

499
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,890
She shouldn't be embarrassed
about knowing me, right?

500
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,930
- I know her.
- Right.

501
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,090
So why?

502
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,560
Maybe her agency
made an announcement.

503
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,790
About what?

504
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,790
- "Ignore Lee Kwang Soo."
- What do you mean?

505
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,900
- Why didn't she recognize you?
- We should be more understanding.

506
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,170
It could happen.

507
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,830
It says that you can
kick toilet paper.

508
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,910
What is this?

509
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,770
- Kick toilet paper?
- Oh, this?

510
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,800
- You can do this?
- It's not easy.

511
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,340
- Messi did it as well.
- Can you do that?

512
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,450
- I'm not that good.
- Let's see.

513
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,490
- I guess she can still do it.
- It's not easy.

514
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,110
She's so talented.

515
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,250
(She chose this
UEFA Champions League song.)

516
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,610
- She must be good.
- I...

517
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,350
I asked them to play this.

518
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,390
I chose this song.

519
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,170
(This is her first time
showing off this talent.)

520
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,700
(How good is she?)

521
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,410
- Goodness.
- What was that?

522
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
(What?)

523
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,240
(Why is a roll of tissue here?)

524
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,830
- Goodness.
- What was that?

525
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,940
- What is this?
- What is this?

526
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,600
- Hey.
- Did we have...

527
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,720
- to catch it?
- Was that it?

528
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,450
It looked like
she was throwing a bouquet.

529
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,310
- What is this?
- I thought you could do it.

530
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,510
You couldn't?

531
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,960
I did practice.

532
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,110
- Try it again.
- Try it again.

533
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,960
- Try it again.
- Turn the music on again.

534
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,160
I'll do my best.

535
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,690
- You should kick it at least twice.
- Right.

536
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,000
Go on.

537
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,850
(Bo Hyun looks even more nervous.)

538
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,230
(Screaming)

539
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,240
(Surprisingly, she does worse
than before.)

540
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,090
- What was that?
- Hold on.

541
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,710
- You kicked it once.
- Hold on.

542
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,670
- Why did she scream?
- She screamed.

543
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,830
She did that before as well.

544
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,480
But if she said
this was her talent...

545
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,570
She should've kicked
at least 2 to 3 times.

546
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,180
All right. Thank you.

547
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
(Ji Hyo reaches out her hand.)

548
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,010
- Do you want to do it?
- Me?

549
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,890
- No.
- Why did you reach out?

550
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,250
- Try it.
- Me?

551
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,660
- Just do it.
- Try it.

552
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,730
- Please play the music.
- Try it.

553
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,320
She'll do it.

554
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,930
- She volunteered?
- Yes.

555
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,000
You look shocked.

556
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,250
She reached out like this.

557
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,590
She did?

558
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,000
She changed a lot.

559
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,500
- Yes, she takes initiative.
- I was surprised.

560
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,170
- She wanted to try this.
- She wanted it.

561
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,530
- Give it to her.
- Hand it to her.

562
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,980
- Try it.
- Try it.

563
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,910
- Do it. Turn on the music.
- Turn on the music.

564
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,250
Go on.

565
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,250
She changed so much.

566
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,280
Just kick it twice, and you've won.

567
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,890
(How good is she?)

568
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
(She kicks it twice.)

569
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,850
Ji Hyo, I want to thank you.

570
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,060
- Right.
- Really.

571
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,700
- Ji Hyo.
- You volunteered.

572
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,260
- Pick it up.
- I hate Suk Jin.

573
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,260
- Why?
- "Pick it up."

574
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,560
I was just joking around.

575
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,800
- Goodness.
- I was just joking around.

576
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,910
Next up is Hipster from Mt. Nam,
Lee Joo Young.

577
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,040
Ma Hyun I.

578
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,310
I was amazed by your performance.

579
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,340
I'm so disappointed
that I couldn't get to watch it.

580
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,490
- Not many people can sing that.
- They can't sing that song.

581
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,490
- She was good.
- She rapped so well.

582
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,660
It's not easy to sing
like the original singers.

583
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,690
It's not an easy song.

584
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,020
I heard you debuted nine years ago.

585
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,020
Seriously?

586
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,560
- I'm a bit hesitant to say that.
- Why?

587
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,700
I've worked on independent films
since 2012.

588
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,140
- Still.
- They still count.

589
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,830
- They still count.
- That was your debut.

590
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,940
You're well known in that field.

591
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,480
- Please be quiet.
- What?

592
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,570
- Quiet.
- She shared something with us.

593
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,040
I was talking about her.

594
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,380
But...

595
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,070
- But...
- I love it when he does that.

596
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,250
- I was complimenting her.
- I love it when he cuts him off.

597
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,690
I was waiting.

598
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,990
That's Jae Suk's role.

599
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,050
- I wanted to let the viewers know.
- Don't.

600
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,780
- All right.
- Just stay quiet.

601
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,280
Be quiet.

602
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,850
Next is Song Jin Woo.

603
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,430
- I love him.
- Hello.

604
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,320
- I love him.
- Oh, come on.

605
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,740
He debuted through a musical called
"Oh, my Captain."

606
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,500
- That was 13 years ago.
- Really?

607
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,300
I could tell from his voice.

608
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,440
- His diction is great.
- He has a good voice.

609
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,410
They were in different majors,
but he and Kwang Soo...

610
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,530
went to the same university.

611
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,210
- We went to school together.
- Right.

612
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,710
- We both enrolled in 2004.
- Right.

613
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,340
- You joined in the same year?
- Yes.

614
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,270
How was Kwang Soo as a student?

615
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,150
Well, this is just
how I thought of him.

616
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,890
- Sure, don't feel any pressure.
- It's just how I thought...

617
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,250
because I didn't
know him personally.

618
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,460
I thought he was a scumbag.

619
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,190
(A scumbag?)

620
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,690
- I...
- You're right.

621
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,090
- I saw him from afar and...
- A scumbag.

622
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,350
I thought he was...

623
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,730
a scumbag too.

624
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,400
- You too?
- In our class...

625
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
I'd see Kwang Soo approach...

626
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,400
and call him a scumbag.

627
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,500
Back then, he had a bob.

628
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,030
- Really?
- Yes, he looked like a sleazeball.

629
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,070
Really?

630
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,710
- Seriously?
- He had a bob.

631
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,000
Well, you shaved your eyebrows
into a thin line.

632
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,340
- Really?
- Yes.

633
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,680
- You know the Japanese style.
- Really? Like the Japanese style?

634
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,420
I spat on the floor
whenever I passed him.

635
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,450
And I also sprayed salt.

636
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,920
He was that ominous.

637
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,460
But then we'd meet and...

638
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,690
- Hello.
- Goodness, hi.

639
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,730
- How have you been?
- But from afar?

640
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,930
But from afar?

641
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,090
- That scumbag.
- What a sleaze.

642
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,820
Unbelievable.

643
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,400
That's why he's a scumbag.

644
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,860
But I was happy to see him do well.

645
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,090
They're so funny.

646
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,910
They're happy to see
each other do well.

647
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,710
Shouldn't you be annoyed
of each other's success?

648
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,770
- I was really happy for him.
- Seriously? You're happy for him?

649
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,140
- I was happy for him.
- There's also...

650
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,500
another talent Jin Woo showed us.

651
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,510
Remember how Lee Byung Hun danced...

652
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,110
- during his fan meet-and-greet?
- That dance?

653
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,110
- Right.
- I remember that.

654
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,780
- Haven't you seen it?
- I haven't.

655
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,810
Can you show us once more?

656
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,050
I call it the healthy teeth dance,
but they're just some simple moves.

657
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,990
It's the smile that matters.

658
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,750
His grin...

659
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,000
and his eyes that shoot lasers.

660
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,290
(His grin
and his eyes that shoot lasers)

661
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,440
(The healthy teeth dance)

662
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,530
(The elegant Lee Byung Hun)

663
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,860
(The cheap copy)

664
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,680
(What on earth is that?)

665
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,680
His face stays the same.

666
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,040
He looks just like Lee Byung Hun.

667
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,190
(It's a 99.9 percent match.)

668
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,350
- Look at his eyes.
- His expression stays the same.

669
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,460
If you look at Byung Hun's video,

670
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,930
- you'll see that it's the same.
- Really?

671
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,350
We should see
the original video too.

672
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,730
If you see the original video,
you'll see that it's the same.

673
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,320
- Exactly.
- They're the same.

674
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,520
I haven't seen it before,
but I can imagine it.

675
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,260
- I can almost see it.
- You'll see that...

676
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,400
he looks exactly like Lee Byung Hun.

677
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,260
- Right.
- How about "Despacito"?

678
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,440
- Sorry?
- "Despacito".

679
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,860
- But...
- "Despacito".

680
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,140
- What's he talking about?
- Well,

681
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,210
- I lip-sync to it.
- Can you show us?

682
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,680
Cue music.

683
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,880
(The music plays.)

684
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,010
This song isn't easy to lip-sync to.

685
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,650
Look at him splitting the beat.

686
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,110
(My gosh.)

687
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,820
(Amid his puffing...)

688
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,160
(seeps out a deep Latin scent.)

689
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,700
(He even lip-syncs
to the electronic sounds.)

690
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,590
(100 percent lip-sync)

691
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,940
This is smothering though.

692
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,860
- It's actually kind of scary.
- Right.

693
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,030
(Sancho Song is back.)

694
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,250
I can't look him in the eye.

695
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,340
Now bring back Lee Byung Hun.

696
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,690
(Latin meets Lee Byung Hun.)

697
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,510
(His unrivaled stage presence)

698
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,420
What's this?

699
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,430
(He starts pointing
his fingers at them.)

700
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,930
What on earth is this?

701
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,790
That was amazing.

702
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,430
(His performance
captivated everyone.)

703
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,670
- Unbelievable.
- Please give it up for Jin Woo.

704
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,860
(And now everyone's
been introduced.)

705
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,800
I'd just like to inform you
that So Min...

706
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,500
hasn't been feeling well
for a few days.

707
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,410
- She's been having dizzy spells.
- So she...

708
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,100
- went to see a doctor nearby.
- All right.

709
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,210
We all hope that...

710
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,450
she gets well soon...

711
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,920
as we begin today's race.

712
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,310
Let's do this!

713
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,510
- Yes!
- Nice!

714
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,310
- So Min, get well soon!
- Get well soon.

715
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,350
- Let's do this.
- See you soon!

716
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,890
Go, So Min!

717
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,930
Don't you worry about today's race.

718
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,750
Today's race is called
the Devil's Whisper Race.

719
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,360
There are eight players in total.

720
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,290
5 are angels while 3 are devils.

721
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,000
Only you know
which role you're playing.

722
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,710
Don't we have two devils now?

723
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,440
- One just left.
- Exactly.

724
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,770
So Min will be included
in the race today...

725
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,240
- even though she's not present.
- Really? Okay.

726
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,300
- We'll have to be wise.
- After each round,

727
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,010
the winning team will receive hints
about the teammates' identities...

728
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,310
as well as a chance
to swap out teammates.

729
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,220
After the race is over,

730
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,220
if your team
only consists of angels,

731
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,920
that team will win a chance
to choose a prize.

732
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,020
If the team has
an angel and a devil,

733
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,730
only the devil will get
to choose a prize.

734
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,400
If the team has
more than two devils,

735
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,790
everyone in that team
will receive a penalty.

736
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,500
You'll now form your teams.

737
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,800
In Voice of Running Man,

738
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,530
Jin Woo came in 1st place
with 6 votes.

739
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,570
Eui Soo is in 2nd place,
Bo Hyun is in 3rd place,

740
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,040
while Joo Young is in fourth place.

741
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,250
In that order, you will
each choose two teammates.

742
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,810
Jin Woo, go ahead
and choose two teammates.

743
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,080
It's important to choose
as many angels as possible.

744
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,050
- I see.
- Jin Woo?

745
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,630
It's as if you're forcing him.

746
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,690
Should you be this forceful?

747
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,290
Jin Woo.

748
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,200
- My first pick is Jong Kook.
- All right!

749
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,000
Of course.

750
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
(What?)

751
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,400
- She's trying to appeal to him.
- I love your enthusiasm.

752
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,300
- It's hilarious.
- All right.

753
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,410
Look at Ji Hyo taking initiative.

754
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,140
- Ji Hyo!
- Come on!

755
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,440
Yes, Ji Hyo.

756
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,100
Which family of Song are you from?

757
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,480
It's a stage name.

758
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,420
(Embarrassed)

759
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,150
That was hilarious. Jin Woo asked
which family of Song she was from,

760
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,690
and she told him it's a stage name.

761
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,250
Her actual surname is Cheon.

762
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,110
- I see.
- Her surname is Cheon.

763
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,130
- Her real name is Cheon Sung Im.
- A stage name?

764
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,280
There's a high chance
that he's a devil though.

765
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,930
(The teams)

766
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,560
All right then.

767
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,760
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go.

768
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,530
You'll now play for a chance...

769
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,290
to receive a hint and
to swap teammates.

770
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,240
This is Battle Royal: Rip or Tear.

771
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,800
- Rip or Tear?
- Tear?

772
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Rip or Tear?

773
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,440
One from each team
will compete in each round,

774
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,800
and you will play
a total of three rounds.

775
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,070
The members from each team
will try to outsmart...

776
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,890
the others for one minute,

777
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,990
and then try to rip name tags off
for 20 seconds.

778
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,920
So Min's not here,
so it's just the two of us.

779
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,320
So one of you
will have to play twice.

780
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,350
You're quite smart, right?

781
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,200
Yang Saeroyi can compete twice.

782
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,350
- Unbelievable.
- Yang Saeroyi?

783
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,430
If by any chance...

784
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,020
Don't be like that.

785
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,330
You will compete until
there is only one member left.

786
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,800
Points will be given to you
depending on how you did.

787
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,880
The team with the highest points...

788
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,240
will receive hints
about all the teammates...

789
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,300
and get a chance to swap teammates.

790
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,710
The team in second place...

791
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,800
will only get the chance
to swap teammates.

792
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,340
- Okay, good.
- Let us reveal...

793
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,180
the quizzes first.

794
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,150
5-second Compliment Game,
4-syllable Game,

795
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,010
and Sing 1 Line.

796
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,110
Only one from each team
will stay in the ring now.

797
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,190
All right. Good luck.

798
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,780
In the Five-second Compliment Game,

799
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,520
you will target your opponent.

800
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,290
The one that's been targeted
must say...

801
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,670
three compliments
about the one who targeted them.

802
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,760
- Three compliments?
- This isn't easy.

803
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,900
This isn't easy at all.

804
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,300
The game will continue for a minute,

805
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,530
and you'll be out of the game
if you get it wrong.

806
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,710
- We'll be out?
- The ones...

807
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,270
that survive this game
will begin Name Tag Elimination...

808
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,910
at the sound of the bell.

809
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,250
- Oh, no.
- I can't believe...

810
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,310
that Joo Young has to compete
with veterans.

811
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,780
- What?
- Unbelievable.

812
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,110
- She doesn't know how it's done.
- I'm sure she'll do well.

813
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,420
- Joo Young.
- The captains...

814
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,130
are relatively new to these games,

815
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,350
so they each get an extra life.

816
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,350
- Nice one!
- All right.

817
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,350
- Good.
- All right.

818
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,930
The four of you will now sit.

819
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,060
Ji Hyo, stay positive.

820
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,860
I rarely compliment others though.

821
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,500
You're out if you get it wrong.

822
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,670
Ready, get set...

823
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,500
Haha!

824
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,880
Great tone of voice,
good acting, and pretty.

825
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,300
Suk Jin!

826
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,750
You're short but brave,
honest, and great.

827
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,250
- What?
- Honest?

828
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,720
Is that supposed
to be a compliment?

829
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,280
How is being short a compliment?

830
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
- It's debatable.
- It's a compliment.

831
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,920
It shouldn't be vague.

832
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,630
- He's short but...
- Go ahead.

833
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,730
Ji Hyo!

834
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,000
You're old but sexy
and you have a big nose.

835
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,820
(You're old but sexy
and you have a big nose.)

836
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,020
(It's the best compliment ever.)

837
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,290
- Hold on.
- How is being old a compliment?

838
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,790
- Hey.
- Is that a compliment?

839
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,440
Well, it means he's experienced.

840
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,670
- Well...
- It's a compliment!

841
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,970
- Right.
- Being old...

842
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,070
- isn't a compliment.
- You may be old...

843
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,270
- but you're still sexy.
- That's a good one.

844
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,210
- Ji Hyo, good one.
- Okay.

845
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,380
Joo Young.

846
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,720
The necklace is pretty,
so is your cap, and also your eyes.

847
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,010
Nice one.

848
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,150
She's good at this game.

849
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,080
- Suk Jin.
- Is it possible...

850
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,190
to be this pretty,
adorable, and lovely?

851
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,280
But...

852
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,730
- Hold on.
- Joo Young liked it.

853
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,130
- This shouldn't be allowed.
- This isn't right.

854
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,550
- That way of talking...
- Why not?

855
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,730
- This shouldn't be allowed.
- Why not?

856
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,460
- Rip their name tags off.
- Rip them off!

857
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,470
(The bell rings to signal
the Name Tag Elimination.)

858
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,700
- Rip them off!
- Go!

859
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,200
(They suddenly go after each other.)

860
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,290
Get them!

861
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,700
- Hold on.
- Get him.

862
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,790
You won't survive this.

863
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,800
(They go after Suk Jin
who's an easy target.)

864
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,440
- You won't survive this.
- No, don't attack me together.

865
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,140
Don't let him rip it off.

866
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,240
(Haha has Suk Jin's name tag
in his hand.)

867
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,710
(Will he be eliminated?)

868
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,880
Go after him.

869
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,250
(Joo Young suddenly appears.)

870
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,680
Go after him!

871
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,180
(Haha barely gets to safety.)

872
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,390
Joo Young, go ahead.
Go after his name tag.

873
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,890
- Go for it.
- Hold on.

874
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,920
- Go after him.
- Watch your back!

875
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,430
Watch out for Joo Young.

876
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,430
(At that moment!)

877
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,350
Watch out for Joo Young.

878
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,730
(Ripped off)

879
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,820
Nice one.

880
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,090
- Suk Jin...
- Good job!

881
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,970
- Nice one.
- What good does defense do?

882
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,300
The old but sexy Suk Jin is out.

883
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,300
The old but sexy Suk Jin is out!

884
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,880
The old but sexy Suk Jin.

885
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,440
- My gosh.
- I'm sorry, guys.

886
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,210
- It's all right.
- He just apologized.

887
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,270
(He held up his hand
for a high-five.)

888
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,720
(His hand has no place to go.)

889
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,510
Suk Jin held up his hand for
a high-five, but they ignored him.

890
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,110
Eui Soo just turned around.

891
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,820
- That's not it.
- Joo Young...

892
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,080
knows how to play this game
better than I do.

893
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,750
Ji Hyo ripped your name tag off...

894
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,290
so why are you taking it out
on Joo Young?

895
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,400
It was chaotic up there.
Suk Jin's mind is a mess right now.

896
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,320
- He's out of it.
- He's still sexy though.

897
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,090
- We'll begin with Joo Young.
- Sure.

898
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,290
Okay, let's go.

899
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Ji Hyo!

900
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,740
You're talented, adorable,
and you have pretty dimples.

901
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,210
Okay, good.

902
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Haha.

903
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,610
You're old, a great actress,
and you live in a cave.

904
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,150
Are those compliments?

905
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,220
Of course.
She never compromises.

906
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,890
Ji Hyo.

907
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,350
You give birth well
and your beard...

908
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,320
Am I the one who gave birth?

909
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,520
(Am I the one who gave birth?)

910
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,290
(Technically speaking,
he's not the one who gave birth.)

911
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,430
- Gosh.
- Hold on.

912
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,200
- Giving birth...
- Babies...

913
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,020
- You're out.
- That's not a compliment.

914
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,030
- There's no doubt about it.
- You're out.

915
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,400
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's not a compliment.

916
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,670
- It should at least make sense.
- Exactly.

917
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,640
- Let's do this then.
- Here we go.

918
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,270
You parted your hair well,
you have a small head,

919
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,180
and you have
such nice, straight eyebrows.

920
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,720
You're a fashionista,
you're wearing nice socks,

921
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,070
and your shoes match them so well.

922
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,390
She's good at this game.

923
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,890
You have no gray hair, your
shoulders are just broad enough,

924
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,050
and you have long legs.

925
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,780
- Rip off the name tag!
- Rip off the name tag, Joo Young!

926
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,990
- Don't be scared.
- I'll rip off your name tag.

927
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,500
Joo Young, go for it.

928
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,930
- Go for it.
- Good.

929
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,790
Gosh.

930
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,320
Haha is pretending to be strong.

931
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,440
(Haha pretends to be strong.)

932
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,560
Don't worry!

933
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,060
(Joo Young bounces off the ropes...)

934
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,260
(and tries a knee kick.)

935
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,070
- Joo Young, good job!
- Come on!

936
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,410
Why are you so strong?

937
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,910
Go, Ma Hyun I!

938
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,810
Joo Young tried a knee kick.

939
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,420
- Joo Young!
- Rip it off!

940
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,840
- Rip it off!
- It's been a while.

941
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,920
(Haha hooks Joo Young's leg.)

942
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,190
- Joo Young, no!
- Joo Young!

943
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,280
Get out!

944
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,020
(Haha goes for
Joo Young's name tag.)

945
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,430
Rip it off! The other side!

946
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,790
The other side! There you go.

947
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,000
- Joo Young is incredible.
- No!

948
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,750
Let go!

949
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,790
Hey!

950
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,130
(Joo Young counterattacks.)

951
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,440
- Yes!
- Oh, no!

952
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,140
(Joo Young's unexpected
counterattack creates tension.)

953
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,910
Yes!

954
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,530
Hey!

955
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,250
(Haha's name tag is ripped off!)

956
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,010
(No one saw this coming.)

957
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,250
She's so strong!

958
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,250
Gosh.

959
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,890
- Unbelievable.
- My goodness.

960
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,350
I didn't go easy on her.

961
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,220
Joo Young.

962
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,780
- What are you talking about?
- You definitely didn't.

963
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,730
- We can see that you didn't.
- Joo Young is so good.

964
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,290
- Joo Young is amazing.
- My gosh.

965
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,730
- Not everyone can pull that off.
- She's really strong.

966
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,000
She just grabbed his name tag...

967
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,290
and ripped it off right away.

968
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,670
She's incredible.

969
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,140
Joo Young even did a knee kick.
Next!

970
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,410
The 2nd round is
the 4-syllable Game.

971
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,480
Let's go!

972
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,600
The Four-syllable Game?

973
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,500
- Is it Joo Young again?
- Jin Woo, warm up! Good!

974
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,420
(He performs a takedown
against himself.)

975
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,450
- Jin Woo.
- Jin Woo, what did you do?

976
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,510
- What did you do?
- I thought it'd work.

977
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,350
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

978
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,490
Yes!

979
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,630
Here comes the King of Ad-libs.
The King of Four-syllable Words.

980
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,250
- Give me your bag.
- The King of Ad-libs.

981
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,490
- Let me show you what I got.
- Jae Suk.

982
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,320
- You're not funny.
- I'll show you.

983
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,700
- The King of Ad-libs.
- Haha.

984
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,820
You can do this!

985
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,940
You get to pick a player
in this game too.

986
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,260
The attacker will pick one person...

987
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,910
and say the first 2 syllables
of a 4-syllable word.

988
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,570
- Hannam.
- Bridge.

989
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,250
- There you go.
- There you go.

990
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,010
You need to stay calm.

991
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,450
Relax.

992
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,040
- TV.
- XQ.

993
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,250
That's right.

994
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,310
- Cheongju.
- Bridge.

995
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,780
"Cheongju Bridge"?

996
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,990
- It exists.
- "Cheongju Bridge"?

997
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,520
- It doesn't exist?
- Search for it.

998
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,900
- It exists.
- Search for it.

999
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,850
What's the correct answer?

1000
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,520
There's no one correct answer.
It just has to make sense.

1001
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,360
- That's not how it works.
- Isn't that right?

1002
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,360
- It doesn't work that way.
- You need a correct answer.

1003
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,200
- You need to follow the rules.
- This is not okay.

1004
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,860
- You need a correct answer.
- You're out.

1005
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,140
The Cheongju Bridge exists.

1006
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,380
- It exists.
- It exists.

1007
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,910
- It exists.
- The Cheongju Bridge exists.

1008
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,100
You're safe now.

1009
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,750
- That's what I had in mind.
- It exists.

1010
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,840
That's what I had in mind.

1011
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,570
That's why I threw salt at him
back in college.

1012
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,610
(Kwang Soo is reminded.)

1013
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,170
- He's so mean.
- I had to.

1014
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,480
- Okay.
- Eui Soo.

1015
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,840
- Jukma.
- Gou.

1016
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,650
Hyeongseol.

1017
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,780
Ji...

1018
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,800
What is it?

1019
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,090
- Hey.
- It's "hyeongseoljigong".

1020
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,690
- It's too difficult.
- Did you know it?

1021
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,730
- It's "hyeongseoljigong".
- Did you know it?

1022
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,760
(It means
"the fruits of studying hard".)

1023
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,860
- It describes this situation.
- Be honest.

1024
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,110
With your hand on your heart,
did you know it?

1025
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,710
It describes this situation.

1026
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,880
I guess Jin Woo is not so smart.

1027
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,280
He doesn't know "hyeongseoljigong".

1028
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,510
- Jin Woo.
- Jin Woo.

1029
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,480
- You have another chance.
- You have another chance.

1030
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,050
- Hold on.
- This is not good.

1031
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,070
Did you say "hyeongseoljigong"
describes this situation?

1032
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,250
- Kwang Soo.
- "Hyeongseoljigong".

1033
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,820
What does "hyeongseoljigong" mean?

1034
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,780
- This complicated...
- Space.

1035
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,090
- space.
- We learned it.

1036
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,920
Se Chan, can you tell us...

1037
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,230
It describes this kind of behavior.

1038
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,630
- That's what it means.
- Not my behavior.

1039
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,090
- It suits Jin Woo's behavior.
- It describes your behavior.

1040
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,510
This situation itself is
"hyeongseoljigong".

1041
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,730
That's hilarious.

1042
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,230
Our members are so funny.

1043
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,010
- You're our captain.
- All right.

1044
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,510
- They're all so smart.
- Let's go!

1045
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,710
How about this one?

1046
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,980
- "Who do you think you are?"
- No.

1047
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,070
That doesn't count.

1048
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,280
He's not even trying to be fair.

1049
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,610
Start.

1050
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,210
You need to know many words
to play this game.

1051
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,460
- Infinite.
- Challenge.

1052
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,260
Jajak.

1053
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,420
Siin.

1054
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,800
- That works.
- That's okay.

1055
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,320
You were thinking of
the "birch tree", right?

1056
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,420
(That's right.)

1057
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,030
If I can find "jajaksiin"
in the dictionary, you're safe.

1058
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,090
- Let's see.
- Is it in the dictionary?

1059
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,570
- What's with you?
- Is that even a word?

1060
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,210
You guys understood
what it means, didn't you?

1061
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,800
I know "jajaksi" means a "poem,"
but "jajaksiin" doesn't make sense.

1062
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,510
- "Jajaksiin"...
- He's being weird.

1063
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,250
- I thought Jin Woo was smart.
- Exactly.

1064
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,780
You guys understood.
Cameramen, you understood it, right?

1065
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,250
Haha and I understood it.

1066
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,420
- We understood it.
- You understood it too?

1067
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,360
I looked it up at the National
Institute of Korean Language.

1068
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,030
"Jajaksi" exists,
but "jajaksiin" doesn't.

1069
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,150
Then what do you call
the person who writes a jajaksi?

1070
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,420
- Hey, you're out.
- Come here.

1071
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,460
- Throw some salt at him.
- I'll go back.

1072
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,900
- See you.
- See you.

1073
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,300
See you guys.

1074
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,860
- Eui Soo, you can start.
- She's good.

1075
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,010
- Eui Soo will go first.
- She's good.

1076
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,170
Arma.

1077
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,670
Geddon.

1078
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
- That was hard.
- That was hard.

1079
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,050
- I didn't know that one.
- For a second...

1080
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,210
Yubi.

1081
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,420
Mueon.

1082
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,340
- She said, "mueon".
- She said, "muhwan".

1083
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,250
- What?
- What's wrong with it?

1084
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,750
- She said, "muhwan".
- Muhwan.

1085
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,480
- She said, "muhwan".
- Eui Soo...

1086
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,860
She said, "muhwan".

1087
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,590
- Eui Soo.
- Didn't you say, "mueon"?

1088
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,190
- I said, "muhwan".
- It's "yubimuhwan".

1089
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,300
My pronunciation is bad.

1090
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,960
- She said, "mueon".
- No.

1091
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,130
"Yubimuhwan".

1092
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,530
I knew it when she juggled
with the toilet paper.

1093
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,860
- She's a liar.
- It's "yubimuhwan".

1094
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,130
- She clearly said, "yubimuhwan".
- Let's just move on.

1095
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,300
Nerve.

1096
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,510
Cells.

1097
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,840
Alone.

1098
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,480
- In Love.
- There you go.

1099
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,800
- In the Mood.
- For Love.

1100
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,250
(The name-tag ripping starts.)

1101
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,670
Hey, attack Jae Suk first.
Team up with Eui Soo.

1102
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,920
That's a good idea.

1103
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,050
- Eui Soo.
- Attack the man.

1104
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,090
- Forget about manners.
- Okay.

1105
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,260
You have to win.

1106
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,550
- Should I attack them?
- Go for it!

1107
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,780
Get them! Go!

1108
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,090
Attack!

1109
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,650
He'll get tired soon.

1110
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,960
He'll trip.

1111
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,360
(Joo Young attacks from behind.)

1112
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,760
(Joo Young grabs
Jae Suk's name tag.)

1113
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,840
(Joo Young is so good.)

1114
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,730
- She grabbed it!
- She grabbed it!

1115
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,570
- She grabbed it.
- What?

1116
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,670
You ripped it off?

1117
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,940
Why did you tease them?

1118
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,070
Way to go!

1119
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,820
Joo Young seems tired.

1120
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,880
- It's going to be fun.
- Joo Young used a lot of energy.

1121
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,780
Eui Soo, use your long arms!

1122
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,090
Joo Young, try...

1123
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,150
(Joo Young tries a low kick.)

1124
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,880
She tried a low kick.

1125
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,320
- She tried a low kick?
- Eui Soo...

1126
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,820
Joo Young tried a low kick.

1127
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,150
- Way to go!
- Oh, no!

1128
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,730
(Fierce)

1129
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,570
- No! Get back up, Eui Soo!
- Hey, it's almost...

1130
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,610
- It's almost ripped off.
- Joo Young is so good.

1131
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,900
- No!
- They're both good.

1132
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,880
She's so good.

1133
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,940
- It's right in front of you. Wait!
- Oh, no!

1134
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,380
It's right in front of you. Wait!

1135
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,170
- Oh, no!
- Wait!

1136
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,670
(A backward roll)

1137
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,750
Wait!

1138
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,610
- She did a backward roll.
- Joo Young!

1139
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,920
Do you really have to do this?

1140
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,510
- Wait.
- Nice!

1141
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,920
Incredible.

1142
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,780
Time's up.

1143
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,260
It was like the UFC.

1144
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,550
But we...

1145
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,030
She did a backward roll.

1146
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,360
It was the best
Name Tag Elimination.

1147
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,960
- They both did an amazing job.
- Good job, Joo Young.

1148
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,400
- Bo Hyun, go!
- You can do this!

1149
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,070
- You can do this!
- Let's go!

1150
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,510
- Bo Hyun, go!
- Gosh.

1151
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,070
All the cheaters are here.

1152
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,320
You two are
the "hyeongseoljigong" guys.

1153
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,510
- Yes, that's right.
- "Hyeongseoljigong"?

1154
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,110
"Hyeongseoljigong".

1155
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,940
In the third round,
we'll play Sing One Line.

1156
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,460
I'll say the name of a singer,

1157
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,280
and you'll each sing one line
from that singer's songs.

1158
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Okay!

1159
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,590
It's no problem!

1160
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,590
(The singer feels confident.)

1161
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,000
But if you fail to sing
within five seconds...

1162
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,030
or sing a song that's already been
sung by someone else, you fail.

1163
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,590
We have to sing a new song.

1164
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,860
- Here's the first singer.
- Okay.

1165
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,070
(The first singer)

1166
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,170
Buzz.

1167
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,670
- 5, 4, 3...
- 5...

1168
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,110
Is Jong Kook already out?

1169
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,340
(What?)

1170
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,010
- 4, 3...
- 4, 3...

1171
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,400
- He's out! Yes!
- Yes!

1172
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,710
(Jong Kook is eliminated.)

1173
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,320
(Let's celebrate!)

1174
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
(Jong Kook is eliminated!)

1175
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,210
Oh, "Coward".

1176
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,980
- Jong Kook!
- Hey.

1177
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,320
- What did you do?
- "Coward".

1178
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,110
<i>I'm a fool</i>

1179
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,260
That's a huge relief.

1180
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,090
- Hey, what did you do?
<i>- I'm a fool</i>

1181
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,460
(The huge mountain crumbles away.)

1182
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,730
I don't know many Buzz songs.

1183
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,030
<i>- Far away</i>
- "Don't Know Men".

1184
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,130
(They tease Jong Kook.)

1185
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
(Glaring)

1186
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,260
(Se Chan comes to senses.)

1187
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,340
Gosh.

1188
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,260
- Hey, what's with you?
<i>- Your love</i>

1189
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,900
I don't know many Buzz songs.

1190
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,070
(5 seconds in,
Jong Kook is eliminated.)

1191
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,280
- That's a huge relief.
- What is this?

1192
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,250
You just sat there
for a few seconds.

1193
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,670
Girls' Generation.

1194
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,610
<i>Tell me your wish</i>

1195
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,480
<i>Trouble...</i>

1196
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,280
- That's the same song.
- That's the same song.

1197
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,280
(Se Chan is eliminated.)

1198
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,860
(Kwang Soo and Bo Hyun
move on to the finals.)

1199
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,110
This is hard.

1200
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,190
Cool.

1201
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,800
<i>- You know how much...</i>
- Keep it short.

1202
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,360
<i>- For you, only for you</i>
- Good job.

1203
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,690
(The name tag ripping starts.)

1204
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,730
- Oh, my.
- You're injured, right?

1205
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,090
- I'm fine.
- You're okay?

1206
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,900
Just a second. It hurts!

1207
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,030
(Kwang Soo starts exaggerating.)

1208
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,630
(I knew Kwang Soo would do that.)

1209
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,670
(Bo Hyun hesitates
to attack Kwang Soo.)

1210
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,670
- Just give up!
- Kwang Soo!

1211
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,940
(Bo Hyun starts
feeling competitive.)

1212
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,980
What's the point...

1213
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,010
(Bo Hyun's name tag is ripped off.)

1214
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,690
Okay!

1215
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,260
- What's the point...
- Okay!

1216
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,730
- Kwang Soo was faster.
- He was faster.

1217
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,480
- What happened?
- What happened?

1218
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,230
Is this...

1219
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,920
Kwang Soo is back!

1220
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,860
- Didn't you rip his first?
- Kwang Soo!

1221
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,760
It takes skill to rip off name tags.

1222
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,170
Turbo or Kim Jong Kook.

1223
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,610
<i>Can't you see me
hiding behind your back?</i>

1224
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,940
<i>Every winter, the two of us</i>

1225
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,570
- That's the same song.
- That's the same song.

1226
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,840
We win!

1227
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,550
(Kwang Soo is eliminated,
and Bo Hyun's team wins 1 point.)

1228
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,210
Some teams have the same score,

1229
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,980
so let's play Five-second
Compliment Game one more time.

1230
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,760
One player from each team will play.

1231
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,090
- Bo Hyun.
- Jin Woo.

1232
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,960
It's Five-second Compliment Game.

1233
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,630
- I have many compliments to give.
- You can't repeat the same thing.

1234
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,230
- Okay.
- You can do this!

1235
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,030
You have one minute. Ready, start.

1236
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,590
- Jin Woo.
- Yang Se Hyeong.

1237
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,960
- Yang Se Hyeong?
- I mean, Yang Se Chan.

1238
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,840
(Se Chan's pride is hurt
from the beginning.)

1239
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,980
That's a weird way to attack.

1240
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,710
- It's strange to attack this way.
- What?

1241
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,980
- What?
- Jin Woo is out.

1242
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,010
What?

1243
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,510
I was going to ask
if Se Hyeong is doing well.

1244
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,920
He was going to ask
if Se Hyeong is doing well.

1245
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,420
I can't believe
you called me Se Hyeong.

1246
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,650
- Jin Woo, come on out.
- It's just a game.

1247
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,530
- Jin Woo, come on out.
- Don't put your heart into it.

1248
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,460
Jin Woo, how are you so bad
at games?

1249
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,900
This time, Se Chan will go first.

1250
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,550
(Se Chan, not Se Hyeong,
will begin the compliments.)

1251
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,090
(The Name Tag Elimination starts.)

1252
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,260
Gosh, this is what I want to do.

1253
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,590
(Eui Soo lies down right away.)

1254
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,000
Eui Soo, they won't attack you.

1255
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,630
Eui Soo. Eui Soo,
they won't attack you first.

1256
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,400
- Eui Soo, stand up.
- Roll over.

1257
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,780
- Roll over.
- Stand up.

1258
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,010
No, Eui Soo. Roll over.

1259
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,400
You guys are too much.

1260
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,280
- Hold on.
- He grabbed it!

1261
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:42,840
- Hold on.
- He grabbed it!

1262
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,820
(Se Chan is out in an instant.)

1263
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,010
(He used his long arms
as if he was playing with a nephew.)

1264
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,460
- That was good.
- Jang Geun Won!

1265
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,690
Okay, okay.

1266
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,690
That was good.

1267
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,860
(Bo Hyun is incredible.)

1268
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,800
Now, compliment each other.

1269
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,820
That was no joke.

1270
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,400
- Shall I begin?
- Yes. Begin.

1271
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,960
You have a small face
and great acting skills.

1272
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,260
I enjoyed the drama.

1273
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,900
Your skin is incredible.
You look great in black.

1274
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,300
Your necklace is sexy.

1275
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,010
You look great in red.
Those designer shoes suit you.

1276
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,230
And the jeans look sexy on you.

1277
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,150
- That sounds genuine.
- Seriously.

1278
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,440
They might suddenly close
the distance.

1279
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,300
Stop it!

1280
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,210
- Stop it!
- He is ruining it again.

1281
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,780
- He is ruining it again.
- I don't know what his problem is.

1282
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,780
For goodness' sake.

1283
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,710
You have sexy eyes. You are pretty.
Your nose is pretty.

1284
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,210
(Haha, the President
of Furthering Love Stories Society)

1285
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,920
You looked so pretty
when you made pasta.

1286
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,360
Watching you made me want
to eat the pasta.

1287
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,920
A woman who can cook
is my ideal type.

1288
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,360
You have thick eyebrows.
Your hair color is very pretty.

1289
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,460
Your nose is pretty too.

1290
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,300
- What a sight.
- Why are you so happy?

1291
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,360
Bo Hyun's ears turned red!

1292
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,670
It's nothing to be happy about.

1293
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,940
You need to win.

1294
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,960
(Instead of attacking each other
with backhanded compliments,)

1295
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,070
- Don't say what you mean.
- What is up with him?

1296
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,280
(they act sweetly
as if they are on a blind date.)

1297
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,170
You are very tall.

1298
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,280
(At that moment,)

1299
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,150
(the bell begins to ring.)

1300
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,840
- Eui Soo, get up. Get up.
- I am sorry.

1301
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,610
- I am sorry.
- Eui Soo, you need to get up.

1302
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,150
Hold on. Hold on.

1303
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,710
- Eui Soo, get up.
- Eui Soo...

1304
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,960
He is ruthless.

1305
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,260
- How could he do that?
- Eui Soo, grab him.

1306
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,360
(Grabbing)

1307
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,090
(Eui Soo's hand is
on Bo Hyun's name tag too.)

1308
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,300
(Eui Soo's counterattack fails.)

1309
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,500
- Eui Soo has skills.
- She is good.

1310
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,070
- She has skills.
- She is good.

1311
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:11,530
- It looks like jiu-jitsu.
- I can't see her.

1312
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,670
There you go.

1313
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,230
- Eui Soo!
- Come on!

1314
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,340
- Eui Soo,
- She is good.

1315
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,980
- not much time remains.
- He is the villain.

1316
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,380
- Hang in there.
- Hang in there.

1317
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,440
Okay.

1318
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,150
(It ends in a tie.)

1319
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,380
- Eui Soo.
- She survived.

1320
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,880
You ruined your image
without ripping off the name tag.

1321
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
Hey, hey.

1322
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,050
Both birds ran away.

1323
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,050
He didn't gain anything.

1324
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,030
Eui Soo's head
was all over the place.

1325
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,500
I think he fell in love.

1326
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,860
- She did a good job.
- I couldn't rip it off.

1327
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,130
- It was no joke.
- Seriously.

1328
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,800
Team Ahn Bo Hyun placed 1st
and Team Ji Eui Soo placed 2nd.

1329
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,340
The captain of the team
that placed first...

1330
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,210
can check if a team has a devil...

1331
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,920
and switch out
a member of your team.

1332
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,210
I can do that after checking, right?

1333
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,690
It can be any team
you are curious about.

1334
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:57,980
It can be your own team.

1335
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,190
When you ask,

1336
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,630
we will say, "A devil exists"
or "A devil doesn't exist."

1337
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,420
There is definitely one in our team.

1338
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,030
- I can tell you that.
- Look at Jae Suk.

1339
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,360
He is flustered.

1340
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,900
- Don't ask about your team.
- Jae Suk, hurry up.

1341
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,000
- I am not a devil.
- Don't ask about your team.

1342
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,030
- Don't worry.
- Don't waste it.

1343
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:15,800
- Don't do it.
- Ask about another team.

1344
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,670
- Ask about another team.
- It's better to do that...

1345
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:18,900
- and swap teammates.
- Kwang Soo.

1346
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,230
Which team will you ask about?

1347
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,570
Ji Eui Soo's team.

1348
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,340
- Will the answer be secret?
- He asked about our team.

1349
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,480
- Our team?
- Yes.

1350
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,480
In Ji Eui Soo's team, a devil...

1351
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,690
- exists.
- I knew it.

1352
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,050
- A devil exists.
- I knew it.

1353
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
In that case...

1354
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,880
(At least one of them is a devil.)

1355
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,860
What are you doing?
I can't believe him.

1356
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,360
- Jae Suk.
- There he goes again.

1357
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,460
What are you doing?

1358
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,030
- Fight!
- Jae Suk is a devil.

1359
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,760
- Fight!
- Bo Hyun.

1360
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,230
- Jae Suk is a devil.
- We don't know about Haha.

1361
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,260
(They stick close to Bo Hyun.)

1362
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,110
- Seriously.
- I am not a devil.

1363
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,440
I say that because when we voted...

1364
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,630
- Bo Hyun.
- You can't be sure about Haha.

1365
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,010
- Both of them are dangerous.
- That's right.

1366
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,130
You can't be sure about Haha.

1367
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,070
Bo Hyun,
would you switch out a teammate?

1368
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:58,980
- Yes, I'll switch someone.
- Okay.

1369
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,780
- Bo Hyun.
- Switch him out for Se Chan.

1370
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:05,320
(While Haha whispers,)

1371
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,150
(Jae Suk sticks close to Bo Hyun.)

1372
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,280
- He is a devil. He needs to go.
- Bo Hyun.

1373
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,630
I get that you like Jae Suk,
but he needs to go.

1374
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:13,820
Will you swap teammates?

1375
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,170
Whom will you switch out?

1376
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,800
I will switch out Jae Suk...

1377
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,800
In the end, Jae Suk got kicked out.

1378
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,190
- For whom?
- In the end...

1379
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:22,840
- In the end...
- Bo Hyun, I can't believe you.

1380
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,730
- It's the right choice.
- I can't believe you.

1381
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,130
- Everyone knows he is a devil.
- You will regret this.

1382
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,380
We knew this from the opening.

1383
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,610
- Se Chan.
- That's right.

1384
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:31,840
- Se Chan?
- Me?

1385
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,150
- That's good.
- There you go.

1386
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,480
- That's good.
- It's "Itaewon Class."

1387
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,610
Seriously.

1388
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,880
- It's "Itaewon Class."
- Seriously.

1389
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,280
Yang Saeroyi.

1390
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,360
Joo Young, don't worry.

1391
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,230
So Min is on the team too.

1392
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,820
- That's right.
- Is So Min on the team?

1393
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,130
Joo Young,
you should send So Min away.

1394
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,230
- That team has two devils.
- What a twist.

1395
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,500
- What did Jae Suk say?
- It's the devils' house.

1396
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,230
So Min, I hope you recover quickly
and come back.

1397
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,400
But So Min needs to go.

1398
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,630
The captain of the team
that placed second...

1399
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,340
can switch out one of the teammates.

1400
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,250
But she won't receive a hint.

1401
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,570
- No.
- You aren't a devil, are you?

1402
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,980
But it would be dangerous
to keep him.

1403
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,420
- I am not a devil.
- But he is too diligent.

1404
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,710
- I am not a devil.
- Shall we go as we are?

1405
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,820
Should we?

1406
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,610
It's not a bad idea. We will stay.

1407
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:15,860
Okay. You will stay.

1408
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,780
- "We will stay."
- They will stay as they are?

1409
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,860
- Okay.
- She couldn't decide.

1410
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,920
After the swapped teammates change,

1411
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,800
we will move to the location
of the next mission.

1412
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,590
(Se Chan and Jae Suk
have been switched.)

1413
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1414
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,900
Do you like your team?

1415
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,980
- It's perfect. It's perfect.
- Of course.

1416
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,510
- Right?
- It's perfect.

1417
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:38,210
We have a talented captain.

1418
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,480
There is no devil in our team.

1419
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,070
- Earlier,
- Joo Young.

1420
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,570
did you see Suk Jin?

1421
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:43,940
What about him?

1422
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,090
He couldn't remember
Joo Young's name.

1423
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,610
"Hold on. Joo Young..."

1424
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,030
(Earlier)

1425
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,030
(Checking)

1426
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,260
(He makes a meaningless comment.)

1427
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:58,400
so strong.

1428
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,690
She did her best.

1429
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,230
I am sorry.

1430
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,460
Joo Young was...

1431
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,210
so strong.

1432
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,570
We will play a game
while in transit.

1433
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,010
It's the upgraded version
of the Frying Pan Game,

1434
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,070
What's Your Name?

1435
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,670
- What's Your Name?
- What's Your Name?

1436
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,440
Like the Frying Pan Game,

1437
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,320
the attacker will say...

1438
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,710
a member's name
and a number from 1 to 4.

1439
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,380
The member who has been called
needs to say...

1440
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,760
the attacker's name in that number.

1441
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,690
- The attacker's name.
- Yes.

1442
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,300
I played this game on "X-Man."

1443
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,690
- I hosted the game.
- For example...

1444
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:37,210
You win a point
if your attack has been successful.

1445
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,170
- Let's go.
- We will play for 10 minutes.

1446
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,840
The teams that place 1st and 2nd
will have benefits.

1447
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,110
Let's do a good job.

1448
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,610
- Let's go.
- Don't do badly on purpose.

1449
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,050
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1450
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,610
(It's important to do well
in order to find the devils.)

1451
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:50,280
- You can do well, right?
- Yes.

1452
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,320
I can do well.

1453
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,920
- Who wants to go first?
- It's obvious.

1454
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,050
- He is the original player.
- I am the original player.

1455
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:58,090
He is the original player of
all games but is terrible at them.

1456
00:48:58,090 --> 00:48:59,800
- Kwang Soo, leave him alone.
- He's...

1457
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,550
Don't let him find out.

1458
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:03,070
- This isn't hard.
- Eui Soo, you know the rules.

1459
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,070
Let's go.

1460

Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo.

1466
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,650
- There you go.
- Ji Hyo, one.

1467
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,280
Joo Young, Joo Young,
Joo Young, Joo Young.

1468
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,480
(Why did she say her name
four times?)

1469
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,980
(Ji Hyo is daring
even if she doesn't know the rules.)

1470
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,010
There is a big difference
between 1 and 4, don't you think?

1471
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,380
She just kept going.

1472
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,730
- She is back.
- I am sorry.

1473
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,130
Team Lee Joo Young wins one point.

1474
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,230
Don't apologize.

1475
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,650
I didn't know Joo Young
was like that.

1476
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,670
She looked at the camera
and did this.

1477
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,030
(She showed her cute act.)

1478
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,400
- Joo Young, good job.
- She did this.

1479
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,400
- Do it like Joo Young.
- I didn't know she was like that.

1480
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,730
(When the game began)

1481
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,110

Kwang Soo, three.

1484
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:53,340
- I didn't know she was like that.
- Did she really do that?

1485
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,780
- Yes. She did this.
- Let's do it together.

1486
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,880
- Look for the camera.
- Let's do it together.

(We should do this together.)

1488
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,530

(He confidently says,
"Jae Suk, Jae Suk, 2, 3.")

1495
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,710
I thought you were

1497

became nervous again.)

1498
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:32,710
He is trembling. He is trembling.

1499
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,290
He is trembling. Look at him.

- "Jae Suk, Jae Suk, 2, 3."
- Seriously.

Hey.

- I thought you were good.
- Bo Hyun.

- What was "2, 3" for?
- What was that for?

- Don't worry, Joo Young.
- I'm not sure.

1506
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,040
I think he's a devil.

Are you nervous?

1515
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,710

- It's "Haha, Haha."

00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,540
He attacks and defends
at the same time.

1548
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,250
I was startled at "Suk Jin, two."

1549
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,710
I feel bad for you.

1550
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,420
Let's play again.
We're starting with Suk Jin.

1551
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,150
<i>Ting, ting, ting, ting
Tang, tang, tang, tang</i>

1552
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,710
<i>Ting, ting, tang, tang
Frying Pan Game</i>

1553
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:17,380
- Joo Young, three.
- Suk Jin, Suk Jin, Suk Jin.

1554
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,630
Jong Kook, three.

1555
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,150
Joo Young, Joo Young, Joo Young
Suk Jin, three.

1556
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,150
Suk Jin, three.

1557
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:24,090
Seok Joong, Joo Young, two.

1558
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,130
(Seok Joong, Joo Young, two!)

1559
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,630
- Who's Seok Joong?
- Seok Joong!

1560
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,900
Stop picking me.

1561
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,380
- I see you.
- Don't do me.

1562
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,130
I see you, so I can't help it.

1563
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:37,840
- This is Ji Suk Jin's Game.
- Ji Suk Jin's Game.

1564
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,610
Let Suk Jin take a breather.

1565
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,880
Hey.

1566
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,020
This is driving me insane.

1567
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,250
- I know.
- You're the favorite.

1568
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,440
Why did you kill your own team?

1569
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,980
- Suk Jin.
- Stop thinking about it.

1570
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,820
But still.

1571
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,650
That was shocking for me.

1572
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,520
- Pick Bo Hyun too.
- I didn't go once either.

1573
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,020
- Why do you pick the same people?
- Call my name.

1574
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,460
- He's behind, so we don't see him.
- Bo Hyun.

1575
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,090
- Bo Hyun.
- Pick Jin Woo.

1576
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,940
He was here the whole time.

1577
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,730
When we play,
he stares at you with this look.

1578
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:06,730
I'm going to pick Jin Woo.

1579
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,630
- You have to look at them, Jin Woo.
- He's staring.

1580
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:09,900
He wants to be picked.

1581
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,650
Pick Jin Woo.

1582
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,150
What's wrong with your hairstyle?
Do you have straight hair?

1583
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,820
- Are you a sea urchin?
- That was so random.

1584
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,150
- I wanted to mention it too.
- That was so random.

1585
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,690
That hairstyle was popular
when I was in middle school.

1586
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,250
- Motorcycle hair.
- Exactly.

1587
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,380
If I dye my hair yellow,
I'm Jang Hyuk from TJ.

1588
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,460
That's true. It's Hyuk's hair.

1589
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,590
That's true.

1590
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:27,420
How does your hair do that?

1591
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,150
- First place is...
- It's us.

1592
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,520
Team Jin Woo.

1593
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,020
- Really?
- It's us?

1594
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,670
- Goodness.
- What was that?

1595
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:34,940
- What happened?
- We didn't get picked a lot.

1596
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,540
Team Joo Young is second.

1597
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,800
- Are we second?
- Jae Suk.

1598
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,900
(They obtain the hints
and move onto the next mission.)

1599
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,440
(In the swaying flowers)

1600
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,650
(They arrive at the next location
that feels like spring.)

1601
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,610
Before proceeding with the final
race, we'll switch teams...

1602
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,440
according to the results
of the second mission.

1603
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,820
Team Jin Woo got first place,
so please come on up.

1604
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,880
- Okay, let's go up first.
- Sure.

1605
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,130
Which team's identity
would you like to check?

1606
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,270
Our team.

1607
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,190
That's a waste.
You threw away the chance.

1608
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:07,940
- In your team...
- Oh, gosh.

1609
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,940
(In your team...)

1610
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,440
(Ji Hyo doesn't react the same.
Is there a devil in Team Jin Woo?)

1611
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,440
- There's no devil.
- I told you.

1612
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,880
What?

1613
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,270
- Didn't you know?
- Pick a teammate to switch.

1614
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,710
Look. Hold on.

1615
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,980
(Team Jin Woo is going to stay.)

1616
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,880
- Kwang Soo.
- Team Jin Woo...

1617
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,380
is going to stay.

1618
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,380
- Wait. Who did they pick?
- Who did they find out about?

1619
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,360
- I can't tell you.
- He can't say.

1620
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,320
- Both of you, come on up.
- Sure.

1621
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,800
You can switch one person.

1622
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,500
So Min or Jae Suk.

1623
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,840
I want to win,
so I'll change up my team.

1624
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,500
- I'll switch So Min with...
- Good call.

1625
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,570
- She's not getting rid of Jae Suk?
- She's not?

1626
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:48,670
- We'll take Se Chan.
- You'll lose for sure.

1627
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:51,110
You're going to take me?
Look at Jae Suk.

1628
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:52,480
It's confusing when it's your
first time on the show.

1629
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,210
He made it complicated.

1630
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,380
- You can't have two devils.
- You must get rid of So Min.

1631
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,710
- Yes, I'll get rid of her.
- And...

1632
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:58,880
take Se Chan.

1633
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,090
- No, Joo Young. He's wrong.
- Joo Young.

1634
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:04,230
(Who will be switched with So Min
and join Team Joo Young?)

1635
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,360
(She has to bring an angel.)

1636
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,190
I pick Kwang Soo.

1637
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,630
(Kwang Soo!)

1638
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,400
Kwang Soo?

1639
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,270
Good one!

1640
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,460
- Why?
- Good one.

1641
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,210
- Good job.
- Why?

1642
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,480
(Devil Jae Suk is also flustered.)

1643
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,300
- Me? I mean...
- Good job.

1644
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,500
- Good one.
- Great job.

1645
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,440
- It worked out.
- Joo Young.

1646
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,980
That team's done now.

1647
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,440
(Why did she pick Kwang Soo?)

1648
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,520
(During first mission,)

1649
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,790
(Team Eui Soo stayed the same.)

1650
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,130
(Does that team not have a devil?)

1651
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,320
Kwang Soo, switch to white.

1652
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,020
No, hey. This is insane.

1653
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,730
This is better.
It's good to put them together.

1654
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:47,360
This mission is called
You Can Tell From the Eyes.

1655
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,540
Each team will take turns to play.

1656
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,670
One person has to describe
the given phrase with their body.

1657
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,540
Two people will try to guess.

1658
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,150
You have three minutes.
The captain of the winning team...

1659
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,070
will find out the identity of
a person of their choice.

1660
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:01,380
- The identity?
- Yes.

1661
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,920
- Okay.
- First of all,

1662
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,380
Jin Woo is expressive.

1663
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,150
(He's silly.)

1664
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:09,020
(I can tell from the eyes)

1665
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,020
(He's playful.)

1666
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,020
<i>- From the eyes</i>
- Stop it. Just listen.

1667
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,320
- Good job.
- This is fun.

1668
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,920
- He doesn't miss a single chance.
- What's wrong with him?

1669
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,570
He reacts to every word in the rule.

1670
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,460
My gosh.

1671
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,340
Are you in a bad mood
because you're on the same team?

1672
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,340
I'm not in a bad mood.

1673
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,570
Good job.
Many people don't know this song.

1674
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,800
Kwang Soo, I understand
why you sprayed salt on him.

1675
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,440
He drives me nuts.

1676
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,270
Which team is going first?

1677
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,440
- He's having fun.
- Let's play Game of Wits.

1678
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,770
- Game of Wits.
- Game of Wits.

1679
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:34,980
Let's play Game of Wits.

1680
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,920
Ready, start.

1681
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,190
- 1.
- 2.

1682
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,290
- Two.
- Good job.

1683
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:42,820
Hey, I said good job!

1684
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,820
- Why are you glaring at me?
- I didn't.

1685
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,090
I'm just really into this game.

1686
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,090
Three.

1687
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,320
(Meanwhile, Eui Soo succeeds.)

1688
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,460
Eui Soo is so...

1689
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,520
- 4!
- 4!

1690
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,000
(They both said 4.)

1691
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,670
- Why did you?
- You had to wait.

1692
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:00,230
- This team is...
- Why did you go?

1693
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,130
- Oh, dear.
- I'm going insane.

1694
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,380
- Two of them.
- Okay.

1695
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,570
- This is driving me nuts.
- What was that?

1696
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:07,920
They'll show the phrase behind you.

1697
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,380
We have to win first place.

1698
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,820
You're pointing the water gun
at them only.

1699
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,820
- Sure.
- Them only.

1700
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:13,820
Ready...

1701
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,920
(Mission starts.)

1702
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:21,130
(Kwang Soo's phrase: A terrapin
waking up from a nightmare.)

1703
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,800
- This is difficult.
- This is really difficult.

1704
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,400
(This is going to be difficult.)

1705
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,570
(What is it?)

1706
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,570
- Sleeping.
- A sleeping giraffe.

1707
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,540
A giraffe waking up.

1708
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,440
Nightmare.

1709
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,400
Having a nightmare...

1710
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,210
Having a nightmare...

1711
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:37,550
(He just has to say,
"terrapin waking up.")

1712
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,940
- Goldfish.
- A turtle having a nightmare?

1713
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,650
Terrapin?

1714
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:42,820
(You're right!)

1715
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,690
Don't have a nightmare
and go to sleep.

1716
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:46,880
(He goes the wrong way.)

1717
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,190
A terrapin waking up from sleep.

1718
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,920
(The terrapin is awoken
by the water gun.)

1719
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,380
Please wrap up your final answer.

1720
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:55,360
While sleeping...

1721
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,460
(Terrapin waking up
from a nightmare.)

1722
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,460
(He's frustrated.)

1723
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,460
Surprised?

1724
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,670
My goodness!

1725
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:00,840
(Terrapin waking up
from a nightmare.)

1726
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,460
(Why is the terrapin talking?)

1727
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,110
Don't talk.

1728
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:07,070
A terrapin waking up
from a nightmare.

1729
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,400
- Okay!
- All right.

1730
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,400
(She actually got this.)

1731
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,550
Keep going.

1732
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:11,770
(Let's keep this going.)

1733
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,250
(A chipmunk that cracked its tooth
from eating an acorn.)

1734
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,420
(He's trying to express a chipmunk.)

1735
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,320
(Se Chan's chestnut hair)

1736
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:21,420
Park Saeroyi.

1737
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,730
Me? Wait.

1738
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:27,630
Moron.

1739
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,230
Wrong. It's not a moron.

1740
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:32,170
Look at this! Look, Joo Young.

1741
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:33,400
I can't look.

1742
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,340
- Look. I can't describe this.
- I can't look.

1743
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,940
(He explains the acorn first.)

1744
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:39,840
How do I...

1745
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,840
(What's that?)

1746
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,400
(Right!)

1747
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,980
<i>Re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do</i>

1748
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,170
<i>- He used his voice.
- Re, mi, fa, so, la, ti</i>

1749
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,710
Acorn.

1750
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,320
You peel the acorn.

1751
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:56,630
Your tooth...

1752
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,020
What's this? Why is this cracked?

1753
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,590
- You lost a tooth.
- What was that?

1754
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,630
You might as well say it.

1755
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,570
You cracked a tooth
while peeling an acorn.

1756
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,920
So?

1757
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,400
(So?)

1758
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,440
So?

1759
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:09,860
I'm not a rat.

1760
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,730
What kind of game is this?

1761
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,300
A bat.

1762
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,040
- A bat.
- That's not it.

1763
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,000
- He talks too much.
- He does.

1764
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,050
- What's that?
- This is not easy.

1765
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:25,150
- It's too bright.
- Sunglasses.

1766
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,550
Sunglasses.

1767
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:28,820
(A pleased panda with
brand new sunglasses)

1768
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,820
Gosh, this is...

1769
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,880
Expensive sunglasses?

1770
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,520
- Gosh, this is...
- This is...

1771
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,020
- Stop talking.
- I've never seen this before.

1772
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,230
Stop talking!

1773
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,270
New sunglasses.

1774
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,130
I didn't see this last year.
It's new this year.

1775
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:41,860
- Don't talk!
- Brand new sunglasses.

1776
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,800
Brand new sunglasses.

1777
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,540
- He talks too much.
- Wearing brand new sunglasses.

1778
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:49,130
You almost had it.

1779
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,550
That was so hard.

1780
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:51,900
- That's impossible to guess.
- It's hard.

1781
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,420
- Next team now.
- Next team?

1782
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,650
You got a cramp, so you're upset.

1783
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,150
- Ostrich that's upset with a cramp.
- Peacock.

1784
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:00,980
- Jin Woo.
- You have a cramp.

1785
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,520
- Show us the Lee Byung Hun dance.
- Show us.

1786
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,400
(Did you call me?)

1787
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,420
Seal.

1788
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,420
- What's that?
- Hold on.

1789
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,840
Is that Haha?

1790
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,070
It's hard.

1791
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:16,900
A crocodile that's in pain
from dislocating its jaw.

1792
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,570
A hedgehog! A giraffe that's sad
with a long neck.

1793
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,730
- We're first place.
- Okay.

1794
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:25,170
- Good job.
- All right.

1795
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:26,610
Let me announce the results.

1796
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:29,420
Team Eui Soo is 1st place
with 3 points.

1797
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,610
Yes. Be happy.

1798
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:32,610
(Be happy.)

1799
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:36,210
Captain Eui Soo, you can ask about
the identity of one person.

1800
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:38,360
- We will disclose it to you.
- Can't she swap teammates?

1801
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,250
No, she can't. It will be an option
for the next mission.

1802
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,550
If there is someone you suspect...

1803
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:44,590
- Let's ask about So Min.
- So Min?

1804
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,670
- It's a good idea.
- Let's ask about So Min.

1805
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:48,230
(They want to figure out
So Min's identity.)

1806
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:49,940
- So Min.
- Right?

1807
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,770
She is...

1808
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,610
Is she a devil?

1809
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:54,730
Is this her identity?

1810
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,650
(So Min's identity is revealed
to Suk Jin and Eui Soo.)

1811
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:59,770
- Is this her identity?
- Yes.

1812
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:00,820
Really?

1813
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,570
Really?

1814
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:04,550
(What could be So Min's identity?)

1815
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,150
This mission gives you
the last chance to swap teammates.

1816
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:08,520
It's Only Shoot Ahead of You.

1817
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,090
(Only Shoot Ahead of You)

1818
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:12,290
- What is it?
- You will draw one ball...

1819
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:15,190
that has a number from 1 to 11.
What you get will be your number.

1820
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:18,190
Color the name tag of the member
whose number is right ahead...

1821
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:20,190
with a water gun.
Then he or she will be eliminated.

1822
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,960
Then he or she will be eliminated.

1823
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:26,460
Does the entire name tag need
to be colored?

1824
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,340
About 90 percent of it
must be colored.

1825
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,550
- Everyone has a target, right?
- That's right.

1826
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:34,980
We will tell you whose number is
right ahead of yours.

1827
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:36,610
We need to keep moving
and shoot the water gun.

1828
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,420
The rankings depend on
when each team lost all the members.

1829
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:42,860
- Let's pick the numbers first.
- Okay.

1830
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:45,460
Come on out and pick a ball.

1831
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,820
- Show it to the camera.
- Okay.

1832
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,400
How cute!

1833
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,520
All right.

1834
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:55,400
(Jong Kook's number is 2.)

1835
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,300
(Jin Woo is up next.)

1836
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,040
(He makes
the Lee Byung Hun turn...)

1837
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,670
(and picks a number!)

1838
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,840
(That's hilarious.)

1839
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,750
(Jin Woo's number is 11.)

1840
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,050
(After the Lee Byung Hun lookalike,
you are up.)

1841
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,320
- Next.
- Next.

1842
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,980
(Ji Hyo does
the Lee Byung Hun dance too.)

1843
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,190
She has short arms.

1844
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,920
(Ji Hyo's number is 9.)

1845
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:23,320
(Other members pick a number too.)

1846
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,090
(The order of the members
by their numbers)

1847
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:28,070
- Please move to your location.
- Okay.

1848
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,340
- We will reveal your target.
- Okay.

1849
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,500
The member you need to eliminate...

1850
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,940
is Jae Suk.

1851
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,110
(Jin Woo's target is Jae Suk!)

1852
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,770
Look forward to it.

1853
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,270
The member you need to eliminate
is Jong Kook.

1854
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,550
Are you serious?

1855
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,190
You aren't lying, are you?

1856
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,980
I have terrible luck.

1857
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,020
(Who is aiming to eliminate
Bo Hyun?)

1858
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,130
No way.

1859
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,880
Bo Hyun.

1860
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:54,650
He is on my team.

1861
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,900
Since my team needs to win,

1862
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,800
I will tell Bo Hyun.

1863
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,860
Let's say someone
who seems to be targeting you...

1864
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,230
chases after you.

1865
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,900
We will give you a headband
you must wear during the race.

1866
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:09,170
- Put it on.
- Then what?

1867
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,900
If you hit the mark,
he or she must stop.

1868
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,610
How would I hit this?

1869
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:14,750
You can do it.

1870
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,420
- The circle?
- Yes. It creates a 10-second pause.

1871
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,860
If I am 3, I need to shoot
4's mark, right?

1872
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,320
The race will begin.

1873
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,750
(The countdown begins!)

1874
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,520
(A chance to swap members
depends on this race.)

1875
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,900
(Which team will win
the final race?)

1876
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,690
(The race starts.)

1877
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,130
- Bo Hyun.
- Yes?

1878
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,800
- What's your number?
- Three.

1879
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,130
I am four.

1880
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,670
Am I the only one you can shoot?

1881
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,770
You are the only one I can shoot,

1882
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:44,270
but we need to survive until the end
if we want our team to win.

1883
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:49,940
- My target is Jong Kook.
- Your target? Jong Kook?

1884
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,550
You are done for.

1885
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:53,420
- It won't be easy.
- Seriously.

1886
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,090
It won't be easy
because he is uncontrollable.

1887
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:57,320
Since I am your shooter,
put your mind at ease...

1888
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,480
- and shoot Jong Kook's name tag.
- Okay.

1889
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:00,860
Where could she be?

1890
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:03,250
(The search for the target begins!)

1891
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,270
Kwang Soo, what's your number?

1892
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:10,570
(Kwang Soo's target is Jin Woo.)

1893
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:12,360
(Walking closer)

1894
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:15,630
Hold on. Am I...

1895
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,270
You are walking towards me.

1896
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,820
(He runs away to avoid
a possible shooter.)

1897
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:23,150
(At that moment!)

1898
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:25,110
(Someone shoots Se Chan!)

1899
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,710
What is going on?

1900
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:28,290
Am I Joo Young's target?

1901
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:29,920
(Se Chan and Joo Young)

1902
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,730
(While Se Chan is distracted,
she shoots at his name tag!)

1903
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,500
(She runs away
after wetting his name tag a bit.)

1904
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:37,190
- Joo Young.
- Joo Young!

1905
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:39,170
Joo Young, is Se Chan your target?

1906
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:40,960
Are you my shooter?
What's your number?

1907
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,300
I don't know.

1908
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,770
Watch your forehead.

1909
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,860
(He tells her
to watch her forehead.)

1910
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:48,380
What was that?

1911
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,840
I will stop you right away.
Watch your forehead.

1912
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,980
(Don't worry about my forehead.)

1913
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,340
Haha, Joo Young shot me.

1914
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,190
Joo Young shot me. She must be five.

1915
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,420
My target is Jong Kook.

1916
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,750
You should go and shoot Jong Kook.

1917
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,790
(Jong Kook is looking at them
alone.)

1918
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:05,190
You can't do it now.

1919
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,650
Shall we go together
so that he doesn't know who it is?

1920
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,300
(Se Chan and Haha will be the baits
so that Bo Hyun can take him out.)

1921
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,500
Shall we go together?

1922
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:14,860
(Will Jong Kook fall
for the operation?)

1923
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,340
1, 2, 3.

1924
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:17,670
(1, 2, 3!)

1925
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,900
(They all run to him!)

1926
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,900
(Jong Kook blocks the path.)

1927
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,070
(Se Chan and Haha work
as the baits.)

1928
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,770
- Keep going.
- We want to look at the rooftop.

1929
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:30,520
- Be careful.
- Don't jump down the stairs.

1930
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:32,690
(When Jong Kook runs away,)

1931
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:36,320
(Bo Hyun shoots the water gun.)

1932
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,190
(But he misses.)

1933
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,590
We are just going up.

1934
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,550
One of you must be my shooter.

1935
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:43,670
(He senses the danger
instinctively.)

1936
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:46,460
- The three of us...
- One of you must be my shooter.

1937
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,670
should pretend to shoot him
together.

1938
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,710
(While Jong Kook runs away)

1939
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:52,900
- What's your number?
- What?

1940
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,000
- What's your number?
- You aren't my target.

1941
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,150
(You are my target!)

1942
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,750
(Jong Kook attacks Kwang Soo
like a beast.)

1943
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:02,550
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook)

1944
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:04,880
(Team Bo Hyun uses this chance
to attack Jong Kook together.)

1945
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:10,550
- Shoot! Shoot him right now!
- Hey.

1946
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,690
- Shoot him right now!
- Shoot him right now!

1947
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:12,980
- Jong Kook is annoyed.
- Shoot him right now!

1948
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,550
(Bo Hyun shoots Jong Kook.)

1949
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,900
(Bo Hyun is Jong Kook's shooter!)

1950
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:18,900
Hang in there.

1951
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,020
(Kwang Soo is
at the end of the cliff.)

1952
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,340
(He counterattacks!)

1953
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,400
You need to pause!

1954
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,400
You need to pause!

1955
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,300
I hit your mark!

1956
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:31,770
I hit your mark!

1957
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,440
- Please pause for 10 seconds.
- You need to pause.

1958
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,980
(Jong Kook needs to pause
for 10 seconds.)

1959
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,880
Bo Hyun, he will pause
for 10 seconds.

1960
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,020
(Bo Hyun uses this chance
to shoot Jong Kook.)

1961
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,750
(He hits the name tag without fail!)

1962
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:43,920
(He doesn't know
Bo Hyun shot him.)

1963
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,190
Can he shoot me during the pause?

1964
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:47,360
I got Jong Kook.

1965
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,420
Jong Kook should be out soon.

1966
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,670
(Although he hit the name tag
perfectly,)

1967
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:53,960
(he couldn't wet all of it.)

1968
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,230
He isn't out yet, right?

1969
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:57,110
- We are almost there.
- Okay.

1970
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:59,070
This plan is working.

1971
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:01,130
(Bo Hyun versus Jong Kook)

1972
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:02,210
(Jae Suk and Jin Woo)

1973
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:03,610
I will take Jae Suk out.

1974
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:05,210
(Jin Woo is looking for Jae Suk,
his target.)

1975
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,480
(He suddenly pretends to be
a detective.)

1976
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,980
(No one is looking,
but he becomes absorbed.)

1977
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:16,050
(He is too serious about this.)

1978
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:18,520
(What is he doing?)

1979
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:21,320
He is pretending to be
in a detective drama.

1980
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:22,820
He is pretending to be
in a detective drama.

1981
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,630
(He rolls on the floor.)

1982
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:26,020
(Ouch.)

1983
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,190
(Excessive passion brought him
an unexpected backache.)

1984
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,860
Gosh, the microphone.
That hurt a lot.

1985
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,610
(Joo Young is still aiming
to get Se Chan.)

1986
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:38,750
Where are Jae Suk and Kwang Soo?

1987
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,270
(While Joo Young is
on a cute stakeout,)

1988
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,520
He is coming.

1989
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,290
(Jae Suk is looking for Ji Hyo.)

1990
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,320
It's Ji Hyo.

1991
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:48,020
(It's Ji Hyo!)

1992
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,480
(Ji Hyo and Jae Suk)

1993
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:50,920
No!

1994
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,650
Stop it, Jae Suk!

1995
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:54,860
- Stop!
- Ji Hyo!

1996
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,050
(He holds her hands and attacks.)

1997
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:57,360
Jae Suk!

1998
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,400
(Kwang Soo joins in.)

1999
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,690
(Kwang Soo holds her
while Jae Suk shoots.)

2000
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:01,000
Ji Hyo.

2001
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:03,730
- I shot her entire name tag.
- Jae Suk.

2002
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:06,110
(Ji Hyo's name tag is soaking wet.)

2003
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,880
- You are out.
- Ji Hyo, you are out.

2004
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,040
(Ji Hyo is out.)

2005
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:11,300
For goodness' sake.

2006
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,570
I need to work fast.

2007
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:15,340
(Jae Suk's next target is 8,
Suk Jin.)

2008
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,210
I need to get Eui Soo.

2009
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:18,880
Hee Soo, run away.

2010
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:20,860
Get Suk Jin!

2011
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:23,320
(Suk Jin protects the captain
whose name he doesn't remember.)

2012
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,460
Hee Soo!

2013
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:27,420
(At that moment,
Jae Suk attacks Suk Jin.)

2014
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,130
Who is it?

2015
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:30,300
Hey!

2016
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,420
(Ripping)

2017
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,090
Hey!

2018
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:37,070
(He shoots water gun
at the ripped name tag.)

2019
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:38,540
- Suk Jin is out.
- Suk Jin, you are out.

2020
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:39,730
What?

2021
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:43,130
(Soaked)

2022
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,000
You ripped it.

2023
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,500
You ripped it.

2024
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,110
- Give me your water gun.
- Hey.

2025
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,940
How could you rip my top?

2026
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,020
It just ripped.

2027
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,550
(I was too absorbed in the race.)

2028
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,750
So you were my shooter.

2029
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:58,290
(Meanwhile, Haha takes out Eui Soo.)

2030
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,920
(I need to shoot Haha.)

2031
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,130
There she is.

2032
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,070
(Haha approaches Joo Young,
his target.)

2033
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:06,900
(Joo Young doesn't know anything.)

2034
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,270
- Am I your target?
- No.

2035
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,390
(Joo Young and Haha)

2036
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,060
(Haha attacks
when he gets a chance.)

2037
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,900
(Shooting)

2038
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,010
(She protects her back
and shoots at Haha.)

2039
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:19,770
(Shooting his headband)

2040
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,850
(Haha must pause for 10 seconds!)

2041
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:23,050
For goodness' sake!

2042
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,550
I knew he would do that.

2043
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,610
I won't forget this.

2044
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,150
- I am on pause.
- What?

2045
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,260
Are you on pause? Come here.

2046
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:35,220
Can you shoot
when I am on pause?

2047
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,760
- Of course.
- Count 10 seconds!

2048
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:38,260
I am on pause.

2049
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:39,970
- I am on pause.
- It hasn't ended yet.

2050
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:41,970
It ended a while ago!

2051
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,190
- Haha is out.
- It ended a while ago.

2052
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:44,510
- Show us your name tag.
- He is out.

2053
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,810
Look.

2054
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,400
(His name tag is blue all over
like a bruise.)

2055
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,540
You are out.

2056
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:50,210
You are out.

2057
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,210
Okay.

2058
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,850
- Most of your name tag is colored.
- Really?

2059
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,440
(He could be out
after a few more shots!)

2060
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,350
- Hold on. Is it colored?
- Most of it is colored.

2061
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:00,560
Bo Hyun, you almost got him.

2062
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,180
You almost got him.

2063
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:03,720
You can climb this big mountain.

2064
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,020
(The new ace player, Bo Hyun...)

2065
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,560
(versus The talented man, Jong Kook)

2066
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:10,690
Pause already.

2067
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,670
- Stop shooting.
- You need to pause.

2068
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:13,820
(Kwang Soo is on pause.)

2069
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,890
(That's good.)

2070
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,510
My goodness.

2071
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:23,180
(Jong Kook spots his chance
and runs towards Kwang Soo.)

2072
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:25,640
(Life or death)

2073
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:28,220
(Jong Kook is after Kwang Soo...)

2074
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,850
(and Bo Hyun is after Jong Kook.)

2075
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,180
(He's a sniper)

2076
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,760
(He lands clean shots
on Jong Kook's open back!)

2077
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,060
Jong Kook. You're out.

2078
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,520
(He didn't know his name tag
was getting soaked.)

2079
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,320
(Jong Kook is out.)

2080
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,560
(Am I out?)

2081
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,000
(This is Bo Hyun.)

2082
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:53,060
I got him!

2083
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,140
- Bo Hyun was behind me.
- You didn't know?

2084
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:59,940
I was close. Thanks.

2085
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:02,850
- Thanks, Bo Hyun!
- Thank you!

2086
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:04,480
- You're after Kwang Soo, right?
- Yes.

2087
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,420
(Don't thank me.
I'm going after you now.)

2088
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,720
- I have to get Jin Woo.
- What?

2089
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,150
I have to get Jin Woo.

2090
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:11,350
- Do you have me?
- Sorry?

2091
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,180
- Do you have me?
- Let's do this.

2092
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:17,470
(3-way race between
Kwang Soo, Jin Woo, and Jae Suk)

2093
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,040
(Bo Hyun is back!)

2094
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:25,400
(He charges at his target,
Kwang Soo.)

2095
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:28,380
(Kwang Soo is in trouble.)

2096
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,510
(He tries to escape.)

2097
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:31,550
Catch him!

2098
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:33,750
(Bo Hyun flew!)

2099
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:38,640
(Flying shot)

2100
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:40,810
Kwang Soo, you're out.

2101
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:42,090
(Kwang Soo is out.)

2102
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:44,630
(100 percent on target)

2103
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:45,680
Kwang Soo, you're out.

2104
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,020
(He has a high score and accuracy.)

2105
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:50,100
We got this. We're good.

2106
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:53,100
(He's dumbfounded.)

2107
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,730
The next person you have
to eliminate is Number 11, Jin Woo.

2108
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:57,930
- Really?
- For real?

2109
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,560
Don't come. Don't come!

2110
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:03,400
- Don't come!
- He's on his own.

2111
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,050
I'm shooting a drama.

2112
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,140
Detective Song, get it together!

2113
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,610
Do you think
I won't be able to find you?

2114
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,440
Don't move. I said don't move.

2115
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,510
Detective Yu,
Detective Song is a traitor.

2116
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:17,480
I already found him.

2117
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:18,980
- 2 on 2.
- Who do you have?

2118
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,220
- Hurry up.
- Who do you have?

2119
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,260
(Jin Woo ambushes Jae Suk.)

2120
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:25,100
(Bo Hyun charges at Jin Woo.)

2121
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,500
I'll hold him.

2122
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,860
Shoot. Bo Hyun. Shoot.

2123
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:31,010
(While Bo Hyun tries to dodge
Jin Woo's water gun...)

2124
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,710
- Jae Suk, you're out.
- Am I out?

2125
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,850
- Let's take a step back.
- Jin Woo, you have to survive.

2126
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,270
- Flip him around.
- Do it.

2127
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:42,110
- Now.
- Now.

2128
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,090
- Now.
- Jin Woo, you're out.

2129
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:46,940
Jin Woo is out. I'll hold her.

2130
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:47,980
Okay.

2131
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:49,610
No!

2132
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:52,720
I got her. Go now.

2133
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:54,060
Go!

2134
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,430
- No!
- Now!

2135
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,670
Joo Young, you're out.

2136
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,890
Joo Young is out.

2137
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,230
(Is Se Chan aiming at Bo Hyun?)

2138
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:03,690
It's game over.

2139
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:05,430
- Is it over?
- Yes.

2140
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,210
Is it over?

2141
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:08,730
There's only one team left,
so you win.

2142
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:09,840
Did we win?

2143
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:12,010
Did we win?

2144
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:13,770
I'm sorry. You must feel betrayed.

2145
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:16,810
Can you edit this part out?

2146
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:19,140
Please. I'm sorry.

2147
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:21,560
- In the end...
- I'm sorry.

2148
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,420
That was my last-ditch effort.

2149
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:24,820
Everything was looking good too.

2150
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,180
(Final race concludes
with an attempted betrayal.)

2151
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:28,890
The final result of
Only Shoot Ahead of You.

2152
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,630
Team Bo Hyun had 2 people left,
so they're 1st place.

2153
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:34,560
Great strategy.

2154
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,260
Team Joo Young is second place.

2155
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:37,810
(Team Joo Young places second.)

2156
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,840
Team Bo Hyun, please come on up.

2157
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,540
(1st place gets a team member hint
and team member switch chance.)

2158
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,310
Please tell me one team
you would like to find out about.

2159
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:46,570
- One team?
- Yes.

2160
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:48,420
I want to know...

2161
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,610
(What team
does he want to know about?)

2162
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,590
- about Jin Woo's team.
- Jong Kook.

2163
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:52,810
Jin Woo's team.

2164
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:54,460
- Jong Kook.
- Us?

2165
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:55,850
Not your own team?

2166
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,560
On that team, there is...

2167
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:02,760
(No devil)

2168
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,260
(Everybody on Team Jin Woo
is an angel.)

2169
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,760
(They're innocent and naive.)

2170
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:10,670
Who would you like to switch?

2171
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:15,040
We discussed this
at the end of the game.

2172
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,180
We'll switch.

2173
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,310
- Me?
- Yes.

2174
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,350
Hey, you discussed without me?

2175
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:22,570
- Because...
- Sure. I'll do it.

2176
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:24,050
- Why? Are you upset?
- Listen to me.

2177
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:26,090
No, I'm not upset.
This is just a bit absurd.

2178
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:27,440
- How's this absurd?
- Come over here.

2179
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,480
- Why?
- Come over here.

2180
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,760
- We discussed this.
- I tried so hard.

2181
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,760
I know you did.

2182
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,720
If you want to be safe,
just go as is.

2183
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,670
If we're all angels,
we get the benefits anyhow.

2184
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:39,390
- That's right.
- But if they're angels as well,

2185
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:41,140
- it doesn't matter if we switch.
- Right.

2186
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,230
- Good point.
- That's true.

2187
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:44,670
It's the same. Can you go?

2188
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:46,170
I'm hurt though.

2189
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:47,570
- No, don't be hurt.
- I understand.

2190
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:48,710
Who are you to say that?

2191
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:50,680
- Haha.
- What did you say? Wait.

2192
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,750
- You look more like a devil.
- What's going on?

2193
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,250
- Think about it.
- Are you upset?

2194
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:56,850
You're not a real devil.
This is just a game.

2195
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:58,310
Please choose.

2196
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:59,480
(What is Bo Hyun's final decision?)

2197
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,260
- I will switch him with Jong Kook.
- Sure.

2198
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,090
You shot me many times.

2199
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:04,220
- That's true.
- Sure, thanks.

2200
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,020
All right. Thanks.

2201
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:07,390
Sure, we'll do this.

2202
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:10,150
Hold on. I'm hurt.

2203
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:11,320
- Why are you so happy?
- You look too happy.

2204
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,560
It's the same.

2205
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,930
- Aren't you hurt?
- I am.

2206
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:15,890
It would have been nice
to end off on a happy note.

2207
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:18,140
Joo Young from the team
that came in second.

2208
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,760
Please tell me one person
you would like to switch.

2209
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,710
Joo Young, I'll go there.

2210
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:24,810
Why do you get to decide?

2211
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:26,440
- Joo Young.
- Let him go.

2212
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,880
That's not right.

2213
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,110
- Joo Young.
- Look at this brat.

2214
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:31,420
What's wrong?

2215
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,810
- Captain Joo Young.
- Please choose.

2216
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,680
(What is Joo Young's decision?)

2217
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,100
(Will she switch her team
or stay the same?)

2218
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:43,720
I would like to...

2219
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,930
- switch Suk Jin and Jae Suk.
- Okay.

2220
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:48,690
(Suk Jin and Jae Suk switch.)

2221
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,260
- I'll switch.
- These two?

2222
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:54,640
Then did the devils win already?

2223
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,340
Please move over.

2224
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,350
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

2225
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,810
We just have to switch our shirts.

2226
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:03,310
- He's a devil.
- He's not.

2227
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,610
(So Min went home already, but
she was suspicious the whole time.)

2228
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:07,790
I knew it.

2229
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:11,180
(So Min was an angel!)

2230
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,960
(Jae Suk is the only devil
on Team Eui Soo!)

2231
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:18,390
(Who's the devil on Team Joo Young?)

2232
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:22,430
(Team Eui Soo has a devil.)

2233
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:26,900
(The devil is either
Kwang Soo or Suk Jin.)

2234
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:31,350
(Is there only one devil?
Or are they both devils?)

2235
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:33,970
(What are their identities?)

2236
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,010
The team switches have been done.

2237
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:38,440
Please place your hand
on your marble.

2238
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,920
It'll light up for the devils.

2239
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,420
- Who are the devils?
- I have no idea.

2240
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,930
If there are 2 devils in 1 team,
everyone on the team gets a penalty.

2241
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:47,690
If there's only one devil,
only the devil wins a prize.

2242
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,390
If there are only angels,
all three win a prize.

2243
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:50,930
Correct.

2244
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,630
- Joo Young must be really nervous.
- It's not me, Joo Young.

2245
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:56,360
1, 2...

2246
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:01,880
(Who's the devil on Team Joo Young?)

2247
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:04,210
1, 2, 3.

2248
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:05,550
It's not him.

2249
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:09,010
(The devils are Jae Suk,
Kwang Soo, and Haha!)

2250
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:12,180
- Haha!
- Devil!

2251
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:16,180
(Suk Jin was not a devil.)

2252
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:18,430
(There's a devil on each team
except for Team Bo Hyun.)

2253
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,130
Success!

2254
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:22,650
- We spread out.
- See?

2255
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,060
I found out at the end.

2256
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,360
- Did you notice?
- Yes.

2257
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,500
(The devils all win a prize!)

2258
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,730
(Devil Kwang Soo managed to
hide his identity...)

2259
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:33,360
(until the end.)

2260
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,970
(Devil Haha)

2261
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:37,900
(You're a devil.)

2262
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:41,350
When Jae Suk looked at me,
he looked like a devil.

2263
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:43,250
Did you know?

2264
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,890
We are devils on a variety show.

2265
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:48,460
- You two were incredible.
- So Min was not a devil.

2266
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:51,350
Everybody on Team Bo Hyun
and the three devils...

2267
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:53,020
will pick a prize.

2268
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,760
(They get to pick a prize!)

2269
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,000
- This is my first time.
- I survived.

2270
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,320
- I survived.
- Nobody gets the penalty.

2271
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,130
That's true. There's no penalty.

2272
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:02,640
Six of you will pick.

2273
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,230
Your captain will arrange the cards.

2274
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:06,640
Okay, I'm the leader of the devils,
so I'll arrange them.

2275
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,770
- Why are you the leader?
- Why is it you?

2276
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:09,900
- People found out about you early.
- Everyone knew.

2277
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,470
Actually, he had
the majority of the votes.

2278
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:14,100
Bo Hyun, you can arrange these
in any order.

2279
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,420
- Arrange them and pick a number.
- Is there anything you need?

2280
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:19,310
Weren't we 28 earlier?

2281
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:21,260
- Right.
- I'll put one on there.

2282
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:22,350
Massage chair.

2283
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:25,130
You like 20s.

2284
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:26,720
- I'm done.
- Pick a number each.

2285
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,800
I've done this a lot recently.
I need a good one.

2286
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,670
- You've done this a lot.
- I have.

2287
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:34,860
You picked a lot, but the only thing
you took was my life-sized figure.

2288
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,470
Pick a number each.

2289
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:39,970
- Pick.
- 1, 2, 3.

2290
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:41,040
- Is it on the bottom?
- Please look.

2291
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,180
What number is it?

2292
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:44,400
(Bo Hyun did well today.
What prize did he win?)

2293
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,680
(He flexes his muscles.)

2294
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,470
(He looked surprised.
What is his prize?)

2295
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:50,550
What number is it?

2296
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:54,010
(Lucky Prize Draw)

2297
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:55,110
Tablet computer.

2298
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,310
(Tablet Computer)

2299
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:59,020
(This is Bo Hyun's class.)

2300
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:00,430
- Really?
- Tablet computer.

2301
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:01,800
(He got a tablet computer?)

2302
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,430
Really?

2303
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:04,520
- 23?
- 23.

2304
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:07,060
- They're serious.
- You get it right away.

2305
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,730
- You get it now.
- Thank you.

2306
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,600
Thank you.

2307
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,640
I keep getting 40s.

2308
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,860
A number of times.

2309
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,680
The massage chair is 28.

2310
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,040
Okay. Is it 28?

2311
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,880
- What number is it?
- What's the first digit?

2312
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,850
- I hope you get something.
- It's sharp.

2313
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:23,050
Is that in the 40s then?

2314
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,270
Seriously?

2315
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:25,510
- Members' face candles.
- Did you get something good?

2316
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,790
Number 41.

2317
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,930
I got the Korean beef set!

2318
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:34,820
See?

2319
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:37,260
- Hey.
- What's going on?

2320
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:39,690
- What's going on?
- This is my first time.

2321
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:41,020
- Hey.
- Protein.

2322
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:43,430
- Number 47.
- Jong Kook.

2323
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:47,170
(The miracle of number 47)

2324
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:50,380
- Look.
- What's going on today?

2325
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:52,050
- You got your favorite.
- Right.

2326
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:53,970
I need to party.

2327
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:55,550
- I'm not sure.
- It's okay.

2328
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:57,270
There's a good vibe.
He has a good vibe.

2329
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:58,940
Autographed name tags sound good.

2330
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,510
- This is a variety show.
- I only get the 40s.

2331
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:03,220
- What number is it?
- It's behind you.

2332
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,650
- What number?
- It ends with zero.

2333
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:07,060
- Go.
- It ends with zero?

2334
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,430
(If it's 0...)

2335
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,690
The Bluetooth speaker is number 30.

2336
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:13,470
(Number 30 is a speaker,
and number 40 is Korean beef set.)

2337
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:14,730
The Bluetooth speaker is number 30.

2338
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:16,600
- Number 30!
- Really?

2339
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,360
(Did he win a Bluetooth speaker?)

2340
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,470
- Really?
- Really?

2341
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:22,380
(There were good prizes
3 times in a row!)

2342
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:24,430
(This is the butterfly effect
of lucky Bo Hyun.)

2343
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:25,880
Let me see.

2344
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,350
- Let's make SBS go broke!
- Hey.

2345
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:29,940
(Unfortunately,
that became a reality.)

2346
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:31,920
Wireless earbuds.

2347
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:32,940
Okay!

2348
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,590
- Kwang Soo.
- This is unbelievable.

2349
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:36,090
- This is insane.
- That's awesome.

2350
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:37,180
He said it's insane.

2351
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:38,460
Number 22?

2352
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:40,350
A laptop?

2353
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:42,820
- Gosh, it's a laptop.
- A laptop.

2354
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:44,390
(He's making up
for his all bad luck.)

2355
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,630
SBS will go broke.

2356
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:47,860
It's the leader's turn.

2357
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,000
(It's the devil leader's turn.)

2358
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,840
- What's your number?
- It's 47.

2359
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:51,900
(Massage Chair)

2360
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,100
(And Jae Suk's number is 47.)

2361
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,310
(His goal is the massage chair.)

2362
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,070
- It's 47.
- It's a dud.

2363
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,640
Okay.

2364
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,880
(He's the only one
who picked a dud.)

2365
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:04,180
(Excited)

2366
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:06,010
(Darn it.)

2367
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,980
Okay.

2368
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,350
Thank the Almighty of variety shows.

2369
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:11,630
This is mine.

2370
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,800
I guess I'm destined
to only host TV shows.

2371
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,650
- You don't have any other talents.
- I can't do anything else.

2372
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:18,130
- He has nothing.
- I don't have anything else.

2373
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:20,930
He got caught as soon as we began,
so he's had a hard time all day.

2374
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:22,470
(We'd like to thank Bo Hyun,
Eui Soo, Jin Woo, and Joo Young.)

2375
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:24,670
(Team Comedian,
Team Actor, Team Singer)

2376
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:27,810
(Cho Sae Ho, Rowoon, Lee Do Hyun)

2377
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,470
(Noh Sa Yeon, Hong Jin Young)

2378
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,810
(With the living legends,)

2379
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:35,050
(all celebrities are
gathered together.)

2380
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:36,810
(Next to a congenial team
of singers,)

2381
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:40,110
(Team Comedian is arguing
about their ranks.)

2382
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,010
(But...)

2383
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:44,930
(the years of experience
can change?)

2384
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,520
Okay. I got one.

2385
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,190
(Their ranks changes in an instant.)

2386
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,670
(In order to get
more years of experience,)

2387
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:54,800
(they start the fiercest battle.)

2388
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:56,860
(The years of experience are
forged by someone?)

2389
01:21:56,860 --> 01:21:59,400
(What if a red stamp is found?)

2390
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,140
(They have to find out a hidden spy
to be ranked number 1.)

2391
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:04,510
- Who is this?
- We might get caught.

2392
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:05,900
(Running Man Class)
