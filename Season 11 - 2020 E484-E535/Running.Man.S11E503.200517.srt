1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,740
Hello.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,090
- Hello, guys.
- Hello.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,110
- The weather is very nice.
- You know what?

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,290
So Min is doing just fine.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,080
- I see.
- Jae Suk.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,290
- I went to So Min's place.
- You did?

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,720
How did it go?

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,750
- She was doing fine.
- Did you...

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,520
- take a picture?
- No, I didn't.

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,360
(He went to So Min's house
with Kwang Soo.)

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,090
So Min.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,310
Hi, So Min.

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,160
This is embarrassing.

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,430
- Why?
- Oh no.

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,380
(She even laced up his apron
with a smile.)

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,980
Hey, this isn't "We've Got Married".

18
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,110
I know that.

19
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,450
He's just watching us silently.

20
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,580
You guys are acting like
as if I'm invisible.

21
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,690
(The host is a little too fussy.)

22
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,340
(Don't spill anything
on the carpet.)

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,350
(To be honest,
I think I've got an upset stomach.)

24
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,560
(You can see what happened
at So Min's place next week.)

25
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,660
She looked...

26
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,300
- very natural.
- Okay.

27
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,730
Considering the situation,
she's way too cheerful.

28
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,440
I hear that everything else is
still in recovery,

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,800
but her mouth has already recovered
200 percent.

30
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,560
- It has a motor.
- Yes.

31
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,880
- That's not good.
- All right.

32
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,200
Haha has worked on the reggae duo,
Sulreggae's debut album...

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,850
- for the past two years.
- That's right.

34
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,240
(Jae Suk pours out words
with his hands put together.)

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,270
- Hold on.
- Are you at it again?

36
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,410
You just sounded like
you were reading a news article.

37
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,710
- I was so surprised.
- Try to sound more natural.

38
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,620
I thought he was a news reporter.

39
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,320
- I was so surprised.
- This isn't entertainment news.

40
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,230
You produced another album?

41
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,620
It's because I couldn't find...

42
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,160
any reggae album
that's easy to listen to.

43
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,760
This album is very easy
to listen to, especially in spring.

44
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,070
You're not one
of the singers, right?

45
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,160
- I'm not.
- You're not?

46
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,570
That's good.

47
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,010
- So it's romantic reggae, right?
- That's right.

48
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,510
- I can't wait.
- It'll make your heart flutter.

49
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,840
- Exactly.
- Is that what you're saying?

50
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,810
(No, no)

51
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,350
(The romantic,
retro-style reggae duo...)

52
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,070
(produced by Haha, Sulreggae)

53
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,040
We haven't seen new singers
from Quan Entertainment...

54
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,650
- in a while.
- It's their new venture.

55
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,410
- I wish you good luck.
- Thank you.

56
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,850
- Thank you.
- All right.

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,230
- Everyone, isn't the weather nice?
- Yes.

58
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,560
It's nice from today.

59
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,760
Usually, in May,

60
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,870
many colleges have festivals.

61
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,070
- That's right.
- That's right.

62
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,430
- That's right.
- So today,

63
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,100
we invited celebrities
who are usually very busy...

64
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,930
around this time.

65
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,030
- Today...
- I'm sure they're very popular.

66
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,110
Singers are usually very busy...

67
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,550
- around this time.
- That's right.

68
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,020
- Jin Young is usually busy too.
- Right.

69
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,440
- But these days,
- She has a lot of time right now.

70
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,780
she can come on the show any time.

71
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,560
- I see her on TV a lot.
- Exactly.

72
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,520
Even if she has time, I want her
on this show only sometimes.

73
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,560
- Why do you say that?
- I like it.

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,460
But you do want to see her
sometimes?

75
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,430
It's so fun to see Jong Kook
with Jin Young.

76
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,560
- She's tiring.
- He becomes so cute.

77
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,690
I can't do my usual thing.

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,190
- It's impossible.
- Here.

79
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,030
(Where is Jong Kook?)

80
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,960
So we invited
the kings and queens...

81
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,110
of college festivals
from different genres.

82
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm curious.

83
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,310
There are two hip-hip singers,

84
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,550
one indie singer,

85
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,940
and two idol singers.

86
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,680
So the 5 guests divided into
3 teams will perform one by one.

87
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
All right.

88
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,710
Each team has a money gun
loaded with 2,000 dollars,

89
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,590
and they will shoot it at any time
during their performances.

90
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,220
(A money gun?)

91
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,300
We're supposed to pick up the money?

92
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,720
The money you pick up...

93
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,220
from the ground
will be your mission fund.

94
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,060
Gosh, why would we...

95
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,430
(You want us to pick up
money from the ground?)

96
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,460
We have to pick up money
from the ground?

97
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,770
That'd be humiliating.

98
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,310
We never pick things up
from the ground.

99
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,050
But it suits Suk Jin best.

100
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,610
It suits him better
than anyone else.

101
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,240
That'd hurt my pride.

102
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,650
Suk Jin, pick anything up
from the ground,

103
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,420
and you're dead meat.

104
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,340
(Suk Jin laughs it off.)

105
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,560
All right.
Let's welcome the first team.

106
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Please come out.

107
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,120
We don't know when they'll
shoot their money gun.

108
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,890
We won't be able to enjoy
their performances.

109
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,520
Oh, my.

110
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,150
(Who are the first guests?)

111
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,490
- Oh, my.
- Hey!

112
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,900
BewhY!

113
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,240
- It's Jessi!
- Jessi!

114
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,900
(Intense rapping
with flow and clarity)

115
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,110
(The top rapper, BewhY)

116
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,030
(Powerful rapping and singing
with deep emotions)

117
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,710
(The irreplaceable,
charismatic Jessi)

118
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,180
- BewhY!
- BewhY!

119
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,710
It's Jessi!

120
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,020
(BewhY flexes his money gun
as soon as he's on stage.)

121
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,090
(Running)

122
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,120
Gosh.

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,960
Hey! There's so much here.

124
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,120
There's so much.

125
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,990
(BewhY shot all his money at once.)

126
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,150
(Everyone is busy
picking up the money.)

127
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,220
Pick it up!

128
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,690
(1,000 dollars is picked up
in the blink of an eye.)

129
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,190
(Unstoppable flow)

130
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,310
(BewhY's rap makes even
the muscular ballad singer dance.)

131
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm a BewhY fan!

132
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,140
I want to see his performance!

133
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,990
(Says BewhY)

134
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,640
(Cheering)

135
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,290
- BewhY!
- Next up is Jessi.

136
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,310
Unbelievable.

137
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,750
I want to see their performances,
but they keep shooting money.

138
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,730
(It's the charismatic girl,
Jessi's turn to perform.)

139
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,820
Focus on my performance.

140
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,890
- Okay!
- I love this song.

141
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,160
Twerking!

142
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,060
(The Sechan Corgi starts twerking.)

143
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,390
("Who Dat B" by Jessi)

144
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,630
(On alert)

145
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,810
(Jessi shoots all her money
at once too.)

146
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,780
(Swarming)

147
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,980
(The money magically
gathers everyone.)

148
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,140
Let's go!

149
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,990
(Now that all the money has been
picked up, they can have some fun.)

150
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,490
(Relaxed)

151
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,880
(They're pretending
they understand hip-hop.)

152
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,800
Jessi!

153
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,300
(Sexy to the end)

154
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,060
(Team Hip-hop flexed their
money guns in a relaxed manner.)

155
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,330
BewhY and Jessi!

156
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,330
Hey!

157
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,310
Someone stepped on the money.

158
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,970
That was so low.

159
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,310
- Suk Jin's hands were so fast.
- It was unbelievable.

160
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,850
- He almost crawled.
- After saying he wouldn't do it...

161
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,680
Also,

162
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
we're supposed to watch
the performances.

163
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,640
- Exactly, but it's impossible.
- You were the most desperate.

164
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,420
This time, let's try to enjoy
the performances more.

165
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,490
Let's do that.

166
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,010
- Don't obsess over money.
- That's right.

167
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,310
Let's see who starts running first.

168
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,450
- All right.
- Let's see.

169
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,680
(Who is the next guest?)

170
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,750
Who is it?

171
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,950
- It's BOL4!
- It's BOL4!

172
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,300
(Ahn Ji Young of BOL4)

173
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,930
(Her unique voice suits
the spring day perfectly.)

174
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,200
(The queen of the charts,
Ahn Ji Young of BOL4)

175
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,700
- Ahn Ji Young!
- BOL4!

176
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,410
- Ahn Ji Young!
- Ahn Ji Young!

177
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,550
Money!

178
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,000
(She shoots her money gun shyly.)

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,120
(Running)

180
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,050
(They said
they'd watch the performance.)

181
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,450
He rolled.

182
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,750
(Rolling and pinching)

183
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,730
- Gosh!
- Hey!

184
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,160
(Ji Young finishes her performance
in shock.)

185
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,190
Hyojung!

186
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,430
(Lastly, Team Idol)

187
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,560
(Jin Hyuk and Hyojung)

188
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,760
- Hyojung!
- Hello!

189
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,470
(Hyojung is known for
her cute and lovely charm.)

190
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,170
(OH MY GIRL is conquering
every music charts right now.)

191
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,370
("Nonstop" Becomes the No. 1 Song)

192
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,540
(Even his breath
heats up the stage.)

193
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,180
(Jin Hyuk recently debuted
as a solo singer.)

194
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,420
Stay here.

195
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,810
(Shooting)

196
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,680
(They run toward the money
for the 3rd time.)

197
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,030
(Despite the money cleaners,
Hyojung stays calm.)

198
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,860
(The money gun is fired.)

199
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,530
(The idol singer is full of energy.)

200
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,870
(His performance is flawless
to the end.)

201
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,470
- There's some left.
- Why is there so much?

202
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,630
I can't see it.

203
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,780
You beggars!

204
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,810
You beggars, move!

205
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,870
(Hyojung donates some money
to Suk Jin.)

206
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,920
Thanks.

207
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,050
(Suk Jin steps on some money.)

208
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,180
Don't step on the money.

209
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,950
All right.

210
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,680
Put your money in your bag
and hand it in so we can check.

211
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
I never pick things up
from the ground.

212
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,300
With these amazing singers here...

213
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,560
In front of younger people...

214
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,170
I wouldn't even pick up
10-dollar bills this way.

215
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,260
We have no money left!

216
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,600
- We have nothing left.
- We don't usually do this.

217
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,700
Please come down!

218
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,870
I ran so much.

219
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,780
We have five kings and queens
of festivals here today.

220
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,200
I'm a little disappointed.

221
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,780
- I wanted to hear them sing.
- I couldn't hear anything.

222
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,640
But we had a mission.
As soon as they appeared...

223
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,120
You said we should enjoy
their performances,

224
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
- but you started running first.
- Who?

225
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,920
You ran so fast.

226
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,450
It reminded me of my dog
running toward his food.

227
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,680
As soon as I throw his food
on the floor...

228
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,820
- It makes him go crazy.
- Yes.

229
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,730
Kwang Soo is even wearing
a poop-colored jacket.

230
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,730
Exactly.

231
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,990
You totally looked like a beggar.

232
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,390
Every penny is so sweet.

233
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,410
Let me introduce our guests.

234
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,970
First, Jin Hyuk.

235
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,640
- He's so good-looking.
- He's a member of UP10TION.

236
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,810
Idol singers have
amazing stage presence.

237
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,810
Do you have any tips
for having a great stage presence?

238
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,620
- For example...
- For example?

239
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,290
Normally,
when you're out of breath...

240
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,750
- Show us what you'd do normally.
- At the end...

241
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,850
This is what you'd do normally.

242
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,130
- He's exhausted.
- He's exhausted.

243
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,430
But on camera...

244
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,860
(He stares right at the camera.)

245
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,460
- That looks completely different.
- He stares at the camera.

246
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,430
The eyes are important.

247
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,100
(Casually stare at the camera.)

248
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,330
As if to say, "Look at me."

249
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Your chest has to move up and down.

250
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,510
Up and down.

251
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,280
(Too much, just right)

252
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,310
That looks so different.

253
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,310
- For an idol singer,
- That looks really different.

254
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,250
- he's pretty funny.
- He's funny.

255
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,420
- I haven't seen...
- He's the male version of Mi Joo.

256
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,680
- Mi Joo?
- Mi Joo.

257
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,290
OH MY GIRL's new song...

258
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,560
- topped the charts right away.
- Hello.

259
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,500
- What's the title?
- It's "Nonstop."

260
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,430
- "Nonstop".
- "Nonstop".

261
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,770
This is the first time
you've topped the charts, right?

262
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,930
- It is.
- Let's give her a big hand.

263
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,540
- You must be so happy.
- Congratulations.

264
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,930
- All right, Hyojung.
- Yes?

265
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,830
Can you perform your new song...

266
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,010
- for us?
- Sure.

267
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,180
Please.

268
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,550
This song topped the charts?

269
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,810
("Nonstop" by OH MY GIRL)

270
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,290
(My heart slightly fluttered)

271
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,710
I love the song.

272
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,390
- It's really nice.
- It's perfect for the weather.

273
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,720
It's so nice.

274
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,500
I love this part.

275
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,320
My heart fluttered.

276
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,000
(Is she sanitizing her hands?)

277
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,410
(Hyojung's cute performance...)

278
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,640
(makes everyone's heart flutter.)

279
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,310
- I love that.
- It's a really nice song.

280
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,750
- I love the song.
- My heart fluttered.

281
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,510
There's something her fans...

282
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,380
often say.

283
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,050
They think sexy dance...

284
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,750
- doesn't really suit her.
- She's too cute.

285
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,260
- She's too cute.
- Her face is so cute.

286
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,520
But...

287
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,950
if she changes clothes
and parts her hair differently,

288
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,890
- she'll look sexy.
- Do you think so?

289
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,090
- Part her hair differently?
- Maybe...

290
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,500
if you get a little tan too...

291
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,030
- I should get a tan?
- Just a little.

292
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,460
That means she has to change
completely.

293
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,060
- That's right.
- The thing is,

294
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,700
she's in an idol group.

295
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,430
- If she wants to look different.
- I get it.

296
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,910
I'm a girl too, you know.

297
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,640
Jessi, show us.

298
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,050
- Show us.
- No!

299
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,200
- Just the facial expressions.
- I don't know the dance.

300
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,280
How do you start?

301
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,570
- Just dance to the music.
- Yes, a freestyle.

302
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,890
You're showing Hyojung
how it's done.

303
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,350
Let's do this!

304
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,630
(Can't wait.)

305
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,850
2, 3, 4.

306
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,350
(What?)

307
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,060
2, 3, 4.

308
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,560
(R-rated version of "Bubble Pop")

309
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,230
Jessi!

310
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,270
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

311
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,540
- Stop it.
- That's not it.

312
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,200
- Jessi, please.
- Gosh.

313
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,380
What on earth are you doing?

314
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,700
- Jessi, hold on.
- What is this?

315
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,280
- That was startling.
- Hold on.

316
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,940
- Hey. This is...
- Jessi.

317
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,440
- Hey!
- This is my style.

318
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,110
Yes, we understand that.

319
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,940
We understand that,

320
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,680
- but it wasn't appropriate...
- Just look though.

321
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,480
- Everyone can keep to their style.
- Keep your own style.

322
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,950
- Yes, do it your own way.
- Of course.

323
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,850
Next up is Ahn Ji Young.

324
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,530
(The unique vocalist
Ahn Ji Young of BOL4)

325
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,960
Anyway, she released a new song.

326
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,560
- That's right.
- It was released on the 13th.

327
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,330
- Yes.
- Songs by BOL4 are always sweet.

328
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,860
- Exactly.
- Right?

329
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,360
- Could we perhaps hear it?
- Sure.

330
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,510
- Here's her mic.
- Let me.

331
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,910
She has such a unique voice.

332
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,250
Way to go Mr. Fashionista.

333
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,570
(Se Chan's fashion turns heads.)

334
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,980
That's how we wore our jackets
in the 90s.

335
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,520
I remember photos of celebrities
in that style.

336
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,720
(Reply 1990s)

337
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,130
(He even looks like someone
from the 90s too.)

338
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,820
The weather's too hot, that's all.

339
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,960
- I had no choice.
- It's cool though.

340
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,230
- But...
- You sure are a celebrity.

341
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,810
Yes, top celebrities are different.

342
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,600
- I was too hot in it.
- It's not easy to pull off.

343
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,380
- I'm not kidding.
- Ji Young, please go ahead.

344
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,700
("Hug" by BOL4)

345
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,750
(Her tone and the melody
is perfect for the spring.)

346
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,980
Gosh, it's nice.

347
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,580
I love it.

348
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,930
(Whoo!)

349
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,590
Can you believe her voice?

350
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,190
(BOL4 always delivers!)

351
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,560
- I love the "whoo" part.
- Your voice...

352
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,860
It gives me the tickles.

353
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,230
- Your voice gives us the tickles.
- Whoo!

354
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,040
That's what I was going for.

355
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,600
Can you sing that "whoo" part again?

356
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,040
(A pleasant breeze goes whoo!)

357
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,380
<i>A pleasant breeze goes whoo!</i>

358
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,840
<i>- A pleasant breeze goes whoo!
- Whoo!</i>

359
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,050
(They can't get enough
of the "whoo".)

360
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,810
- I just got goosebumps.
- Jessi.

361
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,760
Jessi, could you try that too?

362
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,110
- Yes, please.
<i>- A pleasant breeze goes whoo!</i>

363
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,560
- Sing that for us.
- What are the lyrics again?

364
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,530
"A pleasant breeze goes whoo."

365
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,270
- "A pleasant breeze goes whoo."
- A pleasant breeze goes whoo.

366
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,270
<i>- A breeze goes...</i>
- A pleasant breeze.

367
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,560
<i>- A pleasant breeze...</i>
- Hush.

368
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,560
<i>A pleasant booze...</i>

369
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,830
(She flares up by herself.)

370
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,180
- Hold on.
- Jessi!

371
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,780
(She's not used to
such sweet lyrics.)

372
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,150
Did she just swear?

373
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,650
Let me try that again.

374
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,100
She was like, "Darn!"

375
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,150
<i>- A pleasant breeze goes whoo
- A pleasant breeze goes whoo</i>

376
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,750
<i>- A pleasant breeze
- A pleasant breeze goes whoo!</i>

377
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,790
(She has the lyrics down.)

378
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,450
<i>A breeze pleasant...</i>

379
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,450
(A breeze pleasant?)

380
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,260
(She just can't say it correctly.)

381
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,590
- Just don't.
- Don't bother.

382
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,450
- Don't do it.
- Just stop.

383
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,720
- Jae Suk.
- Don't do it.

384
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,820
- I have a genre I'm good at.
- Right.

385
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,300
- You specialize in a different one.
- Jessi, hey.

386
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
My gosh.

387
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,510
Anyway Ji Young, I hear that
many think you lived abroad.

388
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,540
- Because of your pronunciation?
- Yes.

389
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,930
Where were you born?

390
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,700
Yeongju, North Gyeongsang Province.

391
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,200
- Yeongju?
- Yes.

392
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,110
(While Ji Young tells us
how she's been...)

393
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,520
(Mumbling)

394
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,080
- Then...
- Jessi, stop practicing.

395
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,710
She's still practicing that line.

396
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,580
- Why?
- Why doesn't it stick?

397
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,180
A pleasant breeze.

398
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,300
<i>- A pleasant breeze goes whoo!</i>
- That's it.

399
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,400
<i>A pleasant breeze goes whoo!</i>

400
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,300
(She smiles
as she finally says it correctly.)

401
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,360
I feel like you should be
blowing out smoke at the end.

402
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,230
It's just a personal opinion.

403
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,270
- I'm not saying that's true.
- Stop it.

404
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,860
I'm not saying
you smoke or anything.

405
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,670
- Just stop.
- I should've kept that to myself.

406
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,100
- Stop it.
- Your leg is still recovering,

407
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,200
- so she will overpower you.
- Sorry about that.

408
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,650
Next up is Jessi! It's Ho Hyun Ju.

409
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,280
No, Kwang Soo. Don't.

410
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,920
- Jessi!
- I know you don't mean it.

411
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,180
I love Jessi.

412
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,760
- Then...
- I love you.

413
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,020
Jessi is the best!

414
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,430
Jessi's last appearance
on the show was five years ago.

415
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,320
- I was shocked to hear that.
- It seems recent though.

416
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,300
The last time she was here,

417
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,270
she understood the rules
when the race was over.

418
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,630
- Right.
- That's right.

419
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,900
(This is too difficult though.)

420
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,810
(He's frustrated.)

421
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,200
(She went home not fully
understanding the rules.)

422
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,150
You only understood the rules
when the game was over.

423
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,440
What?

424
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,610
- Got it.
- History might repeat itself.

425
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,180
- We're good.
- It might happen once again.

426
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,850
- Jae Suk, don't give up.
- It just seems that way.

427
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,060
- Well...
- Jae Suk, don't give up yet.

428
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,820
(They couldn't be
more frustrated with her.)

429
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,300
- Hold on.
- Jessi, wait.

430
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,820
He made it sound complicated though.

431
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,530
Jae Suk glared at you just now.

432
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,360
- I had my reasons.
- That's right.

433
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,170
- Hey, Jessi.
- It was difficult to understand.

434
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,300
(Jae Suk meets his match
after 5 years.)

435
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,200
It's been a while since I saw
Jae Suk glare at a guest.

436
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,830
- Don't give up. You can do this.
- It's fine.

437
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,780
I asked her the question,
so I'm good.

438
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,410
Anyway, that was Jessi!

439
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,510
(He quickly wraps up
the interview.)

440
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,750
Go, Jessi!

441
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,110
- Next up is BewhY.
- BewhY!

442
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,210
BewhY forever.

443
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,720
His real name is Lee Byeong Yoon.

444
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,260
- BewhY is said to resemble Se Chan.
- Yes.

445
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,860
He's somewhere between
me and Hong Hyun Hee.

446
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,000
He resembles both
me and Hong Hyun Hee.

447
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,640
That's how it goes.

448
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,170
- Haven't you heard that before?
- I have.

449
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,460
He doesn't have
that hairstyle anymore.

450
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,730
You two have similar noses.

451
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,510
- It's our teeth.
- That's not it

452
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,470
BewhY's teeth stick out more.

453
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,550
Really?

454
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,920
I'm just saying.

455
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,380
You just scraped his pride.

456
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,750
Exactly. This hurts my pride.

457
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,980
I usually have
the most protruding teeth.

458
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,080
I don't know why, but we suddenly...

459
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,580
moved on...

460
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
to talking about
his protruding teeth.

461
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,030
What I find the most interesting
about his rap is that I can hear...

462
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,900
- the lyrics even though it's fast.
- Exactly.

463
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,630
- I can hear all the lyrics.
- That's right.

464
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,670
It's been a while,
so I'd like to ask him...

465
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,600
to rap for us a little bit.

466
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,780
Could you smack our ears
with your fast-paced rap?

467
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,970
Let's hear this.

468
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,200
(He seemed flustered at first,)

469
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,840
(but he transforms
as soon as he grabs the mic.)

470
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,650
("Neo Christian Flow" by BewhY)

471
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,980
Isn't he amazing?

472
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,670
How does one rap like this?

473
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,000
He's not even out of breath.

474
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,510
Where does he stop to breathe?

475
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,910
(He tore up the stage.)

476
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,610
I got goosebumps.

477
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,020
- How do you remember the lyrics?
- How do you remember all that?

478
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,310
- Where do you breathe?
- You don't seem out of breath.

479
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,190
It's easy for him
because it's his song.

480
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,730
(She chimes in again.)

481
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,490
- Seriously?
- Jessi!

482
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,150
- But I...
- Of course, we know that!

483
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,700
- We know that too.
- It's not because we didn't know.

484
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,590
Then why ask that question?

485
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,620
(Jessi chimes in
when they're praising BewhY.)

486
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,920
You're cool too, okay?

487
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,090
Gosh.

488
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,710
Today, the members and the guests
will split into teams of four...

489
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,040
and form a performance group.

490
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,070
You will earn money
depending on how you do each round.

491
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,250
The three
who earned the most will win.

492
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,110
Before we begin the race,
you'll split into teams.

493
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,810
You each earned a mission fund
earlier on.

494
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,760
- Right.
- Let me tell you how much.

495
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,150
Jae Suk earned 770 dollars.

496
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,150
That's it?

497
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,800
Suk Jin earned 1,080 dollars.

498
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,730
Haha earned 1,270 dollars.

499
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,860
Kwang Soo earned 1,150 dollars.

500
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,090
- That's a lot.
- Haha earned the most.

501
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,060
Isn't it funny how Ji Hyo managed
to pick up so much?

502
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,630
- I did my best.
- It's uncanny.

503
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,540
You will write down...

504
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,780
how much you'd pay
to cast each guest.

505
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,810
- I'd love to team up with Jin Hyuk.
- Right.

506
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,900
Shall we?

507
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,980
Show us your numbers.

508
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,140
Let's do this.

509
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,370
Did I write down too much?

510
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,840
Sorry, but we're still
testing the waters.

511
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,950
Jong Kook, come on.

512
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,990
- Jong Kook?
- Really?

513
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,220
- Suk Jin?
- Seriously?

514
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,990
- I should've put down more.
- I didn't want to choose him,

515
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,850
but he offered the most money.

516
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,920
(The other teams
finish picking who they want.)

517
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,800
It's over now.
You don't get another chance.

518
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,970
(Team Idol: Suk Jin, Jong Kook,
Jin Hyuk, Hyojung)

519
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,970
(Team Hip-hop: Kwang Soo,
Jae Suk, BewhY, Jessi)

520
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,230
(Team Indie: Haha, Se Chan,
Ji Hyo, Ji Young)

521
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,390
After the race is over,

522
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,310
the three with the most
amount of money earned...

523
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,510
will win prizes
according to their ranks.

524
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,400
The two with the least amount
of money will receive a penalty.

525
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,550
- My gosh.
- After each round,

526
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,370
you will discuss
how you'll divide...

527
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,220
the money among you.

528
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,220
That's the amount of money
you'll individually receive.

529
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,410
Please go and get changed.
We'll begin the first round...

530
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,380
- at a different location.
- Okay.

531
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,650
(Let's go and make some money!)

532
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,300
What's this?

533
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,820
I bet we're supposed
to hang from those.

534
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,270
The first game to earn
money for your performance...

535
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,130
is Cutting the Rope.

536
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,890
Cutting the Rope?

537
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,740
One person from each team
will compete at a time.

538
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,210
The first one to be eliminated
will earn zero points...

539
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,780
while the other two
will earn one point each.

540
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,280
The winning team
will receive 3,000 dollars.

541
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,840
The team in second place
will receive 2,000 dollars.

542
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,450
The team in third place
will receive...

543
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,520
- 1,000 dollars.
- That's a lot.

544
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,720
How much is it again?

545
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,020
- 3,000 dollars.
- 3,000, 2,000...

546
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,310
SBS must be rich.

547
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,690
What we have so far is chump change.

548
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,820
Anyway, one member from each team...

549
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,000
will wear the harness
that is supported...

550
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,500
by five ropes.

551
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,230
You will stand on
a foothold and wait.

552
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,770
In the order I point at,
you will answer my question...

553
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,660
with the correct syllables.

554
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,740
(Answer the question
in the correct syllables.)

555
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,540
- Oh, that game.
- If you take more than...

556
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,510
three seconds or make no sense,

557
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,640
you will have to choose...

558
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,980
- 1 rope out of the 5.
- And it'll be cut.

559
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,870
Only two of them
are supporting your weight.

560
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,050
- Got it.
- You will lose support...

561
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,220
if one of those is cut,
and you'll fall when both are cut.

562
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,310
(The harness is operated manually.)

563
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,080
- Got it.
- Sounds like fun.

564
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,030
Please choose who'll compete first.

565
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,030
The first one from our team
will be...

566
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,760
- Kwang Soo.
- Sure.

567
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,700
- Se Chan is up.
- Since Kwang Soo is competing,

568
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,360
- we choose Jin Hyuk.
- Jin Hyuk?

569
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,770
- Go, Jin Hyuk.
- Because I'm tall?

570
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,440
- That's right. Stand in the center.
- Let's do this.

571
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,770
(The first players enter the arena.)

572
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,810
- Jin Hyuk!
- The center of Team Idol.

573
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,040
Your technology has improved.

574
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,480
- It's improved?
- Yes.

575
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,510
- Technology.
- It's always been this good.

576
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,110
I will now ask the question.

577
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,070
The one who's picked will give
a five-syllable answer.

578
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,580
And the other two
will answer in turn.

579
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,220
Why can't I give
a three-syllable answer?

580
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,490
I can't think
of any five-syllable words.

581
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,190
What are some five-syllable words?

582
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,260
Let's begin.

583
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Focus.

584
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,650
What's a nickname you want
to give to your girlfriend?

585
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,700
Kwang Soo goes first.

586
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,270
(What's a nickname you want
to give to your girlfriend?)

587
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,360
- Pencil Eraser.
- What?

588
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
(Time's up.)

589
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,810
(Does he call his girlfriend
Pencil Eraser?)

590
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,770
What was that?

591
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,570
You could've said things
like "Cute Baby".

592
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,940
I couldn't think of anything.

593
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,980
Why can't you think
of words like that?

594
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,210
I have no idea now.

595
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,870
Why is it so hard?

596
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,950
Hey, wait.

597
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,910
Can you make it easier for me?

598
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,690
Fine. You should just say any
five-syllable word. Say anything.

599
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,760
I can't even understand
the question.

600
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,990
Pick a number from 1 to 5.

601
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,990
Four.

602
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,090
- Four?
- Yes.

603
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,650
(He picks number 4.)

604
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,860
Cut rope number four.

605
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,230
1, 2, 3.

606
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,540
(Is rope number 4 real or fake?)

607
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,970
(Gulping)

608
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,550
(He picked the real rope.)

609
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,900
(Number 4 was a real rope
that was holding Kwang Soo.)

610
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,070
Is this how it goes?

611
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,170
(Number 4 was a real rope
that was holding Kwang Soo.)

612
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,220
- Hey, wait.
- My gosh.

613
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,690
(They are terrified
by the technology at Running Man.)

614
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,650
Is this how it goes?
Gosh, I'm so surprised.

615
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,790
- It's going really low.
- I'm so startled.

616
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,300
- So this is how we play it.
- Kwang Soo.

617
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,860
- Kwang Soo, pull yourself together.
- What?

618
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,060
Pull yourself together.

619
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,770
- Hang on.
- He picked the real rope.

620
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,000
- I mean...
- He's so unlucky.

621
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,060
- Are you good at this game?
- Pull yourself together.

622
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,940
- Are you good at this?
- Stay focused.

623
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,740
Why are you so bad at this?

624
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,810
You could say things like
"Cute Baby".

625
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,210
- Now he's...
- You keep saying that.

626
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,050
That's the only word
you can think of.

627
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,640
He barely came up with the word.

628
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,550
- "Cute Baby".
- "Cute Baby"?

629
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,190
- That's the thing he can say.
- He just keeps saying...

630
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,190
"Cute Baby".

631
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,880
Can't you think
of five-syllable words?

632
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,490
- Okay.
- Let's continue.

633
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,990
What was your first impression
of Jessi? Jin Hyuk, you're up.

634
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,700
Totally tough girl.

635
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,460
(He gives a 5-syllable word.)

636
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,890
Good.

637
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,200
(Kwang Soo is supposed to give
a four-syllable word.)

638
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,500
Cute and sexy.

639
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
It should be a word
with four syllables.

640
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,360
My goodness.

641
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,630
It should go like 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

642
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,270
Cute and sexy has five syllables.

643
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,440
Please let this slide.

644
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,740
- He didn't know the rules.
- I'm sorry.

645
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,370
- We can't do that.
- He really didn't know.

646
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,950
- He didn't know the rules.
- Why did you not know?

647
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,050
Are you a fool or what?

648
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,220
He's dumb.

649
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,810
Admit that you're dumb.

650
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,080
I'm dumb.

651
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,990
Okay. I can let it slide then.

652
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,910
- I'll give you one more chance.
- Okay.

653
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,080
- This is the last time.
- All right.

654
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,880
- Okay.
- It's simple. 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

655
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,230
What's the first thing you look for
when you see a girl? Kwang Soo.

656
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,700
(What's the first thing you look for
when you see a girl?)

657
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,090
Body and face.

658
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,200
(Body and face)

659
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,300
Face, body.

660
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,390
Eyes, nose, and mouth.

661
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,270
Heart.

662
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,270
Brea...

663
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,060
(Brea...)

664
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,540
Wait. I'm sorry.

665
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,540
Cut it.

666
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,240
Hey! How could you...

667
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,570
- Cut it.
- I'm sorry.

668
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,810
I have no excuse.

669
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,050
You need a one-syllable word.

670
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,050
One syllable.

671
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,370
Nose or Eyes.

672
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,080
- My gosh.
- I know that.

673
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,580
I meant the heart.

674
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,020
I care about the heart.

675
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,310
That's how he feels.
What's wrong about that?

676
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,490
Stay quiet, Jessi.

677
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,760
You should've said eyes or nose.

678
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,320
Se Chan, you failed.

679
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,650
Pick a number.

680
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,230
- Three.
- Okay.

681
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,360
- That must be the real rope.
- Number three.

682
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,060
I hope Se Chan will
fall down right away.

683
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,770
1, 2, 3.

684
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,010
Gosh, I'm scared.

685
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,130
- Look at the angle.
- 1, 2, and 3.

686
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,900
(Sliding)

687
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,170
- Gosh, this is scary.
- Let's move on.

688
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,170
All right.

689
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,550
What comes to your mind
right now? Se Chan, you're up.

690
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,450
(What comes to your mind right now?)

691
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,060
Things are getting worse... Darn it.

692
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,230
- "I want to go home."
- Why is it so hard?

693
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,290
What's wrong with you?

694
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,620
"I want to go home."

695
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
- "I want to eat."
- "I want this to be over."

696
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,970
"I want this to be over."

697
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,500
My goodness.

698
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,700
That was easy.

699
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,800
Pick a number.

700
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,890
- Number 1.
- Number 1.

701
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,560
1, 2, 3.

702
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,370
(What's rope 1 Se Chan picked?)

703
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,040
(No change)

704
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,340
There's no change.

705
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,480
(Relieved)

706
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,050
What part of your body
are you not proud of? Kwang Soo.

707
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,190
(What part of your body
are you not proud of?)

708
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,490
Face and body.

709
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,990
Why did you not say buttocks?

710
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,960
Gums, face.

711
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,820
- Jin Hyuk.
- Shoulder line.

712
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,850
(Shoulder line)

713
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,300
- Kwang Soo.
- Eyes.

714
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,820
- Se Chan.
- Everything.

715
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,700
(Everything)

716
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,470
(He suddenly makes a confession.)

717
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,400
- Everything.
- Good.

718
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,170
- Do you like it? Everything.
- What was that?

719
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,670
- Which part of your face?
- Okay.

720
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,210
What do you want to do
with someone you live? Se Chan.

721
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,520
I want to go on a trip.

722
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,070
Amusement park.

723
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,950
Time's up.

724
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,560
- You could say kiss.
- Kwang Soo.

725
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,290
My goodness.

726
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,880
(He's really bad at games.)

727
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,230
I thought Se Chan was going next.

728
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,590
He could've said "wherever".

729
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,060
- My gosh.
- Pick a number.

730
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,090
- Number 3.
- Number 3.

731
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,390
(Kwang Soo picks number 3.)

732
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,200
(Kwang Soo already cut
1 of the 2 real ropes.)

733
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,770
(There's only 1 real rope
among the remaining 4.)

734
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,770
1, 2, 3.

735
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,670
(Kwang Soo is out.)

736
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,570
- My gosh.
- Oh no.

737
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,640
He's the first one to lose the game.

738
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,070
He picked the real one again.

739
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,520
He's so unlucky.

740
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,950
- He's out.
- Come on out.

741
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,610
Gosh, Kwang Soo.

742
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,380
Team Indie and Team Idol
get one point each.

743
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,290
- We got one point!
- Yes!

744
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,990
Jin Hyuk did a good job.

745
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,850
Who's next?

746
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,500
- Next up is Ho Hyun Ju.
- They are so young.

747
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,890
- They are young, so...
- Hyun Ju.

748
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,300
- Am I going next?
- You should.

749
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,830
They are all too good.

750
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,440
- Just go.
- But they are young.

751
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,470
My gosh.

752
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,560
Just go ahead and do it.

753
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,570
Go up there.

754
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,570
She's so talkative.

755
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,370
Gosh, I'm so tired.

756
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,840
Wait. Let me practice.

757
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,070
- Just do it.
- Ask me a question.

758
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,480
- Just do it.
- Any question.

759
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,780
What do you want to say to your mom?

760
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,050
I love you.

761
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,810
All right. That's what you do.

762
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,020
- Just do it. Go, Hyun Ju.
- I love you.

763
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,560
I love you, Mom.

764
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,060
Ho Hyun Ju, just come here.

765
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,000
Why are you yelling at me like that?

766
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,030
Come here.

767
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,890
I'm really tired.

768
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,530
I'm tired when I'm with her.

769
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,270
Hyun Ju, put this on.

770
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,470
She does have a unique character.

771
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,100
- My gosh. The ropes are...
- Just do it.

772
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,210
They must be good.

773
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,740
Please lean forward.

774
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,540
Good luck, Hyun Ju.

775
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,640
Go, Hyun Ju!

776
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,870
Go, Ji Young.

777
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,280
- Go, Ahn Ji Young.
- Good luck.

778
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,070
- Mapo-gu!
- Mapo-gu!

779
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,950
Hyun Ju, be confident.

780
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,580
Hey, shush.

781
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,690
(Hey, shush.)

782
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,110
I got this.

783
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,080
(Getting upset for the 3rd time)

784
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,460
Let's begin.

785
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,820
Wait. Please do it slowly.

786
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,090
Wait. Who's first?

787
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,920
- I don't know.
- He hasn't said that yet.

788
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,360
I don't know!

789
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,560
- Hey, I don't know.
- Let's just begin.

790
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,770
- I'm so tired.
- Please begin.

791
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,470
- Let's just begin.
- I don't know.

792
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,480
I'm sorry.

793
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,210
What do you look for in a guy?

794
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,220
Jessi. One...

795
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,110
- Face and...
- 2, 3...

796
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,610
Face, personality, body.

797
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,060
What?

798
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,290
I say.

799
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,290
(What? I say.)

800
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,290
- What?
- Bo Pil.

801
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,190
You should give her a yellow card.

802
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,230
- Hey, I said it.
- It was too late.

803
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,390
- Hey.
- It wasn't late.

804
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,320
- What?
- Earlier...

805
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,590
Hey, director.

806
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,940
- It wasn't late at all.
- Think about earlier.

807
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,270
Just give me a chance.

808
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,270
- It was too late.
- Please.

809
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,160
Don't get intimidated.

810
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,600
You're intimidated by her, right?

811
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,810
He's intimidated.

812
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,810
(Coward Bo Pil,
Director of Running Man)

813
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,950
Don't get cold feet. She failed.

814
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,050
- Time's up.
- Just give me a chance.

815
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,640
Just give her one more chance.

816
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,670
This is your last chance.

817
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,580
- Let's start over.
- So you don't get more chances.

818
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,220
- And Bo Pil, don't get cold feet.
- Okay.

819
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,310
She seemed pretty upset.

820
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,490
That's why he gave her a chance.

821
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,880
She seemed upset.

822
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,380
It's so funny.

823
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,730
Where did you have
your first kiss? Jessi.

824
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,800
- 1, 2...
- It doesn't have to be true.

825
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,090
On top of the closet.

826
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,160
Okay.

827
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,040
What?

828
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,310
Hey, it's hip-hop. Hip-hop!

829
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,630
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

830
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,630
Does that count?

831
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,630
Yes.

832
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,010
Wasn't it in the closet?

833
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,070
She just said it.

834
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,510
On top of the closet?

835
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,750
- It doesn't have to be true.
- You can just say a random place.

836
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,990
It doesn't have to be true.

837
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,080
- Okay.
- Just say any place.

838
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,690
- It doesn't matter.
- Next.

839
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,260
I don't know it yet.

840
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Playground.

841
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,990
Bed.

842
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,760
It's not true. She's just saying
a random place.

843
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,200
- Next.
- Home.

844
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,030
Good.

845
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,920
This is more fun than I thought.

846
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,390
It doesn't have to be true.

847
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,830
I can't stop imagining
a kiss on top of the closet.

848
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,630
Squeezing myself into the space.

849
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,280
Good. What's the first thing...

850
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,100
you thought of when you woke up
in the morning? Hyojung.

851
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,280
Running Man is the best.

852
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,670
- That was a good one.
- Jessi.

853
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,070
Running Man again?

854
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,640
Should I go home?

855
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,450
What do I do?

856
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,560
What do I do?

857
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,490
- Oh no.
- What's wrong?

858
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,260
- She just sounds cute.
- "What do I do?"

859
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,390
- "What do I do?"
- "What do I do?"

860
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,300
- We say that.
- "What do I do?"

861
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,390
- "What do I do?"
- "What do I do?"

862
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,000
I know what she means.
"What do I do?"

863
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,060
Pick a number.

864
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,700
Doesn't that count?

865
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,940
- Number 4.
- Number 4.

866
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
It will be all right.

867
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,540
1, 2, 3.

868
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,480
(She picked the real rope.)

869
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,670
I like her reaction.

870
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,810
That was good.

871
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,670
- Hyojung.
- I like your reaction.

872
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,020
What should we do with Hyojung?

873
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,250
- What do I do?
- Oh no.

874
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,260
What gift do you want
to get Suk Jin? Jessi.

875
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,790
I hate everything.

876
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,060
(What was that?)

877
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,650
- Why?
- What was that?

878
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,200
I don't want to give him anything.

879
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,500
Why?

880
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,890
She doesn't want
to give him anything.

881
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,560
She just doesn't want to.

882
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,940
- Hang on.
- Listen.

883
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,770
She can't give him anything
because she doesn't want to.

884
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,480
She doesn't want
to give him anything.

885
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,010
- Put yourself in her shoes.
- That's not a gift.

886
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,840
"I hate everything" isn't a gift.

887
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,140
- She doesn't want to.
- She should name a gift.

888
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,280
She just doesn't want to.

889
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,050
- Then I...
- There's nothing she wants.

890
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,640
I don't want to give him anything.

891
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,950
Jessi was being honest.

892
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,690
She just hates it.

893
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,460
- I don't want to give him anything.
- She should name a gift.

894
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,490
A gift.

895
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,920
You failed. Pick a number.

896
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,500
- Number 1.
- Number 1.

897
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,530
Cut number 1.

898
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,920
1, 2, 3.

899
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,590
(No change)

900
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,160
Good. You are safe. Okay.

901
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,560
My luck is very good.

902
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,940
I know. You're lucky.

903
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,600
How do you feel when you look
into a mirror? Ji Young.

904
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,370
This is great.

905
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,510
Let's laugh.

906
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,870
"Let's laugh". Good.

907
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,370
Big breasts.

908
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,640
Big breasts.

909
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,950
(What?)

910
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,190
- Keep going.
- Keep going.

911
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,490
- Keep going.
- It makes sense.

912
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,610
- Go.
- Keep going.

913
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,990
- I can't think of anything else.
- Keep going.

914
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,320
That was good. Keep going.

915
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,790
- Keep going.
- Go.

916
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,890
The best.

917
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,000
Yup!

918
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,590
- "Yup"?
- "Yup"?

919
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,970
- "Yup"?
- What was that?

920
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,090
- What does that mean?
- Yup!

921
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,240
- Yup!
- What's wrong with it?

922
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,500
- Yup!
- What's wrong with it?

923
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,740
Yup!

924
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,560
It's like an exclamation.

925
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,130
- Doesn't "Yup" work?
- Pick a number.

926
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,510
- 5.
- Pick well. 5.

927
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,570
1, 2, 3.

928
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,710
That was a great reaction.

929
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,950
- That was a great reaction.
- Hyojung is out.

930
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,020
Jessi!

931
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,140
(I won!)

932
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,380
No way! Did Jessi win?

933
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,810
(Did Jessi really win?)

934
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,080
Hey, you!

935
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,190
What was that man's name?

936
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,350
- Se Chan.
- "That man".

937
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,500
Jessi, go up there.

938
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,800
Don't look down on Korean-American.

939
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,560
What?

940
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,620
- Why? What?
- What?

941
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,770
- What?
- What?

942
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,770
- Take these off.
- "What?"

943
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,830
"Why? What?"

944
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,940
- "Your head bing bing."
- "Your head bing bing."

945
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,130
Teach me some English words.

946
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,360
"Your head bing bing."

947
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,070
Se Chan.

948
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,710
- BewhY, let's go.
- Let's go.

949
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,780
I will win a point.

950
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,750
Let's go. What do you want to say
to your first love?

951
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,840
Haha.

952
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,810
Are you doing well?

953
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,560
Where did you go?

954
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,080
I miss you.

955
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,420
Hello.

956
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,000
Bravo!

957
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,000
Come on!

958
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,300
That was the worst.

959
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,660
- For goodness' sake.
- That was the worst.

960
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,510
- There's "Come" or "Go".
- "Come" and "Go".

961
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,670
He will fall in the next round.

962
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,900
"Come" and "Go" both works.

963
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,710
Doesn't he have any ad-libs?

964
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,210
Let's see how well you do later.

965
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,670
Jae Suk was
slowly getting nervous...

966
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,410
as his turn was approaching.

967
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,720
- Doesn't he have any ad-libs?
- Doesn't he have any ad-libs?

968
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,690
- Hyojung. Pick a number.
- Yes?

969
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,990
- 5.
- 5.

970
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,120
- Suk Jin chose rope number five.
- Let's go.

971
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,090
1, 2, 3.

972
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,650
(It was a real rope.)

973
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,420
Okay. I like this angle.

974
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,000
I can't think of anything
since I am hanging like this.

975
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,360
Don't think too much.

976
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,890
Don't think of anything.

977
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,710
- What?
- I mean...

978
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,940
Why do you keep talking to me
in a casual way?

979
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,130
She wasn't talking to you.

980
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,440
- Why do you keep doing that?
- She wasn't talking to you.

981
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,140
Why are you attacking her
when she wasn't talking to you?

982
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,370
Don't hold grudges.

983
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,170
When did we agree
to talk to each other casually?

984
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,550
- Why do you keep doing that?
- I was talking to BewhY.

985
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,690
What did you say?

986
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,410
- BewhY.
- I was talking to BewhY.

987
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,580
Then why did you glare at me?

988
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,410
You are sticking out more.

989
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,650
Am I sticking out more?

990
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,650
Suk Jin.

991
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,260
- Focus on the game.
- Okay.

992
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,890
- Good luck.
- I am so nervous.

993
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,500
Which nickname
do you want to give to your lover?

994
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,620
BewhY.

995
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,240
I...

996
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,590
(BewhY fails to answer in time.)

997
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,400
- Hey!
- For goodness' sake.

998
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,510
He couldn't freestyle.

999
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,070
Why couldn't you answer?

1000
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,440
I tried to think of something.

1001
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,980
There is "Cute Baby".

1002
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,100
Is that the only thing on your mind?

1003
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,610
Come up with something else!

1004
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,950
- I don't need anything else.
- That's his only repertoire.

1005
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,290
It works perfectly.

1006
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,110
Jae Suk will play the game too,
right?

1007
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,290
On, my goodness.

1008
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,760
BewhY.

1009
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,580
- Just say what comes to your mind.
- Hey.

1010
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,150
Don't think too hard.

1011
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,350
Experience!

1012
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,620
No! Not experience!

1013
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,700
He should go with the flow.

1014
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,800
He should go with the flow.

1015
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,200
(Taken aback)

1016
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,360
Would you let me speak?

1017
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,970
Seriously.

1018
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,970
Go with the flow.

1019
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,630
- Let me speak, okay?
- Don't be like that, Jessi.

1020
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,900
She shut me down.

1021
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,340
I am absolutely sure
Jae Suk will get slapped today.

1022
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,170
- I am absolutely sure.
- I won't do that.

1023
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,950
Pick a number.

1024
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,840
(It's BewhY's turn to pick a rope.)

1025
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,910
Five.

1026
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,610
1, 2, 3.

1027
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,020
Okay.

1028
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,530
(After all that nagging,
BewhY picked a real rope.)

1029
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,130
What do you do first
when you go to the restroom?

1030
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,360
BewhY.

1031
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,420
I brush my teeth.

1032
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,000
- Mind the syllables!
- Mind the syllables!

1033
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,460
(BewhY gets eliminated
despite his team's guidance.)

1034
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,290
(Team Idol and Team Indie
get 1 point each.)

1035
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,440
That was incredible.

1036
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,500
In the last round, we'll play
until a winner is determined.

1037
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,400
Then the points
will be distributed accordingly.

1038
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,400
- Jae Suk.
- I will show you.

1039
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,610
Jae Suk, it'll be ridiculous...

1040
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,070
- if you do badly.
- Here comes the king of ad-libs.

1041
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,420
I'll show you how it's done.

1042
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,440
To play the game
against the king of ad-libs...

1043
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,250
Let's go!

1044
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,320
- Okay.
- This is the last round.

1045
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,860
- Let's go.
- The score is...

1046
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,790
Kwang Soo, watch me win.

1047
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,250
Jae Suk, show us what you can do.
Go up there.

1048
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,730
- I will do my best.
- The genius of ad-libs will play.

1049
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,360
- The emperor will play.
- Jae Suk, come on.

1050
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,920
- Come on.
- You can do it.

1051
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,790
- You can do it.
- Cute Baby, let's go!

1052
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,790
The national MC is the best!

1053
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,340
Which nickname
do you want to give to your lover?

1054
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,400
Jong Kook.

1055
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,440
(Jong Kook.)

1056
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,840
Cute Baby.

1057
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,340
(Caught by surprise)

1058
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,570
Hold on.

1059
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,820
Why did he steal that one?

1060
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,940
(Why did you steal that one?)

1061
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,380
(His only ad-lib was stolen
right before his eyes.)

1062
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,480
Oh, my goodness!

1063
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,590
- Cute Baby!
- Hold on.

1064
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,900
- Cute Baby.
- There are other nicknames!

1065
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,000
Right, there's My Baby.

1066
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,130
- My Baby.
- Okay.

1067
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,790
Your ad-libs are really limited.

1068
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,290
- Why didn't you say "Pretty Baby"?
- Let's start over.

1069
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,670
- Okay.
- For goodness' sake.

1070
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,110
- "Pretty Baby" would have worked.
- I only thought of "Cute Baby."

1071
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,860
("Cute Baby" couldn't help him.)

1072
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,070
This is just a game.
Don't be nervous.

1073
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,340
- All right.
- Okay?

1074
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,270
- 2.
- 2.

1075
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,570
- Good luck.
- Two.

1076
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,820
- He must be scared.
- Two.

1077
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,540
1, 2, 3.

1078
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,320
Okay.

1079
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,480
- Hang in there.
- Okay.

1080
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,380
Jae Suk. Don't talk too much.

1081
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,820
Cute Baby, let's go!

1082
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,920
Okay!

1083
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,590
(Ji Hyo came to lean forward
as well.)

1084
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,090
Which past of yours
do you want to hide?

1085
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,590
Jong Kook.

1086
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,840
Glasses in my Turbo days.

1087
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,460
Next.

1088
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,840
Grasshopper...

1089
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,270
Four syllables!

1090
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,440
Grasshopper...

1091
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,810
Four syllables!

1092
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,810
- You are driving me crazy!
- Good job.

1093
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,710
What is your problem?

1094
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,940
- Seriously.
- "Grasshopper..."

1095
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,520
(He would have done better
in his rookie days.)

1096
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,980
- How can we get him to ease up?
- What was that?

1097
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,290
I am a fan, but...

1098
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,290
- I am a fan too.
- This is too much.

1099
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,190
- I want to see you do well.
- Okay, okay.

1100
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,460
Just go down a syllable each time.

1101
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,750
Why are you so nervous?

1102
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
- I will survive.
- Make sure you do that.

1103
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,460
- 4 and 5 remain.
- Okay.

1104
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,170
What are you doing?

1105
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,290
- What are you doing?
- 4 and 5 remain.

1106
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,540
(Hanging)

1107
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,980
- His legs went weak.
- Hold on.

1108
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,570
- For goodness' sake.
- 4 and 5.

1109
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,610
Four.

1110
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,150
Jae Suk chose rope number four.

1111
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,650
1, 2, 3.

1112
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,090
Come on down.

1113
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,290
You looked like the biggest coward.

1114
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,860
- You are a coward.
- The biggest coward.

1115
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,920
For goodness' sake.

1116
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,360
He tried to step on the floor.

1117
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,820
Okay, okay. Okay.

1118
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,290
- This is your last chance.
- Jae Suk, this is the last chance.

1119
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,590
- Do as well as I did.
- I will show you.

1120
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,070
- I will bring you victory.
- Seriously.

1121
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,460
- Jae Suk.
- I will bring you victory.

1122
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,860
- I...
- Go back to your seat!

1123
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,810
I will survive.

1124
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,480
I will win 3,000 dollars.

1125
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,000
- The syllables go down by one.
- Jae Suk.

1126
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,500
- Okay.
- I did it too.

1127
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,380
What do you want to say to your ex?
Jong Kook.

1128
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,480
Are you well?

1129
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
Next.

1130
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,040
That's right. You...

1131
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,020
That's right. You...

1132
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,750
(That's right. I'm...)

1133
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,860
Hold on.

1134
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,420
I answered.

1135
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,190
- Why can't you do it?
- I answered.

1136
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,590
- For goodness' sake.
- I answered.

1137
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,630
"I miss you." How's that?

1138
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,920
- But...
- "I love you."

1139
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,440
"That's right. You..."

1140
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,270
It has an implicit meaning.

1141
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,340
(Jae Suk was
all talk and no action.)

1142
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,440
Bye.

1143
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,130
Doesn't it work?

1144
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,110
- Bye.
- 1, 2, 3.

1145
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,210
"That's right. You..." doesn't work?

1146
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,840
That's ridiculous.

1147
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,210
I am sorry.

1148
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,190
- He apologized.
- We won once, right?

1149
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,880
Name your favorite Korean celebrity.

1150
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,820
Sunwoo Yong Nyeo is the best.

1151
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,730
2, 3.

1152
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,980
Okay!

1153
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,400
(Ji Hyo is the 2nd
to get eliminated.)

1154
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,250
You won.

1155
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,770
"What do I do?"

1156
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,630
- "What do I do?"
- "What do I do?"

1157
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,270
- Okay.
- We are doing really well, right?

1158
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,360
The results
of the first mission are out.

1159
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,000
Team Idol placed 1st
and received 3,000 dollars.

1160
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,230
(Team Idol acquires 3,000 dollars.)

1161
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,900
Team Indie placed 2nd
and received 2,000 dollars.

1162
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,770
Team Hip-hop placed 3rd
and received 1,000 dollars.

1163
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,750
(Jae Suk was responsible
for the small amount of money.)

1164
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,820
It's still a lot.

1165
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,110
Now will come...

1166
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,480
the process which requires
psychological warfare,

1167
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,860
the division of the performance fee.

1168
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,790
The four team members
will secretly choose...

1169
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,360
whether they want to monopolize
the money...

1170
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,770
- or share it with the team.
- 3,000 dollars is a lot of money.

1171
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,090
Choose between the Monopoly Card
and Share Card...

1172
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,500
and reveal it on the table.

1173
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,630
If all members choose Share,

1174
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,440
the money will be quartered.

1175
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,150
If 3 members choose Share
and 1 member chooses Monopoly,

1176
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,570
one member will take all the money.

1177
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,380
If 1 member chooses Share
and 3 members choose Monopoly,

1178
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,290
the one member will take
a quarter of the money.

1179
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,650
- A quarter?
- Don't choose Monopoly.

1180
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,130
- What if everyone chooses Monopoly?
- The money disappears.

1181
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,190
- The money disappears?
- Yes.

1182
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,360
- What will you choose?
- Share, of course.

1183
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,560
- We will share.
- We will share.

1184
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,460
I won't betray my team.

1185
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,690
- Me neither.
- This is the first round.

1186
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,960
- This is the first round.
- Let's divide the money equally.

1187
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,500
You will have
the most amount of money.

1188
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,630
Everyone.

1189
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,940
Team Idol, sit down.

1190
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,270
- Okay.
- Okay.

1191
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,630
- You will share, right?
- Let's share the money.

1192
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,980
- I think you will backstab me.
- Let's share the money.

1193
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,540
- Let's all choose Share.
- Okay.

1194
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,210
Hyojung, I am the type to share.

1195
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,840
What will you do
if that doesn't happen?

1196
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,940
- I will be honest.
- I am the type to share.

1197
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,520
- Take responsibility.
- Jong Kook will choose Share.

1198
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,820
- I am the type to share.
- I will choose Share too.

1199
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,290
- You will choose Monopoly.
- I don't trust your eyes.

1200
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,790
No. I will choose Share too.

1201
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,060
- Let's bring our hands together.
- Let's go.

1202
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,920
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go.

1203
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,630
I know exactly which card to choose.

1204
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,270
Show your card
on the count of three.

1205
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,540
1, 2, 3.

1206
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,170
(Team Idol promised
to share the money equally.)

1207
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,130
(Will all the members choose Share?)

1208
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,880
1, 2, 3.

1209
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,650
(They reveal their cards.)

1210
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,520
(Suk Jin chose Monopoly.)

1211
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,840
For goodness' sake.

1212
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,250
Suk Jin will monopolize the money.

1213
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,090
What?

1214
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,320
He will take 3,000 dollars.

1215
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,460
(He changes his life
by monopolizing the money.)

1216
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,750
You guys are so naive!

1217
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,400
You guys are so naive!

1218
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,360
(Such is life.)

1219
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,690
I think this team will have
2 Share Cards and 2 Monopoly Cards.

1220
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,570
- No, no.
- Monopoly will win.

1221
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,690
No. Let's share the money.

1222
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,500
We made up our minds.
We have the best teamwork.

1223
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,540
You made up your mind, right?

1224
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,360
- Mapo-gu!
- Mapo-gu!

1225
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,170
- Choose Share.
- Of course.

1226
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,500
- Let's not be greedy.
- All right.

1227
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,540
Show your card
on the count of three.

1228
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,150
- 1, 2, 3.
- Share all the way!

1229
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,250
(Monopoly, Monopoly,
Share, Monopoly)

1230
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,820
(The three Running Man members
chose Monopoly.)

1231
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,190
- One Share.
- For goodness' sake.

1232
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,190
(For goodness' sake.)

1233
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,610
- What?
- Ji Young will get some money.

1234
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,920
- Ji Young, you got the money.
- For goodness' sake.

1235
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,690
(Ji Young acquires 500 dollars.)

1236
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,090
I can't believe you guys.

1237
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,290
- You guys are so small-minded.
- You guys play so dirty.

1238
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,730
Forget it.

1239
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,070
Ji Young, thank you.

1240
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,190
- For goodness' sake.
- I am glad you took the money.

1241
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,570
- I am glad.
- How did this happen?

1242
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,440
You said you will choose Share
no matter what.

1243
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,400
Come on.

1244
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,540
We will see them lose
all of the money.

1245
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,480
Let's choose a random card.

1246
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,670
- Let's say a few words each.
- Be quiet.

1247
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,920
- For goodness' sake.
- Choose a random card.

1248
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,520
Check the cards.

1249
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,150
Let's choose Monopoly.

1250
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,420
Monopoly?

1251
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,520
- Do I have the right cards?
- We should choose Share.

1252
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,560
- Let's choose Share.
- You understand, right?

1253
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,360
- We might lose all the money.
- Let's choose Share.

1254
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,400
(What?)

1255
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,630
Stay still!

1256
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,230
I already know what will happen.

1257
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,840
- Choose a card without looking.
- He is trying to trick us.

1258
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,000
You have two Monopoly Cards.

1259
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,960
- See?
- You little...

1260
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,570
Kwang Soo will betray us.

1261
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,710
- I have two Share Cards.
- I am sorry.

1262
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,710
(1 minute ago)

1263
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
(Kwang Soo checked BewhY's cards...)

1264
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,750
(and switched one with his.)

1265
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,440
(Pretending to be calm)

1266
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,380
- I am sorry.
- BewhY.

1267
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,960
- Okay.
- Monopoly.

1268
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,650
This is like "Tazza: One-Eyed Jack."

1269
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,480
I simply tested BewhY.
Okay, you passed.

1270
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,690
- What?
- I am serious.

1271
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,460
- Both of them...
- Kwang Soo is so petty.

1272
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,170
- We placed last.
- Share the money.

1273
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,590
- Jessi, choose Share.
- Me?

1274
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,540
This is not comfortable.

1275
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,900
Comfortable?

1276
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,210
What?

1277
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,900
- This is not a competition.
- You mean "Competition."

1278
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,340
- It's "Competition."
- "Competition".

1279
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,250
What are you doing?

1280
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,380
You are so embarrassing.

1281
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,880
I am disappointed in you, Kwang Soo.

1282
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,610
- How embarrassing?
- Weren't you trying to be funny?

1283
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,540
If you are ignorant,
just don't say anything.

1284
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,750
Did he say,
"This is not comfortable"?

1285
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,790
Well...

1286
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,980
That's not important, Jessi.

1287
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,730
Okay?

1288
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,920
Just pay attention
to what's important.

1289
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,360
Why do you butt into every matter?

1290
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,020
(Wow.)

1291
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,230
I am going.

1292
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,040
Where are you going?

1293
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,070
You made up your mind, right?

1294
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,040
- We will see 4 Monopoly.
- 1...

1295
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,730
1, 2, 3.

1296
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,730
(What will be the result?)

1297
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,840
Monopoly... Share.

1298
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,940
- What?
- What?

1299
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,310
Only Jessi wins.

1300
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,770
(Jessi chooses Share alone
and acquires 250 dollars.)

1301
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,290
- Does that mean...
- Only you acquired the money.

1302
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,020
(She cheers belatedly.)

1303
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,060
(Everyone else chose Monopoly
and failed.)

1304
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,320
Jessi is pure.

1305
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,980
- She acquired a quarter of it.
- You liar!

1306
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,130
She is nice.

1307
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,560
"You liar"?

1308
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,150
Me?

1309
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,730
What did I do to be called a liar?

1310
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,520
(Current Rankings)

1311
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,900
Okay. This is good.

1312
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,540
Jjamppong and tangsuyuk.

1313
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,270
(They board the bus
for lunch and the next mission.)

1314
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,500
- Where should we sit?
- I think we can take any seat.

1315
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,540
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1316
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,070
- Do we sit with the team?
- I don't want to do that.

1317
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,610
- Sit with the team.
- No!

1318
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,650
Okay.

1319
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,980
I don't want to sit
next to Jae Suk.

1320
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,880
He gives off bad energy.

1321
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:36,980
Seriously.

1322
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,190
(BewhY prepares a seat.)

1323
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,360
Oh, no!
Will Jae Suk sit next to me?

1324
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,630
Oh, no!

1325
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,290
Kwang Soo, please sit here.

1326
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,420
- Oh, my goodness. No, no.
- What?

1327
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,090
(She hates it.)

1328
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,440
Please, BewhY. No, no.

1329
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,230
- What is up with her?
- Is your butt wet?

1330
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,440
What?

1331
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:57,480
It's because he was nervous earlier.

1332
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,570
Don't say anything.

1333
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,110
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness. Seriously.

1334
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,320
(They sit together
and move to the next location.)

1335
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,710
Where are we going?

1336
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,840
We will go and eat lunch.

1337
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,420
BewhY, did you lose weight?

1338
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,290
That came out of nowhere.

1339
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,290
(What was that?)

1340
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,630
- What do you know?
- Seriously.

1341
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,230
- What do you know about BewhY?
- What was that?

1342
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,290
Stay quiet
if you have nothing to say.

1343
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,020
- I think so.
- What is wrong with you?

1344
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,520
- You lost weight, right?
- I think so.

1345
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,130
I am a fan of BewhY.

1346
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,670
Which song of his do you like?

1347
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,130
- If you are a fan, name 3 songs.
- 3 songs?

1348
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,810
- He hasn't released three songs.
- What are you talking about?

1349
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:30,270
(Brazen)

1350
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,070
(What?)

1351
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,940
- He has released so many songs.
- What are you talking about?

1352
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,170
I was joking.

1353
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,920
Jessi, what do you like to eat?

1354
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,590
- Me? Fish.
- Yes.

1355
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,480
- Really?
- Kimchi stew, doenjang stew...

1356
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,880
Ji Young, what do you like to eat?

1357
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,630
- Me?
- Yes.

1358
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,520
There isn't anything I like.

1359
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,860
You failed.

1360
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,590
- Jae Suk, you failed.
- You failed.

1361
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,440
- Make something up.
- Jae Suk.

1362
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,710
You became flustered.

1363
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,400
Jae Suk, you can save
this interview.

1364
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,270
- Come on.
- This interview is going terribly.

1365
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,610
- Ji Young.
- You can do it!

1366
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,340
Cute Baby, let's go!

1367
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,320
- Ji Young.
- Yes?

1368
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,270
- This is his second attempt.
- You can do it!

1369
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,690
What do you usually do
in your free time?

1370
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,520
I stay home.

1371
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,590
(The national MC gets knocked out!)

1372
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,320
- The interview failed.
- The interview failed.

1373
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,860
Cute Baby, let's go!

1374
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,090
- Jae Suk, you can do it!
- Let's go!

1375
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,590
- Ji Young is incredible.
- Let's go!

1376
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,670
Ji Young is incredible.

1377
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,690
BewhY, how about you?

1378
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,170
Ask BewhY too.

1379
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:35,670
I was about to do that.

1380
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,980
- Jessi, wait. Come on!
- Oh, my.

1381
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,150
Come on!

1382
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,980
- Okay.
- BewhY.

1383
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,840
- What do I want to do?
- That's right.

1384
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,090
What do you want to do the most
these days?

1385
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,790
I want to give a concert.

1386
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,520
That's right.

1387
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,090
- My answer is the same.
- It's so true.

1388
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,290
- You are cool.
- You are cool, BewhY.

1389
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,130
Did you lose weight because
you didn't have any concerts?

1390
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,020
- What?
- Stop talking about his weight!

1391
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,690
- Stop it!
- That's completely unrelated.

1392
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,960
- He lost weight.
- For goodness' sake.

1393
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,000
(He keeps pestering BewhY.)

1394
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,270
You are the worst.

1395
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,340
Stop pestering him.

1396
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,730
Hey, you lost weight.

1397
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,230
Did you lose weight or not?
Hurry up and tell me.

1398
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,310
- You lost weight, right?
- Yes, I did.

1399
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,710
- You lost more than 3kg.
- Stop it.

1400
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,270
We will lose viewers
because of you. Stop it.

1401
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,840
Stop it.

1402
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,020
He said we'll lose viewers.

1403
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,880
I really want to perform,

1404
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,090
- That's right.
- My body feels itchy.

1405
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,520
- Seriously.
- You can't perform.

1406
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,520
I do it alone at home.

1407
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,820
Do you practice at home?

1408
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,360
- I don't practice.
- You give a concert.

1409
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,130
You guys can't communicate.

1410
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:34,400
This has been going on
the entire day.

1411
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,730
I really can't communicate
with Jessi.

1412
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,500
- Stop trying.
- But...

1413
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,170
Jessi speaks in a strange way,

1414
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,940
but you are terrible
at understanding.

1415
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,110
- We can't communicate.
- They don't get along.

1416
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,610
We don't get along.

1417
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,650
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1418
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,340
Try another interview with Ji Young.
I want to see you succeed.

1419
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,340
Okay.

1420
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,790
- Ji Young.
- Yes?

1421
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,040
What's your dream?

1422
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,380
My dream?

1423
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,920
(It's the national MC's
secret weapon.)

1424
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,860
- I am not sure.
- "I am not sure."

1425
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,020
(He gets knocked out
for the 3rd time!)

1426
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,190
- He failed.
- He failed.

1427
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,020
Cute Baby, let's go!

1428
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,090
(Cute Baby is
in the worst condition.)

1429
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,170
- He failed for the third time.
- Ji Young is impenetrable.

1430
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,900
She knocked him out
three times in a row.

1431
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,440
Maybe she doesn't have a dream.

1432
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,110
- Everyone has a dream.
- What's yours?

1433
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,340
- Me?
- What's yours?

1434
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,230
I have so many dreams.

1435
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,480
- I didn't ask.
- What are they?

1436
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,440
- Jee Seok asked.
- Jee Seok!

1437
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,480
His name is Suk Jin.

1438
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,020
Suk Jin.

1439
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,540
(Her brain is muddled.)

1440
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,460
- She got some of it right.
- It's okay.

1441
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,960
- He is Ji Suk Jin.
- I understand.

1442
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,520
- It could be a pet name.
- I am so sorry.

1443
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,820
It could be a pet name.

1444
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,250
- Yu Jae.
- Gosh,

1445
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,920
- I mixed up the two names.
- Yu Jae.

1446
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,130
- Yu Jae.
- It's okay.

1447
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,170
(Thanks to Jee Seok,
the atmosphere is friendly.)

1448
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,590
Jessi, you should treat us today.

1449
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,000
What do you mean?

1450
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
- Pay for lunch.
- We are going to eat separately.

1451
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:49,070
- Isn't that right?
- You should decide...

1452
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,440
which member will pay
with the mission fund...

1453
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,840
- for the meal.
- Really?

1454
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,150
Decide on a member.

1455
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,150
- What?
- One member?

1456
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,610
Suk Jin, you should pay.

1457
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,940
- How much will it be?
- He should pay,

1458
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,940
- right?
- That's right.

1459
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,380
You should pay.

1460
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,520
Suk Jin should pay.

1461
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,150
If each guest says
something nice to me,

1462
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,020
I will pick up the tab.

1463
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,150
Say a few words.

1464
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,920
Suk Jin, you have a big heart.

1465
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,130
- Okay.
- Okay.

1466
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:12,190
I almost spoke casually
to you as soon as I met you.

1467
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,500
Why? Did he seem easy?

1468
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,520
No, no.

1469
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,670
(Did he seem easy?)

1470
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,210
- He looks young.
- Was that the reason?

1471
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,210
- Yes. He looks young.
- Oh, yes!

1472
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,000
- Are you sure he didn't seem easy?
- That sounds so fake.

1473
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,250
- My compliment was sincere.
- Are you sure?

1474
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,750
- You thought you looked stronger.
- That's right.

1475
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,040
Wasn't that the reason?

1476
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,340
I will pick up the tab.

1477
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,380
- Okay.
- I am the only one who can do that.

1478
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:34,790
I have 3,800 dollars.

1479
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,750
2,000 dollars will be deducted
for the food.

1480
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,880
(Does the food cost 2,000 dollars?)

1481
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,020
- Nice!
- Oh, yes!

1482
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,500
This is great.

1483
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,900
Good job!

1484
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,230
- Oh, yes!
- 2,000 dollars!

1485
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,590
2,000 dollars?

1486
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,170
- 300 dollars should be enough.
- Come on!

1487
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,810
Suk Jin is generous.

1488
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,770
He is flexing so much.

1489
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,940
For goodness' sake.

1490
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,210
- Paints.
- Look at those paints.

1491
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,750
We will have the paint show.

1492
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,170
There are various colors.

1493
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,020
You will have the final race
after this mission.

1494
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,980
The mission is
the King of Performances.

1495
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,820
- What is that?
- The King of Performances.

1496
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,060
Two teams will take turns...

1497
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,460
to have three rounds
of a dodgeball match.

1498
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,500
Dodgeball?

1499
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,360
The 1st to 3rd places
will be decided by the points won.

1500
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,190
Two teams will standby
at the waiting place on each side.

1501
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:25,070
When the whistle sounds,
each team will carry a big banner...

1502
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,400
and move to the attack zone.

1503
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,730
Eliminate the opponents...

1504
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,980
by dipping the balls in paint
and hitting their bodies with them.

1505
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,880
We need to dip the balls in paint.

1506
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,880
In short, it's a dodgeball
with six balls.

1507
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,520
One member in each team
and use the banner as a shield.

1508
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:38,340
One member.

1509
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,340
You are out
if you get hit by a ball.

1510
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,150
The game ends
when all the opponents are out.

1511
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,060
The first match is
between Team Hip-hop and Team Indie.

1512
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,060
- Okay.
- Okay.

1513
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,020
- We will win.
- It's better to see them.

1514
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,320
Otherwise, it will be confusing.

1515
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,560
This is unrelated to quick wits,
so Jae Suk will be good at it.

1516
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,900
- Really?
- I like hip-hop.

1517
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,040
- Are you ready to tear them apart?
- Yes.

1518
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,570
- Are you ready?
- Mapo-gu.

1519
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,360
- Okay.
- Let's begin. Get ready.

1520
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
(The 1st round starts.)

1521
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,610
Run! Run!

1522
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,730
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo
defend the team.)

1523
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,270
(The others get ready
to throw the balls.)

1524
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,500
This is cold.

1525
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,050
(We divide the beats.)

1526
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,070
Throw!

1527
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,570
(Jessi launches her first attack.)

1528
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:18,660
- How dare you?
- Throw!

1529
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,800
(How dare you? Jessi.)

1530
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,760
Jessi. I'm going after you.

1531
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,430
(He counterattacks
with a blazing throw.)

1532
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,430
He blocked it.

1533
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,240
(He accidentally blocks.)

1534
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:30,870
Give me the ball back.

1535
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:32,950
- Behind you.
- Hey.

1536
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:36,140
(He hits Jessi.)

1537
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,950
- Jessi is out.
- Jessi is out.

1538
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,820
I'm not!

1539
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,660
Why is Jessi out already?

1540
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,930
- Jessi is out.
- I'm not.

1541
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,660
- Hold on.
- Time out.

1542
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,800
Jessi is out,

1543
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,530
- but she's refusing to go out.
- Wait.

1544
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,030
(She keeps on pretending
she doesn't know the rules.)

1545
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,260
Wait, when did I get hit?

1546
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,930
- What happened, Jessi?
- I have something to say.

1547
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,340
- Oh, gosh.
- You're out, Jessi.

1548
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,260
- Please step out.
- Go out before I hit you again.

1549
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,370
- Move forward.
- We should move forward too.

1550
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,680
Move forward.

1551
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,430
I missed.

1552
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,740
(Gosh, I missed...)

1553
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,300
He can't even play dodge ball.

1554
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,450
- Give me the ball.
- Why did you throw it on the floor?

1555
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:07,470
(What game is he good at?)

1556
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,740
What's wrong with him?

1557
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,740
(This is our chance!)

1558
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:11,120
What's wrong with him?

1559
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,950
(Kwang Soo is out.)

1560
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:13,950
Over there.

1561
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,090
Kwang Soo is out.

1562
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,530
Kwang Soo.

1563
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:17,530
(Kwang Soo is out,
but why are they all laughing?)

1564
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,050
- Why?
- Don't be mistaken.

1565
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,530
- Why?
- What's wrong?

1566
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,160
It's not what it looks like.

1567
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,370
(It's a good spot to be mistaken.)

1568
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:30,910
He used me as a shield.

1569
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,180
- I know.
- I was trying to go that way.

1570
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,510
(He used Kwang Soo as a shield.)

1571
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,950
Good job.

1572
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,550
Kwang Soo, you were supposed to
hit the head.

1573
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,680
Don't do that.

1574
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,010
(How dare you hit Kwang Soo?)

1575
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,010
(He hits the same spot.)

1576
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,010
Hey!

1577
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:47,510
Haha is out!

1578
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,390
- Haha is out.
- Haha is out.

1579
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:50,620
- Now!
- Take a ball.

1580
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,760
- Take a ball now.
- Come on!

1581
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:53,990
Go, Ji Young.

1582
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,760
- Take a ball now.
- Come on.

1583
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,760
(She advances with two balls.)

1584
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,660
(What?)

1585
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,570
(I'm very angry!)

1586
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,610
(Flinging)

1587
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,030
- What are you doing?
- What is she doing?

1588
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,570
- Ji Young.
- What are you doing?

1589
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,240
Ji Hyo,
you should attack for Ji Young.

1590
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,340
- You should.
- Go.

1591
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,780
You need to get both.

1592
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,050
(She's been playing games
for 10 years as Running Man ace!)

1593
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,550
(She played all kinds of ball games.
How will she attack?)

1594
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,680
You need to get both.

1595
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,320
(Tossing)

1596
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,720
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

1597
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,120
(Her throwing skill
regressed by 10 years.)

1598
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,430
- Catch it.
- I mean...

1599
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,700
She went out.

1600
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,470
No!

1601
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:32,160
(They're killed at the same time.)

1602
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,970
(We won!)

1603
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,030
- Good work. That was two in a row.
- Yes!

1604
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,870
- Okay.
- Okay!

1605
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,550
Round two is
Team Idol versus Team Indie.

1606
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,550
That team has the advantage.

1607
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,910
Ready...

1608
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:46,950
I'm scared.

1609
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,490
(Round 2 starts.)

1610
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:52,910
(At the whistle, Team Indie...)

1611
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,050
(secures the balls first.)

1612
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,860
Already? You have to wet it first.

1613
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,050
- Hey, hey.
- Take the ball.

1614
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,220
- Good one.
- Take the ball.

1615
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,590
(Heel-kick pass)

1616
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,390
- Good one.
- Good job, Hyojung.

1617
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,430
Take the ball.

1618
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,160
Try hitting us!

1619
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,240
(Try hitting us!)

1620
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,110
- Good block.
- Seriously.

1621
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,470
What do you think
you're doing, Se Chan?

1622
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,280
(Se Chan the laundry machine is
working at full speed.)

1623
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,320
- Hurry up.
- You have to dodge.

1624
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,890
(Thump)

1625
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:24,950
No!

1626
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,160
(She keeps on blocking.)

1627
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,030
- Good one.
- No!

1628
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,930
(He was watching in the corner.)

1629
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,820
- Good one.
- Hey.

1630
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,370
- You're out.
- Ji Hyo is out.

1631
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:37,530
Let go.

1632
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,660
Haha is out.

1633
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,340
- You're out.
- You're out.

1634
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,470
(It passed Suk Jin...)

1635
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,970
(and hit Kwang Soo.)

1636
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,700
- You're out.
- You got him.

1637
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,640
What's wrong? What's the matter?

1638
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,550
- Kwang Soo, hold on.
- What's the matter?

1639
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,300
- Hold on.
- That's all right.

1640
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,320
- What happened?
- Move back.

1641
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,140
- He's acting.
- Move back.

1642
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,140
(Squirming)

1643
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,510
- What's wrong with him?
- Why do you keep getting hit there?

1644
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,950
- Hey, hey.
- In the groin.

1645
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,320
Why do you... I mean.

1646
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,550
Give me a ball. Quick.

1647
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,990
- Hey, hey.
- Stop it.

1648
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,360
- It's 3 on 2. You never know.
- Let's win.

1649
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,890
You never know. Anything can happen.

1650
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,160
- I'm scared!
- No, don't be afraid.

1651
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,570
(Faking)

1652
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:13,970
Go, go. Attack!

1653
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,700
- Hey!
- Come here.

1654
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,430
(Team Idol takes possession
and attacks.)

1655
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,870
- Okay, you blocked it.
- I blocked it.

1656
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,140
- Block it.
- I blocked it.

1657
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:21,680
Hold on.

1658
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,740
Go for it!

1659
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,740
(Hyojung is an iron wall defense.)

1660
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,050
I blocked it!

1661
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,910
(Jong Kook and Se Chan's competition
is fueled by Hyojung's sacrifice.)

1662
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,120
(Se Chan's blazing throw)

1663
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,930
Okay, Jong Kook is out.

1664
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,720
I should have done that earlier.

1665
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,950
(Se Chan's blazing throw)

1666
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:42,970
Come on!

1667
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,470
- Come on!
- I was going to throw.

1668
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:45,700
- I know.
- Come on!

1669
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,390
- It's okay.
- Come on!

1670
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:48,970
Hide behind me.

1671
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:50,870
Hyojung.

1672
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,610
(Rate of successful defense is
100 percent.)

1673
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,740
Good job!

1674
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,010
Throw it!

1675
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,050
- Good job!
- What's with her?

1676
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,140
Good job, Hyojung.

1677
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,780
- Go forward.
- She blocks everything.

1678
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,050
Good job, Hyojung.

1679
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,510
(He gathers his energy...)

1680
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,950
(and attacks again.)

1681
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,450
Hey.

1682
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,950
She got hit.

1683
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,300
- Hyojung is out.
- I'm sorry.

1684
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:13,990
I'm sorry, Hyojung.

1685
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,530
- Hyojung.
- It went through her shield.

1686
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,490
- Ji Young.
- Run away!

1687
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:19,870
- Get him.
- Okay!

1688
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,410
(Great job, Se Chan.)

1689
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:23,610
We won.

1690
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,300
- Goodness.
- We...

1691
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,340
(After playing another round,
here are the results.)

1692
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,110
1st place is Team Idol, 2nd place is
Team Hip-hop, and 3rd is Team Indie.

1693
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,370
Are we doing that again?

1694
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,680
We're doing this again?

1695
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,640
First place is Team Idol,
so you can go first.

1696
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,640
Please.

1697
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,050
- Be honest.
- Let us raise our ranks.

1698
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,590
- I know.
- Let's...

1699
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,760
- do it this time.
- But look.

1700
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,950
- Gosh.
- If I...

1701
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,360
take 3,000 dollars...

1702
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,220
You'll increase by a lot after this.

1703
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,660
You're first place already,
so if you get more greedy,

1704
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,800
you're a son of a gun.

1705
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,930
(Why are you being so greedy?)

1706
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,260
- You're first place right now.
- Hey.

1707
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,660
I'm first place right now, so think
about it. Will I take all?

1708
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,470
- I know.
- You have to promise me then.

1709
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,430
- Let's share.
- Of course, we'll share.

1710
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:00,530
Pick Share.

1711
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,530
- Okay, I'll pick Share.
- Share.

1712
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,010
- Did you make up your minds?
- Yes.

1713
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,110
1, 2...

1714
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:07,140
(What is Team Idol's result?)

1715
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,240
Three.

1716
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,280
Three.

1717
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,390
(Monopoly again?)

1718
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,120
- It's Monopoly.
- Suk Jin.

1719
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,550
He's the worst.

1720
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,430
(He fooled them again.)

1721
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,220
(Let me get some air.)

1722
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,370
You're incredible.

1723
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,660
- I know.
- Suk Jin!

1724
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,030
How could you pick Monopoly
for the second time?

1725
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:31,070
I'm sorry, guys.
I picked the wrong card.

1726
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,610
- That was my bad.
- Hey.

1727
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:33,740
(He tries to make up for it, but
their team is about to dissolve.)

1728
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,610
I can hear people cursing at him.

1729
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,470
- Suk Jin, that was cool.
- Two times was cool.

1730
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,470
I mean it.

1731
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:40,050
- I didn't think he'd do it again.
- I'm sorry.

1732
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,550
Suk Jin earned 3,000 dollars.

1733
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,220
That was a mistake.

1734
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,050
Team Hip-hop is next.

1735
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,120
So that means...

1736
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,160
If we pick Share,

1737
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,550
- we can all have it.
- Same amount.

1738
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:50,860
- I know.
- There's that face again.

1739
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,030
Look at Kwang Soo's face.
He has that face.

1740
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,550
(It looks like the face right before
he's about to cheat.)

1741
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,570
Look at that.

1742
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,030
- I'm serious.
- Look at him.

1743
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,470
- Why are you laughing?
- No,

1744
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:59,870
- I swore.
- I know.

1745
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:02,240
- One...
- Kwang Soo is picking Monopoly.

1746
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,470
Kwang Soo is picking Monopoly.

1747
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:04,470
Two,

1748
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,700
- three.
- Share or not?

1749
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,700
It's gone.

1750
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,180
(Only BewhY picked Share.)

1751
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,550
Okay!

1752
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:12,050
BewhY earns a quarter of the amount.

1753
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,620
- Forever, BewhY.
- Yes.

1754
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,740
- BewhY took it again.
- Only BewhY took it.

1755
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,050
BewhY took it?

1756
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:19,160
Four of us have high ranks.

1757
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,050
- True.
- Correct.

1758
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,860
So we should pick Share
and take 250 dollars.

1759
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,280
I agree.

1760
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,430
Please.

1761
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:29,200
All three teams said the same thing.

1762
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:31,320
250 dollars is good enough for me.

1763
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,300
- My gosh.
- Please.

1764
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,530
Ji Young,
will you pick Share or Monopoly?

1765
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,740
Monopoly.

1766
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,780
(Monopoly.)

1767
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,680
(She makes a shy confession.)

1768
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,340
- What?
- We should pick Share.

1769
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,740
- She's too honest.
- We talked about this.

1770
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,140
- I was simply asking a question,
- Ji Young.

1771
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,070
but I got chills
hearing her response.

1772
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,570
She's going to pick Monopoly?

1773
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:49,950
(Touching)

1774
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,590
- Nothing happened.
- Stop it.

1775
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,780
(You didn't get chills.)

1776
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,280
Come on.

1777
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,760
- Nothing happened.
- My gosh.

1778
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,550
Why are you doing this to me?

1779
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,450
I got chills,

1780
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,970
and she said, "Nothing happened."

1781
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,740
Nobody told you to tell them.

1782
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,470
What's wrong with her?

1783
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:09,610
(She was laughing...)

1784
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,340
(and spilled paint.)

1785
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:14,070
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

1786
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,640
Don't do this. Come on!

1787
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,410
Don't move. Their team is playing.

1788
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,120
- But I...
- Have you made up your minds?

1789
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,950
Wait. There's a cheater
on this team.

1790
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,450
- What do you mean?
- Somebody took my Monopoly Card.

1791
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,120
Who is it? Seriously, tell me.

1792
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,320
- It's not me.
- Let me see.

1793
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,050
- Who is it?
- It's not me.

1794
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:31,950
- Hey!
- Ji Young!

1795
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:32,950
(Is it Ji Young then?)

1796
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,050
Is it you?

1797
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,760
- What is the matter with her?
- It's not me.

1798
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,470
- It's not me.
- What do you mean?

1799
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,660
- What do you mean?
- It has to be you.

1800
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,140
- Hey.
- She's weird.

1801
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,030
- What's this?
- I was wondering who it was.

1802
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:43,030
(It was BOL4!)

1803
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:45,110
(Exactly 1 minute ago...)

1804
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,030
(She was innocently looking
at the cards.)

1805
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,470
(Sliding)

1806
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,110
(This is her first variety show,)

1807
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,280
(and she already learned
a bad habit.)

1808
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,010
Ji Young,
why are you being like this?

1809
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,390
Show your cards.

1810
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,010
See? Okay.

1811
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,180
- I trust you.
- All right.

1812
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,180
- Let's share it.
- One.

1813
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,660
- Let's do this.
- Two.

1814
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,160
- I hope everyone picks Monopoly.
- Let's do this.

1815
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,320
Three.

1816
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,450
Let's go.

1817
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,700
- Show us your cards.
- Share?

1818
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:10,030
Hey.

1819
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:11,970
(Ji Hyo is the only one
who picked Monopoly.)

1820
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,370
Ji Hyo picked Monopoly.

1821
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,870
She picked Monopoly.

1822
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:16,470
- No way.
- She picked Monopoly?

1823
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,700
Ji Hyo wins 1,000 dollars.

1824
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,970
- Unbelievable.
- Thank you.

1825
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,200
- I'm shocked. She fooled us.
- You promised us.

1826
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,300
But I...

1827
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,450
Haha.

1828
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:27,370
- You did a good job.
- Come on.

1829
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,410
- Please don't be angry.
- I'm not.

1830
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,780
Can't Suk Jin go home?

1831
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,620
He looks so uncomfortable.

1832
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,820
Do you want to go home?

1833
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,930
- It's okay.
- I'll talk to the staff.

1834
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:37,620
- This is life.
- This is life?

1835
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,620
Next week, we'll laugh together.

1836
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:40,860
What are you talking about?

1837
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,660
Once Jong Kook gets angry...

1838
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,890
He's not like that.

1839
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:45,300
He's not like that. You cutie.

1840
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,390
He's not like that. You cutie.

1841
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,680
(Suk Jin gets far away
from the cutie.)

1842
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,640
Jong Kook is not like that.

1843
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,070
(I should try to think of
something good.)

1844
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,140
It's okay. He's not like that.

1845
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,720
- What was that?
- That was the worst.

1846
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,220
He's worried Jong Kook will hit him.

1847
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,120
He's not like that.

1848
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,050
(With everyone happy,
Round 2 is over.)

1849
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:08,510
It's time to carry out
the final mission.

1850
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,160
You'll be given 30 minutes,

1851
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,050
and this is your last chance
to win additional money.

1852
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,930
It's called The Last Festival.

1853
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:15,990
(The Last Festival)

1854
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,990
This mission is important.

1855
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,530
You never know until it's over.

1856
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,870
Nine of you, who are not captains,

1857
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:24,470
- will play Name Tag Elimination.
- Name Tag Elimination?

1858
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,180
Once you rip off someone's name tag,

1859
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,530
bring it to the captain's room.

1860
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:32,910
There, you'll divide the money
between you and your captain.

1861
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,970
One name tag is worth 500 dollars.

1862
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,140
(The eliminated one
loses 100 dollars.)

1863
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,220
You'll play the Share
and Monopoly Cards,

1864
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,220
and the money will be divided
between you and the captain...

1865
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,430
- according to the result.
- Yes!

1866
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,820
When the 30 minutes is up, the 3
members with the most money win,

1867
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:48,530
and the two members with
the least money will be penalized.

1868
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,160
Please move
to your starting positions.

1869
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:52,490
Okay.

1870
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:56,530
(The Current Amounts)

1871
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,740
I'll rip off all name tags.

1872
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,010
I'm at the bottom right now.

1873
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:01,680
(Jin Hyuk is
in a desperate situation.)

1874
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,300
Since I'm on Running Man,

1875
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,200
I want to experience it.

1876
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,340
I want to rip off
as many name tags as I can.

1877
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,950
These shoes are slippery.

1878
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,390
What? What was that?

1879
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:14,620
- Did your shoelaces hurt so much?
- Who is it?

1880
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,930
(Se Chan copies Jessi.)

1881
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:19,120
Then change your shoes.

1882
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,320
- Who is it?
- Who do you think?

1883
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,820
I'm just a guy.

1884
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:24,820
- It's me.
- Gosh.

1885
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,260
Hurry up and lace up your shoes.

1886
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:28,300
What is he doing here?

1887
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:30,610
This is my starting position.

1888
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,970
As soon as the race starts,
I'll rip off your name tag.

1889
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,180
I don't think so.

1890
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:38,140
1, 2, 3.

1891
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,010
Are we playing...

1892
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:42,450
the Share and Monopoly Cards
here too?

1893
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,090
- Suk Jin.
- Should I stick to my strategy?

1894
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,410
If you ask me,

1895
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,280
- you're already on the train.
- Right?

1896
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:51,620
- I can't change my mind here.
- You're already on the train.

1897
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:53,360
Just get punched once,
and that'll be it.

1898
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,430
Seriously.

1899
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,160
It'd be weird to stop here.

1900
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,700
(Suk Jin is experiencing
an inner conflict.)

1901
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,700
(The countdown begins.)

1902
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,030
3, 2, 1.

1903
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,640
The race starts.

1904
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,240
The race starts.

1905
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:09,070
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1906
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:10,510
Come here for a second.

1907
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,740
Jessi.

1908
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,140
Let's make a plan.

1909
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:15,240
How much do you have?

1910
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,280
I have more than you.

1911
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,360
Did you have to say it like that?
"I have more than you."

1912
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,860
Why did you...

1913
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,680
Gosh, I can't believe her.

1914
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:26,860
(Hurry up!)

1915
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:27,860
- Is someone there?
- No.

1916
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,070
Let's make a plan.

1917
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:32,070
I'll protect you to the end.

1918
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,640
(You'll protect me?)

1919
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,640
- You're lying.
- I promise.

1920
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:40,140
Fine, I'm leaving.

1921
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,240
Bye.

1922
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,240
(Inner conflict)

1923
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,410
Come with me, Jae Suk.

1924
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,870
- All right.
- I won't rip off your name tag.

1925
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:47,910
Do you promise?

1926
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,720
Are the microphones
in some kind of room?

1927
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:53,410
(Some members are
looking for microphones.)

1928
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:54,950
Microphones.

1929
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:57,180
(Why are these two
looking for microphones?)

1930
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,820
For those who don't feel confident
about Name Tag Elimination,

1931
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,430
we've hidden a few
Bluetooth microphones...

1932
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:05,120
here and there
so you can perform alone.

1933
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,590
If you find a microphone...

1934
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:10,570
and sing for a minute
without getting caught by anyone,

1935
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:13,180
you can get the name tag
of a person you choose.

1936
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:14,240
Really?

1937
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:19,070
(That way, you can win 500 dollars
without ripping off any name tag.)

1938
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,140
(Where are the microphones?)

1939
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,410
(Ji Young is looking for
a microphone too.)

1940
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,450
(She finds one.)

1941
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:31,030
My heart is pounding.

1942
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:33,890
I want to hide somewhere.

1943
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:38,220
(She is looking for a safe place
where no one will find her.)

1944
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,570
(Excited)

1945
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:45,470
I'll sing "Some" by BOL4.

1946
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,140
(She starts singing
while hiding in the corner.)

1947
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,950
(Being careful)

1948
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,780
(The singer doesn't want
anyone to come to her concert.)

1949
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,010
(She gets startled
in the middle of dancing.)

1950
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,390
(While Ji Young is singing
carefully,)

1951
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:06,030
(Jae Suk and Jessi appear.)

1952
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,300
- What was her name again?
- Hyojung.

1953
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,160
- She's scary too.
- No.

1954
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:11,160
I met her in the elevator earlier.

1955
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:16,370
(The concert is nearing its climax.)

1956
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,030
- Ji Young?
- Ji Young.

1957
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,970
(And there are two people
getting close to the singer.)

1958
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,780
(Please don't come near me.)

1959
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:23,050
In my opinion...

1960
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:25,300
(The uninvited audience
is approaching.)

1961
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,840
We can't go on like this.

1962
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:32,320
(Ji Young is
just around the corner.)

1963
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,360
(Will Ji Young manage to sing
for a minute?)

1964
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:38,950
- I know.
- Can you walk in front of me?

1965
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,760
(Jessi doesn't trust Jae Suk.)

1966
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,370
I'm tying my hair up,

1967
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:45,430
- and I can't relax.
- You can relax.

1968
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:49,370
(Ji Young has sung for a minute.)

1969
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:50,800
(Happy)

1970
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,970
- We should trust each other.
- No.

1971
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:57,140
You've disappointed me
so many times today.

1972
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,640
(Startled)

1973
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,720
I'm just...

1974
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,510
- I'm just...
- Stop.

1975
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,910
She's over there.

1976
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,410
(Jessi finds Ji Young.)

1977
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:08,860
She's over there. Let's go.

1978
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:10,160
Who?

1979
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:11,760
Ji Young?

1980
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,530
Please. I'm scared.

1981
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:16,470
(Jessi charges at Ji Young.)

1982
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:17,620
Gosh, this is scary.

1983
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,720
Hey!

1984
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,490
- She's over there!
- Jessi!

1985
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:23,070
(Just then)

1986
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:25,160
(Jae Suk blocks her way.)

1987
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,030
Jae Suk. Wait!

1988
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:29,140
(Ji Young is blocked on both sides.)

1989
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,570
- Ahn Ji Young.
- Wait!

1990
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:31,740
- Just a second.
- Come here.

1991
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:32,910
- Wait!
- Ahn Ji Young.

1992
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:35,070
Just a second, Jae Suk!

1993
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,510
- Listen to me.
- Ahn Ji Young.

1994
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:37,720
- Please listen to me.
- Ahn Ji Young.

1995
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,090
Jessi, listen to me.

1996
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,660
(But...)

1997
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,760
(Jae Suk ripped off
Jessi's name tag?)

1998
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:44,390
Hey! You...

1999
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,950
Jessi, listen to me.

2000
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,660
(Their alliance breaks down.)

2001
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,930
Jessi is out.

2002
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,800
Jessi is out.

2003
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,370
(Ji Young runs away
in the meantime.)

2004
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:55,390
Wait, Jessi.

2005
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:57,970
(Jessi loses 100 dollars.)

2006
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:00,180
Jessi.

2007
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,410
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry.

2008
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,200
You betrayer.

2009
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,570
- I'm sorry.
- You betrayer.

2010
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:07,910
I'm sorry.

2011
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:10,180
I'm so sorry, Jessi.

2012
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,640
- Sorry.
- I never.

2013
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,260
(Their non-aggression pact
breaks down.)

2014
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,320
Jessi.

2015
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,120
(Hyojung is quietly
taking a look around.)

2016
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,050
(BewhY appears right then!)

2017
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:21,660
(It's BewhY!)

2018
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,530
(He innocently approaches Hyojung.)

2019
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,530
(She gets ready to attack.)

2020
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,430
Gosh, you startled me.

2021
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,470
(The innocent impala's eyes)

2022
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:34,740
(The impala starts running
right away.)

2023
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,370
(The baby beast, Hyojung,
hunts down her prey.)

2024
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,970
(Haha pops out all of a sudden.)

2025
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:41,070
(He attacks the baby beast.)

2026
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,280
Who is it?

2027
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:45,950
(Haha hid as soon as he heard
Hyojung's voice.)

2028
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,890
(And then he attacked her
from behind.)

2029
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:54,220
(The impala luckily survives.)

2030
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,820
Hey!

2031
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:58,870
(Her name tag is ripped off.)

2032
01:06:58,870 --> 01:06:59,970
It's ripped off.

2033
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,370
(Hyojung is out.)

2034
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:04,700
Hyojung, thanks.

2035
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,470
If you sing, I won't catch you.

2036
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:07,800
(Haha brings Hyojung's name tag...)

2037
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,510
(to the captain's room.)

2038
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:10,550
- Haha is here.
- Haha is here.

2039
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:11,700
Am I the first one here?

2040
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:13,740
- What happened?
- I ripped off a name tag.

2041
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,220
Whose name tag?

2042
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,780
Whose name tag did you rip off?

2043
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:18,950
- Hyojung?
- Then...

2044
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,990
it's time to divide the money.

2045
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,090
(500 dollars will be divided
between Haha and Ji Hyo.)

2046
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:25,160
We don't have to do this, Ji Hyo.

2047
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,160
Are you in second place right now?

2048
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,160
- Let's share it.
- You're in third place.

2049
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,930
- If we share it, we can both go up.
- Okay.

2050
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,090
Haha will break his promise.

2051
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,160
I'm serious.

2052
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,660
- Are you sure? Do you promise?
- Yes, I promise.

2053
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,610
If you've made up your minds,
show your cards.

2054
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:42,780
- 1, 2, 3.
- I'm serious.

2055
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,610
(If one of them betrays the other,
he or she wins all 500 dollars.)

2056
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:48,910
(Will both of them pick Share
as they promised?)

2057
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,740
- I'm serious.
- Haha will pick Monopoly.

2058
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:54,160
(Only Haha picks Monopoly.)

2059
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,680
- I'm serious.
- Haha will pick Monopoly.

2060
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:57,860
(I'll take it all.)

2061
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,030
I was 100 percent sure.

2062
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:00,590
I was 100 percent sure
that he'd pick Monopoly.

2063
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,160
You still don't know him?

2064
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,430
- I knew it.
- Ji Hyo has a long way to go.

2065
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,720
I told Kwang Soo,

2066
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,370
- "Haha will pick Monopoly."
- Definitely.

2067
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,510
- That was unnecessary.
- Exactly.

2068
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,140
- Go away.
- Totally.

2069
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,530
(Swearing)

2070
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,970
I knew Haha would pick Monopoly.

2071
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:17,680
Haha wins 500 dollars.

2072
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,110
Okay. Thank you.

2073
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:20,280
500 dollars...

2074
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,280
(Jong Kook brings a name tag
to the captain's room too.)

2075
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,450
Jong Kook is here.

2076
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,680
- Jong Kook.
- Let's do it.

2077
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,080
You ripped off BewhY's name tag?

2078
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:30,720
- You can see it?
- Hand it in.

2079
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,790
- Hand it in.
- This is fun.

2080
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,330
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

2081
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:36,460
I'll show you my big picture.

2082
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,460
(It's time to divide
their winnings with Suk Jin.)

2083
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:39,330
- Show this Share Card.
- Okay.

2084
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:41,500
- I'll show Monopoly.
- Why?

2085
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,070
"Why"?

2086
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:46,240
(Laughing)

2087
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,380
- "Why"?
- I have to show Share?

2088
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,170
- I'll show Monopoly.
- You'll show Monopoly, and...

2089
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:52,040
You'll show Share,
and I'll show Monopoly.

2090
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,140
Okay, let me pick a card
randomly then.

2091
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:56,840
What are you talking about?

2092
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:59,080
- You're being ridiculous.
- This isn't working.

2093
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,420
- I understand.
- Sir.

2094
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,710
It's not easy.

2095
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:02,990
- Sir.
- This is Share.

2096
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:04,880
- Your right hand is Share.
- Right hand, okay.

2097
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,220
- Leave your left hand on your knee.
- Okay, I'll lift my right hand.

2098
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,460
I'll lift my right hand. Okay.

2099
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,670
- Okay. 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

2100
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:12,890
(Monopoly)

2101
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,290
(They both picked Monopoly?)

2102
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,240
I picked my right hand.

2103
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,800
Why is it Monopoly? What happened?
I picked my right hand.

2104
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,080
(He shuffled the cards.)

2105
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,170
- My gosh. What happened?
- Was that necessary?

2106
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:27,210
- Why is this in my hand?
- Suk Jin.

2107
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,080
What happened?
You were like a gambler.

2108
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,620
- You knew he was picking Monopoly.
- He's a gambler.

2109
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,860
- When did he do that?
- My right hand.

2110
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,710
- Why is this in my hand?
- How did he do that?

2111
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:35,820
When did you switch them?

2112
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,920
- You both earned zero dollars.
- What happened?

2113
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,630
(Sighing)

2114
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,390
I was out of my mind, Jong Kook.

2115
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,700
I had no idea.

2116
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,570
I switched without realizing.

2117
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:48,930
(Jae Suk ripped Jessi's name tag.
He walks to the captain's room.)

2118
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:50,570
Jessi?

2119
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,740
- Jessi.
- You took your teammate's name tag?

2120
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,930
This is one-on-one.

2121
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:56,140
- Really?
- Kwang Soo.

2122
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,470
You can rip
your teammate's name tag?

2123
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,640
Hurry up.

2124
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,010
- What do you want?
- We have to pick Share.

2125
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,080
- Will you pick Share?
- Yes.

2126
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:05,040
You have a lot of money,
but I don't.

2127
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,180
You have to pick Share so that
we can earn 200 dollars each.

2128
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,490
Okay?

2129
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:10,550
- You mean it, right?
- I mean it.

2130
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:13,220
- Watch. This is going to be fun.
- This is fun. I want to watch.

2131
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,750
(They watch the spectacle
unfolding in front of them.)

2132
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:17,830
- You should pick Share.
- Hurry up.

2133
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:18,830
That'll be better.

2134
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:19,830
Kwang Soo.

2135
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:22,330
Don't even look at this.

2136
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:24,300
I'm going to ditch this.

2137
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,460
Okay.

2138
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,280
- You have to be serious.
- Okay.

2139
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:29,780
I'm serious.

2140
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:31,000
(He checks the Monopoly Card
on the floor.)

2141
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,380
I'm serious
because this doesn't make sense.

2142
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,840
You're holding the Monopoly Card.

2143
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,580
(You're holding the Monopoly Card.)

2144
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,290
How did you know?

2145
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:40,360
(He got caught.)

2146
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,290
Who are you? How did you know?

2147
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:43,360
(He's frightened.)

2148
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,380
How did you know?

2149
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,360
- I know you.
- Were you watching me?

2150
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,830
- I got chills. How did you know?
- Goodness.

2151
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:56,040
(Before the others got here,
he got for an extra Monopoly Card.)

2152
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,930
(He hid an extra Monopoly Card
in his pocket.)

2153
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:04,470
(He pretended like he was
throwing away the Monopoly Card.)

2154
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:08,640
(He tried to switch the cards
while Jae Suk wasn't looking.)

2155
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:12,210
How did you know?

2156
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:13,860
Come here. Take the Share Card.

2157
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,210
- I will.
- Let's get started.

2158
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,360
Here.

2159
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,580
- I'll pick Share.
- One...

2160
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,360
This is Monopoly.

2161
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,750
Fine. Take this away.

2162
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,760
Okay.

2163
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,000
Take this away.

2164
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,030
(They decide to take away
the Monopoly Card.)

2165
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:28,370
All right. 1, 2, 3.

2166
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,740
(Grabbing)

2167
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,500
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey.

2168
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,280
- What are you doing?
- I'll never earn any money then.

2169
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,410
Hurry up! We're waiting.

2170
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:39,620
Hurry up.

2171
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,380
- Let's go.
- Pick Share.

2172
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:43,540
- I will.
- Pick Share.

2173
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,450
- I'm serious.
- Me too.

2174
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:46,660
- 1...
- You'll be sharing 500 dollars.

2175
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,420
- 1, 2, 3.
- We'll share 500 dollars.

2176
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,630
1, 2, 3.

2177
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,720
(They don't move.)

2178
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,130
Why can't we do this?

2179
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,330
- Lift your hand!
- Pick.

2180
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,720
250 is not bad.

2181
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,090
- This is interesting.
- Can't you do it?

2182
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,670
This is interesting. We can't do it.

2183
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:02,930
- We can't.
- It's not easy.

2184
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:05,110
1, 2, 3.

2185
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,080
- All right.
- Share.

2186
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:10,750
- Jong Kook, come over here.
- Suk Jin.

2187
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,210
(Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
each earn 250 dollars.)

2188
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:15,920
My gosh. Jae Suk was unbelievable.

2189
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,540
- What are you doing?
- No, it's not like that.

2190
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,210
Two people on Team Idol...

2191
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,210
(He got attacked by
Jin Hyuk and Hyojung.)

2192
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:22,620
ripped my name tag.

2193
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,630
Young people are so...

2194
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,160
Him...

2195
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,860
and as Jae Suk got older...

2196
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,670
We should do a double attack.

2197
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:32,960
- I think we should.
- But you swear?

2198
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:34,430
- I swear.
- Okay.

2199
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,910
Because I did this with Jae Suk,
and he ripped mine off.

2200
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:39,300
- Really?
- Yes. I got betrayed three times.

2201
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,830
I hear Jessi's voice. It's Jessi.

2202
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:42,110
(Flinching)

2203
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,380
She's complaining about me.

2204
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:47,580
Right now,
everyone is betraying each other.

2205
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,040
We have to double tag team.

2206
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,080
(She gets closer to Jae Suk.)

2207
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,450
Let's find Jae Suk.

2208
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:53,660
(Jae Suk is right behind her.)

2209
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,290
What are you doing here?

2210
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:57,790
(Grabbing)

2211
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,000
Hey!

2212
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,920
(Betraying again)

2213
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:04,830
He didn't get it.

2214
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:06,370
- I got it.
- You didn't.

2215
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:08,390
- It's not completely off.
- I got it.

2216
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:09,610
I got Jessi.

2217
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:10,910
- I got Jessi.
- Okay!

2218
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,610
- I got her name tag.
- He didn't.

2219
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:14,540
- I got it.
- It's not completely off.

2220
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:16,950
- Let's see. It's off. You're out.
- It's off. See?

2221
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,040
- Give it back.
- What?

2222
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,580
- What? Hey!
- No.

2223
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,970
- How dare you?
- I'm sorry, Jessi.

2224
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,790
Jessi.

2225
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:26,490
He's like a ghost.

2226
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,320
- Hold on, Jessi. I'm sorry.
- This is the second time.

2227
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,460
I'm sorry, Jessi.

2228
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,580
What happens to that?
The one I ripped?

2229
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,660
This doesn't count.

2230
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,890
- You got it after I ripped hers.
- Does it start over again?

2231
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,420
All right. Give me mine.

2232
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,220
(Ripping)

2233
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:41,830
- Not yet.
- Yes!

2234
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:43,370
(Jong Kook came out of nowhere.)

2235
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:45,430
(He removed Jae Suk's name tag.)

2236
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,500
- He betrayed me twice.
- Am I out?

2237
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:49,080
- Yes!
- How?

2238
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,110
He betrayed me twice.

2239
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:52,670
Well, you didn't move.
What was I supposed to do?

2240
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,640
- You have to give it back.
- Jong Kook.

2241
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,920
- I have to take it with me.
- Jong Kook is scary.

2242
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,420
- He's so scary.
- In that moment.

2243
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,680
- Come on.
- You ripped hers off too though.

2244
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,460
I wasn't done,
and you came up from behind.

2245
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,550
What do you mean?

2246
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:05,460
You were wrapping up,
so I went up to you.

2247
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:08,250
I wasn't done.
Don't make me feel disappointed.

2248
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,570
You were done already.
Why are you disappointed?

2249
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:12,330
Why would you play like that?

2250
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:13,830
- Play how?
- Why?

2251
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:16,540
- What do you mean? What's wrong?
- That was dirty.

2252
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,070
Jong Kook!

2253
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:19,740
Where are you going?

2254
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:22,670
Jessi is following us.

2255
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,250
Catch Jae Suk. Please.

2256
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:28,140
(He runs away without looking back.)

2257
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,580
I haven't seen Haha pick Share
in this room yet.

2258
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,540
No, I did once.

2259
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,360
Jae Suk.

2260
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,010
Why do you keep ripping off
Jessi's name tag?

2261
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:38,490
- She's so mad at me,
- I mean.

2262
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:40,660
so she's talking trash about me
to everybody.

2263
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:44,290
(My gosh...)

2264
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:46,430
My gosh. Jae Suk.

2265
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:50,000
I took pity on you. I liked you.

2266
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:52,210
How could you do this to me?

2267
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,280
Jae Suk is next.

2268
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:56,000
Let's go.

2269
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,540
- I'm serious.
- Not again.

2270
01:14:58,780 --> 01:14:59,880
All right.

2271
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,170
(They place Monopoly Cards
away from them.)

2272
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:02,380
Monopoly.

2273
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:05,320
(Squirming)

2274
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:08,360
(Slapping)

2275
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,880
(He finds the hidden Monopoly Card.)

2276
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,920
This.

2277
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,830
My bad.

2278
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:16,200
- How could you?
- My bad.

2279
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,920
Okay. I accept.

2280
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,390
That was a mistake. I swear.
I accept.

2281
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,790
I deserve to be slapped. I accept.

2282
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:22,890
(He's reflecting deeply.)

2283
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:23,930
I swear.

2284
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:25,370
(This is the last time.)

2285
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:26,740
Let's get started right away.

2286
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:29,110
Let's get started.

2287
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:30,840
Stand up.

2288
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,780
- Stand up.
- Pardon?

2289
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:33,970
Stand up.

2290
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:35,540
Stand up.

2291
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,710
- Why?
- Stand up.

2292
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,290
- Stand up.
- Hold on.

2293
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:41,620
(As soon as
he pushes Kwang Soo over,)

2294
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,660
(he finds another Monopoly Card.)

2295
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,990
(How could you?)

2296
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,130
Hey.

2297
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:49,460
- I don't have anymore.
- You don't, right?

2298
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,700
- Where did he hide them?
- I had two.

2299
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,890
- You and I both have Share Cards.
- Okay.

2300
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:54,890
- 250 each.
- Let's go.

2301
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,500
1, 2, 3.

2302
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,760
(Share, Monopoly)

2303
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:00,280
What? Where did you get this?

2304
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,800
Where did you get this?

2305
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:03,250
What?

2306
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,080
Where did you get this?

2307
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,380
(Where did he get
the Monopoly Card?)

2308
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,840
(Jae Suk searched Kwang Soo.)

2309
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:14,160
(He put the Monopoly Card
on his seat.)

2310
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:16,830
(Hands are faster than the eyes.)

2311
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:18,460
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks".

2312
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,250
- I didn't see that.
- "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks".

2313
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,830
- All three are here.
- Hey.

2314
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:24,090
- Jae Suk.
- Okay.

2315
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:25,530
(He's happy
as he leaves the captain's room.)

2316
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:27,790
(There's somebody here.)

2317
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:30,410
(Quiet! Did he see me?)

2318
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:33,300
(He approaches carefully
from behind.)

2319
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,780
(Peekaboo)

2320
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:38,000
(He caught me.)

2321
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,970
- Jessi. I'm sorry.
- No, no.

2322
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:43,950
Jae Suk, I let you go twice
because you didn't have any money,

2323
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:46,860
but you were so cheap to me.

2324
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:48,080
I know.

2325
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:51,660
But let me explain.

2326
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:53,960
- I didn't have any money.
- How could you do that twice to me?

2327
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,220
- We promised.
- Jessi.

2328
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:57,170
I'll give you my name tag,

2329
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,500
- so no more hard feelings.
- Let's start over again.

2330
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,890
- Okay.
- Okay.

2331
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:03,610
You can't go after mine again.
Let's start over again.

2332
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:04,870
(As soon as
they settle on an agreement,)

2333
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,540
(Jin Hyuk comes out of nowhere
and attacks.)

2334
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,340
(Jae Suk helps Jessi
and attacks Jin Hyuk.)

2335
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,280
- Loyalty.
- I helped you.

2336
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,010
Did you rip mine off or not?

2337
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:18,340
(At that moment!)

2338
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:20,960
(Jong Kook keeps on
coming up behind Jae Suk.)

2339
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:22,990
(He removes Jae Suk's name tag.)

2340
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:24,180
Stop coming from behind.

2341
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:27,160
- You should have ripped his off.
- I was going to.

2342
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,160
(He gets 100 dollars deducted.)

2343
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:31,830
(Peeking)

2344
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,130
It's crazier here.

2345
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,260
(She witnesses chaos
outside the elevator.)

2346
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:37,610
(She pauses and hesitates.)

2347
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,800
(She closes the door and withdraws.)

2348
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:45,640
I don't want to get caught up
in that fight.

2349
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,080
(This is that fight.)

2350
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,010
Grab him. I got him.

2351
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:50,920
- Here.
- I can't do it.

2352
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,080
Jessi.

2353
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,880
(Jin Hyuk is resisting a lot!)

2354
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,580
(He endures
to the best of his ability.)

2355
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,790
No worries.

2356
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:58,880
(He can't win 2 to 1.)

2357
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,960
(Jae Suk removes
Jin Hyuk's name tag.)

2358
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,290
- Darn it.
- Jin Hyuk is out.

2359
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:07,130
I got eliminated so many times.

2360
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:08,460
Kwang Soo.

2361
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,960
- This will be fun to watch.
- Let's do half.

2362
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,240
I have to watch. This will be fun.

2363
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,410
- I'm serious.
- Me too.

2364
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:15,930
- There's nothing in this hand?
- No.

2365
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:17,110
- I'll hold this.
- I don't think he'll do it.

2366
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,670
Let's pick Share.

2367
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,380
(Will they both pick
Share this time?)

2368
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:21,380
For sure?

2369
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,210
There's nothing in this hand.

2370
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:24,340
(He looks for the Monopoly Card.)

2371
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,540
Let's hold our hands.

2372
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,010
That's a good idea.

2373
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,080
Good one.

2374
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,030
Last time. Here.

2375
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:31,420
- Let me see.
- Let's get started.

2376
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,390
Me too. See?

2377
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,700
- I wonder what will happen.
- One,

2378
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,720
two,

2379
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,960
three.

2380
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,430
(They don't move.)

2381
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:43,960
- Why?
- Why aren't you holding it up?

2382
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,070
- Hold it up.
- Don't you understand?

2383
01:18:45,070 --> 01:18:46,710
- You hold it up on three.
- Why not?

2384
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:48,240
- Why aren't you holding it up?
- Okay, on three.

2385
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:51,380
Let's get started. 1, 2, 3.

2386
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:54,470
(Slowly)

2387
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:56,380
Share.

2388
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,680
- Share.
- How warm.

2389
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,920
- We did it.
- Done.

2390
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,080
The race is over.
Let's move our final location.

2391
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,630
(The race is over.)

2392
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:06,700
Like I said before,

2393
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:09,220
the top three members will get
prizes according to the ranks.

2394
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,220
(The top three members get prizes
according to their ranks.)

2395
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,000
And the last two
will receive a penalty.

2396
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Okay.

2397
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,130
The winner with 4,550 dollars is...

2398
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:18,300
Ji Suk Jin.

2399
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,410
- He's really...
- Thank you.

2400
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:22,540
- He's really sly.
- My goodness.

2401
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,800
He's really sly.

2402
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,280
- I've been in first place for long.
- Jee Sly.

2403
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,840
- Did he have that much money?
- Yes.

2404
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,640
We didn't have to try so hard
to rip off his name tag.

2405
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,990
It was no use.

2406
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:31,180
(Jessi still doesn't
understand the rules.)

2407
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,380
I kept explaining the rules to her
while they all celebrated him.

2408
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,660
We ripped off his name tag a lot.

2409
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,790
- But it didn't work?
- "Did he have that much money?"

2410
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,000
Jae Suk, seriously...

2411
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,720
The member in second place
with 2,130 dollars is...

2412
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:44,420
Song Ji Hyo.

2413
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,670
- What?
- Really?

2414
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:46,830
Is Ji Hyo in second place?

2415
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:48,760
- Me?
- She got a lot of money at first.

2416
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,930
- I know.
- Next.

2417
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:52,130
- Right?
- He's got 2,130 dollars.

2418
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:53,240
It's Kim Jong Kook.

2419
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,170
Me? Isn't it you?

2420
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:56,950
- I thought it was you.
- He just ran around...

2421
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:58,910
ripping off the name tags.

2422
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:02,510
When you took off the name tags,
it felt like you tore my skin off.

2423
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,510
You grabbed it like this.

2424
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:05,920
- Jessi.
- What?

2425
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,660
- Okay. Sorry.
- What?

2426
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:09,080
It looks like an American sitcom.

2427
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,180
American sitcom.

2428
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,180
- Is it a sitcom?
- Okay.

2429
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:14,390
- Okay.
- Is it "LA Arirang" or what?

2430
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:16,530
Haha and Ji Young are
in fourth place.

2431
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:20,500
Se Chan is in 6th, Kwang Soo is
in 7th, and Hyojung is in 8th place.

2432
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,740
- Jin Hyuk is in ninth place.
- Yes.

2433
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:23,540
Now I will announce
the 10th, 11th, and 12th.

2434
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:24,540
This can't be.

2435
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,460
And we have Jae Suk, BewhY,
and Jessi left.

2436
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:29,300
- Two of you will receive a penalty.
- Who would that be? You two.

2437
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,300
You?

2438
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,380
- This worked out.
- My team is so bad at games.

2439
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:34,470
- What?
- The member in 10th place...

2440
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:35,970
- doesn't receive a penalty.
- Please.

2441
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,180
The 10th is...

2442
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:42,820
(Who's the member in 10th place
who won't receive a penalty?)

2443
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:43,830
BewhY.

2444
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:45,720
Jae Suk is in 11th,

2445
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,630
- and Jessi is in 12th place.
- This is why I...

2446
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:49,290
- I...
- They are the best couple.

2447
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:50,500
- Jessi.
- The best couple.

2448
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,760
- This is why...
- I hate Jae Suk so much.

2449
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,260
- We should've cooperated.
- Wait.

2450
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:57,800
Jae Suk and Jessi.

2451
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:59,000
- We lost?
- Yes.

2452
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:01,430
"We lost?"

2453
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,470
- "We lost?"
- Oh my goodness.

2454
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:06,540
Please bring in the prizes
for the top three members.

2455
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:08,010
- It's Korean beef.
- Congratulations.

2456
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:10,010
First place gets Korean beef,
second place gets Korean pork,

2457
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:11,120
and third place gets vitamins.

2458
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,340
Congratulations.

2459
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:14,320
Congratulations, Suk Jin.

2460
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,120
I'll eat it with my family.

2461
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,160
- Next is the penalty.
- Yes.

2462
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,890
It's the highlight of college campus
festivals. Water balloon throws.

2463
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:22,290
That's right.

2464
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,170
It's frustrating that I ended up
in here after all the betrayals.

2465
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:30,110
(They throw water balloons
at the betrayer.)

2466
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:32,110
This is hard. I can't hit them.

2467
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:35,280
(Kwang Soo throws balloons
at Jessi.)

2468
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,840
Look at that.

2469
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:38,610
- Gosh, Jessi. Are you all right?
- Okay.

2470
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:39,970
I can't just hit him.

2471
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:42,250
- Jessi. I'm so sorry.
- What are you doing?

2472
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,490
No, I didn't mean it.

2473
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:44,620
I couldn't control it.

2474
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,620
Who was that?

2475
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,920
- Are you okay?
- Hey, don't talk to me.

2476
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,250
- Jessi, are you okay?
- I'm not a baseball player.

2477
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,460
Don't talk to me.

2478
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:52,360
Gosh, I'm just...

2479
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:53,550
Darn it.

2480
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:54,750
I'm not throwing it anymore.

2481
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,500
- What are you doing?
- I can't do this.

2482
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,830
- Are you okay?
- I was trying to hit the wall.

2483
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,000
Are you all right?

2484
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,390
I tried to hit the wall.

2485
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:02,590
- Throw it again.
- Kwang Soo.

2486
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:04,430
Did you hit me in the face?

2487
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:06,330
No, I throw it upward.

2488
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:08,110
- I couldn't control it.
- Okay.

2489
01:22:08,110 --> 01:22:09,610
- Okay.
- Okay.

2490
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,910
- Oh no.
- You know what?

2491
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,470
Just...

2492
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,010
(Slurring)

2493
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,750
What did you say, Jessi?

2494
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,010
You know what? Come on.

2495
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:19,840
- Jessi.
- Hey.

2496
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,820
What's the problem?

2497
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:23,080
Jessi, what was that?

2498
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,250
I hate you.

2499
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:26,130
I hate you.

2500
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:28,290
Jessi's nose was running,
and it went back in.

2501
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,630
- I've seen it come out,
- That's enough.

2502
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:32,090
but I've never seen it go back in.

2503
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:34,330
- It was like a cartoon.
- I know.

2504
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:36,390
- Bye, everyone.
- Bye.

2505
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:37,410
- Bye.
- See you later.

2506
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,110
- Bye.
- Bye.

2507
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:43,800
(The veiled people put
everyone in confusion.)

2508
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:46,450
(Sim Eun Woo from "A World
of Married Couple" is here.)

2509
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:48,470
(Kim Min Gue and Kim Jae Kyung)

2510
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:51,510
(The real dilemma begins now.)

2511
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:54,550
(A soccer game
full of slapstick comedies)

2512
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:57,550
(The swamp of dilemma where
they have an X man in the team?)

2513
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,090
(Will they be able
to the endless dilemma?)

2514
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:02,090
(And...)

2515
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:04,890
(They meet So Min
after a long time.)

2516
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:08,290
(Something is going on
between the two of them.)

2517
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:10,370
(Between the couple,)

2518
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:13,110
(Kwang Soo is in a dilemma.)

2519
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,000
(The members at the crossroads,
Too Much Dilemma)
