1
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,280
(It is a sunny summer day.)

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,440
(There are 8 parking spots
with numbers.)

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,090
Kwang Soo's car has just arrived.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,560
It's in number five.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,350
Is it Kwang Soo's car?

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,300
Yes. It just pulled in.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,070
Haha's car is coming in.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,000
It's Haha's car.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,300
(The members start to arrive
in their cars one by one.)

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,870
(Kwang Soo is the first one
to get off the car.)

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,340
(Looking around)

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,380
(As things feel a little different
than usual, he steps outside.)

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,010
Just a moment.

14
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,950
- Do you hear me?
- Put the microphone on him.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,980
Okay.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,160
- Has it started?
- Yes.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,370
Has it started already?

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,440
Yes.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,560
(It's still early, but I'm putting
on the microphone already?)

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,730
You will move
with this blindfold on.

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,230
Please put it on.

22
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,070
(Am I putting on the blindfold
as well as the microphone?)

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,070
- Just put it on.
- But...

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,680
Let's move now.

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,740
- Where...
- Follow me.

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,740
(Let's move now. Follow me.)

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,990
Some of the members
haven't arrived yet.

28
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,210
Let's move.

29
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,550
(Se Chan walks out of his car next.)

30
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,260
(Where is he going?)

31
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,350
Come here.

32
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,430
Where is he going? What's going on?

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,160
I know this place.
There's a coffee shop.

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,770
(Where is he heading
with the blindfold on?)

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,190
(Groaning)

36
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,270
Hang on.

37
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,770
I just broke my arm.

38
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,040
It's broken.

39
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,930
(Beeping)

40
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,180
It's an elevator, right?

41
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,410
(Did he hear some sound
from the elevator?)

42
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,940
I need to go to the restroom.

43
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,240
(Se Chan is being
taken away while whining.)

44
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,380
(So Min gets off her car too.)

45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,190
(She also heads to somewhere
with a blindfold on.)

46
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,550
Are you being taken to somewhere?

47
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,230
- Hello, Haha.
- Where are you going?

48
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,130
I don't know. I'm being taken away.

49
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,460
Where are you taking her?

50
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,100
(All the members are taken somewhere
with a blindfold on...)

51
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,740
(as soon as they get off
from their cars.)

52
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,500
Where on earth are we going?

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,470
- What?
- What's the number?

54
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,150
Hang on. I'm getting in an elevator.
What's happening?

55
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,310
Kwang Soo.

56
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,240
(He gets in an elevator
without knowing why.)

57
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,460
Do you want me to get off?

58
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,400
(Kwang Soo reaches
the 5th floor alone.)

59
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,430
What?

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,590
It's the seventh floor.
What's going on?

61
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,110
(Se Chan is on the 6th floor.)

62
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,270
I guess we are on different floors.

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,210
(1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th,
6th, 7th, and 8th floors)

64
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,870
(All the members have gotten
off at different floors.)

65
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,420
(Is there anyone around here?)

66
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,420
(So Min heads out to the stairs.)

67
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,680
Excuse me!

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
So Min?

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,420
Hey, Se Chan!

70
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,050
(- So Min?
- Hey, Se Chan!)

71
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,020
- Se Chan.
- What?

72
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,330
Which floor are you on?

73
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,220
Where are you?

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,120
Se Chan?

75
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,590
So Min recognizes
Se Chan's voice immediately.

76
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,030
I didn't even know who it was.

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
- Se Chan!
- Yes?

78
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,470
I'm wearing a skirt today.

79
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,550
What?

80
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,710
I'm wearing a skirt today.

81
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,810
What?

82
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,620
Okay. Good for you.

83
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,180
I look pretty today.

84
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,490
- What?
- I said I look pretty today.

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,310
(Laughing)

86
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,550
She says she's pretty.

87
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,750
Stop yelling if nothing's going on.

88
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,120
Pull yourselves together.

89
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,590
(Pull yourselves together.)

90
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,960
There might be people
like scarecrows again.

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,740
(1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th,
6th, 7th, and 8th floors)

92
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,930
What's going on?

93
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,110
(Why are they waiting on different
floors without knowing the reason?)

94
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,270
Ji Hyo, you're on the eighth floor.
Please push the down button.

95
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,520
- I'm getting in.
- Okay.

96
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,340
(Ji Hyo pushes
the button carefully.)

97
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,020
- Take a look inside.
- My gosh.

98
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,340
What's that?

99
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,720
(There's something in the elevator.)

100
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,860
- Take a look inside.
- My gosh.

101
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
What's that?

102
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,830
"There are 80 R coins. Put as many
coins as you want in your bag."

103
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,070
(There are 80 R coins. Put as many
coins as you want in your bag.)

104
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,500
(The number of coins you take
will not be revealed.)

105
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,570
I can take as many coins as I want?

106
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,670
(It's Running Man Platform
from the movie, "The Platform")

107
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,670
Going down.

108
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,510
(The 8 members get 80 coins.)

109
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,480
(Each member will get as many coins
as they want from the top.)

110
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,950
(The fate of the members
on lower floors...)

111
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,260
(depends on the greed
of the members on higher floors.)

112
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,130
(I can take as many
as I want among the 80 coins?)

113
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,790
I should take them all then.

114
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,360
I should bring them all.

115
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,130
Why? Is there something?

116
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,310
(Ji Hyo wonders
what's behind it for a while.)

117
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,600
(Then she takes
as many coins as she wants.)

118
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,210
The doors are closing. Going down.

119
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,840
(The elevator goes down
to the 7th floor.)

120
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,770
(7th floor)

121
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,820
What's that?

122
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,840
What's all this? Shall I get in?

123
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,190
- Going down.
- Gosh, what is this?

124
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,350
"There are 80 R coins. Put as many
coins as you want in your bag."

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,330
There were 80 coins?

126
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,060
Does it go to the first floor?

127
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,460
There were 80 coins,
but this is all we have left?

128
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,770
9 and 10. Who was that?

129
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,030
Who took 60 coins?

130
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,470
Who's above there?

131
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,310
(Ji Hyo took 60 coins.)

132
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,100
Okay. I will take a bundle.

133
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,450
I'm being conscientious.

134
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,840
Seriously, I'm being
very conscientious with this.

135
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,320
The person on the eighth floor...

136
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,190
Okay. Good.

137
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,460
(Now it's Se Chan's turn
on the 6th floor.)

138
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,560
Shall we begin?

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,020
(He sounds determined.)

140
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,850
What?

141
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,350
What does it say?

142
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,270
How many coins
did they take from up there?

143
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,590
My gosh, they are so mean.

144
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,270
- Oh, dear.
- Going down.

145
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,140
(Ji Hyo is the first one
to arrive at the opening place.)

146
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,770
- Ji Hyo.
- It's So Min in a skirt.

147
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,950
Ji Hyo.

148
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,600
(Are you the one
from the 8th floor?)

149
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,970
Gosh, I can't believe this.

150
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,980
- What? Why?
- I mean...

151
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,350
They say a fair face
may hide a foul heart.

152
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,260
- You bragged about your skirt.
- Ji Hyo.

153
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,460
You were on the eighth floor, right?

154
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,700
- Me?
- You are from the eighth floor.

155
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,330
How can you be so sure
that there was no ninth floor?

156
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,720
There was no 9th floor.
You took 60 coins, didn't you?

157
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,130
60 coins?

158
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,500
Someone took 60 coins.

159
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,770
Were there 80 coins?

160
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,460
That's what the cue-card said.
It said 80 coins.

161
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,860
I didn't see it.

162
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,600
(The girl from the 8th floor
is unbelievable.)

163
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
I think Ji Hyo took the coins
without reading the card...

164
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,470
as soon as the door opened.

165
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,340
Hey, guys.

166
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,110
You should make things fun.

167
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,890
- Ji Hyo.
- You guys are so mean.

168
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,960
You should've left at least
20 coins to make things fun.

169
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,390
Se Chan, So Min says
she's wearing a skirt today.

170
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,590
Okay.

171
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,590
(Mindless)

172
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,360
She looks pretty today.

173
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,660
Okay.

174
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,660
(Are you still not interested?)

175
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,860
She says she looks pretty today.

176
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,500
- Hey.
- No.

177
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,530
You look pretty
only when you do something nice.

178
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,530
So Min says she's pretty today. See?

179
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,970
They don't look like flowers to me.
They look like R coins.

180
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,750
It shows the number
of R coins you took.

181
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,210
The number of R coins you have...

182
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,910
Just have me. You can have me.

183
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,480
Put me in your bag.

184
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
(She's bold.)

185
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,320
What are you doing
so early in the morning?

186
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,150
Gosh. They look like
R coins to me, So Min.

187
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,220
I don't know who's on the first
floor, but he will have a hard time.

188
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,590
- On the first floor?
- Yes.

189
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,590
What's that?

190
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,570
(Kwang Soo is on the 5th floor.)

191
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,140
Were there 80 coins?
There are only 5 left.

192
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,160
Were there 80 coins?

193
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,210
(He picks them up first.)

194
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,400
(Kwang Soo takes
all the 5 coins that are left.)

195
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,650
What's that?

196
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,520
"Put as many coins as you want
in your bag?" My gosh.

197
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,650
So Min was yelling earlier.

198
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,090
I'm sure So Min took them all.

199
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,480
Going down.

200
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,720
Darn it.

201
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,160
- Going down.
- There's nothing left.

202
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,700
What do you mean,
there are 80 R coins?

203
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,840
There's nothing here.

204
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,140
Why was I on the fifth floor?

205
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,070
Darn it.

206
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,770
It was decided
by our managers, right?

207
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,950
- Really?
- Isn't it the order we arrived?

208
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,710
- No.
- That's not it.

209
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,770
- Where the cars were parked...
- There were numbers.

210
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,110
On the ground?

211
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,520
The parking spots had numbers.

212
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,110
- Really?
- Really?

213
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,280
(How was it decided
who goes to which floor?)

214
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,920
(This is where they parked
their cars this morning.)

215
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,330
(Each parking spot had a number.)

216
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,160
(Kwang Soo parked
in spot number five,)

217
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,300
(so he was sent to Floor 5.)

218
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,860
(Each member was placed
depending on their parking spot.)

219
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,200
Where's Chan Ho? Why did he park
the park in spot number seven?

220
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,810
- Where is he?
- It's a lucky number.

221
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,210
- That's right.
- You parked in spot number eight.

222
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,370
I shouldn't have thought much.

223
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,780
- I thought too much.
- Gosh.

224
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,710
Ji Hyo always benefits
from not thinking.

225
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,370
Here comes number 2.
He's from the 2nd floor

226
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,740
I guess Suk Jin is
on the first floor.

227
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,690
You're broke, right?

228
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,250
Did number seven take all the coins?

229
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,480
- No.
- What?

230
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,460
- What are you talking about?
- There were a few left.

231
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,530
This guy took everything.

232
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,120
Ji Hyo...

233
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,720
- No. Ji Hyo took about 20.
- What?

234
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,930
- Ji Hyo took 20.
- I think she took half of them.

235
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,590
They took 20 and 30 each,
and Se Chan...

236
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,540
left about five.

237
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,710
And Kwang Soo took five.

238
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,630
(Se Chan left about 5,
and Kwang Soo took 5.)

239
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,130
(100 percent correct)

240
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,310
That's accurate.

241
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,740
- Were you watching us?
- Jae Suk.

242
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,310
- Were you hiding in the elevator?
- Were you?

243
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,640
- Were you watching us?
- Right?

244
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,280
- I knew it.
- That was accurate.

245
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,290
I'm sure there were about five left.

246
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,560
Where's our old man, by the way?

247
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,290
There's nothing left for him anyway.

248
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,880
What if he collapsed on his way up?

249
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,690
Because he's exhausted?

250
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,030
"There are 80 R coins. Put as many
coins as you want in your bag."

251
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,360
"The number of coins you take
will not be revealed."

252
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,490
My goodness.

253
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,130
I'm getting greedy.

254
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,570
So where are the 80 R coins?

255
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,230
Where are they?

256
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,130
They used to be on the tray.

257
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,550
They've all been taken?

258
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,340
What should I do then?

259
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,970
I can't take anything?

260
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,010
(He finally understands.)

261
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,090
- Gosh.
- Gosh, I was so disappointed.

262
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,750
- Look at that.
- What's taking Suk Jin so long?

263
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,350
Did he get in a fight with
with a cameraman or something?

264
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,530
He might have grabbed the cameraman
by the collar.

265
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,660
- "Give me my coins!"
- Is he getting beaten up?

266
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,670
- He'd never hit anyone.
- But he'd get hit.

267
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,430
He might come out
with tissue in his nose.

268
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,590
"Hi, guys."

269
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,630
- That'd be hilarious.
- Did he get in a fight?

270
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,800
If he got in a fight...

271
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,130
I must be late.

272
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,870
What if the opening is over?

273
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,730
- Hi, Suk Jin.
- Hi.

274
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,470
He's alive.

275
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,450
- How could you take everything?
- That's not true.

276
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,610
Did you take everything?

277
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,640
Say the words clearly.

278
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,710
Did you take everything?

279
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,110
I considered parking
in spot number seven.

280
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,660
But I thought it was strange
that no one had taken it.

281
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,480
We have some good news.

282
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,750
("Yoo Jae Suk Wins
the Best Variety Performer Award")

283
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,390
("Lee Kwang Soo Wins
the Best Supporting Actor Award")

284
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,060
(Jae Suk and Kwang Soo won
awards from Baeksang Arts Awards.)

285
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,330
Thank you.

286
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,760
- Thank you.
- Kwang Soo and Jae Suk.

287
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
- Thank you.
- Did you two meet?

288
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,730
We sat next to each other,
but we were a little apart.

289
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry to say this,

290
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,130
but Kwang Soo...

291
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,100
Actually, the other nominees...

292
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,600
- were all amazing actors.
- Really?

293
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,500
- Who were they?
- The one from "Parasite"...

294
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,610
- You mean Choi Woo Shik?
- That's right.

295
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,050
They were all great actors.

296
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,550
After I received the award,

297
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,110
Jae Suk said, "Congratulations."

298
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,110
"But this might make people talk."

299
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,350
(The national host
made a careful prediction.)

300
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,620
He advised me to stay away
from my phone for a while.

301
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,620
(He advised me to stay away
from my phone for a while.)

302
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,360
You didn't expect Kwang Soo to win?

303
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,590
- I was hoping he would,
- Of course.

304
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,570
but when he actually did,
I was a bit surprised.

305
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,630
I looked at Jae Suk right away,

306
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,310
and he completely froze.

307
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,810
He wouldn't even look at me.

308
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,080
The other nominees were
all amazing actors too.

309
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,920
But Kwang Soo did a good job.

310
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,740
- He did. He did well.
- Of course.

311
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,090
Thank you.

312
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,840
He's always been a great actor.
He's never been bad.

313
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,750
- I saw that.
- Me too.

314
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,120
What is that?

315
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,980
- It's what Jong Kook posted.
- Gosh.

316
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,250
It's an indirect advertisement.

317
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,960
"I fell asleep after
a minute and 20 seconds."

318
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,570
When I saw his reaction...

319
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,570
As soon as I saw his fake reaction,

320
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,440
I dropped my phone.

321
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,670
You fell asleep?

322
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,260
- You dozed off.
- I'd watched for about a minute.

323
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,910
About a minute and 25 seconds.

324
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,870
Something I really want to achieve
this year is...

325
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,000
to finish watching
one of Suk Jin's videos.

326
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,580
Without falling asleep
or dropping my phone.

327
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,550
I never get to charge my phone
during the night.

328
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,710
That's so funny.

329
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,290
Are you satisfied with
the number of coins you have?

330
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,430
- I have nothing.
- What are you talking about?

331
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,220
We did a simple mission
before we start the race.

332
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,030
In today's race, you'll be sent to
different floors after each mission.

333
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,570
It's called Sharing Playbook.

334
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,590
After each mission, starting with
the person on the eighth floor,

335
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,570
you'll take as many coins
as you want.

336
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,410
Today, anyone can be penalized.

337
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,130
(Today, anyone can be penalized.)

338
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,370
Whoever fails to buy
an exemption card using the coins...

339
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,950
will be penalized
after the final race.

340
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,690
It must be expensive.

341
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,210
Let me show you the items
you can buy using your coins.

342
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,750
I'll buy it right away if I can.

343
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,830
I've always wanted a massage gun.

344
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,990
- It's really nice.
- The price will be revealed later.

345
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,800
You can buy
a penalty transfer card too?

346
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,200
- There's a transfer card.
- Really?

347
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,300
- I want a penalty transfer card.
- That sounds nice.

348
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,700
With it, you can transfer
your penalty within three months.

349
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,040
That sounds so tempting.

350
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,210
That's a good thing then.

351
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,810
- It's already started.
- We need many coins.

352
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,630
It's important to have
many coins today.

353
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,210
Each item's price will be
revealed after the final race.

354
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,110
Think carefully before distributing
coins among yourselves.

355
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,690
Please change and
go to the next mission spot.

356
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,110
- Okay.
- I don't have any coins.

357
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,790
It's possible that no one
gets penalized, right?

358
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,250
(Current Number of Coins)

359
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,030
What are those cardboard cutouts
doing here?

360
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,220
What's with the sandbag?

361
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,360
Jong Kook, there's a sandbag.

362
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,760
We probably have to choose a number.

363
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,930
What is this?

364
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,860
It looks like we'll have to
hang from the sandbag.

365
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,230
No, we'll use it
to break those boards.

366
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,440
We'll swing it to break
those boards.

367
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,730
- I think we'll hang from it.
- We'll swing it.

368
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,050
- We have to push it?
- Yes.

369
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,420
Don't you see
those Styrofoam boards?

370
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,510
Gosh, let's see who's right.

371
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,590
By the way,

372
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,190
how many is Suk Jin fighting with?

373
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,850
- He's like Sirasoni.
- He's...

374
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,090
"Bring it on!"

375
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,380
- It's okay.
- Seriously.

376
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,830
I feel alive
when people criticize me.

377
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,120
You can keep criticizing me.

378
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,390
This mission is all about
reading the others' minds.

379
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
It's called
Where is Running Man? Here.

380
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,130
- Here.
- It's Jong Kook's game.

381
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,360
- It's Kim Jong Kook Game.
- It's Kim Jong Kook Game.

382
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,340
- Here.
- It's cute.

383
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,230
You'll divide into 4 teams of 2.

384
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
The three defending teams...

385
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,550
will stand behind
one of the four doors.

386
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,110
Each member will wear a helmet...

387
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,110
worth 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
and 100 points,

388
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,350
which will determine
the attacking team's score.

389
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,120
Also, behind
one of the four doors...

390
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,930
Do you see those cutouts?

391
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,120
Why do they have minus points?

392
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,720
You can place a cutout
worth minus 30 points.

393
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,360
So you brought them here
to smash them?

394
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,890
To throw them away?

395
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,440
They're hard to dispose of.

396
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,540
They look ridiculous.

397
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,870
- What did you do with your neck?
- What?

398
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,540
What did you do with your neck?

399
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,780
(Jae Suk can't understand.)

400
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,840
What did you do?

401
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,910
I just did this.

402
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,710
It's something he does all the time.

403
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,840
Each member of the attacking team...

404
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,190
will break a door
by swinging the sandbag.

405
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,090
The team's score will be
determined by the points...

406
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,110
on the members' helmets
or the cutout behind the door.

407
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,700
Each team's score will determine
its ranking,

408
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,060
and the one with a higher score
within each team...

409
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,460
goes to a higher floor.

410
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

411
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,200
- I'll take all the coins this time.
- Me too.

412
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,840
- You're all broke.
- I won't go easy this time.

413
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,600
- You have nothing.
- I won't go easy.

414
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,230
- We have to decide the teams?
- We have to decide the teams?

415
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,680
- Yellow?
- Yellow.

416
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,040
- Green.
- Good.

417
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,840
Ji Hyo, we have to win first place.

418
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,110
- You're worth 10 points?
- I'm worth 10 points.

419
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,210
I'm worth 20 points.

420
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,510
I don't want to give them points.

421
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,010
I really don't want to.

422
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,240
In the first round,

423
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,980
we should all stand
behind the same door.

424
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,560
In the first round,
it's hard to guess.

425
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,960
- The chances are low.
- The chances...

426
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,330
- Right.
- Let's stick together.

427
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,330
Which one? Number one?

428
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,220
(As Suk Jin says, they will all
stand behind the same door.)

429
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,340
- Hurry up!
- We'll stand behind door three.

430
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,630
Let's place the cutout first.

431
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,340
In the worst case,
we'll choose the cutout.

432
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,180
Let's go for something
that you don't choose.

433
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,230
Okay.

434
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,680
- Something you don't choose.
- Okay.

435
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,320
(The cutout pops up.)

436
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,340
(Is that a mistake?)

437
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,380
(They're trying to confuse them.)

438
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,160
You know Ji Hyo doesn't
fall for such a trick, right?

439
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,490
- Forget about it.
- She's already made up her mind.

440
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,260
(Their strategy fails,
and they become flustered.)

441
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,360
(What do we do now?)

442
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,760
Let me tell you
where the cutout is.

443
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,460
(Again?)

444
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
- Here's the cutout.
- Here's the cutout.

445
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,730
(Kwang Soo pops up.)

446
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,840
Here's the cutout.

447
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,470
The cutout is behind
door number three.

448
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,470
That's not a cutout.

449
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,590
(The cutout is shocked.)

450
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,710
Okay.

451
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,880
(The real cutout is behind
door number 1.)

452
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,560
(They're deciding where to stand.)

453
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,660
Time's up.

454
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,830
Everything is ready.

455
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,200
You can't move anymore.

456
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,860
Please swing the sandbag now.

457
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,920
Just avoid the cutout.

458
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,500
You can go beyond the line.

459
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,010
Okay. Ji Hyo.

460
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,930
- One...
- Just a second.

461
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,040
- Number two.
- Hold on.

462
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,740
- You choose number 2?
- I choose number 2.

463
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,340
(That means Ji Hyo will
go for another number.)

464
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,750
Is Kwang Soo here?

465
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,870
(Panicking)

466
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,110
- Here?
- Good.

467
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,320
Throw it hard.

468
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,760
You choose number two?

469
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,110
Which number do you choose?

470
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,650
Number four?

471
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,060
(Ji Hyo chooses number 4.)

472
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,030
- Should I stand in front of it?
- Yes.

473
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,090
Yes, like that.

474
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,090
(No!)

475
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,160
(Haha covers his mouth.)

476
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,600
(If she breaks door number 4,
she gets 250 points.)

477
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,870
(It hits between the doors.)

478
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,480
(That was close.)

479
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,440
(Ji Hyo missed her target.)

480
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,320
- Ji Hyo!
- It's heavy.

481
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,950
You must have scared them.

482
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,350
It's so hard.

483
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,850
Which one are you aiming for?

484
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,530
- Number 3.
- 3?

485
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,030
(She switches over
to door number 3.)

486
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,450
(What a relief.)

487
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,840
Oh, gosh.

488
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,360
(Between 3 and 4)

489
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,660
- Where are you aiming at?
- Sorry.

490
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,740
- Ji Hyo, please.
- My aim is off.

491
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,580
(The board gets thumped
right in front of them.)

492
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,870
(It sheds years
off their life expectancy.)

493
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,670
(She would've got them if
her aim had been a little more off.)

494
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,320
You should swing it
from here instead.

495
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,750
Why is this so darn hard?

496
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,380
Ji Hyo, I want to
see them surprised.

497
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,090
(Which door will she
aim for this time?)

498
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,490
2, 3.

499
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,120
2, 3.

500
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,730
- Oh, no.
- Nice!

501
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,190
- Nice!
- Yes!

502
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,130
(No one's there.)

503
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,310
- You were behind number four?
- I thought so.

504
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,340
What did I tell you?

505
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,840
- I thought we were busted.
- That was so close.

506
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
Was the cutout
behind door number two?

507
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,220
- No, number one.
- You startled all of us.

508
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,140
- We should've chosen number four.
- Gosh.

509
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,680
- That was so close.
- Was that an option?

510
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,220
I chose door number four,
but it bounced off.

511
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,290
The aim was off,
and it went to number three.

512
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,910
Your bad aim
actually made us more anxious.

513
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,950
(It sent chills down their spine.)

514
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,920
You can't stand behind
door number three anymore.

515
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

516
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm not going to stall.

517
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,420
- Figure out where the cutout is.
- Sure.

518
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,800
I won't hesitate. Just watch.

519
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
(It's Jae Suk's turn
to fling the sandbag.)

520
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,010
(The cutout is placed
behind door 1 again.)

521
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,510
(Jae Suk suddenly goes somewhere.)

522
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,080
(Where is he going?)

523
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,440
(He tries to climb the set.)

524
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,140
(He's hoping to take a peek.)

525
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
(Peek-a-boo!)

526
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,490
(The director fails
to keep in his laughter.)

527
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,650
(Why is he suddenly laughing?)

528
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,590
(Haha senses
that something is wrong.)

529
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,650
Jae Suk.

530
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,970
(What are you doing?)

531
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,230
Jae Suk.

532
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,540
(His plan fails.)

533
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,040
- What?
- What?

534
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Seriously?

535
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,310
- Jae Suk.
- What now?

536
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,510
- Seriously?
- As if I'd really take a peek.

537
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,400
- What's wrong with you?
- I was only joking.

538
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,980
You cheeky monkey.
Did you climb up there?

539
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,780
(The man of mischief
is hard to contain.)

540
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,510
I thought of that too, you know.

541
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,580
Hurry up then.

542
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,820
Unbelievable.

543
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,020
(It almost succeeded.)

544
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,320
How about number four?

545
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,340
(Like last time)

546
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,020
(They decide
to stand together again.)

547
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,450
Just follow your heart.

548
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,880
But I always make the wrong choice.

549
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,850
- Except that one.
- Right.

550
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,150
It could be number four again.

551
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,530
Four?

552
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,160
That could be their choice.

553
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,120
Let's play
rock-paper-scissors for it.

554
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,860
Which one?

555
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,040
(Which one will Kwang Soo choose?)

556
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,840
(Kwang Soo chooses number 1.)

557
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,970
(They'll stand behind door 1,
and the cutout will be behind 2.)

558
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,170
Four?

559
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,170
Choose one except four then.

560
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,510
- Okay.
- Choose one except door four.

561
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,550
- Except for door number four?
- Yes, because that's your choice.

562
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,580
- One out of the two then.
- Right.

563
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,640
(They'll choose between
door 1 and door 2.)

564
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,940
The choice has been made.

565
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,650
- But I'm feeling door number four.
- No.

566
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,490
(He has terrible hunches.)

567
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,260
(They try not to laugh.)

568
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,920
You saw what happened.

569
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,360
The cutout was close
to the door you chose.

570
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,690
Then I'll choose either
door 1 or door 2.

571
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,090
(Please choose door number 2.)

572
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,130
Door number two?

573
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,660
(He's the worst at choosing things.)

574
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,870
(The cutout is behind
door number 2.)

575
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,100
(Please choose door 2.)

576
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,200
Door number four?

577
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,600
- Door number 2.
- 2?

578
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,550
But door number two
doesn't feel right.

579
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,720
- Then door number one.
- Okay.

580
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,790
(Ji Hyo's hunches are always right.)

581
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,850
We'll stay away from the one
that I chose.

582
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,330
I'll choose number one
as Ji Hyo suggested.

583
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,620
Wait. Didn't you hear something?

584
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,630
When I said "number one,"
someone gasped.

585
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,630
Hold on a second.

586
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,900
I definitely heard it.

587
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,810
- I think we're right.
- It must be number one.

588
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,900
Someone definitely gasped.

589
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,370
I'm sure of it.
Could I have imagined that?

590
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,320
Let me do this then.
I'll go for door number one.

591
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,050
(Bingo!)

592
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,110
What?

593
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,490
My gosh.

594
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,590
- Goodness.
- What?

595
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,150
Who on earth gasped?

596
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,350
Who made the noise?

597
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,560
Who gasped earlier?

598
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,530
Who gasped?

599
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,660
I can't believe it.

600
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,800
- No way.
- That was incredible.

601
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,430
You were close
to choosing four though.

602
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,510
I wanted to choose four
more than anything.

603
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,600
- You win 250 points.
- How can you exclude number 4?

604
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,900
250 points?

605
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,600
- If it weren't for Ji Hyo...
- Unbelievable.

606
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,600
- How annoying.
- This is incredible.

607
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,370
Excluding what Jae Suk chose...

608
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,670
- worked.
- Exactly.

609
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,140
What a good guess.

610
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,140
(The Golden Hand is back.)

611
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,320
That was hilarious.

612
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,410
Why don't we stand
separately this time?

613
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,950
Right, sounds good.

614
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,350
We can't let them score
in the first round.

615
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,590
- We'll stand together first.
- Yes, in the first round.

616
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,830
We'll stand separately
in the next round.

617
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,570
Otherwise, we can't stop them
from coming out on top.

618
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,120
We need to stand together
in the first round.

619
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,830
I hope you make the right choice.

620
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,160
(Kwang Soo heads somewhere.)

621
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,200
(He goes up to the curtain...)

622
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
(and walks behind it.)

623
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,600
Where should I put the cutout?
You can tell us.

624
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,980
- The cutout?
- I'll put it where you want.

625
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,250
Where should I put the cutout?

626
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,720
Well...

627
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,170
(Movement)

628
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,720
I'll put it where you want.
Where should I put the cutout?

629
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,950
Who's that over there?

630
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,990
(Busted!)

631
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,420
Who's where?

632
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,790
It's one of the cameramen.

633
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,260
(Se Chan plays dumb.)

634
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,500
(She attacks the cameraman.)

635
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,470
- You...
- Get over here.

636
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,470
Get out.

637
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,660
- What are you trying to do?
- Why is he always like this?

638
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,840
How did you find out?

639
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,240
- Must you play dirty?
- What's wrong with you?

640
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,430
- He always messes things up.
- I almost saw it.

641
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,480
(I almost got a peek.)

642
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,750
(The cutout is placed
behind door number 2.)

643
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,220
They might see the shadow.

644
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,550
United we stand and divided we fall.

645
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,610
(Snap)

646
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,790
That came from door number two.

647
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,090
(She tries to throw them off.)

648
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,420
(That came from door number 2.)

649
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,760
Then I'm never choosing number two.

650
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,880
(I won't be fooled.)

651
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,390
That was either Suk Jin or Haha.

652
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,660
You have 10 seconds.

653
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,970
Are you done?

654
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,470
(Everyone playing defense
chooses number 3.)

655
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,590
Have you made up your minds?

656
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,900
Which one?

657
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
(Which number will
Kwang Soo choose?)

658
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,980
- Number 3. We choose number 3.
- Number 3.

659
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,280
(Number 3!)

660
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,280
(My gosh.)

661
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,550
Number three. Are you sure?

662
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,610
(They signal the staff.)

663
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,940
(Number 2?)

664
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,650
(Number 3?)

665
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,060
(They're trying to read the staff.)

666
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,150
(They want a hint from the staff.)

667
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,330
- Got it. So that's where you are.
- All right!

668
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,330
One...

669
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,240
(Instead of door number 3
where they all are,)

670
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,970
(he swings the sandbag
into the cutout.)

671
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,510
The cutout!

672
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
(His eyes widen.)

673
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,940
It was the cutout.

674
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,170
(Changing his choice
was the wrong move.)

675
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,640
Kwang Soo hit himself.

676
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,140
Are you kidding me?

677
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,490
You hit the cutout
of yourself instead.

678
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,720
You chose the wrong door.

679
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,880
I can't believe this happened.

680
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,110
- Do we get another chance?
- Okay.

681
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,260
Darn it.

682
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,030
You used Kwang Soo's cutout,
so only So Min's cutout is left.

683
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,650
- Can we still place one?
- Yes.

684
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,950
Yes, So Min's cutout.

685
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,690
Door number two
isn't an option now.

686
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,630
- Door 2 is out.
- It's either door 1, 3, or 4.

687
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,740
You're in last place
with minus 30 points.

688
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,740
Let's think about this.

689
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,080
(The cutout is placed
behind door 3 first.)

690
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,870
Guys, make your choices.

691
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,980
(You stand behind number 1.)

692
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,200
You can only choose between
door 1, 3, or 4.

693
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
(Only Jae Suk stands
behind door number 4.)

694
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,610
Your choice is final.

695
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,320
(They made their choices.)

696
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,250
- Which one?
- The cutout was behind door two.

697
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,380
They'll never guess that
we'd choose door two again.

698
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,090
- We can't.
- Number two isn't an option.

699
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,490
How stupid are you?

700
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,830
Did you just call me stupid?

701
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,920
You're no better than your cutout.

702
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,830
That's how idiotic you sounded.

703
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,730
Here we go. One,

704
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,190
two...

705
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,660
I bet you're nervous.

706
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,800
(They'll receive 150 points
if they choose door number 1.)

707
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,930
Here we go!

708
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,170
(They'll receive 100 points
if they choose door number 4.)

709
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,340
Let's do this!

710
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,640
Let's do this!

711
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,170
(The sandbag knocks
the cutout of So Min.)

712
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,440
Let's do this!

713
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,290
- What?
- It was the cutout.

714
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,320
The cutout?

715
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,920
- You managed to find both.
- It was the cutout again.

716
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,760
It was the cutout again.

717
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,950
- Really?
- It was the cutout again.

718
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,230
See for yourself.

719
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,970
How can you choose it
twice in a row?

720
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,860
- Unbelievable.
- What are the odds?

721
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,130
You guys are incredible.

722
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,070
I'm amazed, guys.

723
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,510
- My gosh.
- How can this be?

724
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,400
- Do we have minus 60 points then?
- That's right.

725
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,740
So the results are out.

726
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,340
Jae Suk and Ji Hyo won the game.

727
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,320
Jae Suk who received 250 points
will head to the 8th floor.

728
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,370
(Jae Suk will be on the 8th floor.)

729
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,820
Ji Hyo gets to be on the seventh.

730
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,180
So Min will be on the sixth floor,

731
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,610
and Suk Jin will be on the fifth.

732
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,950
You'll now head
to your designated floors.

733
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,420
Unbelievable.

734
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,420
If only I was on the seventh floor.

735
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,090
- So Min.
- Yes?

736
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,160
- Can you leave me some?
- Have faith in me.

737
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,420
- I mean it.
- You can trust me.

738
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,930
The way we're positioned
leaves me no hope.

739
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,970
(He sees no hope.)

740
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,860
- Only a fool would be hopeful.
- Well, I am.

741
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,510
For the second time around,
you'll be sharing the coins.

742
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,510
Like last time,
there are a total of 80 coins.

743
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,940
The belt will travel
from the eighth floor...

744
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,640
and stop in front of you
for about 10 seconds.

745
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,250
I'm somewhat glad
that Ji Hyo's next.

746
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,910
I won't get greedy this time.

747
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,220
Leave me some!

748
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,120
Sure. I won't get greedy.

749
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,620
There's nothing here.

750
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,570
(Jae Suk received zero coins during
the first round of coin sharing.)

751
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,190
There's nothing here.

752
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,240
(No one knows
the exact price of the prizes.)

753
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,860
(Jae Suk is in a dilemma
over the coins.)

754
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,540
If Jae Suk only takes 10,
we'll follow suit.

755
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,200
- The belt will start moving now.
- Sure.

756
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,220
(Pondering)

757
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,720
Gosh.

758
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,680
(How many will he take?)

759
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,830
Jae Suk's not the selfish type.

760
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,730
Of course he isn't.

761
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,530
Which floor was he on
during the first round?

762
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,950
The second floor.

763
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,230
Is Jae Suk done already?

764
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,830
Already?

765
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,590
(Next up is Ji Hyo
on the 7th floor.)

766
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,860
(She flashes a smile
with mixed emotions.)

767
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,540
Didn't I leave you a decent amount?

768
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,040
Yes, you did.

769
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,780
- You already have a lot.
- Okay.

770
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,430
I won't get greedy this time.

771
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,810
I won't be greedy.

772
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,550
- My bag is already opened.
- Think long-term.

773
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,370
At least leave me a few.

774
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,480
Okay.

775
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,910
My bag is already opened.

776
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,910
Jae Suk, you're too much.

777
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,680
(Jae Suk, you're too much.)

778
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,760
(Jae Suk took 50.)

779
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,890
Ji Hyo, you are...

780
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,360
- Let's all live.
- Jae Suk.

781
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,000
You're too much. I will...

782
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,600
- Let's all live.
- Just know...

783
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,340
Just know today
will be full of twists.

784
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,370
- So Min.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

785
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,040
- So Min.
- Gosh, this is too much.

786
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,640
You and I were on the same team.

787
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,140
Goodness.

788
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,170
(She sweeps it in
without thinking about it.)

789
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,110
My goodness.

790
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,840
Seriously.

791
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,910
- 1, 2, 3.
- Hey, So Min.

792
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,350
(She leaves 5 according to
the number of remaining people.)

793
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,180
Jeon So Min, you are seriously...

794
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,530
Jae Suk, are you trying
to place the blame on me?

795
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,620
I was so surprised when I saw
how many were left.

796
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,970
How many did you take?

797
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,500
- Be conscientious, okay?
- My goodness.

798
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,740
- My goodness.
- Be conscientious.

799
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,900
- Jeon So Min, you are seriously...
- Jae Suk.

800
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,810
I've opened up my bag.

801
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,900
(I wonder how many are left.)

802
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,250
I was surprised too.

803
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,480
I just took enough for me.

804
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,250
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

805
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,590
- This is too much.
- Should I anticipate something?

806
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,680
(Peeking)

807
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,450
Is it Haha's turn now?

808
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,450
(I was a fool...)

809
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,230
(for anticipating something.)

810
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,590
I honestly believe I left enough
for everyone.

811
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,860
It doesn't even stop for me.

812
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,070
(The conveyor belt
doesn't even stop for me.)

813
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,270
My gosh.

814
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,500
(Drive-thru)

815
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,130
Goodness. So Min, I didn't think
you'd do that.

816
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,100
Why would it stop?
There's nothing there.

817
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,080
Just end it here.

818
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,200
Why are you making us see it?

819
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,320
Why would it stop
if there's nothing there?

820
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,340
You never know.

821
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,990
There's nothing to collect,
why would it stop?

822
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,220
(As expected.)

823
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,150
- Forget it.
- Why are we like this?

824
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,880
- Goodness.
- The second coin division is over.

825
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,620
- We'll move on to the next mission.
- Yes.

826
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,730
(Let's move on to the next mission.)

827
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,160
I'm not good at this game.

828
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,160
You have to choose the right seat.
Is this a team game?

829
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
They're balloons.

830
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,540
They must have different meanings
since they are in different colors.

831
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,540
This is hard. This is really hard.

832
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,970
If you don't acknowledge
the truth about you,

833
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,100
the balloon above your head
will get thinner.

834
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,280
This game is called
I Saw Running Man.

835
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,340
"I Saw Running Man"?

836
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,340
It's a play on the movie,
"I Saw The Devil".

837
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,670
A few weeks ago,
we asked our viewers...

838
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,090
to share stories if they saw,
encountered,

839
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,260
or heard of the Running Man members.

840
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,950
- Right, it was aired.
- I saw it too.

841
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,490
We received a lot of stories
through emails...

842
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,680
- and Instagram DMs.
- Did you receive a lot?

843
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,800
- Did you receive a lot?
- Yes.

844
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,590
Is it okay to do that
without confirming if it's true?

845
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,530
You will be confirming if it's true
through this segment.

846
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,420
- Can we can deny it if it's false?
- Okay.

847
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,930
(There were thousands of stories
that were submitted.)

848
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,470
(Among them, 99 percent were
moving stories about the members.)

849
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,200
(We have swallowed our tears
and taken them out.)

850
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,780
We've also taken out the ones
that can't be aired.

851
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,670
Don't watch today's episode!

852
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,220
This is... Hold on. How can...

853
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,880
I'm sure you've taken out
all the moving stories.

854
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,380
There were so many moving stories
that we've taken them out.

855
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,150
- Right. I was sure you did.
- You should've kept them in.

856
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,620
- You have to include them.
- I'm sure I have a lot.

857
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm an expert of moving stories.

858
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,230
In comparison to what I do, there
aren't many moving stories about me.

859
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,470
Who had the least amount of
moving stories?

860
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,270
- Who had the most negative stories?
- Who didn't have moving stories?

861
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,860
Yang Se Chan and Haha had the least
number of moving stories.

862
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,600
Goodness.
They are good at keeping secrets.

863
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
Goodness.

864
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,010
- You're all loyal.
- Like "The King with Donkey Ears".

865
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,240
They're all loyal.

866
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,510
- I have a lot of moving stories.
- I have a lot too.

867
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,550
So we are...

868
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,870
going to give each member the files
containing the members' stories...

869
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,490
excluding their own.

870
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,560
You can choose whichever story
you'd like about Jae Suk.

871
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,060
- Okay.
- After they read it,

872
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,990
according to the number of stories
you can't admit to,

873
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,990
the layers of the balloon will be
removed.

874
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,150
- Goodness.
- After everyone has gone,

875
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,690
the layers will be removed,
and the person...

876
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,590
whose balloon pops first
will come in last place.

877
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,890
- If you deny it, you lose a layer.
- You can admit to everything then.

878
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,890
You can admit it.

879
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,010
- But they could be false.
- That's right.

880
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,070
You can admit it
despite it being false.

881
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,280
You have to clarify
the false ones though.

882
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,310
(Looking)

883
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,480
(Fiddling)

884
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,340
Suk Jin seems really nervous.

885
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,080
- Why are you fiddling?
- Suk Jin seems really nervous.

886
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,670
(Suk Jin seems very nervous
about this corner.)

887
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,990
- He keeps playing with his hands.
- He seems very nervous.

888
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,520
- Goodness.
- Once you take a look,

889
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,850
you'll find that some of them
are very old.

890
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,850
- Really?
- So they may be false.

891
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,450
You can hand out the files...

892
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,730
- to everyone.
- Honestly,

893
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,090
we don't know if it's true or false.

894
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,560
- We might not be aware of it.
- Right.

895
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,300
We might not remember.

896
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,300
- Gosh, this is...
- There are a lot.

897
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,860
- Jae Suk's...
- Goodness.

898
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,510
- Goodness.
- There are some about dating.

899
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,600
You can't deny this.

900
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,480
Aren't Jae Suk's stories
too detailed?

901
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,550
Why?

902
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,310
- Why?
- Oh, my gosh!

903
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,610
Is it okay to start it like this?

904
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,520
You said you filtered them,
but you didn't filter this one?

905
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,610
Yoo Jae Suk, out!

906
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,840
(Jae Suk's stories
are interesting.)

907
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,020
Jae Suk,
your stories are incredible.

908
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,880
- Kyung Eun!
- Why?

909
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,680
Don't watch today's episode!

910
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,060
Gosh, this is... Hold on.

911
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,500
- This is really intense.
- Should I read it?

912
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,860
- It was during high school.
- Reading this,

913
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,800
I'm worried about our stories.

914
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,470
- I know. This is quite intense.
- Gosh, this is...

915
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,200
Okay, everyone.
Take a look at Jae Suk's file,

916
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,540
and whoever wants to start
can read one of them aloud.

917
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,430
- Goodness.
- This is really intense.

918
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,510
These are really detailed.

919
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,170
- Stop exclaiming and read one.
- They're really detailed.

920
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,440
I will read one aloud.

921
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,520
"Hello. I'm Park Hyung Man,
and I live in Washington D.C."

922
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,590
Do you know someone by the name of
Park Hyung Man?

923
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,680
- Hyung Man is my close friend.
- Do you know him?

924
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,150
- Really?
- This one is true!

925
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,850
- Really?
- This is undeniable!

926
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,350
- The real deal is here!
- Hyung Man is my friend.

927
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,530
This is true?

928
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,560
(Does that mean this is true?)

929
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,470
"I'm sure Jae Suk will know
who I am after hearing my name."

930
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,500
- Yes.
- He knows who you are.

931
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,090
He was a good friend of mine
when we were in high school.

932
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,970
"The story I will share with you..."

933
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,240
- "is about..."
- Please continue.

934
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,510
"where Jae Suk had his first kiss."

935
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,780
(This story is about where
Yoo Jae Suk had his first kiss.)

936
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,580
- My first kiss?
- I've never heard this story.

937
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,250
- How does he know?
- Oh, my.

938
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,480
Jae Suk needs to take his family
out for dinner this weekend.

939
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,340
- "It was..."
- It's really detailed.

940
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,910
"sometime between the spring
and summer of our senior year."

941
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,820
- Right.
- Keep that in mind.

942
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,850
"The location was..."

943
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,500
"on a secluded overpass
in Sadang-dong."

944
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,570
Do you remember?

945
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,470
Please continue.

946
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,390
On a secluded overpass
in Sadang-dong.

947
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,840
Please continue.

948
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,810
- He must've gone there often.
- But...

949
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,100
He wasn't there. How does he know?

950
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,900
He must've been hiding
and watching you.

951
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,280
"I remember how he told us
at the school store the next day."

952
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,610
(I remember how he told us
at the school store the next day.)

953
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,220
Goodness, this is fun.

954
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,720
(Goodness, this is fun.)

955
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,260
(His robotic reactions are in full
swing at his friend's disclosure.)

956
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,260
He told his friends about
his first kiss.

957
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,220
He has lost his mind.
He has gone insane.

958
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,390
Are you really my friend?

959
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,800
It's really his friend.

960
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,300
- "One more thing."
- Okay.

961
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,240
"In high school, after breaking up
with his girlfriend."

962
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,300
"He gave me the photographs, gifts,
and letters he received from her..."

963
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,510
"and asked me..."

964
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,870
(He gave me the photographs, gifts,
and letters he received from her.)

965
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,100
"to get rid of them for him."

966
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,470
I did?

967
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,850
- Jae Suk did that?
- How lame.

968
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,970
How lame.

969
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,280
He asked him to get rid of them.

970
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,180
I don't remember the latter half
of the story.

971
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,280
"For your information,
this girl was not his first kiss."

972
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
(For your information,
this girl was not his first kiss.)

973
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,320
- This is a lie.
- He's a player.

974
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,430
- This is true.
- Did he date that many girls?

975
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,030
- What?
- This sounds like a lie.

976
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,820
He was a good friend of mine.

977
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,470
- Goodness.
- He also said this.

978
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,240
"I enjoy your show and have watched
every episode while in the US."

979
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,240
"I hope you continue to make
a fun and original..."

980
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,410
Are you kidding me?

981
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,350
"I hope that you continue to give
joy to viewers like me,"

982
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,570
"who are abroad and wait for your
show every week, for a long time."

983
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,220
Goodness. Hyung Man.

984
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Hyung Man.
Let's give him a round of applause.

985
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,780
Thank you, Hyung Man.

986
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,090
Hyung Man is a good friend of mine.

987
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,350
It is true I had my first kiss
on an overpass.

988
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,930
- Really?
- Really?

989
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,800
All the details aren't correct,
but the kiss is true.

990
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,800
- How cool.
- I admit it.

991
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,870
- Can I read this one?
- Which one?

992
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,340
- Go ahead.
- Is it okay?

993
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,740
- I will read this one.
- Okay.

994
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,430
Okay. Gosh, this is...

995
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,340
"Confident Yoo Jae Suk,
Whom I Met at a Sauna".

996
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,470
(Title: "Confident Yoo Jae Suk,
Whom I Met at a Sauna")

997
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,070
(The title is already interesting.)

998
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,740
I will read this while standing.

999
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,620
"Confident Yoo Jae Suk,
Whom I Met at a Sauna".

1000
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,450
- I'm dumbfounded.
- Let's find out if this is true.

1001
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,090
- I don't know who it is, but...
- The title is funny.

1002
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:56,590
"About a year ago, I was hanging out
at the R Hotel sauna in Sinsa-dong."

1003
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,990
That's where Jae Suk goes.

1004
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,470
"There was a commotion inside
the sauna, so I went in."

1005
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,320
"I saw that
Jae Suk and Suk Jin..."

1006
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,340
That's right. I went with Suk Jin.

1007
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,700
- We went together.
- "came to the sauna."

1008
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,970
It's true. I went with Suk Jin.

1009
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,870
"Despite the many eyes looking
at them,"

1010
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,640
"they calmly undressed
and entered the sauna."

1011
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,470
"Their preferences
were the exact opposite."

1012
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,510
("Their preferences
were the exact opposite.")

1013
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,870
This is the truth.

1014
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,970
This is the funny part.

1015
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,450
"Suk Jin seemed a bit embarrassed
and covered himself with a towel..."

1016
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,590
"and entered with his bottom
sticking out."

1017
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,050
"Whereas, Jae Suk did not cover up
and entered confidently."

1018
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,220
Okay.

1019
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,490
- "Furthermore..."
- That's all a lie!

1020
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,570
- "Furthermore,"
- What are you saying?

1021
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,370
"he wore his glasses,
so everyone could recognize him."

1022
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,300
Everyone could tell
he was Yoo Jae Suk.

1023
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,010
"I respect your confidence,
Jae Suk."

1024
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,030
- Thank you.
- Is this true?

1025
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,510
(Yoo Jae Suk, the man who
is confident in the sauna.)

1026
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,350
Thank you. Although
I don't know you personally.

1027
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,570
- We went there.
- I remember.

1028
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,350
I went with Suk Jin.

1029
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,550
- We went to the R Hotel once.
- Right.

1030
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,180
It's right next to Suk Jin's home.

1031
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,260
- Yes. Suk Jin wanted to go.
- It's right next door.

1032
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,590
Is this true? Do you admit it?

1033
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,490
- I admit this.
- Do you?

1034
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,720
- I went there about a year ago.
- Really?

1035
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,300
- I went with Suk Jin.
- Yes.

1036
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,160
- It's true?
- It's right next to my home.

1037
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,660
Next,
we'll read Kwang Soo's stories.

1038
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,340
- Gosh, Kwang Soo.
- He has a lot of stories.

1039
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,640
Should we read Kim Ju Hyun's story?

1040
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,870
- Kim Ju Yeon?
- Kim Ju Hyun.

1041
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,010
"Hello. I am studying to become an
anchor at B Academy in Sinsa-dong."

1042
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,640
"On March 23 at around 6 p.m.,"

1043
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,950
"I got on the elevator after class."

1044
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,590
"Surprisingly, Kwang Soo was inside
the elevator."

1045
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,680
Goodness.

1046
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,990
"He's a superstar, so I couldn't
say hello to him and got in."

1047
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,680
- Goodness.
- "At that time,"

1048
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,300
"Kwang Soo had hurt his leg, so I
thought he was there for a checkup."

1049
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,850
- It wasn't too long ago.
- It was when you hurt your leg.

1050
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,470
"But there is only a plastic surgeon
and a hair loss clinic there."

1051
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,990
(But there is only a plastic surgeon
and a hair loss clinic there.)

1052
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,910
(Kwang Soo went to a plastic surgeon
or a hair loss clinic.)

1053
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,010
Where did Kwang Soo go that day?

1054
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,700
He must be losing a lot of hair
these days.

1055
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,780
Is it plastic surgery or hair loss?

1056
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,570
- What is this?
- Plastic surgery or hair loss?

1057
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,280
- It's neither.
- Plastic surgery or hair loss?

1058
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,510
- Where is it?
- What is this?

1059
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,070
You can go to those places.

1060
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,090
- I can go, but I didn't.
- You can go.

1061
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,820
I don't have hair loss.

1062
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,180
- You can go, if needed.
- At some point,

1063
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,590
he got thick and luxuriant hair...

1064
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,180
- on the back of his head.
- He got more hair.

1065
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,160
Are you saying I got a lot
of back hair after a treatment?

1066
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,490
So I thought he had
some back hair implanted.

1067
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,800
Why would I do that?

1068
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,100
You usually implant back hair
on the top of your head.

1069
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,070
I thought he implanted the top hair
on the back of his head.

1070
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,760
- I guess this is what happened.
- What?

1071
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,260
Maybe that's when I went
to Jong Myung's clinic.

1072
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,470
- My brother's clinic?
- Yes.

1073
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,740
I got treatment for this.

1074
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,470
That's true. The building of
Jong Myung's clinic...

1075
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,970
has an announcer academy.

1076
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,370
- That's true.
- That's what it is.

1077
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,740
Okay. I admit it.

1078
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,990
That's where I went.

1079
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,820
There's a hair loss clinic too.

1080
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,050
- So Ju Hyun told us the truth.
- That's right.

1081
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,450
- It's true.
- It is true.

1082
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,660
- This is really funny.
- Go ahead and read it.

1083
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,530
"I worked at the A club
in Sinsa-dong..."

1084
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,970
"as a server of the VIP Zone
a few years ago."

1085
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,570
- Don't be nervous, Kwang Soo.
- It's so detailed.

1086
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,800
- Kwang Soo, don't worry.
- That's not true.

1087
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,160
I don't know what it is,
but it's not true.

1088
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,410
- Kwang Soo, don't be nervous.
- It's a detailed story.

1089
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,510
- What does he know about me?
- No. It's okay, Kwang Soo.

1090
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,700
This is really fun.

1091
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,180
Kwang Soo, we don't have anything
that can't be aired on TV.

1092
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,450
- Don't worry.
- Are you sure?

1093
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,120
- Just listen.
- It will be okay.

1094
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,240
"Kwang Soo came
to the club by himself."

1095
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,140
To the club?

1096
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,410
- Really?
- To a club?

1097
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,550
- Flex.
- He went to a club alone?

1098
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,530
"I was in charge of his table,
so I was waiting for him to order."

1099
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,030
"Then he suddenly asked..."

1100
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,600
- "how old I was."
- What? That's so rude.

1101
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,100
- Did I...
- He suddenly asked it.

1102
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,740
"I was a little flustered,
but I told him that I was 29."

1103
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,640
"Kwang Soo said, 'I see.'"

1104
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:36,180
"Then he started to dance around
all by himself."

1105
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,950
- That's ridiculous.
- Why?

1106
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,140
- It doesn't make sense.
- What was that?

1107
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,370
- "How old are you?"
- Go ahead and dance.

1108
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,550
What's that?

1109
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,350
- What were you doing?
- Can you believe that?

1110
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,220
- What were you up to?
- It doesn't make sense.

1111
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,890
Why did you ask him about his age
and started to dance?

1112
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,660
Did you not go there alone?
Who did you go with?

1113
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,320
I once went to a club with you.

1114
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,390
- And I went there with Haha.
- When did I do that?

1115
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,660
You were...

1116
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,430
- When did I go?
- What is he talking about?

1117
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,510
- I didn't go to a club with you.
- Look at Suk Jin.

1118
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,930
Why are you feeling nervous?

1119
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,970
He seems very nervous.

1120
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,550
Why did Suk Jin get nervous
after you brought it up?

1121
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,180
(Suk Jin is feeling ill at ease.)

1122
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,220
- What did you do?
- That's not true.

1123
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,010
- Do you not admit it?
- I don't.

1124
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,320
Okay.

1125
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,490
It will get thinner then.

1126
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,620
This one sounds arrogant.

1127
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,720
Let me read this story.

1128
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,050
She went to Hongdae
when she was the sixth grader.

1129
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,890
And she saw
a tall guy in a red cap...

1130
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,470
- walking towards her.
- He does wear a red cap a lot.

1131
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,720
- That's what he often wears.
- It must be a true story.

1132
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,430
"I wondered who it was,
and it was Kwang Soo."

1133
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,930
"As he walked past me, I said this."

1134
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,660
"Gosh, it's Lee Kwang Soo."

1135
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,030
"Then he looked at me..."

1136
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,430
- "and winked at me."
- How could you...

1137
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,350
You're just ridiculous.

1138
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,370
- He thinks he's a big celebrity.
- Hey.

1139
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,620
- He's so sick.
- You're unbelievable.

1140
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,850
I admit the previous one,
and I don't admit this one.

1141
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,910
- This isn't true.
- Why did he wink at her?

1142
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,760
Only huge stars wink at fans.

1143
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,990
- I rarely wink at all.
- He winked?

1144
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,550
- I saw him wink.
- Why would you wink?

1145
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,350
- I saw him wink before.
- He does.

1146
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,600
He was eating at Haha's restaurant.

1147
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,840
When some customers
recognized him, he suddenly...

1148
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,740
(He winked at the customers.)

1149
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,140
- I don't usually wink.
- I saw that too.

1150
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,010
We were shooting Running Man.

1151
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,840
We've done a lot of stuff with mud
at mudflats.

1152
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,680
After he took a shower,
he looked into a mirror.

1153
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,780
And he...

1154
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,510
- What are you talking about?
- I was so shocked.

1155
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,780
That's absurd.

1156
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,140
I don't usually wink at all.

1157
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,220
I winked at an elementary
school kid on the street?

1158
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,680
- You'd do that.
- You're really...

1159
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,050
I thought it was true
when I heard about a red cap,

1160
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,300
but I don't admit it.

1161
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,800
Gosh, I'm so upset.

1162
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,660
Shall we move on to Jong Kook?

1163
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,260
- Gosh, this is...
- Read it for us.

1164
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,030
A lot of stories about Jong Kook...

1165
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,340
- are from L.A.
- They all are from L.A.

1166
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,030
Stories from L.A.?

1167
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,660
There are a lot
of stories about L.A.

1168
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,970
Hang on.

1169
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,410
- My gosh.
- Isn't that true?

1170
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,510
Let's hear it.

1171
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,010
Can I read this story from L.A.?

1172
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,950
"I'm a college student
who lives in L.A., California. "

1173
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,950
"One day, I went downtown
and saw Jong Kook there."

1174
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:01,090
"He was wearing black pants, a black
shirt, black mask, and black cap."

1175
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,390
- "His whole body was covered,"
- I don't dress like that in L.A.

1176
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,220
- "but I could tell it was him."
- I will hear it anyway.

1177
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,120
"I was excited to see a Korean
celebrity in a foreign country,"

1178
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,890
"so I went to get his autograph."

1179
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:16,470
"But there was a woman
who looked like a Korean American."

1180
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,240
"She was coming out of a cafe
with some coffee."

1181
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,550
- Listen.
- What are you talking about?

1182
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,780
- All right.
- Okay.

1183
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,620
- Go ahead and read it.
- He has a girl in L.A.

1184
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,510
- "Jong Kook got..."
- Okay.

1185
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,820
- "a coffee from her casually."
- And?

1186
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,660
"Then he went his way with her."

1187
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,260
"So I couldn't talk to him."

1188
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,760
"The woman who looked fabulous."

1189
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,030
"She's your girlfriend, isn't she?"

1190
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,100
- This one is good.
- We have to check the fact.

1191
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,760
- She looked like a Korean American.
- I'm telling you the truth.

1192
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,700
There are a lot
of photos of you in L.A.

1193
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,430
You see?

1194
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,530
- Are there photos?
- Photos?

1195
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,910
- There are a lot.
- We have photos.

1196
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,740
- Are there photos?
- We have to reveal the truth.

1197
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,200
Did you walk around the streets
dressed like this?

1198
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,780
This is a long time ago.
I was a member of Turbo.

1199
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:00,910
I guess there were times
when I traveled around with women.

1200
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,620
I won't deny it.

1201
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,350
- Did you get a coffee from a woman?
- But it's not like...

1202
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,550
I was alone
with a Korean American woman.

1203
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,530
Did you ever get a coffee
from a woman or not?

1204
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,950
- From a beautiful woman.
- A Korean American.

1205
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,260
There must've been a time
when I got coffee from a woman.

1206
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,550
That's not what I'm talking about.

1207
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,990
That's enough!

1208
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,800
- Just admit it.
- Do you admit it or not?

1209
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,490
Are you from the National
Intelligence Service or what?

1210
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,760
- Just tell us.
- What?

1211
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,680
I might have gotten some coffee.

1212
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,240
- You can't say that.
- That's not right.

1213
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,410
What more do you want?

1214
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,570
- I don't admit it's true.
- Just tell us the truth.

1215
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,600
I don't admit it.

1216
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,140
Is your girlfriend
a Korean American or not?

1217
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,990
Do you have
a girlfriend in L.A. or not?

1218
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,620
I can have
some acquaintances in L.A.

1219
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:39,050
Okay. I admit it.

1220
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,280
- It's done.
- It doesn't matter.

1221
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,090
There's another story about L.A.

1222
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,930
We have a lot of stories from L.A.

1223
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:51,470
"I'm a college
student living in L.A."

1224
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,240
There are a lot of college students.

1225
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,760
"I miss you, Dad."

1226
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:57,840
"I miss you, Dad."

1227
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,370
Is she his daughter?

1228
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,100
- Do you admit it or not?
- What?

1229
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,850
Do you admit it or not?

1230
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:07,720
Is my child a college student?

1231
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,490
- When did I get married?
- Do you admit it?

1232
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,590
- When did I get married?
- "Dad."

1233
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,320
"I miss you, Dad." It says.

1234
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,490
Why do you miss me?
We met last week.

1235
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,660
- Do you admit it?
- I went there last year.

1236
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,030
Listen, Jong Kook.

1237
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,700
I'm 100 percent sure this story
about Jong Kook is true.

1238
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,030
- What?
- This is...

1239
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,530
- What is it now?
- This is how he talks. Listen.

1240
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:28,010
"I'm from Anyang. I've heard a lot
about Jong Kook since I was a kid."

1241
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,030
"In 2006, my friend walked by and
saw Jong Kook shooting a TV show."

1242
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,910
"He got excited and said,
'What? There's Kim Jong Kook.'"

1243
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,070
"And Jong Kook said this."

1244
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,180
"Am I your friend or something?"

1245
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,450
(Jong Kook said,
"Am I your friend or something?")

1246
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,640
- I'm sure it's true.
- You have to admit it.

1247
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,620
- It's true, isn't it?
- It must be true.

1248
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,390
- It's true, right?
- I'm sure.

1249
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,550
- It sounds just like you.
- That's the way he talks.

1250
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,350
- Is it true?
- If a young kid...

1251
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,220
- Do you admit?
- said such a thing to me...

1252
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,160
- in 2006,
- It must be true.

1253
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,430
- it must be true.
- You see?

1254
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,890
"Am I your friend or something?"

1255
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:00,660
While we talk about Jong Kook,
I read stories about So Min.

1256
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,840
- All the stories are about men.
- Really?

1257
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,780
- So Min's stories are unbelievable.
- What do they say?

1258
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,370
- So Min is...
- So Min is...

1259
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,570
They all say that she was with men.

1260
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,950
Let me read one.

1261
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,820
What? That can't be true.

1262
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,390
So Min is...

1263
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,640
I see. I have a lot of male friends.

1264
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,660
- I know.
- I have many friends.

1265
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,050
"So Min Doesn't Seem
Like a Celebrity".

1266
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,490
- That's the title.
- Let's hear it.

1267
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,530
"I saw So Min at a cafe
in Yongridan-gil last winter."

1268
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,820
"She was with a guy."

1269
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,930
(She was with a guy.)

1270
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,970
"When a female celebrity is
out with a guy,"

1271
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,530
- "she would wear a mask."
- Last winter?

1272
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,160
"But So Min revealed her face..."

1273
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,700
"while the guy covered his face."

1274
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,910
(Now she covers her face.)

1275
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,680
- Who was he?
- Gosh, this is...

1276
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,200
- Gosh, So Min.
- I can feel...

1277
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,570
the temperature difference already.

1278
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,070
So who was the guy
who was covering with his face?

1279
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,640
- I can feel the difference already.
- I know.

1280
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,890
- Who was he?
- It was last winter. Who was he?

1281
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:52,260
I guess it was
one of my male friends.

1282
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,280
All right, then.

1283
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,850
Do you go to a cafe a lot
with a male friend?

1284
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,450
- I admit it.
- Do you?

1285
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,820
- Yes, I admit it.
- She admits it.

1286
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,200
Can I read this one?

1287
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,600
- Go ahead, Ji Hyo.
- This is...

1288
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,320
The story was about Yongsan.

1289
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,700
- It says about Yongsan again.
- Is it Yongsan again?

1290
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,030
"Two years ago,"

1291
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,340
"I saw So Min
at a corner of a street..."

1292
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,640
- "behind an apartment in Yongsan."
- This is crazy.

1293
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,780
- "She was wearing a cap..."
- I'm so nervous.

1294
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,280
"pulled down low,
so I didn't recognize her at first."

1295
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,050
"But she was talking loudly on the
phone, so I recognized her voice."

1296
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,320
- "And she sounded quite serious."
- What happened?

1297
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,660
"I'm not sure,"

1298
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,490
"but I guess she was fighting
with her boyfriend."

1299
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,590
"That's what she sounded like."

1300
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,620
- "Unlike her serious voice..."
- Hang on.

1301
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,490
Hang on.

1302
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,220
I will...

1303
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,200
admit it without hearing the story.

1304
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,870
(I will admit it
without hearing the story.)

1305
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,070
(I can tell it's my story
without hearing it.)

1306
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,240
We have to finish the story.

1307
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,100
- No.
- So Min, this is...

1308
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,840
- So Min, just listen.
- Let's hear it.

1309
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,970
- You should hear it.
- No.

1310
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,240
- I don't have to. I admit it.
- Ji Hyo, continue.

1311
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:50,680
Read it calmly.

1312
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,010
"Unlike her serious voice,"

1313
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,680
"it was just a childish
lover's quarrel."

1314
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,140
- It's no big deal.
- And she heard it.

1315
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,820
"'Who should I hang out with then?'"

1316
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,820
"'I want you to hang out with me.'
That's what she said."

1317
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,260
- It sounds like So Min.
- "Who should I hang out with then?"

1318
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,030
"I just walked by
trying to keep a straight face."

1319
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,870
- "Are you still seeing him?"
- Who is it?

1320
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,820
- So Min.
- But So Min's story is...

1321
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,070
I broke up with the guy
two years ago.

1322
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,640
- Really?
- We broke up two years ago.

1323
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,840
I admit it. He was my boyfriend.

1324
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,100
- Okay.
- "In 2013."

1325
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,780
Haha.

1326
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,010
Is there more?

1327
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,950
"I went to watch a musical one day."

1328
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,120
Do you admit it?

1329
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,070
I won't read it anymore.

1330
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,850
Do you admit it?

1331
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,490
I dated all of them secretly.

1332
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:31,990
How did they see me?

1333
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,180
This is crazy.

1334
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,090
You were sitting next to her.

1335
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,050
(She's Love Frog from Yongsan
who can't hide her love.)

1336
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,430
- Everyone knows it except you.
- She saw you there.

1337
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:40,930
(There are a lot
of detailed stories.)

1338
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:44,320
How many of my old boyfriends
are they going to mention?

1339
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,800
There have been three already.

1340
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,370
It was 2014. Do you admit it?

1341
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,340
It was a musical.

1342
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,660
A musical.

1343
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,240
I'll admit it
without hearing the story.

1344
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,180
(She admits it without
hearing the story again.)

1345
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,240
You should read it.

1346
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,970
Let's move on to Haha.

1347
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,720
"I live in the same apartment
complex as Haha."

1348
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,440
(A report from someone who lives
in Haha's apartment complex)

1349
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,110
"Late at night, I saw Haha
get carried on his friend's back..."

1350
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,780
"in a drunken state."

1351
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,800
Admit it. Admit it.

1352
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,880
"The next morning, I saw Haha
send Dream off to the kindergarten."

1353
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,510
"Byul must have scolded him since
he couldn't stand next to her."

1354
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:23,240
"He trailed behind her
like a puppy in the rain."

1355
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,460
I have seen him like that.

1356
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,550
- This is a beautiful story.
- I have seen him like that.

1357
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,780
That's right.

1358
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,280
(I am sorry.)

1359
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,920
Do you admit it or not?

1360
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,420
I admit it.

1361
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:34,530
- Let's move on to Suk Jin.
- Okay.

1362
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,940
I will read this one.
It seems like a good one.

1363
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,630
"This happened at a duty-free shop."

1364
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,360
"The Running Man members
were going abroad that day."

1365
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,840
"'It's Yun Jae Suk!
I have never seen him before!'"

1366
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,210
"The crowd went wild."

1367
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,110
"I also took photos of Jae Suk
with my phone."

1368
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,110
"But when I studied
the photos later, I realized..."

1369
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,170
"that the man next to Jae Suk
wasn't a manager but Suk Jin."

1370
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,380
"He cleared the way for Jae Suk.
I want to apologize."

1371
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,990
Did you clear the way for Jae Suk?

1372
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:57,920
- I cleared the way?
- Yes.

1373
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
I cleared the way for Jae Suk?

1374
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,780
It's belated, but thank you.

1375
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,960
- I never did that!
- This is a heartwarming story.

1376
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,460
Thank you, Jae Suk.

1377
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,320
I simply went my way.

1378
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,920
You should admit it...

1379
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,670
because we saw this happen
many times.

1380
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:13,070
- I cleared the way for Jae Suk?
- Of course. Don't you know?

1381
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:14,900
- You...
- I simply went my way.

1382
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,440
You always do this.

1383
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,030
- You do this.
- That's how you clear the way.

1384
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,970
Suk Jin, you walk like this.

1385
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,550
- Admit it.
- Hey!

1386
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,340
- Don't be ridiculous.
- There are so many photos.

1387
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,880
I don't do that. I walk confidently.

1388
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,420
Suk Jin, you should hold
your head up high.

1389
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,720
What are you talking about?
I don't admit it.

1390
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,460
- It makes Jae Suk uncomfortable.
- What are you talking about?

1391
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,920
- I don't do that.
- Stop making him uncomfortable.

1392
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,320
I don't admit it.

1393
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:39,800
- Shall we read a report on Se Chan?
- Okay.

1394
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,220
Se Chan's story.

1395
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,130
- "I saw Se Chan at the dentist's."
- This one. That's it.

1396
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,240
"Se Chan exited the dentist's
by saying, 'See you next time.'"

1397
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,900
"But the dentist's I go to
specializes in teeth straightening."

1398
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,570
"I couldn't ask the dentist, but..."

1399
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,110
"Se Chan, are you getting
your teeth straightened?"

1400
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:57,550
"Your teeth make me wonder
if I should find another dentist."

1401
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,440
He got his teeth straightened.

1402
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,920
Did you get your teeth straightened?

1403
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,820
- But...
- I got my teeth straightened.

1404
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,990
We should send this person
a present.

1405
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:07,030
- Goodness.
- He got his teeth straightened.

1406
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,360
- It's so funny.
- It's a fact.

1407
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,050
- I was so surprised to find out.
- It's so funny.

1408
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,050
He got his teeth straightened.

1409
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,550
Did you look like a woodpecker
at first?

1410
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,860
- No, I didn't.
- What happened?

1411
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,400
My teeth used to protrude more.

1412
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,530
- Really?
- I get this person's concern.

1413
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:19,970
That dentist's office
specializes in teeth straightening.

1414
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,130
I recommend you to go there.

1415
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,210
- You didn't get it done, did you?
- What do you mean?

1416
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:24,510
- Teeth straightening.
- No, I didn't.

1417
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,570
Who gets his teeth straightened
like this?

1418
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,840
Who gets his front teeth twisted
like this?

1419
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,220
If he had gotten
his teeth straightened,

1420
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,670
I wouldn't have let that dentist be.

1421
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,610
- I would've exploded.
- Who gets...

1422
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:34,780
his front teeth twisted like this?

1423
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,820
- I would have destroyed him.
- I guess your teeth are straight.

1424
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,320
- You got them straightened.
- Yes.

1425
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,920
- I will read a short account.
- Okay.

1426
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,460
"I am a member
of an amateur soccer team."

1427
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,190
"One day, the team had a match
against Jong Kook's team."

1428
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:47,260
"The match started at 10 p.m."

1429
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,220
"When I arrived early
and went to the restroom,"

1430
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,170
"Se Chan was talking on the phone."

1431
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,800
"I couldn't help but overhear
what he was saying."

1432
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,110
"I guess he had agreed to drink
with his friend..."

1433
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:55,670
"because he said he will leave
after the first half."

1434
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:56,940
Hold it right there!

1435
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,030
(He said he will leave
after the first half.)

1436
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,670
(Did he try to escape
after the first half?)

1437
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,050
Who sent that account?

1438
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,300
That's not true. I never did that.

1439
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,420
Jong Kook, when did I ever leave
after the first half?

1440
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,150
I always play soccer
until the very end...

1441
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,050
and go home at 1 a.m.

1442
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,510
- You did leave early once.
- I never did it in order to drink.

1443
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,630
Never. This person is absurd!

1444
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,320
I never said that on the phone.
It's a blatant lie.

1445
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,490
- I don't admit it.
- But it happened.

1446
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,860
- No.
- You did leave early once.

1447
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,860
I never did that.
It's a misunderstanding.

1448
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,570
- I don't admit it.
- It's Ji Hyo's turn.

1449
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,940
- You should admit it.
- I don't admit it.

1450
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,630
Let's read an account on Ji Hyo.

1451
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,940
"I am Ji Hyo's fan
who lives in Yeosu,"

1452
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,400
"Kim Kwang Seong."

1453
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,440
- Do you know him?
- Do you know him?

1454
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,170
- Yes, I do.
- You know him.

1455
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,170
- Yes.
- Really?

1456
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,970
"I always attend
Ji Hyo's fan-signing event."

1457
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:44,820
"Ji Hyo always recognizes me
and greets me warmly."

1458
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,420
"She would ask,
'Did you come from Wando?'"

1459
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,420
"Then I would say,
'No, I came from Yeosu.'"

1460
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,800
(No, I came from Yeosu.)

1461
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,670
(It's definitely a true story.)

1462
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:54,820
It suits her.

1463
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,130
- That's so funny.
- She is unbelievable.

1464
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:57,170
(She can't dispute it.)

1465
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,740
- "At the next fan-signing event,"
- She is unbelievable.

1466
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,800
"she recognized me and greeted me."

1467
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,070
"Did you come from Geoje Island?"

1468
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,880
- She is unbelievable.
- "I told her again..."

1469
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,010
- "that I came from Yeosu."
- She is unbelievable.

1470
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,380
"At the next fan-signing event,"

1471
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,720
"she asked me if I came from Jindo."

1472
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,420
At least she knows Jindo.

1473
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:19,050
- The places are near Yeosu.
- Seriously.

1474
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:23,030
She shocked me
at a fan-signing event in Hong Kong.

1475
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:24,690
She said, "I love Malaysia!"

1476
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,030
She didn't know where she was...

1477
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,590
- or what she was doing.
- That's right.

1478
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,670
That's right.

1479
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,570
It's an account that suits Ji Hyo.

1480
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,030
Do you admit it?

1481
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,740
Yes, I do.

1482
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,780
That's so funny.

1483
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,440
I will read one. The title is,
"Ji Hyo Doesn't Call Back".

1484
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,510
It's a well-known fact.

1485
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:42,840
"A few years ago,
I worked as a staff member..."

1486
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,170
"for a movie Ji Hyo starred in."

1487
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,220
"Ji Hyo and a few staff members
were drinking..."

1488
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,050
"when her phone rang."

1489
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,320
"It vibrated for a while,
but Ji Hyo didn't answer..."

1490
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,010
"and I glanced over at the screen."

1491
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,530
"The caller was Suk Jin."

1492
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,760
(The phone vibrated for a while.)

1493
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:01,090
(Ji Hyo's secret is revealed.)

1494
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,130
Hey!

1495
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:03,740
You...

1496
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,670
- It was purposeful.
- That's too mean.

1497
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,170
How could you screen my call
like that?

1498
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,400
Seriously.

1499
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,440
"She didn't answer until the end.
Did Ji Hyo call him back that day?"

1500
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,740
She hasn't called him back yet.

1501
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,780
She hasn't called me back yet.

1502
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,590
There are a lot of funny accounts.

1503
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:27,820
I must have done that
because I was having fun...

1504
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,150
and wanted
to call Suk Jin back later.

1505
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,920
You mean Suk Jin isn't
as interesting as drinking.

1506
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,420
- It's not like that.
- It is like that.

1507
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,920
- I mean...
- You didn't want to talk to him.

1508
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,490
It's not like that.
I don't think I have ever done that.

1509
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,760
Do you admit it or not?

1510
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,630
I admit it.

1511
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,210
It's understandable.

1512
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,570
In accordance
with the number of "I don't admit",

1513
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,280
we will subtract from 10 layers...

1514
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,240
and hang up the balloons.

1515
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,440
Hang up the balloons.

1516
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,650
- I admitted to every account.
- I didn't expect...

1517
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,590
Hyung Man to send an account.

1518
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:58,610
We will start from So Min and go
in Haha's direction.

1519
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,050
My order is the best.

1520
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,420
Jong Kook's order is the best.

1521
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,690
All right. I will do it lightly.

1522
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,300
I am bad at this.

1523
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,130
- I will do it lightly.
- So Min is bold.

1524
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,860
(What will be the result
of So Min's bold touch?)

1525
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,840
So Min is bold.

1526
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,340
(It bursts in one go!)

1527
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:17,440
- You poked it with too much force.
- That startled me.

1528
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,300
Didn't you do better the last time?

1529
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,650
What was that?

1530
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:23,240
- You made it burst in one go.
- You dug in the blade.

1531
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,570
I slashed it gently.

1532
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,150
I slashed it very gently.

1533
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,880
- So Min, you take the eighth place.
- You dug in the blade.

1534
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,380
- I hope everyone's balloon bursts.
- I know.

1535
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:33,380
I slashed it very gently.

1536
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,130
I think the layers are thin.
The surface is very tight.

1537
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,490
Are you sure there are 10 layers?

1538
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,360
What are you doing in the air?

1539
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,400
(The layers come off instantly.)

1540
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,490
He survived.

1541
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,300
- He survived.
- One more layer.

1542
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,760
(One more layer
comes off belatedly!)

1543
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,840
One more layer.

1544
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,340
(It's nerve-wracking.)

1545
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,970
It's barely hanging.

1546
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,400
It will burst the next time.

1547
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,550
Suk Jin.

1548
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,820
Burst. Burst.

1549
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:00,880
- Burst.
- Burst.

1550
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,840
- Bye.
- Burst.

1551
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,050
That's too gentle.

1552
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,090
- Gosh, this is...
- There should be a time limit.

1553
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:08,090
(It bursts!)

1554
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:09,380
See?

1555
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,190
You should have stopped
after the first scratch.

1556
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,130
- You went further.
- Seriously.

1557
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:17,260
This is cutthroat.

1558
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,530
- It's so scary.
- It dropped here.

1559
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,210
- Next.
- Here I go.

1560
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,470
I got completely wet.

1561
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,630
This is nerve-wracking.

1562
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:24,940
The surface is taut.

1563
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,030
It's very taut.

1564
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,150
Is the blade touching?

1565
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,300
The blade isn't doing anything.

1566
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,670
You should slash it like a man.

1567
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,050
(Slashing)

1568
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:32,440
You should slash it like a man.

1569
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,920
- Okay!
- What was that?

1570
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,590
- He removed 1 layer.
- 1 layer.

1571
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:37,380
- How did you do so well?
- Okay.

1572
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,590
- Did he remove one layer?
- How did he do so well?

1573
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:39,820
I got the hang of it.

1574
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:41,220
You need to use the tip.

1575
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,260
(Ji Hyo gives it a go
after a tip from Se Chan.)

1576
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,530
That's right. Use the tip.

1577
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:46,190
I thought she would make it burst
in one go.

1578
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,530
I am scared.

1579
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:48,630
Ji Hyo.

1580
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:51,690
- Ji Hyo.
- You are slashing the air.

1581
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,840
I am scratching it.

1582
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:57,440
(It shows no sign of tearing.)

1583
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,130
What was that?

1584
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,210
Did it work?

1585
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,900
(Coming off)

1586
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,970
Did it work?

1587
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,280
- What was that?
- It worked.

1588
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:06,780
- How did she do that?
- Is someone controlling it?

1589
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,190
- What did you do?
- Was it magic?

1590
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,240
- One layer suddenly came off.
- Seriously.

1591
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,360
It suddenly came off.

1592
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,090
- I did it.
- You must have done it delicately.

1593
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,690
- Jae Suk.
- Go ahead.

1594
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:16,780
(Jae Suk gives it a try.)

1595
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,300
- This isn't easy.
- This really isn't easy.

1596
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,900
Jae Suk wouldn't be able
to succeed.

1597
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,420
I am really bad at things like this.

1598
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,440
Jae Suk, I will give you
two coins...

1599
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,590
- if you let me slash it.
- There you go.

1600
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,440
Why does his mouth do that
when he concentrates?

1601
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,530
Look at his mouth.

1602
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,880
He looks like
he is kissing on the overpass.

1603
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,300
(He looks like
he is kissing on the underpass.)

1604
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,340
Come on.

1605
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,510
- The first kiss?
- For goodness' sake.

1606
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,940
Don't bring that up.

1607
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,960
(He slashes the balloon carefully.)

1608
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,030
That's...

1609
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,320
I can't do it.

1610
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,130
I am too scared.

1611
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,260
I am too scared.

1612
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,130
I bet he had
his first kiss like that.

1613
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:56,570
(I bet he had
his first kiss like that.)

1614
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,240
- "I am too scared."
- "I am too scared."

1615
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,130
He would have pulled back.
"What should I do?"

1616
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,030
"I am too scared."

1617
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:04,400
I don't want to think about that.

1618
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,470
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1619
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:08,670
"I can't do it."

1620
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,570
(Look into that memory and do it.)

1621
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,380
- 5, 4, 3...
- Jae Suk.

1622
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,840
Do it confidently.
You are a confident man.

1623
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:18,050
- Okay.
- You are a confident man.

1624
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,090
(He confidently makes
the balloon burst.)

1625
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,490
- My goodness.
- That was cool.

1626
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,190
For goodness' sake.

1627
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,550
That was good.

1628
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,960
- It isn't easy.
- It's so hard.

1629
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,320
It's not something I can do.

1630
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,760
Three people are out.

1631
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,990
Okay, okay.

1632
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,800
Slash it, Kwang Soo.
You have done it before.

1633
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,970
- Let's see how he does it.
- He will make it burst.

1634
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:36,110
Let's see how he does it.

1635
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,610
Okay!

1636
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,300
(He cleanly peels off one layer.)

1637
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,240
- What is up with him?
- Seriously.

1638
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,780
- What happened?
- I just put the blade on it,

1639
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,880
and a layer came off.

1640
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,070
- Really?
- What happened?

1641
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,720
I bet Jong Kook is good
at something like this.

1642
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,550
- No, no.
- Your brother is a plastic surgeon.

1643
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,460
- That has nothing to do with me.
- Seriously.

1644
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,990
(He must have doctor's genes.)

1645
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:56,280
- What was that?
- He did a good job.

1646
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,360
He did it gently.

1647
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,860
- Haha.
- Is it my turn?

1648
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,030
I should move out of the way.

1649
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,130
- Hey.
- That won't work.

1650
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:03,170
Put some strength into it.

1651
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:04,570
Don't do it like that.

1652
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,090
- For goodness' sake.
- Look back on what you did.

1653
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,110
- He is practically patting it.
- Just do it like this.

1654
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,150
Just do it like this.

1655
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:17,780
(Kwang Soo gets a splash of water!)

1656
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,240
He's out.

1657
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,240
(Dumbfounded)

1658
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,820
(Flustered)

1659
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,820
What are you doing?

1660
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:26,490
He got completely wet.

1661
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:28,050
(Jae Suk can't stop being
mischievous.)

1662
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,490
Kwang Soo, I am sorry.

1663
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,590
- What?
- You are out.

1664
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,690
He said, "I am sorry."

1665
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:32,760
Is that all you can say?

1666
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,070
It burst on its own, right?

1667
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:35,300
- What?
- It burst on its own, right?

1668
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,300
(Swearing)

1669
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,240
- "It burst on its own."
- Kwang Soo.

1670
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,860
You should have stopped him.

1671
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,260
- I am sorry.
- What?

1672
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,470
That's...

1673
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,900
- Okay.
- I knew that would happen.

1674
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,050
- Come on.
- Okay.

1675
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,440
Okay! Let's take first place!

1676
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,570
Ji Hyo, go ahead.

1677
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:52,610
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

1678
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,610
I put a hole in it!

1679
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:56,280
- Ji Hyo is good at slashing it.
- Gently.

1680
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,380
It shows
that she has used a knife...

1681
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,720
- ever since she was little.
- I know.

1682
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,220
(The importance of early education)

1683
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,400
- The knife...
- It shows that she's experienced.

1684
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,130
- It's coming off.
- There is a hole.

1685
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:10,320
- There is a hole.
- I am seeing a different color.

1686
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,340
(What?)

1687
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,360
- What?
- Does it count or not?

1688
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,440
- What is that?
- She needs to slash the upper part.

1689
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,760
- Does it count or not?
- It doesn't count yet.

1690
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,800
- It doesn't count yet.
- It hasn't peeled off.

1691
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,510
- Ji Hyo, it doesn't count yet.
- It needs to peel off completely.

1692
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:18,510
Slash this part.

1693
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:20,710
You should slash the red part.

1694
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,340
(You should slash the red part.)

1695
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,970
Haha, be quiet.

1696
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,880
Do you think I am a fool?

1697
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,340
Then why are you reaching
for the blue part?

1698
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,690
(Ji Hyo reaches for the blue part.)

1699
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,150
Just take that part off.

1700
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,490
- It will be hard to do that.
- This is...

1701
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,170
Just slash the blue part.

1702
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,530
For goodness' sake.

1703
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:44,860
(There are 3 people remaining
including Ji Hyo.)

1704
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:46,800
- Three?
- What?

1705
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,070
For goodness' sake.

1706
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,240
(She suddenly self-destructs!)

1707
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,380
- What?
- Why did you do that?

1708
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,510
- Why did you do that?
- It's so frustrating!

1709
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,170
- Are you serious?
- She is weird.

1710
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:56,710
Did you give up
because you have many R coins?

1711
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:58,150
- Why did you do that?
- Ji Hyo is scary!

1712
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:59,880
It's so frustrating
that I can't do it.

1713
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:00,880
What is wrong with her personality?

1714
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,380
- You are scary.
- Listen.

1715
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:05,280
It didn't come off cleanly,
but I couldn't do it again.

1716
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,820
- I understand.
- Is it my turn?

1717
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:07,990
- Yes.
- I think it will burst.

1718
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:09,550
It would be better
for Jong Kook to take first place.

1719
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,530
I think he will fail.

1720
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:12,800
No, no.

1721
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,920
(What?)

1722
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:16,760
(The balloon falls to the ground.)

1723
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,170
- He is still in.
- The balloon didn't burst.

1724
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:20,800
(Thankfully,
the balloon didn't burst.)

1725
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,240
The balloon didn't burst.

1726
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,670
(What?)

1727
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:25,670
Hey, hey.

1728
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,240
Pick it up!

1729
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,470
- Pick it up!
- Hey!

1730
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:32,510
(Popping)

1731
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,150
- For goodness' sake.
- Pick it up!

1732
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,940
- Hey!
- You should have picked it up.

1733
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,960
- What?
- Couldn't you have picked it up?

1734
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,220
What happened?

1735
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,990
(Kwang Soo stayed true
to his character.)

1736
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,590
- I tried...
- What was that?

1737
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,690
I tried to pick it up.

1738
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:47,360
- It can't be helped.
- Jong Kook is out.

1739
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,630
- Thank you so much.
- Okay!

1740
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,190
- Thank you so much.
- Okay!

1741
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,530
- Thank you.
- For goodness' sake.

1742
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:52,800
- I tried to pick it up.
- You shouldn't have done that.

1743
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,990
Se Chan took first place.

1744
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:55,740
It can't be helped.

1745
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:58,630
After this,
you have one more chance...

1746
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,530
to get more coins after the race.

1747
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:01,970
For goodness' sake.

1748
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:04,720
I will listen to my conscience.

1749
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:08,550
We will start the conveyor belt.

1750
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:10,090
Can I start taking the coins?

1751
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:11,150
- Yes.
- Se Chan, stop it already.

1752
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,880
You are making yourself look bad.
I am serious.

1753
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,650
I did it conscientiously.

1754
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,300
- Jong Kook.
- We will need to give up.

1755
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,530
You will be impressed.

1756
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:20,530
(The conveyor belt reaches
Jong Kook on the 7th floor.)

1757
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:21,590
(My goodness.)

1758
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,470
Who knew I would end up
on the first floor?

1759
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,300
The number isn't half bad.

1760
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,440
You are right. Seriously, Se Chan.

1761
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,940
- Yes?
- I have no expectations.

1762
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,440
I have no expectations either.

1763
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:33,530
I will leave some behind...

1764
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:35,400
- for Haha.
- That's right.

1765
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,280
(What?)

1766
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:38,820
Haha needs some coins.

1767
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,940
I mean...

1768
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,090
Don't take so many.

1769
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,090
(Why did Se Chan laugh?)

1770
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,820
Ji Hyo, don't take so many.
You have a lot already.

1771
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,260
- Okay, okay.
- Promise me.

1772
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,780
I promise.

1773
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,460
Let me see how many coins there are.

1774
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,030
(Clean)

1775
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:55,860
Let me see how many coins there are.

1776
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,860
(There aren't any coins to see.)

1777
01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:59,590
I left a lot of coins.

1778
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,530
How did... How did this happen?

1779
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,030
(The tray moves on
without taking a client.)

1780
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,240
For goodness' sake.

1781
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:10,240
What?

1782
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,880
Gosh, this is...

1783
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,590
What's the point of making it stop?

1784
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:15,720
I shouldn't have had
any expectations.

1785
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,420
It's time for the final race.

1786
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:20,460
You will choose the last order
in which you take the coins...

1787
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,590
through the Running for 10 Years.

1788
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:24,920
It's the tail-catching
name tag elimination.

1789
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,920
(The tail-catching
name tag elimination)

1790
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:29,260
The person below your number
will be your target.

1791
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,090
- My goodness.
- 8's target is 7.

1792
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,340
- 7's target is 6.
- Hold on.

1793
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,570
1's target is 8.

1794
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:35,900
For goodness' sake.

1795
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:37,670
For goodness' sake.

1796
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,740
- This determines the last ranking.
- Yes.

1797
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,880
However,

1798
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,820
you can purchase items
during the race.

1799
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,070
(You can purchase items
during the race.)

1800
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,490
Adding a target costs five coins.

1801
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:51,150
Putting a bell on a member
also costs five coins.

1802
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:54,090
If you pay five coins,

1803
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:57,150
you can have another target
who isn't right below your number.

1804
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,460
Okay.

1805
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:01,300
It's important to have five coins.

1806
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,670
Suk Jin doesn't have any coins.

1807
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,510
Then you can get the target
who is right below your number.

1808
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:12,280
Otherwise, you can beg
and ask for mercy.

1809
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,800
- Is begging an option?
- Yes.

1810
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,670
- My goodness.
- Please move to your spot.

1811
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:18,780
- Okay.
- Get ready to beg.

1812
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,840
This hurts my pride.

1813
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,650
You are having a hard time today.

1814
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,510
I have a plan.

1815
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:29,460
I will lick Se Chan's shoes.

1816
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,860
(I will lick Se Chan's shoes.)

1817
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,550
(He made up his mind to beg.)

1818
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:33,590
That's my plan.

1819
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,070
(He made up his mind to beg.)

1820
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,070
What should I do?
Whom should I choose as my target?

1821
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,260
It's meaningless to hold on
to these five coins.

1822
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:45,780
Se Chan will try to take off
my name tag.

1823
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:47,880
When it's me against Jong Kook...

1824
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,840
after he takes off
everyone's name tag,

1825
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,440
I will take off his name tag
and become a hero.

1826
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,590
All right. The race will start.

1827
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:59,220
My heart is beating fast...

1828
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,860
even though I have done this
for 10 years.

1829
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:06,460
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1830
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:07,970
The race starts.

1831
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:10,070
(The race starts.)

1832
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,760
(Se Chan, Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Haha,)

1833
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,530
(Kwang Soo, Jae Suk,
Suk Jin, and So Min)

1834
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,530
(Picking up)

1835
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,130
The race starts.

1836
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,470
Here are 10 coins.

1837
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:23,340
- Put two bells on Jong Kook.
- Okay.

1838
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,050
I'll put them on him from the
start. That'll make me feel at ease.

1839
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:28,820
Where is Ji Hyo?

1840
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,880
Jong Kook, someone put bells on you.

1841
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,650
For goodness' sake.

1842
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:38,320
It must be Ji Hyo.
The wealthy Ji Hyo did it.

1843
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:41,320
I will need to take off
her name tag soon.

1844
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,800
Let's see where she is.

1845
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,030
(With the bells, Jong Kook shows off
his sense of presence.)

1846
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,130
I will first watch a performance
of "Heungbo Is Dumbfounded".

1847
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:54,550
(Before the race began)

1848
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,070
(I don't have any coins.)

1849
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,780
(Beg when the camera is running.)

1850
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,280
Sing this part. "Where do you want
your little brother to go?"

1851
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,420
(Show me a performance
of "Heungbo Is Dumbfounded".)

1852
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,990
(Satisfy me!)

1853
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:08,150
(They agreed to be clowns
for 5 coins.)

1854
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,190
Se Chan.

1855
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:10,720
Wait.

1856
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,050
(Haha begins to warm up.)

1857
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,070
All right. Let's see it.

1858
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,360
<i>All right</i>

1859
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,760
(All right)

1860
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,260
(Here I come)

1861
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:23,760
(All right)

1862
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,300
- Here I come
- There you go.

1863
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,050
(This beggar let go of his pride.)

1864
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,070
(He is doing great.)

1865
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:32,970
<i>Heungbo is dumbfounded</i>

1866
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,550
(Heungbo is dumbfounded)

1867
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,960
(He gives a passionate show
for 5 coins.)

1868
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,280
That's life.

1869
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,920
There is no such thing as seniority
before capitalism.

1870
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,070
That's life.

1871
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:52,240
(He sang the entire song
to get some coins.)

1872
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,860
Please give me some coins.

1873
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,710
That was perfect. Here you go.

1874
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:59,280
- I will give you five coins.
- Se Chan.

1875
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:02,550
I am giving you these coins
so that we can be allies.

1876
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:04,780
That's right. Se Chan.

1877
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:08,720
(The beggar gives a gala show
in happiness.)

1878
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,190
I will take off
So Min's name tag first.

1879
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:13,590
Gosh, Jae Suk will come after me
with all his might.

1880
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:16,760
So Min is over there.

1881
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,220
Jae Suk and So Min are over there.

1882
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:20,860
I need to avoid Suk Jin.

1883
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,400
I can take Suk Jin out.

1884
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:24,570
Then I will be bait.

1885
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,590
I'll be bait.

1886
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,800
I'll make Suk Jin come to me.

1887
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:32,070
Jae Suk is protecting So Min.

1888
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,170
(Suk Jin is watching everything.)

1889
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,150
(Jae Suk is hiding.)

1890
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,320
(He finds something.)

1891
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:41,510
- Hey, Suk Jin is watching you.
- I know.

1892
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,820
To be honest,

1893
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,190
our eyes met,

1894
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,110
and it's so awkward
to pretend I have no idea.

1895
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:49,090
(It's too awkward.)

1896
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,030
- Our eyes definitely met.
- Suk Jin thinks...

1897
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:53,490
he is...

1898
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:54,990
in "Mission: Impossible".

1899
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:58,840
He thinks he is Tom Cruise.

1900
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:00,900
Look at that.

1901
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,800
Wearing a yellow cap...

1902
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,880
How can he think
we can't see him?

1903
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,400
How long are we supposed to
pretend we have no idea?

1904
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,740
If I approach her right now,

1905
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,010
she'll call Jae Suk,

1906
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:13,340
and Jae Suk will run to her.
Then it'll be 2 to 1.

1907
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,150
(What is she doing?)

1908
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,260
I'm letting Suk Jin know
where I am.

1909
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,190
I'm letting him know.

1910
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,220
(Lying down)

1911
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,780
So Min is right there.

1912
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,820
Jae Suk is coming upstairs.

1913
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,820
Don't you think she's looking at me?

1914
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,470
(The middle-aged man
can be slow.)

1915
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:34,860
(Jong Kook is figuring out
what's going on.)

1916
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,010
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1917
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,170
You have to put on two more bells.

1918
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,510
(This is driving me crazy.)

1919
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,570
(He has to wear so many bells.)

1920
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:42,710
Just a second.

1921
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,940
This is not okay.
How many bells do I have to wear?

1922
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,840
What's the use of R coins?

1923
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,280
(Ji Hyo invests her R coins
in bells.)

1924
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,550
I'll cover Jong Kook's legs
with bells.

1925
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:54,650
He's wearing two bells,
and I can't hear him?

1926
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:57,030
(He's wearing as many bells
as a shaman does.)

1927
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,050
There she is.

1928
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:01,190
(So Min and Se Chan
run into each other.)

1929
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,360
- What about me?
- What about her?

1930
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:03,920
Suk Jin can eliminate her, right?

1931
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,570
Yes. I'm running away from him.

1932
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:06,740
I'm not going to eliminate you.

1933
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,610
- Are you So Min's target?
- Yes.

1934
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:11,110
- Pay five coins then.
- What?

1935
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,900
(Se Chan can eliminate So Min
if he pays 5 coins.)

1936
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,940
I should pay coins?
Bye. Thanks for today.

1937
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,110
What?

1938
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,820
- I'll eliminate you.
- Why are you doing this?

1939
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,150
You can't do this.

1940
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:22,320
- Don't do that.
- Are you going to cry?

1941
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:25,880
(She is about to cry.)

1942
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,180
- Are you going to cry?
- This is how you play.

1943
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,680
- Why are you crying?
- She shouldn't be like this.

1944
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,730
This is how you play.

1945
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:32,430
- I'll pay you. Eliminate Se Chan.
- What?

1946
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:34,350
- How much?
- Take it, and we'll eliminate you.

1947
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:35,470
I'll pay you.

1948
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:38,600
(So Min's offer
makes Kwang Soo's eyes shake.)

1949
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,360
- Look at Kwang Soo's face.
- I'll give you one coin.

1950
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,170
Let's see what he does.

1951
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:45,480
Why don't you make an offer to me?

1952
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,140
Fine.

1953
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,740
- All right.
- Hey.

1954
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:50,880
(Haha takes it back.)

1955
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,020
I get it.

1956
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,440
(So Min suddenly attacks Kwang Soo.)

1957
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:59,110
(So Min's target is Se Chan.
Why is she attacking Kwang Soo?)

1958
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:02,350
Target Kwang Soo.

1959
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:03,680
- Me?
- Yes.

1960
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:06,300
- Eliminate Kwang Soo first.
- Okay.

1961
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,690
Okay.

1962
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:08,860
- I'll target Kwang Soo.
- Okay.

1963
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,670
(So Min paid 5 coins
to be able to target Kwang Soo.)

1964
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:13,670
(She attacked him
while he was distracted.)

1965
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:14,860
- Gosh, this is annoying.
- What happened?

1966
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,100
- This is annoying.
- What's wrong?

1967
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:18,270
- Did she pay to attack me?
- What happened?

1968
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,230
Haha, hold Kwang Soo.

1969
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:21,230
- No!
- Pay me.

1970
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:22,380
- Hold him!
- Okay.

1971
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:24,980
(I can't believe you.)

1972
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,050
Hold him.

1973
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,610
- Stop it!
- Hold him!

1974
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:29,090
Hold him! Hurry!

1975
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:30,420
What did I do so wrong?

1976
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,610
I don't even have coins!

1977
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,110
Listen, I don't even have coins.

1978
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,650
- Look at his face.
- I don't even have coins.

1979
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:36,280
- He looks genuinely frustrated.
- This is so unfair.

1980
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,780
I don't even have coins.

1981
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,730
Look at his face.
He looks so desperate.

1982
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:41,820
Eliminate him!

1983
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:43,270
(In the end, they use force.)

1984
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:47,170
(Suk Jin pops out of nowhere.)

1985
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,930
(So Min's name tag is ripped off.)

1986
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:53,430
(So Min is eliminated by Suk Jin,
whom she looked down on.)

1987
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:54,570
What happened?

1988
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,100
(This is
the older generation's skill.)

1989
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,440
(Kwang Soo's name tag is
ripped off.)

1990
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,180
- Give it to me.
- Kwang Soo is out.

1991
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:01,350
(So Min and Kwang Soo
are out.)

1992
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:02,940
- Who is my next target?
- Who is my next target?

1993
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:04,720
Am I your next target?

1994
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,020
Suk Jin, am I your target?

1995
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,980
Hold on.

1996
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,630
(Se Chan backs off.)

1997
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:10,930
Haha, hold Suk Jin.

1998
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,490
- Those who are out...
- Hurry up and pay.

1999
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:14,100
(The beggar is back.)

2000
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,730
- Hurry up and pay.
- This is not okay.

2001
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:17,230
I'll target Suk Jin.

2002
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,690
(Se Chan can now attack Suk Jin.)

2003
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,900
Did you two team up?

2004
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,640
- Rip it off.
- Hey!

2005
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:25,840
Suk Jin.

2006
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:27,600
This is...

2007
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,480
(Suk Jin is out.)

2008
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:34,310
(Even though he has never been
this quick in 10 years...)

2009
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,140
- I can attack Jae Suk now.
- Those who are out should move.

2010
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,980
(Suk Jin is eliminated by
the beggar alliance.)

2011
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,460
We'll be penalized.

2012
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,780
This keeps you cool.

2013
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,300
This cools you off.

2014
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,760
- Oh, this...
- Oh, this...

2015
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:49,130
This keeps you really cool.

2016
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,860
This is really effective.

2017
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:53,170
I feel so much cooler now.

2018
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:56,510
Se Chan has been so arrogant today.
It's annoying.

2019
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:57,730
It is annoying.

2020
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:58,900
Gosh.

2021
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,270
He can't win first place anyway.

2022
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:02,400
- Jong Kook will win.
- Jong Kook will win for sure.

2023
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,440
It feels like he's older than me.

2024
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,850
Just imagine he's older than you.

2025
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,310
(Jong Kook is stronger
than Suk Jin.)

2026
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:09,810
Gosh, what should I do?

2027
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,590
I can attack you now.

2028
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:13,280
Okay.

2029
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,760
But let's eliminate Jong Kook first.

2030
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:17,430
Then promise me.

2031
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,800
- We'll be top two,
- Okay.

2032
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,260
- and we'll share the coins.
- That sounds good.

2033
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,300
- Whether I win or you win...
- Okay, it's a deal.

2034
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,470
- I promise.
- Promise me.

2035
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:26,100
- I can attack you now.
- Okay.

2036
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,990
Let's eliminate Jong Kook first.

2037
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:29,170
Let's go.

2038
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:30,270
(Jingling)

2039
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:31,360
Here he comes.

2040
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,980
(Jong Kook appears
with the jingle of the bells.)

2041
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,180
Gosh, this is frustrating.

2042
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:37,680
(He appears right away.)

2043
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,740
Gosh.

2044
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:39,770
Here comes Jong Kook.

2045
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:41,310
I'll eliminate Ji Hyo.

2046
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:42,740
She has too many coins.

2047
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,590
(Staring)

2048
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:45,720
What's with your face?

2049
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,020
- You...
- You want to attack me?

2050
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:48,150
That's not it.

2051
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:49,520
- I want to attack Jae Suk.
- Hold on.

2052
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,600
(Is he paying to attack Jae Suk?)

2053
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,760
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

2054
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,230
- Calm down.
- I want to attack Se Chan.

2055
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:56,470
Wait.

2056
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,560
- There's no point in attacking me.
- Calm down.

2057
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,970
I'll eliminate Ji Hyo.

2058
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,360
She has too many coins.

2059
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,230
But if you eliminate Ji Hyo,
I'll be in danger.

2060
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,340
I'll be Jong Kook's next target.

2061
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:09,980
Then you two can team up
and eliminate me.

2062
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:11,480
Do you think that'll work?

2063
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:15,740
- I wish we could do that.
- I wish it was that simple.

2064
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:17,550
Then should we keep Ji Hyo alive...

2065
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:19,420
and try to eliminate
each other here?

2066
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,680
Gosh.

2067
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,590
Do you want me
to eliminate her first...

2068
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:23,650
or should we start right now?

2069
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:25,890
- Why do you have to scare us?
- I mean...

2070
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,460
- Why...
- We can start right now.

2071
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:28,820
Eliminate Ji Hyo first,

2072
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:30,100
and we'll decide later.

2073
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,490
- You can eliminate her now, right?
- I can do that.

2074
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,930
- Then do that.
- I'll eliminate her.

2075
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,210
She's survived long enough.

2076
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:38,430
(He sets out to get Ji Hyo.)

2077
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:40,730
I have to find Jae Suk.

2078
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,770
(Meanwhile,
Ji Hyo is looking for Jae Suk.)

2079
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:45,380
(She finds him.)

2080
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,720
(However)

2081
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:48,850
Ji Hyo.

2082
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,890
(Jong Kook appears in front of her.)

2083
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:52,220
- What are you doing here?
- Jong Kook.

2084
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:53,980
You've survived long enough.

2085
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,680
- I get it.
- You've survived long enough.

2086
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,260
- We need to talk.
- No.

2087
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,890
Ji Hyo is here.

2088
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:00,460
They're going up.

2089
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:02,730
- They're going up.
- What happened?

2090
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:03,820
Why doesn't he eliminate her
right away?

2091
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,230
- Why are they being lovey-dovey?
- What are they doing?

2092
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:07,730
That's how a couple fights
in an elevator.

2093
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,170
(Romance, seen from a distance,
but action, seen up close)

2094
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:11,340
- Why isn't he ripping it off?
- I know.

2095
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,530
Hey! The bells...

2096
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:15,180
The bells are no use.

2097
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,640
- The bells...
- Stop it!

2098
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,180
You've survived long enough.

2099
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:19,920
You have a lot of coins.

2100
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:22,180
Darn it.

2101
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:24,280
Why did you have to show up there?

2102
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,760
- Ji Hyo is out.
- Okay.

2103
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,180
- Jae Suk.
- Hey.

2104
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,390
(Wait for me. I'll be right there.)

2105
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:32,350
Like we said before...

2106
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,060
We should both attack him...

2107
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,690
whether you win or I win.

2108
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:38,930
- We have no choice.
- Okay.

2109
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:40,930
Please don't betray me.

2110
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,340
Why would I?

2111
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,030
You really shouldn't betray me.

2112
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:45,230
- We'll eliminate him together...
- Okay.

2113
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,880
- and share...
- Okay.

2114
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,510
- equally...
- If we...

2115
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:50,600
- Let's finish it the right way.
- If we don't do this right,

2116
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,140
one of us will be out.

2117
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,270
- Right.
- Okay.

2118
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:56,280
Let's eliminate Jong Kook.

2119
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:01,060
(Will they be able to get
the innocent serial eliminator?)

2120
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,890
(How will the final fight end?)

2121
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:04,130
You two...

2122
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:05,560
have some money.

2123
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,320
- Yes.
- You to have a bit of money.

2124
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,520
So we should talk.

2125
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,130
- Did you pay to attack us?
- What?

2126
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:11,320
- Did you pay to attack us?
- Did you pay to attack us?

2127
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,840
I'm your target, right?

2128
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,390
(Jong Kook's target is Jae Suk.)

2129
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,340
He's your target,
and you're my target.

2130
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:18,530
I'm your target?

2131
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:19,770
That came out wrong.

2132
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:21,430
(What did you just say?)

2133
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:22,940
That came out wrong.

2134
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,850
- I mean we're not a team.
- Hold on.

2135
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,940
- That's what I meant.
- I'm your target?

2136
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:29,280
I'm supposed to attack you.

2137
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,440
Are you angry?

2138
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,960
By the way, don't you want to
finish in second place?

2139
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,460
(Glancing)

2140
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:35,730
Or...

2141
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:40,730
do you want to finish in
first place? I'll make you king.

2142
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,690
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

2143
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:45,140
(What's going on here?)

2144
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:46,360
Just let me finish in second place.

2145
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,510
- Hold on.
- That sounds great.

2146
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:51,530
- Don't you want to win?
- What do you say?

2147
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,710
- Call me a kingmaker.
- Hold on.

2148
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:54,710
- A kingmaker.
- Just a second.

2149
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:57,100
- Se Chan.
- I know you two are close, but...

2150
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:59,520
- Don't be so desperate.
- He says he'll make me win.

2151
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,810
- Come here.
- Let's get it over with.

2152
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:04,390
- I'll make you king.
- Hold on.

2153
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,850
Wait.

2154
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:07,280
- Let's not waste time.
- Don't waste time.

2155
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,560
- I mean...
- Come here.

2156
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:10,180
- Hold on.
- Come here.

2157
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,260
Rip it off.

2158
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,560
Okay!

2159
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:15,520
Okay!

2160
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,670
This is...

2161
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:18,020
- This is unfair.
- Go away.

2162
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,230
Go away.

2163
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:21,100
- Third place is good enough.
- Okay.

2164
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,310
- How many coins do you have?
- What?

2165
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:23,770
- How many do you have?
- Jong Kook.

2166
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,970
- How many coins do you have?
- What?

2167
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:26,430
- How many do you have?
- Jong Kook.

2168
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,930
How many do you have?

2169
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,270
How many do you have?
Do you want me to open your bag?

2170
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,640
Why...

2171
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,140
What are you talking about?

2172
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:33,520
Just tell me roughly.

2173
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,550
- You sound so scary.
- Just tell me roughly.

2174
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:38,090
Fine, how many are you
going to take later?

2175
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:40,280
- Promise me.
- Do I have to tell you...

2176
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,650
(What?)

2177
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,460
- If you were going to be...
- I'll make you king.

2178
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,560
Can't you do that much?

2179
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,690
I'll take half.

2180
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,230
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

2181
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:49,060
I always keep my promise.

2182
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,470
I'll make you king.

2183
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,630
Say thank you.

2184
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,930
What are you talking about?

2185
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:55,970
- Say thank you.
- Can I film this?

2186
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,430
- Just say it.
- Is it really necessary?

2187
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:58,510
Say thank you.

2188
01:15:58,510 --> 01:15:59,900
- The game is over now.
- No one will know.

2189
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,740
- Only Se Chan will hear it.
- Still,

2190
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,940
thank you.

2191
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,980
Still, thank you.

2192
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,940
- Okay. Promise me.
- Thank you.

2193
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,280
If you break your promise today,

2194
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,110
it'll affect the next episode too.

2195
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,110
(And he has to pay interest.)

2196
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,180
Seriously.

2197
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:15,850
If you were going to be
stressed out...

2198
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,320
I mean...

2199
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,960
Just answer me.

2200
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,300
Just say yes or no.

2201
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,650
Just rip off my name tag!

2202
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:23,860
(I can't stand it anymore.)

2203
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,300
(The puppet king loses his temper.)

2204
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,170
- I can't handle this stress.
- That's enough.

2205
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:28,710
- I will make you king.
- What are you saying?

2206
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:32,180
- Let's split it.
- Just rip it off.

2207
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:33,380
Don't do it then.

2208
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,180
Don't do it then.

2209
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,550
(An outbreak of a coup d'etat)

2210
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,770
Rip it off! Just rip it off.

2211
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:41,380
If I have to live like this,
I'd rather you rip it off.

2212
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:42,810
Okay!

2213
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:43,850
(The unfortunate king
who was dethroned in 5 minutes)

2214
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,090
- The race is over.
- Gosh, I'm dumbfounded.

2215
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:47,420
If you were
going to die like this...

2216
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,590
- No, this is...
- Let's go.

2217
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:50,280
Gosh. I'm dumbfounded.

2218
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,820
I will be conscientious
and leave you some.

2219
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:54,820
I will keep it a secret
that you died so miserably.

2220
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,100
I will be conscientious.

2221
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,270
(Jae Suk's words ended up becoming
an ornament for Jong Kook.)

2222
01:16:58,270 --> 01:16:59,890
- Seriously.
- Jae Suk got ripped off.

2223
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,060
- Okay, everyone.
- Yes.

2224
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:03,530
Before we start dividing up
the coins for the last time,

2225
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:06,010
- I will tell you the prices...
- I don't have any coins.

2226
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:08,850
- of the prizes you all wanted.
- I hope they cost 100 coins.

2227
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:10,140
The penalty exemption card...

2228
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,110
I just need to avoid
getting the penalty.

2229
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,680
- is 40 coins.
- 40 coins.

2230
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,880
(Penalty exemption is 40,
Penalty transfer is 50)

2231
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,090
(Massage gun is 30, A box of masks
and hand sanitizer is 20)

2232
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,050
50 coins?
You have to spend 50 coins then.

2233
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,780
I wouldn't have wasted my coins
if I knew.

2234
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,520
- Gosh, this is...
- They're affordable.

2235
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:23,480
Today, as you can see,

2236
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,890
a total of 320 coins
have been given out.

2237
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:27,600
- Right.
- If you divided it up evenly,

2238
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,730
no one would've ended up
with a penalty.

2239
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:30,770
I know.

2240
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:32,690
But you all squandered it
and kept each other in check,

2241
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,990
- I'm embarrassed of myself.
- No.

2242
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,400
We could've avoided
the penalty today.

2243
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:37,530
- Right.
- Right.

2244
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:38,570
Goodness.

2245
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,570
(The moments of greed
cross their mind.)

2246
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:41,340
- The condition is the penalty, yes?
- If you can't buy the exemption,

2247
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:42,550
you'll get the penalty.

2248
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,570
Hold on. If I use 40 for today...

2249
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,720
Hey, Jong Kook.

2250
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,110
If you aren't greedy...

2251
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:49,520
It's not too late.

2252
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,550
- The conveyor belt...
- How much do we need?

2253
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:53,180
- will start.
- Just start already.

2254
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:56,230
This isn't a competition.
We can all survive.

2255
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:59,320
- Okay, go.
- Hold on.

2256
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,560
Hey!

2257
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,890
- What are you doing?
- Hold on!

2258
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:03,430
What are you doing?
How many are you taking?

2259
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,520
Hold on.

2260
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,890
What are you doing?
Why did you take so much?

2261
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:09,060
My gosh. Hold on.

2262
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,770
Is this what it's like? Hold on.

2263
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:13,070
- He took so many.
- How many are left, Se Chan?

2264
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:14,570
(He picks up as many as he needs.)

2265
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:15,640
- I have just enough.
- You have enough, right?

2266
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,270
- Really?
- Got it.

2267
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,770
(The last 2 will go to Ji Hyo,
who's on the 5th floor.)

2268
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:21,940
Jong Kook took so many.

2269
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:23,610
No, Jae Suk.

2270
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:24,680
(He has only seen
an empty tray all day.)

2271
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,920
There weren't that many
to start with.

2272
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,060
- You're a fool to expect otherwise.
- There's nothing there.

2273
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:30,480
(As expected, there are no coins
left for the lower floors.)

2274
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,730
You're a fool to expect otherwise.

2275
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:33,630
(The final coin division is over.)

2276
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:34,650
(The results of
the final coin division)

2277
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:35,670
(Jong Kook 56, Jae Suk 52,
Ji Hyo 52, Se Chan 40, So Min 24)

2278
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:36,670
(Haha 10, Kwang Soo 6, Suk Jin 0)

2279
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,130
What's the penalty for today?

2280
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,800
The penalty
will be revealed shortly.

2281
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,730
I'm considering buying the massage
gun and just getting the penalty.

2282
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:45,380
- Seriously?
- I really needed one.

2283
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,710
I just need 20.
Will anyone give me 20 coins?

2284
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,140
- No one will do so, right?
- How many do you have?

2285
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,480
I have 24 coins.

2286
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,280
I've decided to get
the massage gun.

2287
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,280
Are you going to give them to me?

2288
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,980
- What?
- You're going to get the penalty?

2289
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:59,060
I...

2290
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:01,090
You're going to get the penalty
and buy a massage gun?

2291
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:02,150
Are you serious?

2292
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:03,760
You can get an exemption card today.

2293
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,650
I'm going to buy the massage gun.

2294
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:07,230
- Why are you obsessing over it?
- I could...

2295
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:09,190
I could just go home
after the penalty.

2296
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,770
- Why?
- Here, have 20 coins.

2297
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:11,860
Why are you doing this?

2298
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,970
I don't need it.
What will I do with 20 coins?

2299
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:14,990
He's just giving it to her?

2300
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:17,170
I want to get a massage gun now
because of him.

2301
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:20,140
I want a massage gun because
Jae Suk keeps talking about it.

2302
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:22,440
There's a limited supply.
There are only three.

2303
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,310
I want a massage gun
because there's a limited supply.

2304
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:27,610
- You're sure, right?
- Haha.

2305
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:28,680
- Haha.
- What's going on?

2306
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,240
There aren't many left.

2307
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,280
- Haha.
- Hurry up and buy it.

2308
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,920
- There's one left?
- Hurry up and buy it.

2309
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,560
It's better to buy this
and get the penalty.

2310
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,520
- Hurry up and pay him.
- Here. I'll buy the massage gun.

2311
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,850
I'll purchase an exemption card.

2312
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:42,360
I'll purchase an exemption card.

2313
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:43,600
We have one more.

2314
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,130
There's one more. I'll get it.

2315
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:46,300
I'll buy the massage gun.

2316
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,360
- Okay. Masks and hand sanitizer.
- We're so warm-hearted.

2317
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,430
(Kwang Soo got
the mask and hand sanitizer set.)

2318
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:51,030
We're so warm-hearted.

2319
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:53,570
Am I the only one
who doesn't get anything?

2320
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,900
- Yes.
- It's okay.

2321
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:58,070
- Six people will get the penalty.
- Right.

2322
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:00,880
The penalty that you all feared...

2323
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,020
- What is it?
- I'll reveal it now. Come in.

2324
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,520
- "Come in"?
- What is it?

2325
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,310
(What is the penalty...)

2326
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:08,560
(that they exchanged
for the massage gun?)

2327
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,630
- Is it a gourd?
- What is that?

2328
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:11,320
- We have to break the gourd.
- Is that it?

2329
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,430
(The mysterious gourds come in.)

2330
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:14,930
- Are we breaking gourds?
- To end the day...

2331
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:17,490
with your warm loyalty, we will do
Break the Gourd with Loyalty.

2332
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,470
This is really...

2333
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:21,840
However the winner feels like?

2334
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,400
It will be in order
until the last one is broken.

2335
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,640
- I told you.
- Jae Suk.

2336
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,010
- Thank you.
- What did I tell you?

2337
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,710
- Thank you, Jae Suk.
- I also...

2338
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,940
(Jae Suk goes first.)

2339
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,180
- I'll start.
- Okay.

2340
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:34,920
Nice shot.

2341
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:37,550
(With the power of the massage gun,
he breaks the gourd satisfyingly.)

2342
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:38,780
- Jae Suk broke it.
- One more.

2343
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,180
The gourd is hard too.

2344
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:42,150
- One more!
- Okay, one more!

2345
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:43,850
You're so cool!

2346
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,260
- This one is hard.
- This one is...

2347
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:47,260
(An unexpected dull sound)

2348
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,630
Jae Suk, think of...

2349
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:49,890
Think of the massage gun.

2350
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:51,930
This one is... Gosh.

2351
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,300
This one sounds different.

2352
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,270
- Goodness.
- Look at that.

2353
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:56,470
Gosh, this is...

2354
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,030
- Goodness.
- Look at that.

2355
01:20:58,030 --> 01:20:59,840
(It's more like he's breaking
his head with a gourd.)

2356
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,400
It didn't break even though
he threw it on the ground.

2357
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,350
It has a crack in it now.

2358
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:04,570
- It is cracked.
- It has a crack in it now..

2359
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:05,810
It will break now.

2360
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:06,880
(He had some difficulty, but he
successfully breaks 2 gourds.)

2361
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,110
The gourds are breaking!

2362
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:09,480
Can't you wear a hat?

2363
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:11,680
- It won't break?
- It should break now.

2364
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,960
That's why it's a penalty.

2365
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,560
You got it. One more.

2366
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:15,760
That's right.

2367
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,350
- Good job.
- Good job.

2368
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:19,350
We are loyal.

2369
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:21,600
It's so heartwarming.

2370
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,690
I will pass it on
to the next person.

2371
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:26,890
(I will pass it on
to the next person.)

2372
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:30,340
Gosh. As soon as he said that.

2373
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:31,840
- He's the worst.
- I'll pass it on.

2374
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,340
It's not that. I just...

2375
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,380
I'm sorry.

2376
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,680
- He passed it on.
- He passed it on.

2377
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:39,480
You can do it.

2378
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:42,220
You should do it.

2379
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:43,280
- He won't do it.
- You should.

2380
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,280
I already went.

2381
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:45,650
What?

2382
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:48,420
(He already broke some
in his imagination.)

2383
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:49,460
And then I returned to my spot.

2384
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,460
- What are you saying?
- What?

2385
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:53,890
- You didn't even touch it.
- You have to touch it.

2386
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:54,990
Who said?

2387
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:56,390
Then I'll break one.

2388
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:57,770
- Okay.
- Okay. Break one.

2389
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:59,640
- It's not that bad.
- Let's do it.

2390
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:01,890
- Okay.
- Okay. Good job.

2391
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:02,900
Finish up the last three.

2392
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,970
Se Chan does this all the time.

2393
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:08,380
(Hitting)

2394
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:10,740
Okay!

2395
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,570
(This is the pride of a comedian.)

2396
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:14,810
He's so cool!

2397
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:16,240
Yang Gourd.

2398
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,590
- Gosh, Yang Se Chan.
- Good job!

2399
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:19,680
Good job, Yang Gourd.

2400
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:23,850
(The members enter
a mysterious room.)

2401
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:25,320
I really wanted to do this.

2402
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,490
(A mysterious liquid
is in front of them.)

2403
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:29,390
(You are...)

2404
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:32,690
(a person with a superpower.)

2405
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:36,510
(With new students,
Kang Han Na and Lee Sang Yeob)

2406
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:37,860
(The legendary superpower race
has returned.)

2407
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:38,980
What is this?

2408
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:41,400
(They have returned with strong
superpowers.)

2409
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:44,100
(The ultimate superpower war)

2410
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,610
(They don't know
each other's superpowers,)

2411
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:47,880
(but they must become
the last man standing.)

2412
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,420
(It's an end game of superpowers
unseen anywhere else.)

2413
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,280
(The final war among superpowers
to change destiny will unfold.)

2414
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:57,680
(Superpower School Race,
War of Superpowers: The End Game)
