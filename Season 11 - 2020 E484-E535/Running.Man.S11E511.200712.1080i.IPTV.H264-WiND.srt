1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,405
I'm here.

2
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,990
Am I the first one to arrive?

3
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:16,075
I'm sure I came first.

4
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,070
- Come on out. - I'm the first.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,030
Move over.

6
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:23,240
I'm here, everyone.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,385
I'm the first to arrive.

8
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:30,110
- Thank you. - Thank you.

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,810
Well done today.

10
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:35,380
Guys, you should come by 9:30am tomorrow.

11
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,380
But if you arrive early, you will have some advantage.

12
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:39,580
What time are we supposed to get there?

13
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:41,490
- I'll be there at 8am. - What are you trying to do?

14
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,505
I'll be there at 8am.

15
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:46,990
The cameras aren't ready yet.

16
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:49,075
- We haven't even started. - You told me to come early.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,760
This is nice.

18
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:54,600
You didn't know I'd come this early, did you?

19
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:56,445
Am I supposed to pick one?

20
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,885
My heart is racing. What should I do?

21
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,770
I really want to go to the ladies' room,

22
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:02,985
but I'm afraid someone would arrive while I'm gone.

23
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:05,480
But I want to pick one when others are watching.

24
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,195
To wind them up.

25
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:14,450
What's going on? Did anyone come already?

26
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,635
Yes. Someone's here already.

27
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:20,890
There was a camera in the parking lot.

28
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:22,675
So I was going to show myself...

29
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:33,315
Why are you trying so hard?

30
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:36,110
Why are you being like this?

31
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:38,140
Why did you come so early?

32
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:40,795
Why did you come an hour earlier?

33
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,020
You guys are unbelievable.

34
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,520
Gosh, you persistent ones.

35
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,520
- It's Se Chan. - Goodness.

36
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,960
- Did you guys not sleep at all? - I couldn't sleep.

37
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:52,220
Why did you come so early?

38
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,430
- Are you the first to arrive? - Yes.

39
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,560
She got here first.

40
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:56,160
Seok Jin doesn't sleep much.

41
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,145
Isn't he supposed to get here first?

42
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:00,630
- Let's make a bet. - That's a good idea.

43
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:01,800
I bet Jong Kook is next.

44
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:03,715
Jong Kook? Okay.

45
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:07,085
- Do you want to bet on Ji Hyo? - Are you kidding me?

46
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:10,610
- I bet on Haha. - Haha?

47
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:12,425
I'll go with Jae Seok.

48
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:14,625
Someone's coming.

49
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:21,435
It's Ji Hyo. I can't believe this.

50
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:23,090
It's Ji Hyo. I can't believe this.

51
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:25,820
Guys! Ji Hyo is here!

52
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,860
This is amazing.

53
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,960
She arrived even before the appointed time!

54
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:31,100
- It's never happened for 10 years. - Hey, Ji Hyo.

55
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:32,960
- Hurry. Song Ji Hyo! - Song Ji Hyo!

56
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:36,070
- Song Ji Hyo! - Song Ji Hyo!

57
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,640
This is unbelievable.

58
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:40,170
- You better return it now! - Why?

59
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:41,410
- What? - Why did you come so early?

60
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,770
- What's wrong? - Did you sleep here?

61
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:43,940
- Ji Hyo, did you... - Did you sleep here?

62
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:45,080
What happened?

63
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,750
I just came early. Why?

64
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,950
I just wanted to come early.

65
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:50,695
Did you drink last night?

66
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:53,365
I'm sure you did.

67
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,090
I'm not even fully awake.

68
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,760
I came really early.

69
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,560
My goodness.

70
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:02,475
- I came really early. - My goodness.

71
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,230
- Will you go over there and do it? - Why?

72
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:08,270
I'm just putting on a microphone. What's the problem?

73
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,240
I can see your belly.

74
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,085
Will you go to a sauna with me this weekend?

75
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:16,940
She's still half-asleep.

76
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,825
You all are still half-asleep.

77
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:22,650
You pretended not to care about this yesterday.

78
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:23,820
My gosh.

79
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,920
I just saw you come walking.

80
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,050
Why did you pretend to run right here?

81
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:28,520
- Why does your flag say Big Nose? - Why...

82
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,190
- It's already set. - I don't know what this is.

83
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:31,590
- What's that? - What is it?

84
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:33,190
Am I supposed to pick Big Nose...

85
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:34,760
no matter when I arrive?

86
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:37,100
Today, each of you will take on a special role...

87
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,760
and have a race.

88
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:40,330
And each role has different benefits.

89
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:42,470
So you should pick one carefully starting from number one.

90
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,470
- By the way, Seok Jin will... - Yes?

91
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,670
play CEO Big Nose...

92
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,740
no matter what he chooses.

93
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,570
- Am I a CEO today? - Is he a CEO?

94
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,180
- Hey, stand straight. - CEO?

95
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:53,110
Stand upright in line.

96
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,050
He's a condescending CEO.

97
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:56,110
- What are they? - What?

98
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,265
There are a judge and a lawyer.

99
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:02,820
All right.

100
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,520
I guess some of them don't know what an analyst is.

101
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,390
- What is it? - An analyst?

102
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:09,705
- What is it? - What do you think it is?

103
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,445
Is it a person who arranges lists?

104
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:14,530
- What's an analyst? - An analyst.

105
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:17,270
- Isn't it a bad thing? - An analyst.

106
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:18,900
It's a person who analyzes companies.

107
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:20,240
- I see. - Something about companies.

108
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,410
- Like an industry analyst? - Yes.

109
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:23,910
- Gosh, this is... - Why do we have an analyst here?

110
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:24,940
A detective.

111
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:26,580
Jong Kook should be a detective.

112
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,780
- A lawyer. - Everyone.

113
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,950
- 10 years ago today, - Yes?

114
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,680
we filmed the first episode of Running Man.

115
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,150
- I see. - My gosh.

116
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,990
It's a meaningful day.

117
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:36,520
We had Hyo Lee in our first episode.

118
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,435
And Jung Eum.

119
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,490
Stop walking and start running. We're Running Man.

120
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,160
Hello, dear viewers.

121
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:45,360
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

122
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,630
My name is Lee Kwang Soo. And I'm 26 years old.

123
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:50,900
Kwang Soo is crying.

124
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:52,240
It's like a scene from a drama.

125
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:54,570
This is the 10th Anniversary Special.

126
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,610
You will pick a role and have a race...

127
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:58,510
- with your own benefits. - Really?

128
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,450
So you should choose your role carefully from number one.

129
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,780
- This is... - So Min, pick one.

130
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:03,750
I mean, this is so...

131
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:06,380
I can tell a judge and a lawyer are the good ones.

132
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,490
- Right. Pick something like that. - It's better than a butler.

133
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,190
- But I'm... - A gambler might be a good one.

134
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:12,220
- I agree. That can be right. - Right.

135
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,430
The good ones might be...

136
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,790
You like to bet.

137
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,160
Then I'll...

138
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:18,600
- Pick a gambler. - That's right.

139
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:19,800
- I knew it. - Look at her.

140
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,570
Once you pick one, you can't change your choice.

141
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,030
All right. Next up is number two.

142
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,770
- She's unbelievable. - It might be a good one.

143
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:27,510
- I know. It's possible. - I pick the judge.

144
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,410
- I'll go with the judge. - You're a judge?

145
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,780
- That doesn't sound right. - It doesn't suit you.

146
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,040
- I don't think it'll be fun. - That doesn't suit you at all.

147
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:35,710
- If you... - He's a crazy judge.

148
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:38,080
- All right. Se Chan. - It's me. What should I pick?

149
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,620
You should be a butler.

150
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:42,920
I might look like a lawyer in a suit.

151
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,720
- Just give it a try. - He's a judge,

152
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,605
and you're a lawyer?

153
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:48,960
- What? Why? - How would you clear up a case?

154
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:51,400
- What's wrong with that? - It will be a mess.

155
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:53,230
- It will be terrible. - We will take bribes.

156
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:55,070
All right then. I'll be a detective.

157
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,840
- Okay. - Okay. It sounds about right.

158
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,785
- A detective sounds good. - Ji Hyo.

159
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,040
What about a butler?

160
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,855
- A butler? - Yes.

161
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,410
- I will... - I like your clothes today.

162
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,295
Isn't it funny that Ji Hyo reaches out to the lawyer?

163
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:12,480
It's a mess. We are a judge, a detective, and a lawyer.

164
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:13,520
Go for it.

165
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:14,990
- We can work together for justice. - Go for it. This is funny.

166
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:16,550
Who are you going to defend?

167
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,290
- I'll pick a lawyer. - Okay.

168
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,660
- This is fun. - Jong Kook.

169
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,660
- We are professionals. - What should I pick?

170
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:24,260
The insurance salesman sounds suspicious.

171
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,300
I pick the analyst.

172
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,800
- Get ready to be a butler. - A butler?

173
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,900
I pick the analyst.

174
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,600
- Get ready to be a butler. - A butler?

175
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,670
- You're a butler. - It works for you.

176
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,340
- Don't make me a butler. - Butler Yu.

177
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:33,610
It suits you.

178
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,870
- All right. - Good.

179
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:36,310
- Okay. - You're a butler.

180
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,780
- It's settled. - He's holding it.

181
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,610
We don't know what it is yet.

182
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:41,495
We don't know how it will work.

183
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:48,420
CEO Big Nose just got a warning letter.

184
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:49,450
- Okay. - Oh, no.

185
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,090
Am I CEO Big Nose's butler?

186
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,120
- Yes. - Of course.

187
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:53,860
- Really? - What about the detective?

188
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:55,630
Why am I worried about Seok Jin?

189
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:58,130
- Really? - You'll see what will happen.

190
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:59,500
A warning letter.

191
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,370
"CEO Big Nose, there will be a party..."

192
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:04,200
- "to wish you good health today." - It's a party?

193
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,340
"During the party, I will take the gold bars..."

194
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,170
"you've been bragging about."

195
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,970
"So make sure to stay vigilant."

196
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,610
"From Thief Running Man."

197
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:14,895
My gold bars? The gold bars from my life savings?

198
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,620
This is the 10th Anniversary Special,

199
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,920
Running Man Thief Race.

200
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:22,220
And you guys are invited to the party...

201
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,020
to wish good health for the richest man...

202
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,305
in the country, CEO Big Nose.

203
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,390
But there are two thieves who are going after...

204
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,100
- CEO Big Nose's gold bars. - You see?

205
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,660
- There are thieves. - I knew it.

206
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,630
You have to arrest them all to win the race.

207
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:36,400
- Those who arrived early... - Wait.

208
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:37,600
- I agree. - Right?

209
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:39,140
- You got a mission, right? - You got one.

210
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:40,610
- Why else would they come early? - This is frustrating.

211
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,410
- When did you give the mission? - It's strange...

212
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:44,580
- that they voluntarily came early. - You'll go to Big Nose Mansion,

213
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:47,325
and there is a room of gold bars.

214
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,850
Before the mission, each member will get to...

215
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:52,965
search the room for 50 seconds.

216
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:04,360
During the time, the thieves can move the gold bars in the safe...

217
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,845
into the thieves' safe.

218
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:11,300
Once all the members leave the room,

219
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:12,640
you will carry out the mission.

220
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:15,070
And the videos of two members with the lowest records...

221
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,525
will be revealed after the mission.

222
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:30,150
After watching the videos, you will have a vote...

223
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,635
and single out the thieves.

224
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,430
Now we will reveal the benefits of each role...

225
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,830
you just picked.

226
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:42,100
- Let's open CEO Big Nose first. - What's my benefit?

227
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,700
I don't even know what my benefit is.

228
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:45,170
CEO Big Nose can deprive the butler of the right to vote.

229
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:47,040
Gosh, what is this?

230
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:48,970
- The butler? - Take away the right to vote?

231
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:51,380
- Hey, fan me. - So you don't get to vote?

232
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:52,640
- I don't want to. - Just do it.

233
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,810
- No. - I'll take away your right to vote.

234
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:56,380
- I don't care. - Just do this!

235
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:58,565
- I said no. - Do this.

236
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,320
The butler.

237
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:02,435
- I think the butler is a good one. - The butler.

238
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:04,560
I knew it.

239
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:05,990
If he knows the passcode, he knows everything.

240
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:07,590
If he doesn't share it with us, it means he's the thief.

241
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,590
The CEO is nothing without me.

242
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,200
- It means he's... - He can't do anything without me.

243
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,370
I must know the passcode. I should know that.

244
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,470
- You don't. - Only the butler knows it.

245
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,140
I don't know the passcode of my own safe?

246
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,170
You don't know.

247
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,410
- I told you. - What kind of CEO am I?

248
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:22,970
- I mean... - If I don't know it...

249
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,240
And he knows it?

250
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,480
- The passcode of my safe? - How can a CEO not know?

251
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,250
- So you should be nice to me. - It doesn't make sense.

252
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,980
Jae Seok is the influential one here.

253
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,465
- The judge. - It doesn't make sense.

254
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:37,490
- The judge gets two ballots. - Two ballots?

255
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,305
We should be careful around him.

256
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:43,560
- Detective. - Detective.

257
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:46,445
- I'm the detective. What is it? - Kwang Soo, take my side.

258
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,170
He can watch any video for 20 seconds.

259
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,900
Am I supposed to share it with others?

260
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:51,200
It's up to you.

261
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:53,240
If you're innocent, you'll share the correct information with them.

262
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:56,555
If you're a thief, you will hide what you saw.

263
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,625
The lawyer.

264
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:03,580
She can rule out a suspect she wants...

265
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:05,180
- at the first trial. - It's not bad.

266
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,720
- It's a good one. - Because she's a lawyer.

267
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:09,520
- She can exclude a suspect. - That's right.

268
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,605
- That's right. She can rule it out. - Okay.

269
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,675
- The insurance salesman. - It's me.

270
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:17,960
He can find out the number of stolen gold bars?

271
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,500
- He knows how many are stolen. - What's that?

272
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:20,830
It's the worst one.

273
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:23,170
- Why would you want to know it? - It's the worst.

274
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:24,370
We will find it out eventually.

275
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,040
Why would you want to know about what's already stolen?

276
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,510
I'm just like a viewer here.

277
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,170
The insurance salesman can see...

278
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:32,180
how hard the thieves worked in each round.

279
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,195
- That's right. - In each round.

280
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,095
The gambler.

281
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:38,380
The prize and penalty are doubled?

282
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,820
- Whatever it is... - In the live broadcast,

283
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:42,320
if you think your team will win, you can double your bet.

284
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,520
- Whatever it is, I can double it. - It's a good one.

285
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:44,790
- I like that. - The prize can be doubled too.

286
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:45,920
- That's amazing. - It's a nice one.

287
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:46,960
The prize can be doubled.

288
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:48,675
- That's not bad. - The penalty is doubled too.

289
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,745
Analyst.

290
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:54,930
"Guess the thief chosen by viewers..."

291
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:58,000
If the analyst successfully guesses who will get the most votes,

292
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,440
he or she wins a penalty transfer card.

293
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,310
And the card can be used the same day.

294
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,070
- That sounds fun. - Really?

295
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,740
- So I have to say it at the end? - The analyst is pretty good.

296
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,010
- Yes, at the end. - At the end.

297
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,625
Okay.

298
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,920
Just so you know, the thieves heard about the roles...

299
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,835
- and the capabilities beforehand. - Really?

300
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,890
The thieves can be caught...

301
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:24,200
through three trials.

302
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,300
In the first trial, the members will take a vote to choose two suspects.

303
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:30,230
And I will tell you...

304
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:33,540
if any of the suspects are thieves.

305
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:35,255
- Okay. - Thieves...

306
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:40,080
In the second trial, you will take a vote to choose one suspect...

307
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,480
and see if he or she is a thief.

308
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,095
Okay.

309
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,590
The final trial will take place...

310
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:51,690
during the much-anticipated live broadcast at the end of the show.

311
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:54,930
The viewers will have the same information as you have...

312
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:57,260
while watching today's race...

313
00:11:57,266 --> 00:12:00,445
and can vote by sending a text.

314
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:03,230
The identity of the suspect chosen by the viewers...

315
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:07,015
will be revealed during the live broadcast.

316
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,825
Got it.

317
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:16,750
There's a penalty?

318
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:19,580
Among the viewers who successfully guessed the thief,

319
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,750
one gets a massage chair,

320
00:12:21,758 --> 00:12:26,435
and 10 get name tags signed by the members.

321
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,505
Kwang Soo, can you demonstrate?

322
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,775
Can it be used by someone who is 2m tall?

323
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:34,870
- I pushed the button. - It's extending.

324
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:37,715
- Here... - It even massages your feet.

325
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:41,140
There you go.

326
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:42,470
These days...

327
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:44,310
- I pushed the button. - It's extending.

328
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:46,240
- It's extending. - Look at this.

329
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:48,480
Even Kwang Soo can fit?

330
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:49,950
How does it feel? Does it massage here too?

331
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:51,320
- I definitely want this. - It massages here too.

332
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,820
- How does it feel? - It must feel nice.

333
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,435
It's very relaxing.

334
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:57,435
Is it working?

335
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,290
- Just stay still. - Stay still.

336
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,805
- You should test it. - We'll give the thumbs up.

337
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:15,770
Thank you so much for your love and support...

338
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,110
- for the past 10 years. - Thank you!

339
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:21,480
- We can't thank our viewers enough. - I know.

340
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:25,150
Please watch the show carefully and text the name...

341
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:29,765
of the most suspicious one before the final trial.

342
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:36,990
The member who gets the most votes...

343
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:40,200
from the viewers will be put on Judgment Stand...

344
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:42,970
- I see. - during the live broadcast.

345
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:45,670
Dear viewers, please find the thief...

346
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:47,100
with your sharp eyes.

347
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:49,940
- Let's get started! - Yes!

348
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:51,655
Let's go!

349
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:55,795
The place looks fancy.

350
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,420
- Welcome to my house. - What's with that portrait?

351
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,850
- This is just 1 of my 99 rooms. - Oh, my.

352
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,465
Really?

353
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:05,705
Butler Yu, please show them around.

354
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:08,690
- I'm a judge! - I'm a detective!

355
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:11,600
I'll talk to the detective about that.

356
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,645
- I want to look cool. - Come on.

357
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:17,270
Guys, you're not allowed to sit on the sofa.

358
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,270
It's just for show. It's expensive. Don't sit on it.

359
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,440
- Everyone, have a seat. - Okay.

360
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,240
- Don't sit on it. - Everyone, have a seat.

361
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:24,540
Okay.

362
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:25,980
- I'll listen to the butler. - Gosh.

363
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,040
- Let's sit down. - My goodness.

364
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:30,920
I'm so glad to have you all here in this humble house.

365
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,450
Why don't you put that glass down?

366
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,620
- What? - Put that glass down.

367
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,250
He carries around the glass...

368
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:38,235
because he's petty.

369
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:40,630
Hey!

370
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,690
- His business is petty too. - He's petty.

371
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,160
- CEO Petty. - Yes, CEO Petty.

372
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,900
- His nickname is Petty. - I disagree.

373
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:46,930
- He's petty. - It's a crystal.

374
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:50,315
- Welcome to the Big Nose Mansion. - It's huge.

375
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,240
- There will be a party here? - Enjoy yourselves.

376
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:55,710
The first room search will begin shortly.

377
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:56,770
- Already? - Yes.

378
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,380
Each of you will search the room...

379
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:01,250
for 50 seconds in the order chosen by CEO Big Nose.

380
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,650
Each of you will search the room for 50 seconds.

381
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,150
According to the mission results, the videos of the bottom two...

382
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,520
will be revealed for 20 and 30 seconds each.

383
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,520
They will be revealed to the viewers as well.

384
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,020
- The videos will be revealed? - Hold on.

385
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:16,230
The passcode for the safe is supposed to be only known to me.

386
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:18,230
Do the thieves know it too?

387
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:20,200
- Yes. - Really?

388
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:23,015
The thieves know it when I don't?

389
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,000
- You'd know it if you're a thief. - I see, if I'm a thief.

390
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,010
- That's right. - Is that possible? You're the CEO.

391
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,510
The CEO might be one of the thieves.

392
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,710
There are 100 gold bars in total...

393
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,580
- distributed in 3 safes. - 100 gold bars?

394
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:39,665
That means the thieves can win up to 3,000 dollars.

395
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:41,920
Plus the massage chair.

396
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,520
One important thing to remember. Five additional ballots...

397
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,160
are hidden in the room.

398
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:47,330
- We can find them? - In the room?

399
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,690
- In the room? - Yes.

400
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,390
The more ballots you have,

401
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,160
the easier it'll be to catch the thieves without getting chosen.

402
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:56,100
That's right. But the thieves want to steal the gold bars,

403
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:57,130
so they'd want to buy time.

404
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,540
I'm suspecting those...

405
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,710
- who came early today. - Right.

406
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:02,970
The staff must have said this.

407
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:05,180
"To have an advantage over the others, come early..."

408
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,910
- "and be the judge or detective." - No.

409
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,610
- Right. - To be honest,

410
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:11,520
I'm not sure if the judge has any advantage over the others.

411
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,320
You do. You can cover up...

412
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,020
- for your teammates. - Right.

413
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,620
You have an advantage when picking out thieves.

414
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,360
- Of course. - You do.

415
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:22,590
How can you say the judge has no advantage?

416
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,830
Isn't it better to search first if you want ballots?

417
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,860
- If you want ballots, yes. - Right?

418
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:28,700
- Then I'll go first. - What?

419
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,040
- Does he get to decide everything? - You?

420
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,100
- Fine, go ahead. - You want to go first?

421
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:33,600
I'll go first and take a look.

422
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:35,370
- I have 50 seconds? Okay. - Yes.

423
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:37,710
The next person is Se Chan.

424
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:39,240
- Me? - And then?

425
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,540
And then Ji Hyo.

426
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,010
- Hold on. Why... - Why?

427
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,565
Those two won't be able to find anything anyway.

428
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:48,820
Those two won't find anything.

429
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:51,460
- You chose the stupid ones first? - That's why I chose them.

430
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,820
You should send me in after them...

431
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:56,560
so that I can see if any gold bars have been taken.

432
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,460
- You think so? You'll do that? - Yes.

433
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:01,300
If I go into the room...

434
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:03,270
after Ji Hyo,

435
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,700
- Me and... - Se Chan, and the CEO,

436
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,240
and no gold bar is missing,

437
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:08,910
that means the ones that enter after me could be the thieves.

438
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,470
- That's right. - You'll be able to figure that out.

439
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:11,980
That's why you should go in in the middle.

440
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,125
The butler is the most powerful.

441
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,350
Why does the butler have so much power?

442
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,250
- I should have become the butler. - What is this?

443
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,165
- I should have chosen it. - I could have chosen it.

444
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:22,190
Why didn't you become the butler?

445
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:24,760
I'll go in and take a look.

446
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,420
I'm too curious.

447
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:29,175
So this is it. This is the room.

448
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,355
This is my room.

449
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:44,325
My 3,000 dollars.

450
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,325
So this is the safe.

451
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:50,495
What is this? Time passes too fast. I couldn't do anything.

452
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,335
- Is this it? - It starts as soon as I enter?

453
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,175
My goodness.

454
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,345
- Seeing how Jae Seok is quiet... - What took you so long?

455
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,445
Is anything missing?

456
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,870
- There are gold bars missing. - There are?

457
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,600
My goodness.

458
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,070
- That means a thief has been there. - A thief has been there.

459
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:16,240
- A thief has been there. - A thief has been there. Who is it?

460
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:18,640
- Detective, Lawyer, - The stupid ones...

461
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,040
Judge, and CEO Big Nose.

462
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:22,110
- One or more of you... - One or more of them are thieves.

463
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:24,720
- are thieves. - It could be you too.

464
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,050
- That's right. - Is one gold bar missing?

465
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:27,350
- No. - How many were missing?

466
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,220
There are three safes,

467
00:18:29,225 --> 00:18:32,705
- and I opened all of them. - Okay.

468
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,360
And gold bars were missing from two of them.

469
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,290
- Two of them? - They were broken into?

470
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,660
It could be you.

471
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,600
- It could be him, right? - I can check the videos.

472
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,030
If I check Jae Seok's, we'll know.

473
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,330
You'll see in my video.

474
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,270
I only checked the safes as soon as I entered the room.

475
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:47,955
Detective, let's do it like this.

476
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,880
I can find out the number of missing gold bars.

477
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,510
- The number... - And we'll say it at the same time.

478
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:54,750
You want to do that?

479
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,450
Everyone is so serious today.

480
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:58,150
I have no idea who are the thieves.

481
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:00,165
- Haha, go. - You should go, Haha.

482
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:11,930
All eight of you have searched the room.

483
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:14,430
- Insurance salesman Haha, - Yes.

484
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,700
come forward so I can tell you.

485
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:17,840
That's pretty useful.

486
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,070
It was a good one after all.

487
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,600
- Haha. - It's a good one.

488
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:22,885
That's the most important information right now.

489
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,280
- He's so cute. He looks like a kid. - You look so cute.

490
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:30,180
How many gold bars were missing?

491
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:34,320
When I checked, 3 or 4 were missing at most.

492
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:37,520
You can decide if you want to tell the number to the others.

493
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:40,060
Here's the number of gold bars taken by the thieves.

494
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:42,390
You should tell me, at least. I'm the CEO here.

495
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,700
Jae Seok said about four were missing.

496
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,575
How many were taken?

497
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,630
Haha, is the number higher than you expected?

498
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:50,315
What do you think?

499
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:52,170
Hold on.

500
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:54,455
- What happened? - Is the number high?

501
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:57,440
Why?

502
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,440
What's wrong? Tell us. I'm curious.

503
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,350
- Can I decide not to tell them? - Yes.

504
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:04,620
- Tell us. - Can he lie too?

505
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,550
- Yes, he can. - If he is a thief...

506
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,190
Tell us.

507
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,020
It'll help when we vote.

508
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:15,230
All right. The thing is, if I tell you the number now,

509
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,100
it can cause a bit of trouble.

510
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,600
You should tell us the number...

511
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:22,130
so we can compare...

512
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,100
I'll talk to the detective about that in private.

513
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,140
Bye, then.

514
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,040
Sir! Wait!

515
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:30,040
Take my business card, at least.

516
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,080
- Take my business card. - What is he doing?

517
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:33,540
What is he trying to do?

518
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:35,210
I don't know exactly what you're trying to do,

519
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:37,210
but it suits you so well that it drives me crazy.

520
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,020
- It suits him too well. - His hairstyle...

521
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:41,650
- It's perfect for him. - It suits him perfectly.

522
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,990
How many are missing?

523
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,620
- Right now... - You should tell me.

524
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:46,220
I can't tell you right now.

525
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:48,930
- You have to tell me, so... - Haha, tell me later.

526
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:52,175
- You have to tell me. - That was my decision.

527
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:55,600
- I'm so frustrated. - Goodness. Now...

528
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,900
Now it's hard to tell because everyone's so good.

529
00:20:57,906 --> 00:21:00,070
We'll start the first mission where you will be able to see the video...

530
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:02,110
- of the members searching the room. - Okay.

531
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:03,670
It's called Catch Me If You Can.

532
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,010
- What is it? - For this mission,

533
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,910
we've invited a specialist to help CEO Big Nose...

534
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,980
improve his ability to react quickly to things.

535
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:11,480
- What is it? - Please come out.

536
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:12,780
- Who is it? - Is someone joining us?

537
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:13,980
It's a foreigner.

538
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,650
- Is he a Turkish ice cream vendor? - Turkish ice cream.

539
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:17,990
- Hello. - Hello.

540
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:19,620
Isn't he from Itaewon? Are you from Itaewon?

541
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:21,190
- Yes, I am. - I see.

542
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,690
- Come here. - Come here.

543
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,930
Come here.

544
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:25,900
It's impossible to grab the Turkish ice cream.

545
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,530
I've never done this before.

546
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,600
- Is it hard to grab? - You will go one at a time.

547
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:32,100
The order will be determined by how fast...

548
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:33,840
- you grab the ice cream. - I'm in trouble.

549
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:35,510
If the cone breaks,

550
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,910
the clock will still run as he changes the cone.

551
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:39,880
- I'll go first. - Have you done this before?

552
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,525
No, I haven't.

553
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:44,050
- Welcome. - Hello.

554
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,650
- What flavor would you like? - Vanilla, please.

555
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:46,680
- Vanilla? - Yes.

556
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:47,690
- It started. - Okay.

557
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,020
- Has the clock already started? - Yes, it has.

558
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:50,720
- Okay. So time is passing. - You don't...

559
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,560
have to play tricks. You can just give it to me.

560
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,830
- You can... - I'll give you everything.

561
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,930
- Okay. - Okay.

562
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:57,705
He said he's going to give you everything.

563
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,015
- Here you go. - This is...

564
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:04,415
What are you doing?

565
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:07,440
How is that possible?

566
00:22:07,443 --> 00:22:09,610
- That's nice. - I don't have time!

567
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:11,180
- You have to grab it. - What are you doing?

568
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,580
That's nice.

569
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,480
- That's so cool. - Isn't the clock running?

570
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:16,810
That was so cool. The whole thing came out.

571
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,965
The whole thing can come out.

572
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:22,635
- Now... - He's focusing.

573
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,935
- I think he'll be able to grab it. - You have to grab it.

574
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:27,605
- Is this what you do? - Here.

575
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,805
It looks like it's going to fall.

576
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:34,100
- Darn it! - That's it.

577
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,800
- This is the funniest. - That makes you so angry.

578
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:37,815
You will never be able to grab it.

579
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,900
- There's no way. - There's no way.

580
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,955
It runs away.

581
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:47,580
That can make you angry.

582
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,495
Hit him on top of his head.

583
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,050
- It slipped out of his hand. - He's just putting it in his hand.

584
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,390
- Why can't you grab it? - He's just putting it in his hand.

585
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:00,660
Why can't you grab it?

586
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:02,275
I grabbed it!

587
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:04,500
He pretty much just gave it to you.

588
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,200
- It took 1 minute and 35 seconds. - Okay!

589
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:07,730
- He practically gave it to you. - Thank you.

590
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,100
- You have to grab it in one try. - Thank you.

591
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:10,370
He managed to succeed.

592
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:13,370
- Goodness. It's possible to get it. - He looks really upset.

593
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,610
Dondurma.

594
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,010
- Dondurma. - Dondurma.

595
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:18,680
- Kaymak. - Dondurma.

596
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,810
He learns all these random things while roaming around.

597
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,780
- Please give me vanilla. - Okay.

598
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:24,880
- I need to grab vanilla. - Okay.

599
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,150
I need to catch the vanilla ice cream quickly.

600
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,820
- Okay. - Dondurma.

601
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,120
- You have to grab it. - It's like "Comedy Big League".

602
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:32,490
- It's here. - It's here?

603
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,790
- It's here. - Where?

604
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:36,590
- It's here. - Where was it?

605
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:37,800
- Was it here? Should I grab it? - Here.

606
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,900
- Yes, grab it. - Grab it?

607
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:41,300
- Put it here. - He's getting annoyed by Se Chan.

608
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:43,630
- Put it over here. - Okay.

609
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,470
- You need to grab it. - His face is getting red.

610
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:48,670
Grab it.

611
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,370
- I can't grab it. - You have to grab it.

612
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:52,010
You have to do it slowly.

613
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,780
- Okay. - Go slowly.

614
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:55,150
- This is hilarious. - I'll go slowly like this.

615
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,080
- Like this. - The vendor is getting angry.

616
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,920
- Slowly. Like this. - Like this.

617
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:00,880
- This is hilarious. - You should give me a chance.

618
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:02,620
- Like this. - You should give me a chance.

619
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,460
You should give a chance. I missed my chance.

620
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,260
- I missed the chance you gave me. - You should've grabbed it.

621
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:07,890
I missed the chance you gave me.

622
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:09,390
- You should've grabbed it. - I missed the chance.

623
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:10,560
- Be honest. - Here.

624
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:12,530
You planned this skit with him, didn't you?

625
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,900
You met with the vendor, didn't you?

626
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:15,270
- Right? - Did you?

627
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,300
This is hard.

628
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:17,800
It seems like you planned out your lines too.

629
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:20,000
This is hard. You are good.

630
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:21,640
Dondurma.

631
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:23,710
- Dondurma. Kaymak. Grab it. - Dondurma. Kaymak.

632
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,925
Kaymak.

633
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,480
- He got it. - He got it.

634
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:30,195
- He got it. - He did it.

635
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,980
He got it.

636
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:34,150
It took 1 minute and 18 seconds.

637
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:35,650
Dondurma!

638
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,235
That was amazing.

639
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:39,260
How do you do it?

640
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:41,190
This is hard. What should I do?

641
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:42,990
- Welcome. - Hello.

642
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:44,390
What flavor would you like? Chocolate,

643
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,930
- vanilla... - Please give me vanilla.

644
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:48,615
- Vanilla? Okay. - Yes.

645
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,670
- Here you go. - You're giving me so little.

646
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:51,840
- Thank you. - Thank you.

647
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,440
- What is he doing? - What is he doing?

648
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:54,670
- Thank you. - Thank you.

649
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,455
- What is he doing? - What is he doing?

650
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:57,740
Are you just giving it to me?

651
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,880
What is this?

652
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:00,140
I'm sorry, but...

653
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:02,180
- What is this? - What's going on?

654
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:03,350
- What are you doing? - Excuse me.

655
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:04,350
I'm not here to collect money.

656
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:05,480
- You shouldn't do that. - What is he doing?

657
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:06,550
- What are you doing, sir? - I'm not here to take...

658
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:08,290
- your money. - What are you doing?

659
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,605
He's a bit scary.

660
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,060
He could hit me, so I'm scared.

661
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:15,830
- Nice. - Here you go.

662
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:19,175
- Thank you. - Kim Jong Kook. 14 seconds.

663
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:26,440
- Everyone. - Yes.

664
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,855
I'll show you 20 seconds of Haha's entrance video.

665
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:31,580
It's okay to see my video.

666
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,525
Play the video.

667
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:42,835
- He doesn't go near the safe. - He doesn't go near it.

668
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:45,360
The safe is right there, but he's not going near it?

669
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,190
It might be on purpose.

670
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:49,975
- Could that be it? - He's not going to the safe?

671
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:56,430
He's searching... He must've planned it.

672
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:58,570
He must've planned it.

673
00:25:58,574 --> 00:25:59,640
I'm sure Jae Seok will go to the safe.

674
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,070
We'll watch Jae Seok's video next.

675
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:04,640
I'm sure Jae Seok will go to the safe.

676
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,210
- I go straight there. - I'm sure.

677
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:08,550
Because I need to check.

678
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,550
If we're lucky, we might get to see the inside of the safe.

679
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:11,820
It might be caught on video.

680
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,765
Play 30 seconds.

681
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,865
Look at that.

682
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:19,460
Press start.

683
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:21,305
The passcode shouldn't come out.

684
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,530
- Bottom, top. - I can't tell.

685
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:25,060
- Side, top. It's too long. - So Min, try to see it.

686
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:26,645
It's too long.

687
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,900
That was pretty much the same.

688
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:34,885
Shouldn't you have checked the thieves' safe?

689
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,640
I don't know the passcode to the thieves' safe.

690
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:38,255
So you can't see it.

691
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,395
I don't know the passcode to the thieves' safe.

692
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,465
- It was missing. - It disappeared.

693
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:48,890
- It was missing. - It disappeared.

694
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,920
- The 1st one still had it. - The 1st one still had it.

695
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:53,705
It was missing from the 2nd and 3rd safes.

696
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:56,560

697
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,730
and they have seen this video as well.

698
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:01,700
We're going to vote on the first trial.

699
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,670
For the first trial, please write the name...

700
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:06,670
of the people you deem suspicious...

701
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:09,310
on your basic ballot and any additional ballots you have found.

702
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:10,910
- Did you find any? - No, I didn't.

703
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:12,180
And according to the results,

704
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,880
the two people with the most votes will be put on the Judgment Stand,

705
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,280
and you will be told whether or not there is a thief among them.

706
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:19,780
- Goodness. - Goodness.

707
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:23,790
I haven't told anyone yet,

708
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:26,190
but can I choose to tell a couple of people?

709
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:27,390
- You can do that if you want. - Who?

710
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,560
You said you would tell the detective.

711
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,990
- Tell me. - Detective.

712
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:31,430
- Yes. - You're not going to tell me?

713
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:32,460
- Okay. - The insurance salesman...

714
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,200
The insurance salesman must tell me.

715
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:36,070
- Since I'm the detective, - Hold on.

716
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,200
- I will decide. - I'm the judge,

717
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:38,500
- why aren't you telling me? - It's my gold bar.

718
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:40,070
Excuse me, insurance salesman. The gold bar is mine.

719
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,710
The detective and...

720
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,010
I have three ballots.

721
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:45,080
- I have more ballots. - And the judge. These two.

722
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,340
- No. - The judge.

723
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:49,480
I'm positive the thieves are in that group.

724
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:53,065
The analyst is included, but the butler is not?

725
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:54,350
- What's incredible... - Yes?

726
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:56,865
- How many disappeared? - right now is...

727
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,460
Jae Seok said that...

728
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:02,990
- they were missing, right? - Right.

729
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:05,075
- I checked it. - Right.

730
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,660
I checked the safes,

731
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:09,430
- the gold bars... - Are they still there?

732
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,015
They're still there.

733
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:15,210
I opened all three safes,

734
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,740
- two of the safes were empty. - Two of them?

735
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:19,080
They were all stolen?

736
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,895
This is how many gold bars there are.

737
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:26,565
- How many were stolen? - Were there a lot stolen?

738
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:32,820
I'm telling you exactly what I saw.

739
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:35,290
That's why I didn't announce it in front of everyone.

740
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,290
- I see. - Right.

741
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,600
It must be what he saw earlier. About the gold bars.

742
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,830
There must've been a hint.

743
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,400
I think we have to vote for Jae Seok.

744
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:43,630
- For now. - In this round.

745
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,570
- For the 1st trial. - Since it's the 1st round.

746
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:47,400
- Since we know. If we fail, - We should vote for him.

747
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:48,640
that means he was just mistaken.

748
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,710
I think we should vote for him.

749
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:52,380
- Okay. - Okay.

750
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,640
The detective can choose any member...

751
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,450
and watch 20 seconds of their video.

752
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:58,680
- I can? - Yes.

753
00:28:58,687 --> 00:29:00,250
And the lawyer...

754
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:03,050
can take one person off the list of suspects.

755
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:04,090
- Okay. - That's right.

756
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:05,520
- Whose video should I watch? - Tell us.

757
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:07,435
You don't have to say it out loud.

758
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:10,790
We have something we're basing things on.

759
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,530
- You guys must be onto something. - Yes, we are.

760
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:14,675
Whose video do you want to see?

761
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:22,540
Did Haha find out something incredible?

762
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:23,710
It's not that I found something,

763
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:25,510
I'm moving according to the information I received.

764
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,680
It gave me goosebumps.

765
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,710
It is really surprising.

766
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:28,710
Really?

767
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:30,280
- I really got chills. - Did you really get chills?

768
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:32,365
What is it? I'm curious.

769
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,180
- Goodness. - That's incredible.

770
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,790
- Did you see something? - It's...

771
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,350
- My gosh. - Did you see something?

772
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,520
- Are you onto something? - It was...

773
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,090
It was short,

774
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:43,460
but the person was headed to that direction when it got cut.

775
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:45,800
- I see. - So I... Gosh.

776
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,160
- I see. - Yes.

777
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:48,430
There's someone you're suspicious of.

778
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:50,200
Lawyer Song can choose one person...

779
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,070
to be removed from the first trial.

780
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:57,470
I need to know something to take a person off the list.

781
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,980
You can choose yourself.

782
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,240
Really?

783
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:04,825
If I were to choose one person aside from myself...

784
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:06,620
Who would you choose?

785
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:08,265
I...

786
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:09,350
choose Kim Jong Kook.

787
00:30:09,357 --> 00:30:12,190
- You'd take Jong Kook out? - Why would you take him out?

788
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:14,990
This is a weird choice.

789
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:17,490
She could take herself out, but she didn't.

790
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:20,760
I'm just saying we shouldn't waste ballots.

791
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:22,030
- This is too weird. - This is weird.

792
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,170
Isn't this strange?

793
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:25,015
Those two must be the thieves.

794
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:28,070
This could be it.

795
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,410
- This... - That can't be it.

796
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,940
How can you say that when you didn't even hear what I had to say?

797
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:32,940
You didn't even hear what I had to say.

798
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:34,140
This is nice. It's funny. Do this a bit longer.

799
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:35,880
- How do you know if it can't be? - Do it a bit longer.

800
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:38,180
This could lead to us finding both thieves right away.

801
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:39,720
- Tell us. - How? Tell us.

802
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:42,550
If she were to remove herself from the list,

803
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:44,050
then she can't remove herself...

804
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,790
- next time. So for her to... - Right.

805
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:47,290
To show that she's not a person of interest.

806
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:48,560
- Yes, that could be her plan. - Right, that's possible.

807
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:49,990
I'm not saying it is. I'm just saying it can be.

808
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:51,430
- That could be her plan. - Exactly.

809
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,660
Lawyer Song made her choice.

810
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:55,700
It means you can't choose Jong Kook as a suspect.

811
00:30:55,704 --> 00:30:57,130
Unbelievable.

812
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:59,740
You will all now get to vote.

813
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:01,470
- The judge gets two votes. - Right.

814
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:03,070
We all get one vote?

815
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:04,840
There's a thief among those that went before us.

816
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:07,340
Before you and me, Se Chan, Kwang Soo,

817
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:09,580
- There's one among them. - and Ji Hyo went in.

818
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:11,110
It's one of the three.

819
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,065
Ji Hyo? But she...

820
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:14,620
Did you search the room after she did?

821
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,190
Yes, she went in before I did.

822
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:17,450
Right, so it's one out of the three.

823
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,290
- Then... - So Min, join us.

824
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,875
Who should I suspect?

825
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,860
I can't believe you're grouping up by yourselves.

826
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:27,230
It hurts, right?

827
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:29,130
What are you talking about? Can I hear it too?

828
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,230
- Whatever. - Why does it matter to you?

829
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:31,870
- Seok Jin... - You never listen to us anyway.

830
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:33,270
I suspect Haha, that's why.

831
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:35,655
Fine, be suspicious of him someplace else.

832
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,940
- I'll do as you say. - Then join us.

833
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:39,480
I'll add my vote.

834
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:43,980
Since we suspect Jae Seok as one of the thieves,

835
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:48,465
we should put someone up with him that seems innocent.

836
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:50,220
- To know for sure? - Right.

837
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:51,420
- That's right. - We need to be sure.

838
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:54,905
What if we put Kwang Soo on the chopping block too?

839
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,745
What if we put Kwang Soo on the chopping block too?

840
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:03,200
What if none of them is a thief?

841
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:04,430
- Exactly. - Then,

842
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,100
- the heat will be on Haha. - Yes, I'll be the next target.

843
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:08,610
- Because he threw us off. - I'll have to defend myself.

844
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,710
Exactly.

845
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:11,510
Please write down the name of a suspect.

846
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,240
Okay, there he goes.

847
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:14,280
Off he goes.

848
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:15,680
He's been given...

849
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,110
- an adorable character. - I know.

850
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:19,720
He was given a character we can only love.

851
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,735
I wouldn't mind signing 10 insurance contracts with him.

852
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:28,105
- Guys. - Yes?

853
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:30,775
- We have tallied your votes. - Sure.

854
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,500
CEO Big Nose can choose whether or not...

855
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:35,630
to nullify his butler's vote.

856
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:37,900
- Is that important? - It's up to you to decide.

857
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:39,740
- My butler's vote? - Yes.

858
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:41,640
- The one he voted... - Jae Seok's vote...

859
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:43,540
- will be nullified. - His vote...

860
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,180
It could change who takes the stand.

861
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,380
- Exactly. I will... - Right.

862
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,610
- Sir. - Yes?

863
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:49,450
You must leave my vote as is...

864
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:50,780
to catch the thief.

865
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:54,020
Well, it's all due to the fact that you seem quite suspicious.

866
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,835
Unbelievable.

867
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:57,535
Is this what you all want?

868
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:02,275
I will nullify Jae Seok's vote.

869
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:05,060
That seems like the right choice. I have serious doubts about him.

870
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,600
You've got to be kidding me.

871
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:08,630
- With his vote nullified... - Yes?

872
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:09,670
Here are the two...

873
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,415
- on the chopping block. - Okay.

874
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:13,385
Jae Seok...

875
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:21,810
Yu Jae Seok and Lee Kwang Soo.

876
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:22,810
Me?

877
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:24,880
- Yu Jae Seok and Lee Kwang Soo. - Me?

878
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:26,565
Kwang Soo too?

879
00:33:41,036 --> 00:33:43,300
- Yu Jae Seok and Lee Kwang Soo. - Me?

880
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:44,300
Please take the stand.

881
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:46,470
- It's not because we suspect you. - Jae Seok,

882
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:48,370
- it'll be Kwang Soo. - We know it's Jae Seok.

883
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:49,810
That's why we chose an innocent person to join him.

884
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:51,170
- But he... - If...

885
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,840
there turns out to be a thief among us...

886
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:56,680
The viewers are joining us for this race.

887
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:59,180
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo have been chosen...

888
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:02,135
as the suspects in the first trial.

889
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:04,735
Is there a thief among them?

890
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:06,960
There is.

891
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,060
There is a thief among them.

892
00:34:09,064 --> 00:34:10,630
See?

893
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,760
There is a thief among them.

894
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:15,230
- You jerk. - Hold on a second.

895
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:16,230
There is a thief among them.

896
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:17,830
See?

897
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,300
- Haha, gosh. - Hold on.

898
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,770
- What did I tell you? - Okay.

899
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:23,410
- Okay, fine. - Seok Jin, we told you why.

900
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:25,240
Why do you think Jae Seok is a thief?

901
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:26,810
- We already told you. - When?

902
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,650
- I'll say it again. It isn't me. - Seok Jin.

903
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,410
- There's only one more to go. - Is it really him?

904
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:31,550
- Like I said... - It's him.

905
00:34:31,553 --> 00:34:33,620
Let me tell you why I suspect the butler.

906
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:34,650
- Right. - Sure.

907
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,290
Jae Seok told us that the safe was empty.

908
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:38,320
Yes, tell everyone that.

909
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,160
The information given to me...

910
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,390
revealed that the gold bars hadn't been moved.

911
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:43,560
- What? - So...

912
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:45,775
- That doesn't make sense. - See?

913
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,900
It's like this. Jae Seok...

914
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,800
told us his version of the story knowing that the other thief...

915
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:51,970
will take the gold bar.

916
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:53,200
- It was a signal. - That's right.

917
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:56,440
But the other thief couldn't take it due to the circumstances.

918
00:34:56,444 --> 00:34:57,770
Let me tell you my side of the story.

919
00:34:57,779 --> 00:34:59,480
Sure, go ahead.

920
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:01,980
We were told that the number of gold bars...

921
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:03,780
averaged around 33 to 34.

922
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:07,180
So the thief would've only taken about 3 to 4.

923
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,250
Not a lot could've been taken.

924
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:11,390
So the safe wasn't fully stocked...

925
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:12,890
- with the gold bars. - No.

926
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:14,690
I didn't have the time...

927
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,130
to actually count the number of gold bars.

928
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:19,460
You could've thought that some were taken when they were not?

929
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:20,560
I could've easily been mistaken.

930
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:21,870
- That could've happened? - Yes.

931
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,770
- That's reasonable. - I see.

932
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:27,240
Kwang Soo, it's your turn to defend yourself.

933
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:29,055
- Me? - Yes.

934
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:30,940
Why me?

935
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:33,110
Because Jae Seok makes a reasonable case.

936
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:34,210
In what way?

937
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,150
He could've been mistaken due to how the bars were stacked.

938
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:37,850
That I understand.

939
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:39,520
- Exactly. - I agree.

940
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:41,850
- At this very moment... - Hold on.

941
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:43,750
Let me say this one thing.

942
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:45,720
We have our thief.

943
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,220
- Kwang Soo. - It's him.

944
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,790
Let me defend myself too.

945
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:50,290
See? We have our thief.

946
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:53,900
I had a total of three ballots.

947
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,845
I had two to begin with, and I found another one in the room.

948
00:35:56,938 --> 00:35:59,015
Would I have had the time...

949
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,315
to find the extra ballot...

950
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:03,940
- and open the safe? - He wouldn't have.

951
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,070
- It doesn't make sense. - He didn't have enough time.

952
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,580
- There's not enough time. - Right.

953
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,410
Couldn't they both be the thieves?

954
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,480
- Exactly. - That could be true.

955
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:10,810
- It could be them both. - Right.

956
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:11,920
- Right. - That could be true.

957
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,980
- They both could be thieves. - That could be true.

958
00:36:13,988 --> 00:36:15,790
- Just admit it, you jerk! - What?

959
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,690
- Say that it's you! - You're the thief!

960
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:20,990
- Unbelievable. - Haha...

961
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:23,530
I'm not saying this because he's my butler,

962
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:26,860
but because I've known him for 30 years.

963
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,230
Jae Seok's definitely telling the truth.

964
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:30,770
- I don't detect a lie. - Exactly.

965
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,300
It's just how I feel.

966
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:34,800
- I'm confused. - Tell me about it.

967
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:38,040
Jong Kook won first place in the previous mission,

968
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:40,010
so he'll decide the order in which you'll search the room.

969
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:41,140
- Me? - We're going in again?

970
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:43,480
- I need to be smart about this. - Please decide on the order.

971
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:46,695
Keep the order similar to how it was before.

972
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:50,865
- Similarly? - Ji Hyo...

973
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:53,520
I saw the video of Ji Hyo, remember?

974
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:56,290
It got cut as she was about to reach the safe.

975
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,030
I can't wait to find out who the thieves are.

976
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:01,560
- Ji Hyo will enter first. - Sure.

977
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:02,900
- Got it. - Who'll go next?

978
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:05,245
- And then Jae Seok. - Sure.

979
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,540
Kwang Soo, Seok Jin,

980
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:09,940
- and then So Min. - You must not doubt us much.

981
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:11,340
I'll go, and then Haha will go.

982
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:13,110
- That's the order. - Sure, Ji Hyo, you first.

983
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:14,925
I can't believe this.

984
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,595
- You know... - You're really suspicious of me?

985
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:21,350
We're not 100 percent sure that you're the thief yet.

986
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:23,990
We'll decide after the second round.

987
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,720
I can be sure this time...

988
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:28,060
because I'm now aware of how the bars are set.

989
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:30,530
None were moved, so I'll know for sure this time.

990
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:31,730
Of course.

991
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:33,000
- I'll know for sure. - Shouldn't you take your time?

992
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,600
- Why wait? - Exactly.

993
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,915
- He needs to prove his innocence. - That's right.

994
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:47,555
No changes have been made to the safes.

995
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,280
- He's back. - How were they?

996
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:53,520
- What did you see? - I didn't notice a change.

997
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,620
They were exactly like what I saw during the first search.

998
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:57,290
Jae Seok should've entered last.

999
00:37:57,292 --> 00:38:00,335
- But he's the thief. - Guys, be on alert.

1000
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:03,160
The thieves will now make their move.

1001
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:04,160
They'll just steal the bars?

1002
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:05,930
- Hold on. And that's me? - Yes.

1003
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:07,230
- Of course. - I'll make my move this time?

1004
00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:08,630
Yes, this time around...

1005
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:10,300
From what I can tell, he already made his move.

1006
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:12,570
- I'm sure of it. - He already made his move.

1007
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:15,085
I'm sure of it. Just you wait and see.

1008
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:18,955
- Only Haha will know. - This is getting interesting.

1009
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,080
The insurance salesman...

1010
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:30,050
will be told how many gold bars were stolen.

1011
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,890
- Sure. - This is the most important round.

1012
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,420
You're playing a pivotal role in this game.

1013
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:35,560
- Tell me about it. - It's more crucial than I thought.

1014
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,390
He was given one of the best abilities.

1015
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,300
He holds the power to manipulate the public.

1016
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:41,860
- His ability... - Exactly.

1017
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:43,970
He can manipulate us all if he chooses to lie.

1018
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:45,340
That's right.

1019
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,070
He can manipulate us all if he chooses to lie.

1020
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,915
That's right.

1021
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:51,355
What happened?

1022
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:53,725
I bet many were taken.

1023
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,195
It doesn't make sense if none were.

1024
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:58,480
It happened exactly like how I suspected.

1025
00:38:58,486 --> 00:38:59,580
- How? - I'm sorry,

1026
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,880
- but can you take off your cap? - Take off your cap, Haha.

1027
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:02,350
- There he is. - Look at him.

1028
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:04,235
I'm a fan!

1029
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,805
Everyone.

1030
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:11,030
It happened exactly like how I suspected.

1031
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:12,830
- How? - Which is what?

1032
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:15,000
- A lot of gold bars... - I knew it.

1033
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:16,630
- were stolen. - See?

1034
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:19,570
- A lot of gold bars were stolen. - I knew it.

1035
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:20,570
See?

1036
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:22,840
What did I tell you? I was right, wasn't I?

1037
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:25,810
The number of stolen bars indicates that the thieves...

1038
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:27,840
- were in a hurry. - Right.

1039
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:30,350
This fact tells us one thing.

1040
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:31,380
- That's right. - What's that?

1041
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:34,350
That only one of the thieves made a move.

1042
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:36,120
We need to catch who that person is.

1043
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,190
- It has to be Jae Seok. - We can guess...

1044
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:39,660
depending on the order we went in.

1045
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,335
I conclude my briefing.

1046
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:43,360
- This is crazy. - Gosh.

1047
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:46,245
We'll move on to the next round.

1048
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:49,245
I have the result.

1049
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,140
Haha came in 7th, so you'll see 20 seconds of his search.

1050
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,070
Ji Hyo came in 8th, so you'll see 30 seconds of her search.

1051
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:57,910
Yes, we should get a look at Ji Hyo's search.

1052
00:39:57,912 --> 00:40:00,410
- Go ahead. I have nothing to hide. - They aren't the usual suspects.

1053
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:02,280
One of them could be the thief.

1054
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:03,980
- I'm suspicious of Haha. - Yes?

1055
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,865
- Let's take a look. - Play the video.

1056
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,635
I checked the safe after entering the room too.

1057
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:19,530
- Isn't he too calm though? - There's nothing here.

1058
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:23,245
The extra ballot isn't important anymore.

1059
00:40:23,438 --> 00:40:25,700
- The extra ballot. - That's not what's important.

1060
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:27,885
He heads toward the safe.

1061
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:33,480
Next is the 30-second video of Ji Hyo's search.

1062
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:35,895
- Yes, Ji Hyo's search. - Play the video.

1063
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,380
Ji Hyo is one of the names in the suspect pool.

1064
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:42,520
- Yes, she's on the list. - Of course.

1065
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,690
- Where's the extra ballot? - She went in first.

1066
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,920
She's definitely not a thief.

1067
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:48,535
She can't be a thief. She is too relaxed.

1068
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:50,275
She went before me.

1069
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,730
Ji Hyo didn't steal the gold bars. Jae Seok said nothing had changed.

1070
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:55,945
I checked. Ji Hyo didn't steal the gold bars.

1071
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:59,540
But she could still be a thief.

1072
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,615
That's right. Perhaps she pretended to be innocent.

1073
00:41:02,844 --> 00:41:04,755
I'm not a thief.

1074
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:07,825
- I'm not a thief. - I don't know anymore.

1075
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,480
- Was that 30-seconds long? - Yes.

1076
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:12,780
- She had 20 more seconds afterward. - That's right.

1077
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:14,320
In 20 seconds, you can punch in the passcode,

1078
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:15,950
open the safe, and take out the gold bars.

1079
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:17,890
- It's entirely possible. - It's entirely possible.

1080
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,490
She would have needed to move them to a different safe.

1081
00:41:19,494 --> 00:41:22,630
Listen. I went in after Ji Hyo, right?

1082
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,130
Everything was the same.

1083
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:25,330
- But... - Please prove my innocence.

1084
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:28,730
like I said, there is a possibility only one thief made a move.

1085
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,500
So it's not definitive evidence.

1086
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:32,900
- I'll check a video as a detective. - Okay, you can go ahead.

1087
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,470
That's a good benefit.

1088
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:35,510
Whose video will you watch?

1089
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,810
This step is really important.

1090
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:38,310
- This step is really important. - That's right.

1091
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:39,510
I will watch it carefully.

1092
00:41:39,514 --> 00:41:42,480
Perhaps Jae Seok thought he would get caught anyway...

1093
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:46,080
and moved a lot of gold bars.

1094
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,350
- Jae Seok? - Yes.

1095
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:49,335
Then watch my video.

1096
00:41:49,457 --> 00:41:51,750
- You should watch Kwang Soo's. - You can watch mine.

1097
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,290
We will learn about their identities soon.

1098
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:56,460
A thief among the two of us will get caught anyway.

1099
00:41:56,464 --> 00:41:58,175
Whose video should I watch?

1100
00:42:07,475 --> 00:42:09,310
Did you see anything suspicious?

1101
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,570
- Not at all. - Not at all?

1102
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:11,640
- Whose video did you watch? - Seriously.

1103
00:42:11,646 --> 00:42:14,825
So Min's video.

1104
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:18,450
Why did you watch So Min's video?

1105
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,920
- So Min's video is meaningless. - I said she isn't a thief.

1106
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:23,720
Perhaps he checked it to be certain since no one was suspecting me.

1107
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:26,120
She didn't do anything suspicious.

1108
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,160
We are aware of the fact that only the first 20 seconds get revealed.

1109
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:31,390
- So the thieves... - They wouldn't do anything.

1110
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:33,400
would only get to work...

1111
00:42:33,401 --> 00:42:34,530
after 20 seconds pass.

1112
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:36,700
- The last 30 seconds matter. - That's right.

1113
00:42:36,704 --> 00:42:37,870
Then they would run around.

1114
00:42:37,872 --> 00:42:40,840
This is your last chance to apprehend a thief...

1115
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:42,070
before the viewers vote.

1116
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,240
Whom should we put on the Judgment Stand?

1117
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:44,540
If you fail to catch a thief this time,

1118
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:46,910
the viewers' votes will determine the two suspects.

1119
00:42:46,914 --> 00:42:48,280
Then the likelihood of catching the thieves will fall.

1120
00:42:48,282 --> 00:42:50,210
- Let's put Jae Seok on the stand. - Put me on the stand.

1121
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:52,010
Let's take Kwang Soo out.

1122
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:53,780
- Listen to what I have to say. - Okay.

1123
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:56,220
If we must choose one of them to put on the Judgment Stand,

1124
00:42:56,223 --> 00:42:58,865
it has to be Kwang Soo.

1125
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,960
- I agree. - Listen to what I have to say.

1126
00:43:00,962 --> 00:43:02,760
Walk us through your reasoning.

1127
00:43:02,763 --> 00:43:04,975
- It's him. - He is a thief.

1128
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:07,760
The only thing Jae Seok can hope to achieve at this point...

1129
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:11,670
is making people continue to suspect Kwang Soo.

1130
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,670
If people continue to suspect Kwang Soo,

1131
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:19,110
his fellow thief will have a higher chance of survival.

1132
00:43:19,113 --> 00:43:20,810
- This is driving me crazy. - Am I right?

1133
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:22,750
Let me tell you what I think.

1134
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,380
I'm not on Jae Seok's side or anyone else's side.

1135
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:25,820
- I just want to catch the thieves. - That's not true.

1136
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,350
You are on Jae Seok's side.

1137
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,420
Do you think I am on his side?

1138
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:30,320
- It's obvious. - I'm beginning to get upset.

1139
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:31,950
- This is too much. - I'm not on his side.

1140
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:33,520
I can tell you this much.

1141
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,090
We got divided up because of you.

1142
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:36,960
- That's not true. - CEO Big Nose is on my side.

1143
00:43:36,964 --> 00:43:38,590
- That's true. - I am not on your side!

1144
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:40,300
I just want to catch the thieves.

1145
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:41,560
Is he the butler?

1146
00:43:41,569 --> 00:43:42,570
- What? - Who is the butler?

1147
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:43,730
He is the butler.

1148
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:44,800
It's rather confusing.

1149
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:47,285
- Actually, I am Batman. - Hey!

1150
00:43:47,475 --> 00:43:48,870
This is driving me crazy.

1151
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,910
You're Batman?

1152
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,310
- Hey! - He is Alfred.

1153
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:55,580
He enjoys the 4 major insurances and annual salary of 33,000 dollars.

1154
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,410
I'm the one who pays him.

1155
00:43:57,418 --> 00:43:58,450
- Jee-fred. - Jee-fred.

1156
00:43:58,452 --> 00:44:00,120
- I even give him incentives. - Jee-fred.

1157
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:01,520
Wait outside, Jee-fred.

1158
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:03,650
- Wait outside. - This is how Jee-fred is.

1159
00:44:03,658 --> 00:44:04,890
We should put Kwang Soo on the Judgment Stand.

1160
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,220
That's right. Let's put Kwang Soo on the Judgment Stand.

1161
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,030
If he is innocent, we will know that Jae Seok is a thief.

1162
00:44:10,031 --> 00:44:11,190
That's right.

1163
00:44:11,198 --> 00:44:13,930
Let's have a vote then.

1164
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:15,800
- Okay. - One of us will go up on the stand.

1165
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:17,600
- Okay. - Whom do you want on the stand?

1166
00:44:17,605 --> 00:44:20,085
- Let's begin. - I will cast my ballot.

1167
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:29,225
I will announce the result. The one who received the most votes is...

1168
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:32,350
I want to go up on the Judgment Stand.

1169
00:44:32,353 --> 00:44:35,690
- Then people won't suspect me. - It would be faster...

1170
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,650
if I go up on the stand.

1171
00:44:37,658 --> 00:44:39,420
- Kwang Soo, please come forward. - All right.

1172
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,360
- What was the difference? - I can't tell you.

1173
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:43,005
Why did people choose Kwang Soo?

1174
00:44:43,631 --> 00:44:45,290
- It would be better... - That's right.

1175
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:47,000
to catch a thief.

1176
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:49,330
- If Kwang Soo isn't a thief... - Then we know that Jae Seok is.

1177
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:51,515
Then we will know one thief for sure.

1178
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,910
You should have chosen Jae Seok to know the truth, you fool!

1179
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,655
For goodness' sake.

1180
00:44:59,246 --> 00:45:03,125
Kwang Soo received the most votes in the second trial.

1181
00:45:03,851 --> 00:45:05,495
He is...

1182
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:07,950
He's a thief.

1183
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,965
- He is... - He's a thief.

1184
00:45:10,825 --> 00:45:11,820
- He is a thief. - There we go!

1185
00:45:11,826 --> 00:45:12,960
No!

1186
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,120
- He is a thief. - There we go!

1187
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,320
No!

1188
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:17,460
- You thief! - You should have chosen Jae Seok.

1189
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,175
- You thief! - For goodness' sake!

1190
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:24,415
- You thief! - For goodness' sake!

1191
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:26,300
Things became more confusing.

1192
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,215
We should have put Jae Seok on the Judgment Stand.

1193
00:45:29,844 --> 00:45:32,980
Tomorrow, there will be a party to wish for the health...

1194
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,050
of CEO Big Nose, the richest man in this country.

1195
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,565
You are the thieves who are after his gold bars.

1196
00:45:44,058 --> 00:45:45,350
I pick the judge.

1197
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,820
- I'll go with the judge. - You're a judge?

1198
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,730
- Since I'm the detective, - Hold on.

1199
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,130
I'm the judge, why aren't you telling me?

1200
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:52,960
- It's my gold. - I have three ballots.

1201
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:55,000
And the judge. These two.

1202
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,815
- No. - The judge.

1203
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,050
Things became more confusing.

1204
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:19,035
We should have put Jae Seok on the Judgment Stand.

1205
00:46:19,794 --> 00:46:21,335
You...

1206
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,775
I can't believe I went up the stand as the control.

1207
00:46:24,165 --> 00:46:27,945
I can't believe I went up the stand because I was too trustworthy.

1208
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:31,330
- Tell us who the other thief is. - I was right!

1209
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:32,500
- Let's put an end to this. - Jae Seok wasn't...

1210
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:34,885
I can't believe I went up the stand because I was too trustworthy.

1211
00:46:35,075 --> 00:46:37,455
The two of them are the thieves.

1212
00:46:37,511 --> 00:46:39,040
- The two of them are the thieves. - I was right!

1213
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,710
Isn't it too early to say that?

1214
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,740
You could be wrong.

1215
00:46:41,749 --> 00:46:44,395
It's a possibility for now.

1216
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:46,220
This is incredible.

1217
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,195
Let me tell you this once more.

1218
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:50,535
One of them...

1219
00:46:51,692 --> 00:46:53,690
is a thief.

1220
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:55,890
We have it harder now.

1221
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,660
- To be honest... - He is so smart.

1222
00:46:57,665 --> 00:46:59,960
I see why the production crew was nervous.

1223
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:01,500
- Seriously. - We have it harder now.

1224
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:02,970
I see why they were so quiet.

1225
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,170
There is another possibility...

1226
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:05,870
of both of them being the thieves.

1227
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:07,800
- I get it now. - We should have chosen Jae Seok.

1228
00:47:07,808 --> 00:47:09,210
I am telling you...

1229
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:10,670
- that we should see... - That's right.

1230
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:11,970
who is swaying the public.

1231
00:47:11,979 --> 00:47:13,910
- A thief is behind it. - I'm truly glad...

1232
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,510
- that Kwang Soo got caught. - I think...

1233
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:16,650
I think...

1234
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,150
I can steal the gold bars once more, right?

1235
00:47:19,153 --> 00:47:20,620
Kwang Soo will steal in the open now.

1236
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:22,265
What?

1237
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,320
You need to wait.

1238
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:27,060
Hold on. Someone stop him. He lost control now.

1239
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:29,630
You succeeded to arrest a thief.

1240
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,360
The arrest of the remaining thief is up to the viewers...

1241
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:35,400
who will send in their votes after watching the show.

1242
00:47:35,402 --> 00:47:37,730
- I hope they watch carefully. - I bet they will be confused.

1243
00:47:37,738 --> 00:47:39,770
- It's time for the last search. - All right.

1244
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,300
The winner of the second mission, Jong Kook,

1245
00:47:41,308 --> 00:47:42,500
will decide the order once more.

1246
00:47:42,509 --> 00:47:43,710
- Will we go in there again? - Yes.

1247
00:47:43,711 --> 00:47:45,070
It will be the last search.

1248
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:49,850
In that case, Kwang Soo should go...

1249
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:51,350
before Jae Seok.

1250
00:47:51,352 --> 00:47:52,480
Kwang Soo?

1251
00:47:52,486 --> 00:47:54,050
- Yes. - Before Jae Seok?

1252
00:47:54,054 --> 00:47:56,520
- Let's have him go before Jae Seok. - That's just wrong.

1253
00:47:56,523 --> 00:47:59,460
Then another suspect should go after Jae Seok.

1254
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,620
- A suspect should go before him. - Then Haha...

1255
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,190
A suspect should go before me.

1256
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:04,190
What's the point...

1257
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:06,000
- of having me go after Kwang Soo? - There is no point.

1258
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,360
Jae Seok should go first.

1259
00:48:07,368 --> 00:48:10,170
If both Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are thieves...

1260
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,970
- There is that possibility. - There is that possibility.

1261
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,640
Such a possibility is incredibly low.

1262
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,810
Jae Seok, Haha...

1263
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,510
Let's do this.

1264
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:21,425
I can't make a single comment!

1265
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:23,410
- Say something. - Seriously.

1266
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:24,710
- I can't make a single comment. - Say something.

1267
00:48:24,718 --> 00:48:26,780
They keep going back and forth.

1268
00:48:26,787 --> 00:48:28,780
- Stay seated! - This is driving me crazy.

1269
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:29,820
Let me say this.

1270
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,250
- Does anyone have an opinion? - Haha...

1271
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:32,760
I have an opinion!

1272
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,290
We have an opinion!

1273
00:48:34,295 --> 00:48:36,990
- The three of us have an opinion! - I want to talk too.

1274
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,190
I am the one who gets to decide on the order,

1275
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,500
- so tell me what you think. - Okay.

1276
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,800
- For goodness' sake. - Haha is the one...

1277
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:45,030
- who set up this situation. - That's right.

1278
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:47,970
Since he provided a crucial hint, I think...

1279
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:50,870
- he should be included. - This is hard.

1280
00:48:50,878 --> 00:48:52,880
- Kwang Soo, go first. - Okay.

1281
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,440
Then Jae Seok will go next. The rest doesn't matter.

1282
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:58,780
If Kwang Soo is determined, he will steal all the gold bars.

1283
00:48:58,786 --> 00:49:00,280
- I will give it a try. - Let's see...

1284
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:02,150
- what happens. - That's right.

1285
00:49:02,156 --> 00:49:03,490
Let's study the situation.

1286
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:04,650
- Then... - Kwang Soo,

1287
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:06,490
you were a judge before you became a thief.

1288
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:07,860
- That's a judge's clothing. - Me?

1289
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,375
I'm just a thief in a judge's clothing.

1290
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:37,535
Why won't they go in?

1291
00:49:38,158 --> 00:49:39,735
Hold on!

1292
00:49:41,462 --> 00:49:43,390
- I'm sorry, but... - Yes?

1293
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,590
- Did you create a mess? - Did you break something?

1294
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:47,000
The other thief should do the work.

1295
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:49,615
- You didn't get to move a lot. - The gold bars...

1296
00:49:49,803 --> 00:49:52,245
are all over the floor.

1297
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:55,770
What is this?

1298
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:58,270
- If the room is clean... - Hold on!

1299
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:01,880
Everyone should count the gold bars on the floor.

1300
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:04,180
What do you think? If the number...

1301
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:06,780
remains the same until the end,

1302
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:08,680
- it means Jae Seok is a thief. - Jae Seok.

1303
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:10,250
Right?

1304
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,850
Let's see what happens.

1305
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:14,805
How am I doing? Do you still suspect me?

1306
00:50:16,397 --> 00:50:18,575
Why did you come back so soon?

1307
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:20,900
As Kwang Soo said,

1308
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:23,030
the gold bars were scattered...

1309
00:50:23,037 --> 00:50:25,900
- all over the floor. - What did you do with them?

1310
00:50:25,906 --> 00:50:27,670
- I thought about it. - What?

1311
00:50:27,674 --> 00:50:32,440
- If I put them back in the safe... - You shouldn't do that.

1312
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,440
- Did you put them back? - Yes, I did.

1313
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,610
- What? Where did you put them? - There were many gold bars.

1314
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,210
How did you do that in such a short amount of time?

1315
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:39,750
- I could only move a few. - Where did you put them?

1316
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:40,880
You put them back?

1317
00:50:40,888 --> 00:50:43,190
- One safe... - That's what a thief would do.

1318
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,220
You shouldn't have.

1319
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:45,990
- You shouldn't have touched them. - One safe... Why not?

1320
00:50:45,993 --> 00:50:48,420
- We were going to count them. - We were going to count them.

1321
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:50,060
Had the numbers changed, we would have been able...

1322
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:51,590
- to single out a thief. - No, no.

1323
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:53,300
I will tell you why I put them back.

1324
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,330
- One thief remains, right? - How did you do it so fast?

1325
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:56,930
Transferring the gold bars on the floor...

1326
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:58,300
- to the safe... - That's right. You did a good job.

1327
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,740
wouldn't have been too easy for the remaining thief.

1328
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,540
That's right. I will be back.

1329
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,710
Please check the state of the room.

1330
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:04,740
Okay.

1331
00:51:04,745 --> 00:51:07,680
I did wonder if I should leave them as they are...

1332
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:09,510
- or put them back. - Seriously.

1333
00:51:09,516 --> 00:51:11,310
- Jae Seok. - What?

1334
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,280
What's the point of putting the gold bars back in the safe?

1335
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:14,320
Why?

1336
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,390
You kept the safe open.

1337
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,550
I didn't have time to close it.

1338
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,590
- You should have closed it. - He said he closed it earlier.

1339
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:21,860
There were gold bars all over the place.

1340
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:23,630
You made it too easy for the thief.

1341
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:26,530
So what did you do?

1342
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:28,200
- What? - Did you close the safe?

1343
00:51:28,202 --> 00:51:32,815
How can I close it? I don't know the passcode.

1344
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,240
I'm the only one who doesn't know it.

1345
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:39,710
Can't you close it without knowing the passcode?

1346
00:51:39,713 --> 00:51:40,880
- You can't do that. - Jong Kook.

1347
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:42,640
- It's open. - It's...

1348
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:44,280
the perfect test.

1349
00:51:44,284 --> 00:51:45,310
I agree.

1350
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:46,420
- What do you mean? - It's bait.

1351
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,580
Then we can count the gold bars.

1352
00:51:47,588 --> 00:51:48,950
- We can count the gold bars. - That's right.

1353
00:51:48,956 --> 00:51:50,020
Counting them...

1354
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,120
- will take up the time. - It will be hard to steal them.

1355
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:53,960
- No one will be able to touch them. - That's right.

1356
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:55,860
The safe on the right is untouched.

1357
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:56,930
It's untouched.

1358
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,590
- It's locked. - A thief couldn't get to it.

1359
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:00,660
He only touched the other two safes.

1360
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:02,660
The next person should count...

1361
00:52:02,669 --> 00:52:04,730
- That's right. - how many gold bars are in there.

1362
00:52:04,738 --> 00:52:05,830
We need to know the number.

1363
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,240
- The next person should count. - Let me go.

1364
00:52:07,241 --> 00:52:08,870
- The next person should count. - Let me go next, Jong Kook.

1365
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:09,940
- Go ahead. - Okay.

1366
00:52:09,943 --> 00:52:11,210
Let's go in this order.

1367
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,440
Hold on.

1368
00:52:12,446 --> 00:52:13,880
- Count the gold bars. - Someone else should go.

1369
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,410
- Why? - It's strange that you volunteered.

1370
00:52:15,415 --> 00:52:17,280
- You should go first, Se Chan. - For goodness' sake.

1371
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:19,620
We can't make her the first person to check the number.

1372
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,320
- Right? - I can count!

1373
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:22,990
- She could move the gold bars... - Count well.

1374
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,490
- I will count well. - to the thief's safe.

1375
00:52:24,491 --> 00:52:25,590
You said I am not...

1376
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:27,120
- a suspect. - Don't complain. Se Chan, go.

1377
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:29,220
I can't do anything today!

1378
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,690
I am not a thief!

1379
00:52:30,697 --> 00:52:32,975
- That's right. - The analyst...

1380
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,615
Okay, okay.

1381
00:52:38,505 --> 00:52:41,140
Let's write down the number.

1382
00:52:41,141 --> 00:52:43,140
- Yes. Everyone should do it. - Write down the number.

1383
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:44,770
Don't show it to anyone.

1384
00:52:44,778 --> 00:52:46,610
- Add the numbers. - Should I add them?

1385
00:52:46,613 --> 00:52:47,780
- One. - They aren't ready.

1386
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:48,840
- Did you write it down? - Yes.

1387
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:50,695
In 1, 2, 3.

1388
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:53,065
In 1, 2, 3.

1389
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:56,195
Their numbers match.

1390
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,835
- 11 plus 12. - 23.

1391
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,830
- The numbers match. - The numbers match.

1392
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,730
- Listen. - The thief didn't steal them.

1393
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,300
I told you earlier.

1394
00:53:11,305 --> 00:53:13,440
- Those safes weren't touched. - In that case...

1395
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,410
The information Haha hears will tell us what happened.

1396
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,340
Then it's a matter of whether I lie or not.

1397
00:53:19,346 --> 00:53:21,640
- That's right. - If Haha had been a thief,

1398
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:24,110
he would have counted the gold bars and stolen them anyway.

1399
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:27,365
The insurance salesman, Haha.

1400
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:30,050
It has been added to the number you saw earlier.

1401
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:32,435
- Okay. - This is the total number.

1402
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:36,435
- CEO Big Nose, do something. - Hey.

1403
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:38,790
You should reveal the information now.

1404
00:54:06,026 --> 00:54:07,728
How many were stolen?

1405
00:54:07,761 --> 00:54:08,895
Did more gold bars get stolen than earlier?

1406
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,231
- I guess I can reveal it now. - Yes.

1407
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:12,933
- Did more gold bars get stolen? - So far,

1408
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:14,635
the thieves stole a total of...

1409
00:54:14,635 --> 00:54:17,004
- 44 gold bars. - I knew it. I was right.

1410
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,572
I said the number will be somewhere around 40.

1411
00:54:18,572 --> 00:54:20,607
44 gold bars.

1412
00:54:20,607 --> 00:54:23,076
This is confusing.

1413
00:54:23,644 --> 00:54:25,379
Haha...

1414
00:54:30,617 --> 00:54:33,487
The last mission will help CEO Big Nose stretch his wrists.

1415
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:35,122
It's called Spin and Spin.

1416
00:54:35,122 --> 00:54:37,357
Turn the glass upside down and spin a ping-pong ball inside.

1417
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,926
Transfer as many balls as you can to the cups on the other table.

1418
00:54:39,926 --> 00:54:40,994
Shall we have Kwang Soo go first?

1419
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:42,262
- He doesn't need to go. - He doesn't need to go.

1420
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:44,598
- You don't need to go, right? - But there is my video.

1421
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:46,433
- Oh, right. We have that. - We don't care about your video.

1422
00:54:46,433 --> 00:54:47,567
We don't want to watch it.

1423
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:50,370
If I take the last place,

1424
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,538
- the other thief's video... - Right.

1425
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,206
- won't be revealed. - I get it now.

1426
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,609
I get it now.

1427
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:57,177
Start.

1428
00:54:57,411 --> 00:54:59,079
Does he have one minute?

1429
00:54:59,479 --> 00:55:00,681
Gosh, he is something else.

1430
00:55:00,681 --> 00:55:01,882
- Will he take the last place? - Yes.

1431
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,518
- He will do that on purpose. - Does he have one minute?

1432
00:55:04,518 --> 00:55:05,919
Gosh, he is something else.

1433
00:55:05,919 --> 00:55:07,821
- He wants to save the other thief. - Seriously.

1434
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:09,623
- He is the worst. - He is stooping so low.

1435
00:55:09,623 --> 00:55:10,991
- Seriously. - He is the worst.

1436
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:13,293
He should look back upon himself for the 10th anniversary.

1437
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:14,628
Just stop if you are going to be that way.

1438
00:55:14,628 --> 00:55:16,897
It has been 10 years.

1439
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,232
How could you be so bad at it?

1440
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,734
- How could you be so bad at it? - He will take the last place.

1441
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,636
Kwang Soo, you moved zero balls.

1442
00:55:22,636 --> 00:55:24,004
- Zero balls. - Okay.

1443
00:55:24,004 --> 00:55:26,206
This man has been on the three major TV stations...

1444
00:55:26,206 --> 00:55:27,274
for 10 years.

1445
00:55:27,274 --> 00:55:28,575
It won't be easy.

1446
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,676
- Yu. - Jae.

1447
00:55:29,676 --> 00:55:31,978
- Seok. - Let's go.

1448
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,582
I will show you what it takes to be on the three major TV stations...

1449
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,918
- for 10 years. - Show us!

1450
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,687
Get ready.

1451
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,956
You just need to do it lightly.

1452
00:55:43,557 --> 00:55:45,292
He is really good.

1453
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:48,829
This isn't hard.

1454
00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:51,198
My goodness.

1455
00:55:51,665 --> 00:55:52,999
My goodness.

1456
00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:54,935
Your heart is pounding now, right?

1457
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,870
- I bet your heart is pounding. - That came out of nowhere.

1458
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,238
Your heart is pounding now, right?

1459
00:55:58,238 --> 00:56:00,941
I bet he became surprised when he did a good job at first.

1460
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,275
"Am I good at this?"

1461
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,744
This is...

1462
00:56:03,744 --> 00:56:05,212
- He must feel nervous now. - Why am I so bad at it?

1463
00:56:05,212 --> 00:56:06,780
- Four, - No one is chasing after him.

1464
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,215
three,

1465
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:10,350
- 2, 1. - He got another one.

1466
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,018
For goodness' sake.

1467
00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:14,721
- Eight points. - What were we supposed to see?

1468
00:56:14,721 --> 00:56:16,123
- This is hard. - It's seven points.

1469
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:19,092
Get ready. Set...

1470
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:22,496
- What? - He is bad at it too.

1471
00:56:22,496 --> 00:56:24,231
- You should spin it as you move it. - He is bad at it.

1472
00:56:24,231 --> 00:56:25,632
- He is bad at it. - There is something he is bad at.

1473
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,033
- We will see his video. - This is funny.

1474
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:29,736
He won't be able to move one ball.

1475
00:56:30,404 --> 00:56:32,239
- What is going on? - He is bad at it.

1476
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:33,840
- Look at his right hand. - Look at that.

1477
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,942
Look at the way his right hand shakes.

1478
00:56:35,942 --> 00:56:37,778
Gosh, he is terrible at it.

1479
00:56:37,778 --> 00:56:39,413
- My goodness. - That's right.

1480
00:56:39,413 --> 00:56:41,014
There is something Jong Kook is bad at.

1481
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:42,716
- He is bad at it. - Why can't you do it?

1482
00:56:42,716 --> 00:56:45,018
His strong arms are wasted on him.

1483
00:56:45,018 --> 00:56:46,620
- Why can't you do it? - I can't do it.

1484
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,922
He should do better with his strong arms.

1485
00:56:48,922 --> 00:56:50,624
2, 1.

1486
00:56:50,624 --> 00:56:52,192
Jong Kook failed.

1487
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:53,393
My goodness.

1488
00:56:53,393 --> 00:56:54,494
I can't do it.

1489
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,196
That's not how you do it.

1490
00:56:56,196 --> 00:56:58,932
20 seconds of Kwang Soo's video and 30 seconds of Jong Kook's video.

1491
00:57:00,066 --> 00:57:01,768
Let's watch 20 seconds of Kwang Soo's video.

1492
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:03,336
- It will be something. - It will be funny.

1493
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,672
We should have watched 30 seconds of his video.

1494
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:12,179
- It's war. - Look at him.

1495
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,348
Look at him.

1496
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,117
- He is good. - That part must have been hard.

1497
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:19,319
- How did he go about it? - That must have taken up time.

1498
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:20,887
He opened two safes.

1499
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:23,356
- He opened two safes. - One safe was left untouched.

1500
00:57:23,623 --> 00:57:25,025
He didn't open the third safe.

1501
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,927
That safe was completely full.

1502
00:57:27,294 --> 00:57:30,297
- He should have piled them up. - I get it!

1503
00:57:30,297 --> 00:57:32,299
The gold bars were left like that.

1504
00:57:32,299 --> 00:57:34,100
- What is it? - What about that safe?

1505
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,937
- He opened it too. - Really?

1506
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,310
I get it now.

1507
00:57:45,445 --> 00:57:49,516
Now comes Jong Kook's video which is 30 seconds.

1508
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,817
It was clean.

1509
00:57:50,817 --> 00:57:53,220
- The black one. - That's right.

1510
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,455
I'm sure it was also like that.

1511
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,791
- Who is that? Jong Kook? - Jong Kook.

1512
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:08,468
I counted slowly.

1513
00:58:10,504 --> 00:58:11,938
He didn't do anything.

1514
00:58:11,938 --> 00:58:13,540
I told you so. I simply counted the gold bars.

1515
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,509
It's easy to count them.

1516
00:58:15,509 --> 00:58:17,744
Did he open the third safe now?

1517
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,845
He had 20 seconds left.

1518
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:20,514
- All right. - Oh, he didn't.

1519
00:58:20,514 --> 00:58:22,782
I counted the gold bars twice.

1520
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:24,551
Maybe he got to work afterward.

1521
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:26,119
- After that... - I was the last to go in.

1522
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,654
- You never know. - After that...

1523
00:58:27,654 --> 00:58:28,755
Are you saying he stole them in 20 seconds?

1524
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,357
The person who came in after me counted too.

1525
00:58:30,357 --> 00:58:31,758
Maybe he looked at the camera...

1526
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,560
and grinned.

1527
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:35,495
- Gosh. - Maybe he did that.

1528
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:37,631
- Maybe he did that. - I am so glad...

1529
00:58:37,631 --> 00:58:38,632
we got to watch...

1530
00:58:38,632 --> 00:58:39,833
- Kwang Soo's video. - Why?

1531
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:42,102
- Don't you get it? - No, I don't.

1532
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:45,539
Kwang Soo dropped much more gold bars on the floor...

1533
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:48,241
than the ones we saw in the two safes.

1534
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:49,843
- So... - So...

1535
00:58:49,843 --> 00:58:51,845
it makes no sense the safes only had 11 and 12 gold bars respectively.

1536
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:53,580
- There were so many on the floor. - That's right.

1537
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,615
That means...

1538
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,351
someone put some gold bars in the thief's safe.

1539
00:58:58,351 --> 00:59:00,887
And Jae Seok went in after Kwang Soo.

1540
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:02,889
- The gold bars. - He is unbelievable.

1541
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:05,659
- Right? - He is unbelievable.

1542
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:08,895
- I can see the videos, right? - We already did.

1543
00:59:08,895 --> 00:59:11,231
- I can because I'm a detective. - Yes, you can.

1544
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,266
- Can I do that? - Of course.

1545
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:17,037
- "Can I do that?" - I want to see...

1546
00:59:17,037 --> 00:59:19,873
- either Jae Seok's or Haha's. - Right.

1547
00:59:19,873 --> 00:59:21,441
- You don't have to see mine. - Why not?

1548
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:22,542
You...

1549
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:24,945
Think about what's more important.

1550
00:59:24,945 --> 00:59:26,980
You... Let me tell you this.

1551
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,114
Listen to me.

1552
00:59:28,114 --> 00:59:31,451
All you have to do is count the gold bars on the floor.

1553
00:59:31,451 --> 00:59:32,786
Just count them quickly.

1554
00:59:32,786 --> 00:59:34,321
- Do you think that's easy? - I mean...

1555
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,555
- How can I... - What I mean is...

1556
00:59:35,555 --> 00:59:36,957
Can you count the balls on the floor now?

1557
00:59:36,957 --> 00:59:38,158
- Hey. - It's impossible.

1558
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,760
Jong Kook is the judge, the detective...

1559
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,563
How many jobs does he have?

1560
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:46,266
Can you count the balls on the floor now?

1561
00:59:46,266 --> 00:59:47,400
- What is he talking about? - How many jobs does he have?

1562
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,401
- Hey. - Seriously...

1563
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:50,103
- Somebody stop him. - What I mean is...

1564
00:59:50,103 --> 00:59:51,438
- What I mean is... - How can I count them?

1565
00:59:51,438 --> 00:59:52,439
What I mean is...

1566
00:59:52,439 --> 00:59:53,740
He has eight jobs!

1567
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,642
He is the detective, the judge... How many jobs does he have?

1568
00:59:55,642 --> 00:59:58,612
- He is CEO Big Nose as well! - What is he doing?

1569
00:59:58,612 --> 01:00:00,347
- Right? - Those two are losing their cool.

1570
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,248
- That's the proof. - They left their seats.

1571
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:03,550
No!

1572
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,685
Se Chan, he has a point.

1573
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,120
Count the gold bars.

1574
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:11,558
Gosh, I feel betrayed by Jae Seok.

1575
01:00:11,891 --> 01:00:14,194
He could be a thief. I'm getting confused.

1576
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:17,564
This is why I told you to put me on Judgment Stand.

1577
01:00:17,564 --> 01:00:19,065
- What do you mean? - But that's already...

1578
01:00:19,065 --> 01:00:20,533
- This is why... - That's already over, you punk.

1579
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,502
- I mean... - What's with you?

1580
01:00:22,502 --> 01:00:23,837
- I'm getting upset. - We're just trying to guess.

1581
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:24,938
I'm getting angry.

1582
01:00:24,938 --> 01:00:27,207
Aren't you the one who talked about your friendship of 30 years?

1583
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,975
I'm just angry!

1584
01:00:28,975 --> 01:00:31,845
I'm getting suspicious of you at the last minute!

1585
01:00:31,845 --> 01:00:33,546
- Hold on. - Hurry up and do it.

1586
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,248
Go! I'm so angry.

1587
01:00:35,248 --> 01:00:37,651
We've been friends for 30 years!

1588
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:40,954
- Se Chan. - I get it.

1589
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:42,756
- Hurry up and check the video. - Check my video.

1590
01:00:42,756 --> 01:00:44,691
- I'm so angry. - Check my video...

1591
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:47,060
and prove my innocence...

1592
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,629
so that the viewers can suspect...

1593
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:51,231
someone else.

1594
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,699
So go check my video right now.

1595
01:00:52,699 --> 01:00:54,334
- Your video? - Check my video.

1596
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:57,003
Can the viewers see what Detective Yang sees?

1597
01:00:57,003 --> 01:00:59,339
No. They have to rely on what the detective says only.

1598
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:00,340
I see.

1599
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:02,676
- He could be a thief too. - That's right.

1600
01:01:02,676 --> 01:01:04,711
- Count the gold bars on the floor. - Okay.

1601
01:01:04,711 --> 01:01:05,912
- Just count them quickly. - Check Jae Seok's video.

1602
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,047
I'll count them quickly.

1603
01:01:07,047 --> 01:01:08,915
By the way,

1604
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,552
I wonder why Jong Kook is trying to frame me.

1605
01:01:12,552 --> 01:01:14,688
I'm just being objective.

1606
01:01:14,688 --> 01:01:16,856
- I don't think so. - Jae Seok.

1607
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,062
- There are many, right? - No?

1608
01:01:22,062 --> 01:01:23,263
This is strange.

1609
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,899
Jae Seok, I only saw 20 seconds of it.

1610
01:01:25,899 --> 01:01:28,435
Did you say you put all of them back in?

1611
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,437
There were about 15 on the floor.

1612
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,072
What?

1613
01:01:32,172 --> 01:01:33,807
That's because...

1614
01:01:33,807 --> 01:01:36,042
the video got cut off. I put all of them back in later.

1615
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:37,210
There were about 15 on the floor.

1616
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:39,546
- Only 15? - On the floor.

1617
01:01:39,546 --> 01:01:41,915
What about when he first came in?

1618
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:43,016
About 15.

1619
01:01:43,016 --> 01:01:45,351
- On the floor? - Yes, about 15 were on the floor.

1620
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:47,220
There weren't many. Kwang Soo put most of them back in.

1621
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:50,156
- I told you. - I saw 20 seconds of it.

1622
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:51,424
I'm telling you the truth.

1623
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:53,893
- He's not a thief. - That means you're not a thief.

1624
01:01:53,893 --> 01:01:55,095
- Why? - Because you're telling the truth.

1625
01:01:55,095 --> 01:01:56,329
Yes, there were 15.

1626
01:01:56,329 --> 01:01:58,631
It's either Jae Seok or Jong Kook.

1627
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,133
I've been suspecting Jong Kook, but...

1628
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,068
There's something that bothers me.

1629
01:02:02,068 --> 01:02:04,637
Let's say I'm innocent and Jong Kook is...

1630
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,207
- trying to frame me. - I mean...

1631
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:10,677
That means he's trying to sway us.

1632
01:02:10,677 --> 01:02:13,346
So who is the thief?

1633
01:02:14,681 --> 01:02:16,716
Welcome to my house.

1634
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:20,987
I can decide, right? Then I'll go first.

1635
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,923
- What? You? - Does he get to decide everything?

1636
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:27,026
- Fine, go head. - Can he be a thief?

1637
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:29,362
- Yes. - But he's the CEO.

1638
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,998
Detective, go check the video.

1639
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:39,572
- Whose video did you watch? - So Min's video.

1640
01:02:39,572 --> 01:02:41,775
- Why did you watch So Min's video? - So Min's video is meaningless.

1641
01:02:41,775 --> 01:02:44,110
I said she isn't a thief.

1642
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:46,880
- You go in first. - Gosh.

1643
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:52,719
- 1, 2, 3. - I told you.

1644
01:02:57,757 --> 01:03:00,660
Here's the number of gold bars taken by the thieves.

1645
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:04,664
He holds the power to manipulate the public.

1646
01:03:04,664 --> 01:03:08,401
- He can throw us off the track. - That's right.

1647
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:10,470
1, 2, 3.

1648
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,139
- 11, 12. - 11, 12.

1649
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:17,010
If Haha is a thief, he could have taken the gold bars.

1650
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:20,046
Will I lie or not?

1651
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,481
Exactly.

1652
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:24,617
Lawyer Song can choose one person to be removed from the first trial.

1653
01:03:24,617 --> 01:03:27,787
- I choose Kim Jong Kook. - You'd take Jong Kook out?

1654
01:03:27,787 --> 01:03:31,691
Why would you take him out? This is a weird choice.

1655
01:03:31,691 --> 01:03:34,694
She could take herself out, but she didn't.

1656
01:03:34,694 --> 01:03:37,730
- This is too weird. - This is weird.

1657
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:44,237
Am I the first to arrive? Then I'll pick...

1658
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,340
- Pick a gambler. - That's right.

1659
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,642
I didn't have the time to actually count...

1660
01:03:49,642 --> 01:03:51,678
- the number of gold bars. - That's reasonable.

1661
01:03:51,678 --> 01:03:53,479
- And open the safe? - He wouldn't have.

1662
01:03:53,479 --> 01:03:54,614
- It doesn't make sense. - He didn't have enough time.

1663
01:03:54,614 --> 01:03:56,349
- There's not enough time. - Right.

1664
01:03:59,285 --> 01:04:01,521
I opened all of them, and gold bars were missing...

1665
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:03,189
from two of them.

1666
01:04:03,189 --> 01:04:05,058
- Two of them? - They were broken into?

1667
01:04:05,058 --> 01:04:08,328
- The gold bars are still there. - Are they still there?

1668
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:12,498
- How many were on the floor? - About 10.

1669
01:04:12,498 --> 01:04:15,702
- Are they still there? - I put them back in.

1670
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:18,104
- What are you talking about? - You put all of them back in?

1671
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,274
- Are you so neat? Why did you? - You put all of them back in?

1672
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,942
I did.

1673
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:31,251
Hold on. Come here, three of you. Wait.

1674
01:04:31,251 --> 01:04:33,653
Let's count the gold bars on the floor.

1675
01:04:33,653 --> 01:04:35,755
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo...

1676
01:04:35,755 --> 01:04:38,825
- may be thieves. It's possible. - Just in case.

1677
01:04:38,825 --> 01:04:41,861
- It's unlikely. - What are you talking about?

1678
01:04:41,861 --> 01:04:46,366
If Jong Kook is a thief, he must want to frame me,

1679
01:04:46,366 --> 01:04:50,570
- who is being suspected. Right? - That's possible.

1680
01:04:54,374 --> 01:04:56,776
All right. Running Man 10th Anniversary Special Live Broadcast.

1681
01:04:56,776 --> 01:04:59,512
We will catch the last suspect...

1682
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:01,281
with the viewers...

1683
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:03,149
right here.

1684
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,984
The text voting ends...

1685
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,519
in five minutes.

1686
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:10,390
Everyone, let's get started!

1687
01:05:16,796 --> 01:05:18,031
Hello, viewers.

1688
01:05:18,031 --> 01:05:20,566
- Hello. - Hello.

1689
01:05:20,566 --> 01:05:22,702
Running Man 10th Anniversary...

1690
01:05:22,702 --> 01:05:25,605
Special Live Broadcast has started.

1691
01:05:25,605 --> 01:05:27,807
- Nice to see you all. - Nice to see you all.

1692
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,610
Jong Kook, you look so creepy.

1693
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:32,512
- We... - Please explain why.

1694
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,547
There's a reason why...

1695
01:05:34,547 --> 01:05:37,283
Jong Kook and I look like this.

1696
01:05:37,283 --> 01:05:39,118
I'd like to apologize.

1697
01:05:39,118 --> 01:05:40,954
- It's a penalty. - This is our penalty, right?

1698
01:05:40,954 --> 01:05:42,088
- Yes. - That's right.

1699
01:05:42,088 --> 01:05:43,623
Jae Seok is supposed to be...

1700
01:05:43,623 --> 01:05:45,692
- a zombie. - From the Joseon period.

1701
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,627
- From the drama, "Kingdom". - That's right.

1702
01:05:47,627 --> 01:05:49,729
But he just looks like a tired man in the woods.

1703
01:05:49,729 --> 01:05:51,097
- That's right. - The thing is...

1704
01:05:51,097 --> 01:05:53,900
- I was going to wear contacts, - Exactly.

1705
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,335
- but... - It'd look too scary.

1706
01:05:55,335 --> 01:05:57,804
many people watch our show.

1707
01:05:57,804 --> 01:05:59,572
- Many children watch it too. - That's right.

1708
01:05:59,572 --> 01:06:01,975
- So I didn't wear them in the end. - Exactly.

1709
01:06:01,975 --> 01:06:04,243
- That's why I just look tired. - You look like an ascetic.

1710
01:06:04,243 --> 01:06:06,045
But I wanted to look like a zombie.

1711
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,480
- A zombie from "Kingdom". - But...

1712
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,781
- Look at this arrow. - Yes, look at this arrow.

1713
01:06:08,781 --> 01:06:10,149
- He's been shot with an arrow. - It looks so cute.

1714
01:06:10,149 --> 01:06:11,851
You'll know if you've watched "Kingdom".

1715
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:13,720
- You're Huh Joon Ho. - Without the contacts...

1716
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,722
- I'm supposed to be Huh Joon Ho. - You're Huh Joon Ho.

1717
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:18,157
- But I look like a tired ascetic. - You look like an ascetic.

1718
01:06:18,157 --> 01:06:19,592
- Please understand. - He looks cute.

1719
01:06:19,592 --> 01:06:21,828
Jong Kook, you are...

1720
01:06:21,828 --> 01:06:23,830
- I'm Kaonashi. - That's right.

1721
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:26,032
- I'm Kaonashi. - He's the most scary-looking...

1722
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:27,767
- He looks horrifying. - He looks creepy.

1723
01:06:27,767 --> 01:06:29,602
- He looks so creepy. - He looks awful.

1724
01:06:29,602 --> 01:06:31,204
- He looks scary. - Even my outfit is not straight.

1725
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:32,872
It makes my body look crooked.

1726
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:35,141
Anyway, we're dressed like this...

1727
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:37,744
- because this is our penalty. - That's right.

1728
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,780
We'll soon catch the culprit, right?

1729
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,781
- Yes. - Yes.

1730
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:43,916
We've been watching the show here in the studio...

1731
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,853
- and guessing the whole time. - We've been guessing too.

1732
01:06:46,853 --> 01:06:48,888
- But we have no idea. - We don't.

1733
01:06:48,888 --> 01:06:50,990
We have no idea who the culprit is even though this is a live show.

1734
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:54,560
Anyway, the text voting will end soon.

1735
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,095
Some of you may already have voted,

1736
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,330
but I'm sure...

1737
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:59,632
- some are still not sure. - That's right.

1738
01:06:59,632 --> 01:07:02,735
As Kwang Soo has already been caught,

1739
01:07:02,735 --> 01:07:04,837
he will be excluded.

1740
01:07:04,837 --> 01:07:07,206
- Hold on. - He didn't even have to come.

1741
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:09,208
- I don't get to say a single word? - Why did you come?

1742
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:10,943
- I mean... - You got caught.

1743
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:13,312
Kwang Soo has already been caught as a thief,

1744
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:15,281
- and there is one more thief left. - That's right.

1745
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,183
Since we don't have much time...

1746
01:07:17,183 --> 01:07:19,118
- and this is live, - Yes.

1747
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,553
- let's hurry up... - Yes.

1748
01:07:20,553 --> 01:07:22,321
and try to defend ourselves one by one.

1749
01:07:22,321 --> 01:07:23,923
- Okay. - Kwang Soo messed up.

1750
01:07:23,923 --> 01:07:25,792
Haha, please defend yourself.

1751
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:28,728
Hello, everyone. I'm an insurance salesman.

1752
01:07:28,728 --> 01:07:30,897
- Take off your cap. - There is only one thing...

1753
01:07:30,897 --> 01:07:32,331
I want to tell you.

1754
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:34,734
I didn't lie about the number of gold bars.

1755
01:07:34,734 --> 01:07:36,002
And that means...

1756
01:07:36,002 --> 01:07:38,404
- That's right. - I can't be a thief.

1757
01:07:38,404 --> 01:07:40,039
- 10 seconds is up. - Stop.

1758
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:41,874
- Believe me. - Next up is Se Chan.

1759
01:07:41,874 --> 01:07:43,042
Hello, I'm Detective Yang.

1760
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:44,911
I believe the thief is...

1761
01:07:44,911 --> 01:07:48,047
either Jong Kook or Jae Seok.

1762
01:07:48,047 --> 01:07:50,983
That's my honest opinion as a detective. Thank you.

1763
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,618
Next up is Ji Hyo.

1764
01:07:52,618 --> 01:07:53,820
The detective shouldn't pick people out.

1765
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,789
I can't wait to find out who the thief is.

1766
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:58,291
Anyway, I'm not a thief.

1767
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:00,793
- She's suspicious. - I don't know what else to say,

1768
01:08:00,793 --> 01:08:02,628
but I'm really not.

1769
01:08:02,762 --> 01:08:05,731
I suspect So Min and Jae Seok.

1770
01:08:05,731 --> 01:08:06,966
- Really? - All of a sudden?

1771
01:08:06,966 --> 01:08:09,001
- So Min, all of a sudden? - Right?

1772
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,169
- So Min? - Jae Seok and...

1773
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,370
- So Min? - It's possible.

1774
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:12,872
- She didn't say much. - So Min, defend yourself.

1775
01:08:12,872 --> 01:08:15,675
I'm glad that you guys are suspecting me,

1776
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,043
but I'm not a thief.

1777
01:08:17,043 --> 01:08:18,744
I suspect Jae Seok, Haha,

1778
01:08:18,744 --> 01:08:20,413
- and Jong Kook. - That's right.

1779
01:08:20,413 --> 01:08:24,016
- I didn't do anything suspicious. - Why me...

1780
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,084
- That's right. - That's why.

1781
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:26,252
- That's why you're suspicious. - That's why you're suspicious.

1782
01:08:26,252 --> 01:08:28,287
- That's why you're suspicious. - We want to be careful...

1783
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:31,357
because according to the voting results,

1784
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,292
someone will be penalized.

1785
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:35,128
- That's right. It's incredible. - That's why...

1786
01:08:35,128 --> 01:08:36,295
we want to be careful with what we say.

1787
01:08:36,295 --> 01:08:38,097
Next up is CEO Big Nose.

1788
01:08:38,097 --> 01:08:40,333
- I can't be a thief. - Okay.

1789
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:42,835
- I... What are you doing? - Go on.

1790
01:08:42,835 --> 01:08:44,971
Why would I steal my own gold bars?

1791
01:08:44,971 --> 01:08:46,806
Does that mean I made up the whole thing?

1792
01:08:46,806 --> 01:08:48,674
Isn't that too predictable?

1793
01:08:48,674 --> 01:08:50,610
I... Stop staring at me.

1794
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:52,612
I'm definitely not a thief.

1795
01:08:52,612 --> 01:08:53,913
- You're not? - No.

1796
01:08:53,913 --> 01:08:56,516
Seeing how you're dressed, it feels like we're shooting at your house.

1797
01:08:56,516 --> 01:08:58,651
- This is my house. - He's at home.

1798
01:08:58,651 --> 01:09:01,154
This is not Seok Jin's house.

1799
01:09:01,154 --> 01:09:02,755
- This is our studio. - All right.

1800
01:09:02,755 --> 01:09:04,457
- I'll defend myself quickly. - Sure.

1801
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:06,826
I was watching what was going on in today's episode,

1802
01:09:06,826 --> 01:09:08,494
and many people are suspecting me.

1803
01:09:08,494 --> 01:09:10,263
I am definitely not a thief.

1804
01:09:10,263 --> 01:09:13,166
There is one person that I am very suspicious of,

1805
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:15,635
but I'm scared that I am choosing the wrong person.

1806
01:09:15,635 --> 01:09:16,736
- Who is it? - Tell us...

1807
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:17,737
- Right? - who you think it is.

1808
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,805
- I think that it's Jong Kook. - I think that it's him too.

1809
01:09:19,805 --> 01:09:22,542
- Right. - On the day of the shoot,

1810
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:24,777
I could've gone up the Judgment Stand, but he stopped me.

1811
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:26,746
That's what made me think it was him too.

1812
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,447
There was a reason behind that.

1813
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,349
If you watch the whole thing, then you will know.

1814
01:09:30,349 --> 01:09:32,084
From my perspective,

1815
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,187
I did that because I believed the thief was Jae Seok.

1816
01:09:34,187 --> 01:09:35,621
Our perspectives were different.

1817
01:09:35,621 --> 01:09:39,358
I was adamant that it was Jae Seok,

1818
01:09:39,358 --> 01:09:40,660
- He looks scary. - but I'm not sure, to be honest.

1819
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:43,162
- I'm going to focus on... - Okay.

1820
01:09:43,162 --> 01:09:44,430
who you guys vote for.

1821
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,731
- You guys look so funny together. - Right now.

1822
01:09:45,731 --> 01:09:47,200
- It's scary. - It looks like a comedy show...

1823
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,068
with the two of us in the frame.

1824
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,703
It looks like we're doing skits on Running Man now.

1825
01:09:50,703 --> 01:09:52,371
Don't show off your arms.

1826
01:09:52,371 --> 01:09:54,407
Kaonashi is supposed to have its arms covered,

1827
01:09:54,407 --> 01:09:55,541
but I didn't cover them because this was funnier.

1828
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:57,643
Okay. This is important, everyone.

1829
01:09:57,643 --> 01:10:00,580
- The texting votes will end soon. - It will end soon.

1830
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:02,648
- Let's start the countdown. - We're very curious too.

1831
01:10:02,648 --> 01:10:05,551
We're doing a special live broadcast to celebrate our 10th anniversary.

1832
01:10:05,551 --> 01:10:08,421
We've done live broadcasts in the past,

1833
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:10,323
- but this is the longest one. - Right.

1834
01:10:10,323 --> 01:10:11,457
- It's our first time. - Right.

1835
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,659
- We are very curious too. - We can't wait to find out.

1836
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:15,561
Your mustache is falling off.

1837
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:16,596
Is that on purpose?

1838
01:10:16,596 --> 01:10:18,397
- No. - I think that...

1839
01:10:18,397 --> 01:10:19,832
you should watch TV together.

1840
01:10:19,832 --> 01:10:20,967
- It's fun. - It's so much fun.

1841
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,134
- It was a lot of fun. - It was a lot of fun.

1842
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:23,236
I've said this before,

1843
01:10:23,236 --> 01:10:25,104
but I always felt weird when I was watching Running Man.

1844
01:10:25,104 --> 01:10:26,572
- It's because we know the ending. - Exactly.

1845
01:10:26,572 --> 01:10:28,841
But since we don't know how it will end today, it's so much fun.

1846
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,410
The Chief Director joined us today.

1847
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,346
- Yes. - She seems very pleased.

1848
01:10:33,346 --> 01:10:35,514
- She's happy. - It's a party here.

1849
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:37,516
Many people may have heard of her.

1850
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:39,285
- Chief Director Choi Young In. - Chief Director Choi Young In.

1851
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:40,319
Thank you for joining us on a Sunday.

1852
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:41,487
We're working really hard.

1853
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:46,492
We will end the voting period now.

1854
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,361
- Let's count down. - Shall we count down together?

1855
01:10:48,361 --> 01:10:49,629
- 5. - 5.

1856
01:10:49,629 --> 01:10:50,663
- 4. - 4.

1857
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,664
- 3. - 3.

1858
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,732
- 2. - 2.

1859
01:10:52,732 --> 01:10:54,033
- 1. - 1.

1860
01:10:54,033 --> 01:10:56,402
- The end. - It is now closed.

1861
01:10:56,902 --> 01:10:59,005
- I want to know quickly. - I would like to thank...

1862
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,807
all the viewers who have tuned in to our show today,

1863
01:11:01,807 --> 01:11:03,409
and I would also like to thank everyone...

1864
01:11:03,409 --> 01:11:06,312
who sent in a text with their vote once again.

1865
01:11:06,312 --> 01:11:10,016
The results of the votes will be revealed shortly.

1866
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:11,617
- That's right. - We are so curious as well.

1867
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:13,019
We're all so curious.

1868
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,420
- This is real. - They won't tell us who it is.

1869
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,454
This is important.

1870
01:11:15,454 --> 01:11:19,592
To the viewer who guessed the last thief correctly,

1871
01:11:19,592 --> 01:11:22,428
we will send them a luxurious massage chair.

1872
01:11:22,895 --> 01:11:24,697
- It is refreshing. - Will one person receive this?

1873
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:25,931
Yes, one person will receive it.

1874
01:11:25,931 --> 01:11:28,901
We will also give 10 people autographed Running Man name tags...

1875
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:32,338
and a group photograph as a gift.

1876
01:11:32,338 --> 01:11:33,372
Haha has been on a lot of...

1877
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,573
- home shopping shows. - It's like a home shopping show.

1878
01:11:34,573 --> 01:11:36,008
- He's good at it. - He's different.

1879
01:11:36,008 --> 01:11:37,476
He's been on a lot of home shopping shows.

1880
01:11:37,476 --> 01:11:40,012
I don't know if we'll get a chance to do this again in the future,

1881
01:11:40,012 --> 01:11:42,281
but if we do, we'll prepare a lot more gifts then.

1882
01:11:42,281 --> 01:11:43,783
- Yes. We'll prepare them. - Yes.

1883
01:11:43,783 --> 01:11:46,185
We'll prepare a lot more gifts and give them to more viewers.

1884
01:11:46,185 --> 01:11:48,487
- We're going to find out... - Right.

1885
01:11:48,487 --> 01:11:51,357
if Kim Jong Kook the analyst and Jeon So Min the gambler will bet.

1886
01:11:51,357 --> 01:11:52,825
- They should bet. - This is important.

1887
01:11:52,825 --> 01:11:53,893
What will you do, Jong Kook?

1888
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,028
I will be strategical, and since it's our 10th anniversary...

1889
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:59,131
I'm sure a lot of people have voted for Yu Jae Seok.

1890
01:11:59,131 --> 01:12:01,367
Of course, I have my suspicions about him.

1891
01:12:01,367 --> 01:12:03,769
But according to the flow of everything,

1892
01:12:03,769 --> 01:12:06,639
I think a lot of people voted for Jae Seok.

1893
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:08,274
We don't have a lot of time left, so please...

1894
01:12:08,274 --> 01:12:09,342
- Neatly. - shorten what you're saying.

1895
01:12:09,342 --> 01:12:11,344
I will choose Yu Jae Seok.

1896
01:12:11,344 --> 01:12:12,545
- So the analyst will choose me? - Yes.

1897
01:12:12,545 --> 01:12:15,247
- If I am the thief, - Yes.

1898
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:16,582
you get a penalty transfer card.

1899
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:17,883
It doesn't matter if you are the thief or not.

1900
01:12:17,883 --> 01:12:19,919
I get it if you have received the most viewer votes.

1901
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,887
- It doesn't need to be right. - I can be wrong.

1902
01:12:21,887 --> 01:12:23,255
- The person with the most votes. - That's right.

1903
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:24,256
Who the thief is doesn't matter to me.

1904
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:25,825
- So you chose me. Okay. - Yes.

1905
01:12:25,825 --> 01:12:27,426
What will you do, So Min?

1906
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,661
I think that we will catch the thief...

1907
01:12:28,661 --> 01:12:30,029
- no matter what. - Right.

1908
01:12:30,029 --> 01:12:32,798
- So I will bet on it. - Okay.

1909
01:12:32,865 --> 01:12:35,735
If we catch the thief, then So Min will...

1910
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:37,236
- We will get double the prizes. - Double.

1911
01:12:37,236 --> 01:12:40,373
If her bet is wrong, then instead of two people getting the penalty,

1912
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:43,075
- 4 people will get it. - 4 people.

1913
01:12:43,075 --> 01:12:46,145
I hope that our viewers will...

1914
01:12:46,145 --> 01:12:48,247
- catch the thief. - Please catch the thief!

1915
01:12:48,247 --> 01:12:49,648
- Please catch the thief! - Please catch the thief!

1916
01:12:49,648 --> 01:12:50,783
- Please. - Please catch the thief!

1917
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:51,884
- I'm so curious. - I hope they catch the thief.

1918
01:12:51,884 --> 01:12:53,652
Please clear me of these false charges.

1919
01:12:53,652 --> 01:12:54,887
- Please. - "Please clear me."

1920
01:12:54,887 --> 01:12:57,423
- Please, save me. - You really look desperate.

1921
01:12:57,423 --> 01:12:58,657
- It doesn't matter to me. - You look desperate.

1922
01:12:58,657 --> 01:13:01,494
- I hope you all voted for Jae Seok. - Please save me.

1923
01:13:01,494 --> 01:13:03,562
He just needs to get all the votes to benefit me.

1924
01:13:03,562 --> 01:13:08,734
We need to announce the results now.

1925
01:13:08,734 --> 01:13:11,871
Since I'm one of the main suspects in this case,

1926
01:13:11,871 --> 01:13:14,640
the veteran host, Jee Seok Jin,

1927
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,475
- will take over for me. - Yes, of course.

1928
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,943
Will it be okay for Seok Jin to do it?

1929
01:13:17,943 --> 01:13:19,211
- He's a veteran host. - In any case,

1930
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:20,613
- Seok Jin... - just trust me.

1931
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:23,449
Back in the day, according to the history of show hosts,

1932
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:25,418
he started off as a host at Everland.

1933
01:13:25,418 --> 01:13:27,319
- He has strong foundations. - He does.

1934
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:29,722
- He is. - He has a lot of experience.

1935
01:13:29,722 --> 01:13:33,793
The results of the viewers' votes will be given to me shortly.

1936
01:13:33,793 --> 01:13:34,827
It's coming.

1937
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,028
- It's here. - It's here.

1938
01:13:36,028 --> 01:13:37,630
- It's here. - I'm so curious.

1939
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,998
CEO Big Nose, you have to announce the results quickly.

1940
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,466
Don't improvise and just announce it.

1941
01:13:40,466 --> 01:13:41,667
I'm so curious.

1942
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,335
- Please clear my name. - Why isn't there...

1943
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:44,370
Why isn't there an envelope?

1944
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:46,439
Tell us who received the most votes.

1945
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:47,606
That's the most important thing for me.

1946
01:13:47,606 --> 01:13:49,542
Running Man's 10th anniversary live broadcast.

1947
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:51,744
We had over...

1948
01:13:51,744 --> 01:13:55,981
- 230,000 people vote. - Goodness.

1949
01:13:55,981 --> 01:13:57,516
- A lot of people voted. - That's a lot of people.

1950
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,718
- That many people voted? - It was over 230,000 people?

1951
01:14:00,586 --> 01:14:03,322
The results are... Gosh, it's this person.

1952
01:14:03,322 --> 01:14:06,292
- Out of all those votes, - Please.

1953
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:08,494
- about 59,000 votes... - 59,000 votes.

1954
01:14:08,494 --> 01:14:10,463
- If you receive the most votes, - It is this person.

1955
01:14:10,463 --> 01:14:12,264
- you will go on the stand. - I just need to get this right.

1956
01:14:12,264 --> 01:14:13,999
- Please. - We have to get them right.

1957
01:14:13,999 --> 01:14:15,468
I just need to guess the right person for this.

1958
01:14:15,468 --> 01:14:17,002
I'm not looking.

1959
01:14:17,002 --> 01:14:18,604
- The thief needs to go up. - Hurry up.

1960
01:14:18,604 --> 01:14:20,639
- The viewers selected... - It's not here.

1961
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:22,007
- Who is it? - Who is it?

1962
01:14:22,007 --> 01:14:23,409
Who is it? They said it's there.

1963
01:14:23,409 --> 01:14:25,110
It's not here. It's not written here.

1964
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:26,779
- Hey. - Okay.

1965
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,214
Who is it?

1966
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,616
It's not written here, so I will just call their name.

1967
01:14:30,616 --> 01:14:32,218
It is...

1968
01:14:32,651 --> 01:14:34,386
Yu Jae Seok!

1969
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:37,022
- I'm exempt from getting a penalty. - It's not me.

1970
01:14:37,022 --> 01:14:38,591
- We all knew it. - It's not me.

1971
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:40,559
- We all knew it'd be Jae Seok. - I'm exempt from getting a penalty.

1972
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:43,028
- This is driving me crazy. - I'm exempt from getting a penalty.

1973
01:14:43,028 --> 01:14:44,630
It's not me.

1974
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:46,999
- Kwang Soo is happy. - Kwang Soo looks happy.

1975
01:14:46,999 --> 01:14:48,934
- Regardless, I will... - Hold on.

1976
01:14:48,934 --> 01:14:51,403
It looks like Kwang Soo is happy, so Jae Seok might not be the thief.

1977
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,172
- That's possible. - I'm not happy about this.

1978
01:14:53,172 --> 01:14:56,275
- It doesn't matter. - Out of the 220,000-some odd votes,

1979
01:14:56,275 --> 01:14:57,977
- I got the most votes... - 50,000.

1980
01:14:57,977 --> 01:14:59,678
which is over 50,000 votes.

1981
01:14:59,678 --> 01:15:01,280
I am standing on the stand.

1982
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,781
Everyone, it's not me.

1983
01:15:02,781 --> 01:15:03,949
- Then first... - Okay.

1984
01:15:03,949 --> 01:15:06,986
- Whether or not it's me... - It will be revealed.

1985
01:15:06,986 --> 01:15:08,254
- It's.. - It's inside here.

1986
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:11,924
- It will say "thief" if he is one, - Right.

1987
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,993
or "citizen" if he is not.

1988
01:15:13,993 --> 01:15:16,862
- Let's find out. - If I am a thief,

1989
01:15:16,862 --> 01:15:18,998
- I will take it off myself. - We're curious too.

1990
01:15:18,998 --> 01:15:21,100
- He looks happy. - It's not me.

1991
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,469
- 1, 2, - Who is it?

1992
01:15:23,669 --> 01:15:25,237
Three.

1993
01:15:26,872 --> 01:15:27,940
Oh, my gosh.

1994
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:30,109
- Who is it then? - It wasn't me.

1995
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,744
- It's not me. - Who is it?

1996
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:33,679
- I told you. - Then is it Jong Kook?

1997
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,481
- The viewers chose... - Look at his hair.

1998
01:15:35,481 --> 01:15:38,484
Yu Jae Seok as the thief,

1999
01:15:38,484 --> 01:15:40,085
- but it turns out he's not a thief. - Now,

2000
01:15:40,085 --> 01:15:41,554
- Who is it? - since it's not me,

2001
01:15:41,554 --> 01:15:42,922
we failed to catch the thief.

2002
01:15:42,922 --> 01:15:44,657
It's unfortunate, but there's nothing we can do.

2003
01:15:44,657 --> 01:15:45,691
That's just how life is.

2004
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:47,626
- Who is it? - Lee Kwang Soo, the thief,

2005
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,695
will announce who the other thief is.

2006
01:15:49,695 --> 01:15:53,732
The other thief did an incredibly good job that it gave me chills.

2007
01:15:53,732 --> 01:15:56,135
I will announce the thief.

2008
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,871
Honestly, I thought it could be Jong Kook.

2009
01:15:58,904 --> 01:16:00,239
- It's not me. - Is it Jong Kook?

2010
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:01,540
- It's not me. - Okay.

2011
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:03,208
- Who is it? - My partner-in-crime is...

2012
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:05,110
- Who is it? - He's standing next to him.

2013
01:16:05,678 --> 01:16:07,446
Yang Se Chan!

2014
01:16:09,848 --> 01:16:11,150
We did it.

2015
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,851
If you thought it was Se Chan, you should've said it.

2016
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:14,587
It was Se Chan?

2017
01:16:17,222 --> 01:16:19,291
- It was Se Chan? - I had no idea.

2018
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:20,726
- To be honest, - I really had no idea.

2019
01:16:20,726 --> 01:16:22,761
- he didn't do anything today. - He didn't do a thing.

2020
01:16:22,761 --> 01:16:25,598
- Okay. We're all curious. - This is unbelievable.

2021
01:16:25,598 --> 01:16:28,133
- He was not a suspect at all. - This makes no sense.

2022
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:30,402
Let's take a look at his performance.

2023
01:16:30,402 --> 01:16:31,870
- Let's watch it. - Let's watch it.

2024
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:33,238
- We had no idea. - We were all fooled.

2025
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:35,908
You guys are guests at a party,

2026
01:16:35,908 --> 01:16:38,711
as well as thieves who are after gold bars.

2027
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:42,147
You and I should be a judge. I think this is a good role.

2028
01:16:42,147 --> 01:16:44,617
From here, we're going straight to tomorrow's opening.

2029
01:16:44,617 --> 01:16:46,652
You guys are unbelievable.

2030
01:16:46,652 --> 01:16:48,387
Gosh, you persistent ones.

2031
01:16:48,387 --> 01:16:49,755
It's Se Chan.

2032
01:16:49,755 --> 01:16:51,657
- This is incredible. - I pick the judge.

2033
01:16:51,657 --> 01:16:52,825
- This was all planned. - I'll be a detective.

2034
01:16:52,825 --> 01:16:54,927
It doesn't matter to me.

2035
01:16:55,494 --> 01:16:56,962
Nobody suspected him.

2036
01:16:56,962 --> 01:16:58,597
Se Chan didn't act suspicious.

2037
01:16:58,597 --> 01:17:00,833
- He was never a suspect. - But he did his job.

2038
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:03,369
- He did a lot. - I did a lot.

2039
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,270
How did he do it?

2040
01:17:05,437 --> 01:17:06,572
He did that?

2041
01:17:06,572 --> 01:17:07,740
The number of gold bars increased.

2042
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:10,442
- I see. - Since he was the detective,

2043
01:17:10,442 --> 01:17:11,910
we never really suspected him.

2044
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:13,012
And gold bars were missing from two of them.

2045
01:17:13,012 --> 01:17:14,013
Two of them?

2046
01:17:14,013 --> 01:17:16,248
I moved the gold bars into the other safe,

2047
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:18,550
and Jae Seok got confused and thought they were stolen.

2048
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,019
I suspected Haha,

2049
01:17:20,019 --> 01:17:21,286
but he wasn't lying.

2050
01:17:21,286 --> 01:17:22,655
I only told the truth.

2051
01:17:22,655 --> 01:17:24,023
And Jae Seok didn't lie either.

2052
01:17:24,023 --> 01:17:25,524
- Right. - It was all true.

2053
01:17:25,524 --> 01:17:28,360
- Se Chan did a great job. - He did a good job.

2054
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,130
- Go in first. - Okay. I'll use it well.

2055
01:17:31,964 --> 01:17:33,365
This is shocking.

2056
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:35,300
We narrowed down our deductions too much in the beginning.

2057
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,403
We were too focused on certain people.

2058
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:40,472
We didn't take a broader look at things.

2059
01:17:40,472 --> 01:17:42,641
- Also... - He didn't act suspicious.

2060
01:17:42,641 --> 01:17:44,043
To be completely honest,

2061
01:17:44,043 --> 01:17:45,778
I didn't suspect Yang Se Chan, not even once.

2062
01:17:45,778 --> 01:17:46,845
- Me neither. - That's what I'm saying.

2063
01:17:46,845 --> 01:17:48,514
Se Chan did a great job.

2064
01:17:48,514 --> 01:17:50,749
- I didn't suspect him too. - We never even mentioned him.

2065
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,184
- Right. - Right.

2066
01:17:52,184 --> 01:17:53,585
Why?

2067
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:55,354
The two of you...

2068
01:17:55,354 --> 01:17:57,890
- There was no chance... - You must've been happy.

2069
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:59,291
for anyone to suspect him.

2070
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:01,360
We didn't even give him a chance to talk.

2071
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,296
- I was lucky too. - I agree.

2072
01:18:05,364 --> 01:18:07,199
We suspected Jae Seok too much.

2073
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,268
Jong Kook kept saying it was Jae Seok.

2074
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,070
When someone says they're not, believe them.

2075
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:13,939
Believe in them! Why are you always suspicious?

2076
01:18:14,139 --> 01:18:16,241
- Believe in them. - All right.

2077
01:18:17,976 --> 01:18:20,412
- So... - This is...

2078
01:18:20,412 --> 01:18:23,682
This is quite disappointing, but none of us...

2079
01:18:23,682 --> 01:18:25,350
- thought it was Se Chan. - None of us knew.

2080
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:26,585
- Not even the slightest. - Not at all.

2081
01:18:26,585 --> 01:18:29,888
Who would've thought the thief was our youngest member?

2082
01:18:29,888 --> 01:18:31,657
- Right. In such a big project. - As a result,

2083
01:18:31,657 --> 01:18:33,826
the thieves...

2084
01:18:33,826 --> 01:18:36,161
The thieves have won!

2085
01:18:36,762 --> 01:18:38,363
- So what's going to happen? - Unfortunately,

2086
01:18:38,363 --> 01:18:40,966
we failed to catch both of the thieves.

2087
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:44,870
We failed to catch 1 of the 2 thieves,

2088
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:48,107
so the two of them will take the prize.

2089
01:18:48,107 --> 01:18:51,343
Also, the 1,320 dollars from the gold bars the thieves stole...

2090
01:18:51,343 --> 01:18:55,047
and the proceeds from the songs from Nine Years of Running Man...

2091
01:18:55,047 --> 01:18:58,717
will be donated to where they are needed...

2092
01:18:58,717 --> 01:19:00,853
under Lee Kwang Soo and Yang Se Chan's name.

2093
01:19:00,853 --> 01:19:02,421
That's nice.

2094
01:19:02,421 --> 01:19:05,724
As a result of So Min the gambler's bet,

2095
01:19:05,724 --> 01:19:07,593
the number of members...

2096
01:19:07,593 --> 01:19:08,694
- to be penalized... - It should be doubled.

2097
01:19:08,694 --> 01:19:10,429
- has been doubled to four. - Right.

2098
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:12,798
And the member with the most votes is...

2099
01:19:12,798 --> 01:19:15,067
- That's right. - I got the most votes.

2100
01:19:15,067 --> 01:19:16,168
- You did. - And I will...

2101
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,170
call the names one by one now.

2102
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,106
I'm the 1st. Jong Kook is the 2nd.

2103
01:19:21,106 --> 01:19:23,609
Haha is the 3rd. Kwang Soo is the 4th.

2104
01:19:23,609 --> 01:19:24,610
- Me? - What?

2105
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:26,011
But they knew Kwang Soo was one of the thieves.

2106
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:27,713
It's Ji Hyo. I meant Song Ji Hyo.

2107
01:19:27,713 --> 01:19:28,714
What are you talking about?

2108
01:19:28,714 --> 01:19:30,215
The votes I got have been nullified.

2109
01:19:30,215 --> 01:19:31,950
Kwang Soo is arrested.

2110
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:33,519
- I'm just... - Next.

2111
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:34,720
Ji Hyo is the fifth...

2112
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,155
according to the number of votes,

2113
01:19:36,155 --> 01:19:38,690
but she will get the penalty...

2114
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:39,992
instead of Kwang Soo.

2115
01:19:39,992 --> 01:19:41,426
- Then... - All right.

2116
01:19:41,426 --> 01:19:43,495
If I refuse to get the penalty, who's next?

2117
01:19:43,495 --> 01:19:44,997
You have the penalty transfer card.

2118
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:46,265
Then the person who comes next will get the penalty, right?

2119
01:19:46,265 --> 01:19:48,233
If you refuse to get the penalty, the next person will get it.

2120
01:19:48,233 --> 01:19:50,369
- That's nice. - You should get the penalty.

2121
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:51,870
- So are you... - I'm thinking...

2122
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,739
- Just do it. - whether I should wash my face...

2123
01:19:53,739 --> 01:19:55,707
- or take a shower. - Just take a shower.

2124
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:57,543
- What are you hesitating for? - It's a pleasant concern.

2125
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:58,977
I have to wash my face anyway.

2126
01:19:58,977 --> 01:20:00,646
So I should probably take a shower as well.

2127
01:20:00,646 --> 01:20:02,181
- Exactly. - I'm thinking of taking a shower.

2128
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:03,749
So aren't you going to use the card today?

2129
01:20:03,749 --> 01:20:05,184
I won't use it today. I'll just get the penalty.

2130
01:20:05,184 --> 01:20:07,519
Okay. Good. You should use the penalty transfer card...

2131
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:10,556
- you won today in three months. - Okay.

2132
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:13,258
All right. If you forget to use it, it will be canceled.

2133
01:20:13,258 --> 01:20:14,593
- I hope it will happen. - In three months?

2134
01:20:14,593 --> 01:20:16,895
- It's too soon. - We should get the penalty now.

2135
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:18,363
- Take off the microphone. - Before we do that,

2136
01:20:18,363 --> 01:20:21,600
we'd like to thank our viewers for the 10th anniversary.

2137
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,703
Shall we say a few words? Kwang Soo, you can go first.

2138
01:20:24,703 --> 01:20:27,539
Okay. I hope you enjoyed our show.

2139
01:20:27,539 --> 01:20:30,475
Thank you for the last 10 years.

2140
01:20:30,475 --> 01:20:33,478
And I'll work even harder for the show.

2141
01:20:33,478 --> 01:20:34,613
- Seriously... - He's a bad speaker.

2142
01:20:34,613 --> 01:20:36,415
Jae Seok, you should say it for him.

2143
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:37,783
- This is a live show. - I'm nervous.

2144
01:20:37,783 --> 01:20:39,985
- If we had... - Thank you.

2145
01:20:39,985 --> 01:20:41,486
enough time here,

2146
01:20:41,486 --> 01:20:43,488
we would've taken turns to say thank you.

2147
01:20:43,488 --> 01:20:46,458
But we have to get the penalty too.

2148
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:49,094
So I will give a speech on behalf of them.

2149
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,629
Why don't you thank our viewers, CEO Big Nose?

2150
01:20:50,629 --> 01:20:51,697
- Right. - You're the oldest one here.

2151
01:20:51,697 --> 01:20:52,698
- You should do that. - You should.

2152
01:20:52,698 --> 01:20:55,534
Thank you for your love and support for the past 10 years.

2153
01:20:55,534 --> 01:20:58,804
We don't even know how to thank you enough.

2154
01:20:58,804 --> 01:21:00,873
We will work even harder in the future.

2155
01:21:00,873 --> 01:21:02,241
Please keep loving...

2156
01:21:02,241 --> 01:21:03,308
- and supporting our show. - You're talking too much.

2157
01:21:03,308 --> 01:21:04,843
- Thank you. - Thank you!

2158
01:21:04,843 --> 01:21:08,914
Dear viewers, thank you for being with us for the past 10 years.

2159
01:21:08,914 --> 01:21:10,182
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2160
01:21:10,182 --> 01:21:11,984
- Thank you. - The losers.

2161
01:21:11,984 --> 01:21:13,352
- Let's do this. - Take off the microphone.

2162
01:21:13,352 --> 01:21:15,687
- Take off the microphone. - Take it off. Get in there.

2163
01:21:15,687 --> 01:21:17,623
Here we go. Make sure to take off the microphone.

2164
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,459
- Take it off. - Gosh, today...

2165
01:21:20,525 --> 01:21:21,860
we have mud.

2166
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:23,462
- It's mud. - Thank you.

2167
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:26,164
Those who have survived should stand here.

2168
01:21:26,164 --> 01:21:28,967
- All right. Today... - We're running out of time.

2169
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,503
We couldn't even imagine that Se Chan was the thief.

2170
01:21:31,503 --> 01:21:33,005
I asked you many times.

2171
01:21:33,005 --> 01:21:35,340
- Come this way. - I was really surprised...

2172
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,508
when I heard it was you.

2173
01:21:36,508 --> 01:21:38,610
All right. Come over here.

2174
01:21:39,011 --> 01:21:40,579
Those who are not getting the penalty...

2175
01:21:40,579 --> 01:21:42,180
- should stand here. - Okay.

2176
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:43,382
It might splatter on you.

2177
01:21:43,382 --> 01:21:45,550
- Move over. - Okay.

2178
01:21:45,884 --> 01:21:47,452
- All right. - I'm so glad I'm not one of them.

2179
01:21:47,452 --> 01:21:48,487
Come here.

2180
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,155
He seems happy.

2181
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,256
Be careful.

2182
01:21:51,256 --> 01:21:54,860
- All right. This is live. - Right.

2183
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:55,861
- All right. - This is live.

2184
01:21:55,861 --> 01:21:59,097
The writer is telling us to hurry.

2185
01:21:59,097 --> 01:22:00,332
- Okay. - Okay.

2186
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,500
Because this is live.

2187
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,902
- We should do this right. - Brace yourselves.

2188
01:22:03,902 --> 01:22:05,103
- Are you ready? - Yes.

2189
01:22:05,103 --> 01:22:06,305
Let's begin then.

2190
01:22:06,305 --> 01:22:08,573
After this show, All the Butlers is up.

2191
01:22:08,573 --> 01:22:11,109
Please watch it as well.

2192
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:13,645
We will keep running hard and fast in Running Man.

2193
01:22:13,645 --> 01:22:16,014
Please give us a lot of support.

2194
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:18,150
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

2195
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:20,619
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2196
01:22:24,489 --> 01:22:26,158
Thank you!

2197
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:29,728
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2198
01:22:32,898 --> 01:22:34,099
Look at Jong Kook.
