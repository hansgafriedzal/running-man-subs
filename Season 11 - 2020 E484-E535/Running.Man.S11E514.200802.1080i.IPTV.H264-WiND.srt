1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,080
(It's a summer day
with drizzling rain.)

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,240
Hello.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,940
It's a cloudy morning.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,650
Hello. Good morning.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,610
I'm in Yangpyeong now.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,720
(All the members start
the shooting separately.)

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,190
It wasn't raining
until just a few minutes ago.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,620
I know.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,100
(The phone rings
right at the moment.)

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,420
What's going on?

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,690
Answer it.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,570
What?

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,530
Why are you calling me when you're
standing right in front of me?

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,640
Just pick it up.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,930
(The director calls Kwang Soo
who stands right in front of him.)

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,960
Hello?

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,880
Hello?

18
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,380
What are you doing?

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,000
What is going on?

20
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,950
Hello. This is Running High School.

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,890
I hear double voices.

22
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,780
Hello?

23
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,180
Hello. This is Running High School.

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,420
What? High school?

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,920
What did you say?

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,960
Running High School?

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,860
Your youngest sister, who's a model
student of Running High School...

28
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,460
and expected to go
to a prestigious university,

29
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,460
skipped school saying she would
take an audition to be a singer.

30
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,460
Darn it.

31
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,560
Please find your sister
and send her to school.

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,280
My youngest sister skipped school?

33
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,810
My youngest sister is
acting up again.

34
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,710
She wants to give up school
to become a singer.

35
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,840
- Exactly.
- I actually support her dream.

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,750
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

37
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,120
That's what I did.

38
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,480
Today, we're going to have
Unstoppable Sisters Race.

39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,680
There will be 4 teams of 3 members.

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,350
Suk Jin, your goal is to collect
as many academic points...

41
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,260
as possible with your siblings.

42
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,060
And you should make
the top two teams...

43
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,460
to have your sister graduate...

44
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,000
and get exempted from the penalty.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,640
So there will be a penalty today.

46
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,900
At the same time,
your youngest sister...

47
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,340
can collect audition points
without her siblings.

48
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,480
The youngest sister
with the highest audition points...

49
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,280
will win a prize and
get exempted from the penalty.

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,480
And the second place
will also win a prize.

51
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,340
You should keep your sister
from winning audition points.

52
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,620
She will definitely try to get
more audition points and win.

53
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,810
Among the four sisters,

54
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,180
you should find your real sister
and send her to school.

55
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,060
Then you will get academic points
by the order of arrival.

56
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,870
Including the youngest sister,
once three siblings get together,

57
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,270
your siblinghood will be judged.

58
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,770
You should hold each other's
hands and say "We are siblings."

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,870
If you say it with a fake sister,

60
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,210
the sister will get
10 audition points.

61
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,970
(Once the 3 siblings get together,
they can move to the opening place.)

62
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,550
(If they are not real siblings,
the sister gets 10 audition points.)

63
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,340
If we pick a wrong person,

64
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,750
we will be helping her
pass the audition.

65
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,780
They are going to lie to us
to get 10 points.

66
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,650
They all are going to say
they are my sisters.

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,250
This is the cue card that has
your sister's location and number.

68
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,330
Ennik and Yong Sun?

69
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,930
(Hyun Ju, Young Ji,
Ennik, Yong Sun)

70
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,800
I don't have a sister
with such names.

71
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,560
Are these their real names?

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,460
- They are their real names.
- Really?

73
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,560
Yong Sun?

74
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,160
I'm in trouble.
I don't know any of them.

75
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,840
Is Young Ji a member of Jewelry?

76
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,340
Gosh, there's no way
I can go to an Ivy League college.

77
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,370
I'll just try my best.

78
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,150
(A high school rapper
with a sweet voice, Lee Young Ji)

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,710
(Popular rapper Lee Young Ji
is known for her sweatsuit.)

80
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,900
Can I just pick anything I want?

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,750
(They randomly picked
their siblings before the race.)

82
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,370
Can I take a look at it?

83
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,060
(Who are Young Ji's siblings?)

84
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,900
(Laughing)

85
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,310
(Haha and Lee Kwang Soo)

86
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,180
(Young Ji's siblings are
Haha and Kwang Soo.)

87
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,550
<i>Nino Maximus Keyser Soze</i>

88
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,680
(She seems really excited
even before the race.)

89
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,840
All right.

90
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,310
Hang on. Hyun Ju?
I think I know who she is.

91
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,860
(The second sister Hyun Ju is...)

92
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,830
One of the sisters already
picked her team.

93
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,460
Please pick one of the three cards.

94
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,360
(Jessi picks a card among three.)

95
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,530
Yoo Jae Suk!

96
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,560
(Yoo Jae Suk!)

97
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
(Jessi's brothers are
Jae Suk and Se Chan.)

98
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,160
Yang Se Chan.

99
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,370
(Jessi's brothers are
Jae Suk and Se Chan.)

100
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,580
(She's the natural enemy
of Jae Suk and Se Chan.)

101
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,180
(She's a Korean American
with a strong pride, Jessi.)

102
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,210
My goodness.

103
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,470
(Her natural enemies
are her family for today.)

104
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,090
I found it.

105
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,250
(The third sister,
Ennik's identity is revealed.)

106
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,720
Ennik is Jeon So Mi, right?

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
(Jeon So Mi, Ennik Somi Douma)

108
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,160
(So Mi is back with her new song,
"What You Waiting For".)

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,060
(Today, she's a daring sister
who never listens to her brothers.)

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,190
Oh, no.

111
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,540
(Who on earth are her siblings?)

112
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,130
Am I supposed to be happy about it?

113
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,110
I picked Jong Kook and Suk Jin.

114
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,440
So Jong Kook
is coming to catch me...

115
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,180
while shouting "Sparta"?

116
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,250
(He's a scary brother
with a big build.)

117
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,250
Can I just go back to school?

118
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,250
(She became a model student again.)

119
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,080
Yong Sun? Who's Yong Sun?

120
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,880
It means a ship for the king.

121
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
(Yong Sun is...)

122
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,320
Hello.

123
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,060
(Solar of MAMAMOO.)

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
(Solar has an enthusiastic zest
and brilliant charisma.)

125
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,200
(This is her first time
to join Running Man alone.)

126
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,180
(Solar's siblings are
Ji Hyo and So Min.)

127
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,750
Solar, your siblings are...

128
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,810
Song Ji Hyo and Jeon So Min.

129
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,810
Okay.

130
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,480
(Jae Suk, Jessi, Se Chan,
Jong Kook, So Mi, Suk Jin)

131
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,350
(Ji Hyo, Solar, So Min,
Haha, Young Ji, Kwang Soo)

132
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,860
This is what I'm going to do.
They all are my family.

133
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,060
Okay? The problem is
they will recognize my voice...

134
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,730
once I call them.

135
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,730
Hang on.

136
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,670
Hello? It didn't sound like me.
It was like a guy.

137
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,670
Hello?

138
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,320
I should fake my voice.

139
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,370
Hello? Right. I'm your sister.

140
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,110
Can I say I'm their sister?

141
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,870
Okay. Gosh.

142
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,240
- Hello?
- Hello?

143
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,500
Is this Hyun Ju speaking?

144
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,810
Yes.

145
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,870
Are you Ms. Baek Hyun Ju?

146
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,510
Yes, I am.

147
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,750
- I see. It's you.
- Right.

148
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,560
I know who you are.
You're a member of SEEART.

149
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,680
- Right?
- Yes.

150
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,160
It's you. I know everything
about SEEART.

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,870
I already know everything
about today's guests.

152
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,040
Because Hyun Ju is my sister.

153
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,110
Suk Jin, I'm your sister.

154
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,910
- Shall we go together then?
- Let's do that.

155
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,180
- All right then.
- Okay.

156
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
- Bye.
- Bye.

157
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,440
(He totally fell for my lie.)

158
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,770
My gosh.

159
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,770
(She gets another call
while feeling excited.)

160
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,420
What? It's Kwang Soo.

161
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,810
Hello?

162
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,250
- Hello?
- Hello?

163
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,680
What...

164
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,820
Isn't it Jessi?

165
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,820
(Isn't it Jessi?)

166
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,760
What was that? He hung up on me.

167
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,690
I'm very offended.

168
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,830
Jessi, I'm sorry.

169
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,330
Why did you hang up on me like that?

170
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,930
I'm so sorry, Jessi.
I was just surprised.

171
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,060
Did you pick two members?

172
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,700
Yes. I picked two members.

173
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,040
Who are they? Am I one of them?

174
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,980
You are one of them.
And there's one more.

175
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,250
Who is it?

176
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,680
Well... It's Suk Jin.

177
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,990
(She lies to Kwang Soo.)

178
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,880
What? My gosh.

179
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,820
What was that? He hung... Hey!

180
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,080
Hang on. It's Jae Suk.

181
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,360
(It's Jae Suk's call.)

182
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,450
Hello?

183
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,470
(She changes her voice
even when she talks to her brother.)

184
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,520
Hello?

185
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,560
- Yes?
- Hyun Ju.

186
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,670
Yes.

187
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,560
Hyun Ju, are you my sister?

188
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm your family. Come over here.

189
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,410
You're Jessi, aren't you?

190
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,570
(You're Jessi, aren't you?)

191
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,180
(Laughing)

192
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,920
I told you you shouldn't say,
"Hyun Ju".

193
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,940
It said, "Hyun Ju",
so I thought that was your name.

194
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,680
I didn't know you were Jessi.

195
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,220
I mean...

196
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,020
Hurry up and come over here.
You're my family.

197
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,060
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

198
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,230
Come on. Hurry up. It's raining,
and I have a stomachache.

199
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,230
My T-shirt is too tight.

200
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,520
Hey.

201
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,260
It's not like I picked it out.
Why are you complaining to me?

202
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,200
Anyway, come over here.
You're my brother.

203
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,410
Are you sure?

204
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,430
- Okay. I'll come over.
- There's one more person.

205
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,770
- I trust you. Okay, see you.
- See you.

206
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,480
(Meanwhile, Solar...)

207
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,180
- The phone is ringing.
- Take it.

208
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

209
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,380
Hello. Hi.

210
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,420
Do you even know who I am?

211
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,490
(Solar's siblings:
Ji Hyo and So Min)

212
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,430
Is this Haha?

213
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,890
Is this Haha?

214
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,120
(Is this Haha?)

215
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,390
Wait, Solar.
I'm obviously not your brother.

216
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,540
That's not it. You are. That's why.

217
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,240
To me, you totally sound...

218
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,370
like you're lying.

219
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,740
(You totally sound like
you're lying.)

220
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm not your brother,

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,610
- but you want 10 points.
- That's not it.

222
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,680
(Solar sounds like she's lying.)

223
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,480
You're one of my siblings.

224
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,920
- So just come over here.
- Okay.

225
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,410
Anyway,

226
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,720
just come.

227
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,320
I can't really tell from your voice,

228
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,490
so let's meet.

229
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,990
Okay.

230
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,090
(It worked.)

231
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,200
Where are you, my precious sister?

232
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,420
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Se Chan.

233
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,660
- Hi.
- Hi.

234
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,970
- Should I go out?
- You're wearing a school uniform.

235
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,970
Yes.

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,300
I'm not going to school.

237
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,900
All of a sudden?

238
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
(She suddenly starts acting?)

239
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,080
All of a sudden?

240
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,800
- What are you talking about?
- I mean...

241
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,980
- You brat.
- I'm not going to school!

242
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,620
Come on, Solar. Your brother...

243
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,640
has been looking everywhere for you.

244
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Hold on.

245
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,190
- Hello.
- She's always looked down on me.

246
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,320
Hello.

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,460
- Who is it?
- Yong Sun.

248
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,550
(The second person
who fell for Solar's lie appears.)

249
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,000
- Yong Sun!
- Her eyes... Oh, Haha is here too.

250
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,860
- Yong Sun!
- I'm sorry. I have to go.

251
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,390
- Hey.
- Yong Sun!

252
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,130
- Yong Sun, please don't do this.
- I'm not going to school!

253
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,700
- Hey.
- I'm not going!

254
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,370
Think of how Mom raised us.

255
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,710
Go away!

256
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm not going to school!

257
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,170
Are you insane?

258
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,530
- Don't hit her.
- How dare you...

259
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,610
The thing is, we somehow
look like each other.

260
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,980
- Kind of.
- Right?

261
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,480
You look like both of us,
but in a good way.

262
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,380
(You look like both of us,
but in a good way.)

263
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,960
- Don't you admit it?
- You're right.

264
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,590
All right. I'm sure we're siblings.

265
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,250
- Yes, definitely.
- Definitely.

266
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

267
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
- We're siblings.
- We're siblings.

268
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,730
You're not real siblings.

269
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,100
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

270
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,630
(She fooled us!)

271
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,700
What happened?

272
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,970
It's raining.

273
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,300
Bye.

275
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,240
Solar, you gained
10 audition points.

276
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,740
- Unbelievable.
- Yes!

277
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,800
You... Okay, I get it now.

278
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,140
- Goodbye.
- You should become a good singer.

279
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,250
(After getting what she wants,
Solar says goodbye to them.)

280
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,450
Neither of us is her sibling?

281
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,880
(Running)

282
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,950
Let's run.

283
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,190
- Solar wasn't my sister.
- Gosh.

284
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,380
(They start looking for
their real siblings.)

285
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,330
I have this nagging feeling
that Jessi is my sister.

286
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,230
I wish So Mi was my sister.

287
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,020
Please.

288
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,420
She's in the van?

289
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,070
(Kwang Soo came to meet Jessi.)

290
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,000
(Happy to see her,
he bursts out laughing.)

291
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,970
- Come on, get in.
- You're wearing a school uniform?

292
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,660
This school uniform
is way too tight.

293
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,800
- Get in.
- I mean...

294
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,300
Is no one else here?

295
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,270
Too much is happening right now.

296
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,580
Hyun Ju!

297
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
(Her real brother, Jae Suk,
appears.)

298
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,750
- Jae Suk is here.
- Hyun Ju...

299
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,010
He's not my brother.

300
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,220
- Hyun Ju...
- Tell him he is.

301
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,140
Hi, Jae Suk.

302
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,150
Why is it so crowded here?

303
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,280
- Is it really Hyun Ju?
- I just got here.

304
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,460
Hyun Ju.

305
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,380
Why are you wearing so much perfume?

306
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,330
A girl should smell good.

307
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,620
I mean...

308
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,260
Gosh, it's giving me a headache.

309
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,970
I'm dizzy. I breathed
through my mouth in the car.

310
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,660
My shirt is too tight.
I can't breathe.

311
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,030
- You're the one who tightened it.
- Hey.

312
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,400
- Loosen it.
- Unbelievable.

313
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,940
- It's tight around here.
- I mean...

314
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,500
- Hey, come on.
- It's tight in the armpits.

315
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,480
You tightened the shirt yourself.

316
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,350
It's tight around here.

317
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,410
I get it. Stop.

318
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,850
- Gosh.
- Okay.

319
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,590
Why did you only tuck your shirt
in the front?

320
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,990
- It's a style.
- Why would you do that?

321
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,410
- It's a style.
- What is that?

322
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,120
You're unbelievably tall.

323
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,360
How can you say that
to your big brother?

324
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,830
How can she say that
to her big brother,

325
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,730
- looking him up and down?
- "You're unbelievably tall."

326
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,160
Let's give it a go.

327
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,260
- No. Hold on.
- No?

328
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,940
I'm not sure if you're my sister.

329
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,110
She's been saying this
the whole time.

330
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,160
She told me you were her brother.

331
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,030
- To tell you the truth,
- Gosh.

332
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,850
you guys are my siblings.

333
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,370
We are siblings.

334
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,370
- Let's give it a try.
- Okay.

335
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,540
- What are we supposed to do?
- Say, "We're siblings."

336
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,040
- Let's hold hands.
- We're siblings.

337
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,190
1, 2, 3.

338
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,590
- We're siblings.
- We're siblings.

339
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,620
(We're siblings.)

340
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,620
You're...

341
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,420
- not real siblings.
- See?

342
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,790
See? I told you.

343
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,200
She told me
you weren't her brother.

344
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,260
(What?)

345
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,620
- Bye.
- Suk Jin and I are her brothers.

346
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,400
Gosh, why are you doing this?

347
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,710
I don't know.

348
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,030
- So you are her brother?
- Yes.

349
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
- My goodness.
- From the beginning...

350
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,580
Why didn't you tell me?

351
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,710
- I'm leaving.
- How does this work?

352
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,540
Just wander around
in the rain for a bit...

353
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,120
- and be penalized later.
- This is so annoying.

354
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
(I'll call you again soon.)

355
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Should I try with Young Ji?

356
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,140
(Jessi's real brother, Jae Suk,
hurries to the next person.)

357
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,620
Young Ji, are you sure
I'm your brother?

358
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,490
- Is this Jae Suk?
- Yes, that's right.

359
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,050
Oh, my. Jae Suk.

360
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,700
Nice to meet you. Hello.

361
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,100
From the way you talk to me,

362
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,970
- I can tell we're not siblings.
- Right? No.

363
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,030
Don't I totally sound
like your little sister?

364
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,100
We're family.

365
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,130
All right, Young Ji.

366
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,000
Who is your other sibling then?

367
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,400
- My siblings are...
- Okay.

368
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,500
you and...

369
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,750
Kwang Soo.

370
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,720
Kwang Soo says
he is Jessi's brother.

371
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,950
What? Why would he do that?

372
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,690
Can you bring him over to me?

373
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,150
- Is Kwang Soo your brother?
- Yes.

374
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,620
Jessi says he's her brother.

375
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,860
- If someone comes...
- Jae Suk is calling me.

376
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,360
Hi, Jae Suk.

377
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,920
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

378
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,120
- Listen carefully.
- Okay.

379
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
(Whispering)

380
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,700
You're not Jessi's brother.

381
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,900
(You're not Jessi's brother.)

382
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,070
- What?
- Young Ji...

383
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,760
- Just keep quiet and listen to me.
- Okay.

384
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,750
I'm listening. I'm right here.

385
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,500
(He gets caught by Jessi.)

386
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,250
- Hey, I mean...
- Who is it again?

387
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,040
- We're on the phone.
- Who is it?

388
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,850
Just because you whisper
doesn't mean she can't hear you.

389
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,550
You hang up!

390
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,190
Hold on. Hello?

391
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,830
Gosh, they hung up on me.

392
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,780
They hung up on me.

393
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,500
Be honest with me.

394
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,420
- Seriously.
- Ji Hyo is not my sister.

395
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,700
- So who is it?
- I'd feel bad if she comes.

396
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,260
- Who is it?
- Kwang Soo, where are you?

397
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,030
I'm with Jessi.
She's driving me crazy.

398
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,470
- What's his name?
- The thing is...

399
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,660
I'm in trouble.

400
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,940
- This is driving me crazy.
- Why?

401
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,000
I can neither stay nor leave.

402
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,640
(Meanwhile...)

403
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,140
(Haha came to meet...)

404
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,410
(So Mi, who isn't his sister.)

405
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,590
- Haha!
- Ennik!

406
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,280
(My little sister, Ennik!)

407
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,780
Am I...

408
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,420
You're my brother, seriously.

409
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,330
- Are you sure?
- I swear.

410
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,020
Ennik!

411
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,500
(Se Chan arrives,
who isn't her brother.)

412
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,570
You...

413
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,940
- You...
- Hurry!

414
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,790
When did you run out?

415
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,840
Hold on.

416
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,270
Se Chan is running to her. Gosh.

417
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,670
- Four people...
- Hold on. Let's wait for Jong Kook.

418
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,870
- Hurry!
- Hold on.

419
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,480
- So Mi!
- What's going on?

420
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,820
- I'm scared. Let's say it already.
- What's with him?

421
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,540
So Mi!

422
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,220
Why are you not going to school?

423
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,320
He's getting into it. Look at him.

424
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,880
- These guys...
- Look at him.

425
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,860
- We're siblings.
- You brats...

426
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,420
You're hanging out with So Mi?

427
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,920
- No, we aren't.
- She should go to school.

428
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
(Let my little sister go.)

429
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,260
- You little...
- Hold on.

430
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,370
- Hold on.
- You know me, right?

431
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,870
- You two might be brothers.
- I'm your little brother.

432
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,440
- I'm your little brother.
- You two might be brothers.

433
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,530
I'm your little brother.

434
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,840
- All right.
- You're my big brother.

435
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,240
- Gosh.
- She's trying to win points.

436
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,530
- I'm sure she's my little sister.
- We're siblings. In 1, 2...

437
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,800
- We're siblings.
- We're siblings.

438
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,350
- No.
- You're not siblings.

439
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,140
We aren't siblings.

440
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,350
- Move.
- Wait. I'm not her brother?

441
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,820
- You're not.
- Neither of us?

442
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,650
Jong Kook, hold her hand.

443
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,420
- You gained 10 audition points.
- So Mi.

444
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,590
- I'm your brother, right?
- Yes, you are.

445
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,020
I'm pretty sure.

446
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,020
- Let's give it a try.
- Ready, go.

447
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,420
- We're siblings.
- We're siblings.

448
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,370
You're not siblings.

449
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,470
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

450
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,840
You're not siblings.

451
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,970
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

452
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,070
- But...
- So Mi.

453
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,970
- Wait, is Jong Kook your brother?
- You gained 10 audition points.

454
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,210
- I must be her brother.
- Yes.

455
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,110
- Really? I am?
- Yes.

456
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,250
- You three...
- Go away, you punks!

457
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,540
- Go away!
- How dare you mess with my sister?

458
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,820
You're a bad influence.

459
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,250
Hey, you and I might be brothers.

460
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,620
Se Chan and I might be brothers.

461
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,960
- Let's try.
- Hold hands.

462
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,990
- Hold hands.
- They're only getting her points.

463
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,050
Let's try.

464
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,000
- We're siblings.
- We're siblings.

465
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,250
- No.
- You're not siblings.

466
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,100
That was a good idea, right, So Mi?

467
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,000
- Good job.
- Right?

468
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,160
Go away.

469
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,290
Jae Suk.

470
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,710
Se Chan.

471
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,440
- Hey.
- Go away!

472
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,630
I'm with So Mi,
and she's not my sister.

473
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,400
She's not?

474
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,000
No. The problem is,

475
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,480
I might end up with Hyun Ju.

476
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,320
Gosh, this is bad.

477
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,380
I don't want to be siblings
with Jessi.

478
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,960
Even if she's my little sister,
I'm scared of her.

479
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,020
- Hey, Brother!
- Hi!

480
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,330
- Hyun Ju!
- My brother!

481
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,700
- My little sister!
- This is real.

482
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,020
- Seriously...
- Finally...

483
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,290
- Why did you not listen to me?
- All my siblings are here.

484
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,570
- We're siblings, right?
- Suk Jin. Gosh.

485
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,940
Here we are, finally.

486
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,100
- The three of us.
- I mean...

487
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,940
- She said it from the beginning.
- I know.

488
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,070
- To be honest...
- You didn't sound so convincing.

489
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,610
Also, she doesn't know the rules.

490
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,170
Be quiet.

491
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,210
- Let's give it a go.
- Let's try. Stand here.

492
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,610
- Stand in the middle.
- If we're siblings...

493
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,820
- Say, "We're siblings."
- All right.

494
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,510
- We're siblings.
- We're siblings.

495
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,540
You're...

496
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,650
We're siblings.

497
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,380
not real siblings.

498
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,330
Hey, you.

499
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,250
- You're not my brother.
- This is driving me crazy.

500
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,350
To be honest,

501
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,590
- you're not. Go now.
- Hey.

502
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,560
- You're not my brother.
- Hey!

503
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,230
- Who is it then?
- I ran all the way here.

504
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,590
- Am I your brother?
- Yes.

505
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,740
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You said it was him and me.

506
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,170
Gosh, I'm leaving. Hey.

507
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,670
You're not her brother either,
you fool.

508
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,270
- You're not.
- You said from the beginning.

509
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,570
- You're not.
- Suk Jin isn't my brother.

510
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,380
He's a fool.

511
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,250
- Where are you?
- Jong Kook, where are you?

512
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,510
Where are you now?
I'm with So Mi now.

513
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,540
(His real brother, Jong Kook
calls him right on time.)

514
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,920
I'm with So Mi.

515
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,050
I don't want to study.

516
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,550
You should at least graduate.

517
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,250
What's the use of graduating?

518
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,500
Hang on. Your second
sister is coming, you brat.

519
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,290
Gosh, you are unbelievable.

520
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,200
If you're my sister,
you'll be doomed.

521
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,830
- Hello, Ji Hyo. Hi!
- So Min.

522
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,140
Hello, So Min.

523
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,740
Wait... Well... You...

524
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,980
Hang on.

525
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,480
If she insists that we're
her sisters, that means we're not.

526
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,110
- They're here.
- I just abandoned So Mi.

527
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,010
All right. We are...
You should say it with me.

528
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,810
- We are siblings.
- We are siblings.

529
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,660
Hang on. I just saw Yong Sun's eyes.

530
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,850
- No, I'm serious!
- Her glaring eyes.

531
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,350
Seriously, I'm your sister.

532
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,590
Look at her.

533
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,060
- She seems very excited.
- Hang on.

534
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,320
- This is strange.
- That's because I'm your sister.

535
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,470
- Hang on.
- Because it's true.

536
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,900
- This is crazy.
- We are...

537
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,970
- We are siblings.
- We are siblings.

538
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,030
Are we siblings?

539
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,180
- Please say that again.
- Should we say we're siblings?

540
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,180
Yes.

541
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,540
- We are siblings.
- We are siblings.

542
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,750
The three of you are...

543
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,840
(Their relationship is
finally being revealed.)

544
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,340
siblings.

545
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,650
- Really?
- Yes, we are!

546
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,750
(Solar is the first one
who met her siblings.)

547
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm your sister!

548
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,080
All right. I got you. Let's go home.

549
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,230
- Let's go.
- No. I'm not going home.

550
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,900
- You should graduate.
- I'm not going, sisters.

551
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,020
Come on.

552
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,430
- Ennik.
- Suk Jin.

553
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,760
- Where have you been?
- What took you so long?

554
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,830
- We are siblings.
- We are siblings.

555
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,560
The three of you are...

556
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,330
- siblings.
- Yes!

557
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,940
- She is our sister.
- Let's hurry.

558
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,070
- You are my sister.
- Yes, I am!

559
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,150
Let's go.

560
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,420
- Hello, Jae Suk.
- Young Ji.

561
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,810
(They have no time to waste.)

562
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,610
- It's nice to see you.
- Are you my sister?

563
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,310
Of course I am. Isn't it obvious?

564
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,960
I look like your sister.

565
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,080
You do?

566
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,080
- Young Ji!
- Yes?

567
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,350
Young Ji.

568
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,970
Young Ji.

569
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,730
Hey, Young Ji.

570
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,860
I've been looking for you.

571
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,440
Can I hold your hands once?

572
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,140
- Just once.
- Why are you...

573
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,640
- Are you sure?
- Let's do this.

574
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,800
You said Kwang Soo and I
were your brothers earlier.

575
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,300
- That's not true.
- You said that to me too.

576
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,770
No. Just hold my hands first.

577
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,040
- Did she say that to you too?
- I'm serious.

578
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,570
- Are you lying to me?
- Gosh, no.

579
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,810
Just hold my hands.

580
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,880
- Is she lying to me?
- We're siblings of the same blood.

581
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,490
- 1, 2, and 3.
- 1, 2, and 3.

582
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,610
- We are siblings.
- We are siblings.

583
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,660
The three of you are...

584
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,780
- not siblings.
- Darn it.

585
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,130
It's Haha.

586
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,550
- Darn it.
- It's Haha.

587
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,230
- Are you serious?
- Haha and Kwang Soo.

588
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,760
- Is that true?
- Haha and Kwang Soo, forever!

589
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,230
- I'm serious.
- Are you serious?

590
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,520
- I am.
- Can you swear?

591
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,670
- Is it true?
- Young Ji.

592
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,260
- Feeling! Cross!
- Intuition!

593
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,710
- Am I Intuition? All the sudden?
- Yes.

594
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,300
Young Ji! I can't believe this.
Hold on.

595
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,740
- We need Kwang Soo now.
- Hold on. Then I should...

596
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,210
We should hurry.

597
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,710
We need Kwang Soo.

598
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,100
- Okay. I'll call him.
- Where is he?

599
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,980
Come right away.
I just sent Jae Suk away.

600
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
(Kwang Soo gets a call from Haha.)

601
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,340
I'm on my way.

602
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,160
Jessi lied to you
to earn more points.

603
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,460
I should get going now.

604
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,960
Haha, this is a good chance
to run away from her.

605
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,520
I'll be right there.

606
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,160
(While Jessi talks to Jae Suk,
Kwang Soo tries to escape.)

607
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,130
(He gets in the van hurriedly.)

608
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,140
Lock the door!

609
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,240
Please start the car.
Don't open the door! Never!

610
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,980
Hey! What is she doing?

611
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,880
Call the police.

612
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,720
- Call the police now.
- Kwang Soo.

613
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,220
You are my brother! I told you.

614
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,310
No, I'm not.

615
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,720
I'm serious. Wait.

616
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,960
(Jessi never gives up.)

617
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,660
(She threatens her brother
knocking on the door.)

618
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,050
- You're not my sister.
- Hey, you're my brother.

619
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,430
- Come on out.
- Why are you being so scary?

620
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,430
- Come on out.
- That's not true.

621
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,640
- Kwang Soo.
- Why did you jump at the car?

622
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,900
- Just come on out.
- We are not siblings.

623
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,970
Yes, we are.

624
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,670
Get out.

625
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,940
Why is she being like this?

626
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,830
It's Jae Suk.

627
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,100
Hello?

628
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,420
- Why? You have to trust me.
- Please start the car.

629
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,480
I'm on my way.

630
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,990
- Hey!
- Hurry up.

631
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,780
I told you to come here.

632
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,920
(I finally escaped... What?)

633
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,550
You should hurry.

634
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,020
(Where are you going?)

635
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,590
Jessi was sticking to my car.

636
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,290
- You have to hurry.
- Come right away, Kwang Soo.

637
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,000
- Okay.
- Jae Suk just left.

638
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,300
I just started off
on the wrong foot.

639
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,640
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk
went to see Jessi.)

640
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,800
- My gosh.
- Hey, come on!

641
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,270
- It's Ho Hyun Ju.
- You have to hurry.

642
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,180
- I was...
- It's raining.

643
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,010
And call Se Chan.

644
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,420
Hello, Jae Suk.

645
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,950
Se Chan, hurry and come over.
I told you to hurry.

646
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,220
Jae Suk, I'm almost there.
I'm only 1km away.

647
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,580
- Are you sure I'm your brother?
- Definitely.

648
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,630
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

649
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,850
(Nino Maximus Keyser Soze)

650
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,090
(Sonador and Sparta)

651
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,000
(She tries to prove that she's
his sister singing his hit song.)

652
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,470
- I'm so touched.
- See? I'm your sister.

653
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,670
- Okay. I'll keep calling Kwang Soo.
- Thank you.

654
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,360
Hey, bro!

655
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,240
- Come on!
- Hurry. What took you so long?

656
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,300
What have you been doing?

657
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,380
Jessi, why did you lie to me?

658
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,680
We are...

659
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,220
(As soon as Se Chan arrives,
they ask about their siblinghood.)

660
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,040
- He's here.
- Hurry.

661
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,920
- Hurry and come on out.
- Hold my hand first.

662
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,220
Hold our hands.

663
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,780
- We are siblings.
- We are siblings.

664
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,430
(They don't even say hello.)

665
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,820
(The two families shouted it out
almost at the same time.)

666
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,590
The three of you are...

667
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,250
- siblings.
- Gosh.

668
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,590
- Hey, Jessi.
- See? Why did you not trust me?

669
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,000
- Earlier, you said...
- You three are siblings.

670
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,170
- Yes!
- I told you to hurry.

671
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,030
Why were you there
for such a long time?

672
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,210
- Nice to meet you.
- It was a long time.

673
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,030
- Let's go.
- Get in the car.

674
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,440
You are my sister.

675
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,680
Gosh, this is so fun.

676
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,600
- Why did you not trust me?
- We have to hurry.

677
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,920
We have to get there
as soon as possible.

678
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,150
I had no idea.

679
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,510
(Who is the first one to arrive
at the opening place?)

680
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,580
Gosh, Ho Hyun Ju.

681
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,010
It's good to see you again.

682
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,010
(It's good to see you again.)

683
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,130
(Jessi sounds cute
when she feels happy.)

684
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,320
You sound quite moody.

685
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,200
- I really like Jae Suk.
- You do?

686
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,060
He's like my real brother.

687
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,640
Anyway, don't look down
on Korean Americans.

688
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,940
When did I look down on them?

689
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,830
- I'd never do that.
- You know what? That day...

690
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,140
I respect them.

691
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,070
- When did I do that?
- You did look down on me that day.

692
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,910
- I was deeply hurt back then.
- Were you hurt?

693
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,250
I was also hurt because
I didn't understand your English.

694
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,110
- Why?
- I'm a native Korean,

695
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,770
and I was hurt.

696
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,490
- You looked down on me.
- You're lying.

697
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,540
No. Seriously,
you looked down on me.

698
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,250
- They are so funny.
- Whatever.

699
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,250
- Now that we're here...
- It is going to be a long day.

700
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,750
- I'm feeling dizzy already.
- I'm dizzy too.

701
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,960
In fact, the production crew
wouldn't let me team up with Haha.

702
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,970
- Kwang Soo and me.
- Because we're too good.

703
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,500
- I see.
- It's not fair.

704
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,030
- You two are too good together.
- We're just too good.

705
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,360
- So it's forbidden.
- Yes.

706
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,140
It's like a team
of Hulk Hogan and Warrior.

707
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,500
- Okay. I get it.
- You don't know them, do you?

708
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,650
Of course I don't know.

709
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,980
That's disappointing.
She's like a machine.

710
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,810
- She just answers.
- She's a machine.

711
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,510
- She's...
- That's true.

712
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,040
She's from a factory.

713
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,080
Young Ji, I think you got
yourself a perfect character.

714
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,660
It just suits you perfectly.
You're still a great musician.

715
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,930
You're like Lee Kwang Soo
in the world of rappers.

716
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,400
(She sounds hesitant and confused.)

717
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,710
She's been showing machinelike
reactions, but she just stopped it.

718
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,210
I'm honored.

719
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,800
He still wins awards as an actor.

720
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,650
That's nice.

721
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,770
- You didn't hear me, did you?
- No.

722
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,340
Jessi's team is around here.

723
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,650
Really?

724
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,580
- We have to run.
- Are they behind us?

725
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,610
(The team who finishes
in 3rd place gets 20 points.)

726
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,390
(The 4th place gets only 10 points.)

727
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,750
Please stop here.

728
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,820
(They start running immediately.)

729
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,590
Where is the flag?

730
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,130
Where is it?

731
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,060
(Young Ji's team finally arrives
at the opening place.)

732
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,210
Are we the last one to come?

733
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,970
- Are we the last?
- You're in fourth place.

734
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,070
- I told you to hurry.
- Are we in fourth place?

735
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,380
What's with your hair?

736
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,270
What's wrong with you?

737
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,880
- Kwang Soo.
- Are we in fourth place?

738
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,110
I can't believe this.

739
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,420
Like I said before,

740
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,810
you can get academic points
and audition points today.

741
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,920
You will get
academic points as a team.

742
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,430
The two teams
with the lowest academic points...

743
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,250
will get a penalty.

744
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,250
Isn't it just for the fourth?

745
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,630
Both the 3rd and 4th
will get a penalty.

746
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,760
And the youngest sisters will get
audition points as an individual.

747
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,240
The top two sisters
will get a prize.

748
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,740
And the one with the highest points
will be exempted from the penalty.

749
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,980
- Really?
- That's great.

750
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,240
- Wow.
- Okay.

751
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,680
Solar, Ji Hyo, and So Min
who arrived first get 40 points.

752
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,070
(Team Solar gets 40 points.)

753
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,380
- Wow, you liar!
- Yes.

754
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,150
What?

755
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,750
So Mi, Jong Kook, and Suk Jin
who came in second get 30 points.

756
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,660
- I'm envious.
- That's not bad.

757
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,930
You liar!

758
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,000
20 points
for Jessi, Jae Suk, and Se Chan.

759
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,930
- Come on!
- Come on!

760
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,730
And 10 points for Young Ji,
Haha, and Kwang Soo.

761
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,230
(4th place,
Team Young Ji, 10 points)

762
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,530
- Look at her.
- This is so upsetting.

763
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,440
- I thought Jessi was my sister.
- It's his fault.

764
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,600
And your sisters got...

765
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,770
audition points
according to the number of times...

766
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,600
- they fooled you.
- Okay.

767
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,070
Jessi fooled you twice,
so she got 20 points.

768
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,220
- What? Only twice?
- Yes.

769
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,720
That's not much. You'll see.

770
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,340
- Isn't it big?
- No. It's not a big number.

771
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,050
Solar got 10 points.

772
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,720
Solar lied only once?

773
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,730
So Mi got 30 points.

774
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,520
(So Mi got 30 audition points.)

775
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,850
(She fooled them 3 times?)

776
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,960
I helped her with it.

777
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,500
And Young Ji got 30 points.

778
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
- Okay!
- Okay!

779
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,790
- That's a lot.
- You did a good job.

780
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,140
It's all from me.

781
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,210
How did they get so many points?

782
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,500
Jessi, why did you send me away?

783
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,100
I didn't tell you to leave.

784
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,540
Hey.

785
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,950
They got together again.
It will be uproarious today.

786
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,310
They are so loud.

787
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,780
- Hey.
- He seems embarrassed.

788
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,040
It's loud already.

789
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,610
Come on.

790
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,050
Let me introduce
our guests one by one.

791
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,050
We have Solar here.

792
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,320
(Solar of MAMAMOO
with a delightful voice)

793
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,430
What's with your hair, by the way?

794
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,790
Are you shooting
a historical drama or something?

795
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,060
(Her hair is neatly combed
straight back in half.)

796
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,640
This is the real
Korean-American style.

797
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,910
(She pokes Jae Suk
with her fingernail.)

798
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,410
(It stings.)

799
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,030
This is the real
Korean-American style.

800
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,480
- Is it a Korean-American style?
- This is the Korean-American style.

801
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,040
- No.
- Yong Sun...

802
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,720
- is from Daejeon, I think.
- It's Korean-American style.

803
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,450
- I'm from Seoul.
- You're from Seoul?

804
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,540
Stop acting like a know-it-all.

805
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,990
Don't act like a know-it-all.

806
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,750
- Seoul.
- She's from Korea.

807
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,250
I'm sorry.

808
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,160
- But you look prettier like that.
- This is...

809
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,000
Be quiet. Come on.

810
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,820
I'm not going to talk anymore.

811
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,470
You still say
what's on your mind though.

812
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,670
- Right.
- This is nice.

813
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,900
You look so pretty.

814
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,330
- So pretty.
- I heard...

815
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,330
Solar's personal channel
for posting videos...

816
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,940
- has...
- She has a lot of subscribers.

817
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,140
2.25 million subscribers?

818
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,980
- Yes, I do.
- That's insane.

819
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,650
- That's incredible.
- She's a queen.

820
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,950
2.25 million subscribers?

821
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,150
That's incredible.

822
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,340
She's a queen.

823
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,990
What did you just do?

824
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,350
This is my signature greeting.

825
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,420
Can you do it for us?

826
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,050
<i>Sol, la, ti, do</i>

827
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,160
- <i>Sol, la, ti, do</i>
- How cute.

828
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,660
- <i>Sol, la, ti, do</i>
- <i>Sol, la, ti, do</i>

829
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,500
- My goodness.
- I guess that's necessary.

830
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,290
- Yes.
- It's a YouTube special.

831
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,030
I should start a channel too.

832
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,440
- You should.
- You could make a channel too.

833
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,700
- I'm going to.
- It will do well.

834
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,210
Let's do it.

835
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,940
- What was that?
- Hold on.

836
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,710
(He smashes down
with a fly swatter.)

837
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,450
There was a fly.

838
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,040
- Did I get it?
- Yes, you did.

839
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,310
- Was there really a fly?
- There was really a fly there.

840
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,450
- Did you get it?
- I did.

841
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,250
- I got it. Look.
- He really did.

842
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,540
- Here it is.
- Gosh.

843
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,310
(Catch and release)

844
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,010
(Flying away)

845
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,630
- It's still alive.
- Was there really a fly?

846
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,630
- There really was one.
- There was.

847
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,130
- Luckily, it survived.
- It did.

848
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,350
- It survived.
- Thank goodness.

849
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,520
I think you hit me a bit too hard.

850
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,820
- No.
- You were hitting the fly, right?

851
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,670
- That's how you kill a fly.
- Right?

852
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,830
It wouldn't die
if you hit it lightly.

853
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,640
The next person is Ennik.

854
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,260
Ennik.

855
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,530
Didn't you recently release
a new song, Ennik?

856
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,980
That's right. I released a new song.
It's coming out as a single.

857
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,220
You've returned with a single.
What's your song called?

858
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,750
"What You Waiting For".

859
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,990
- What are you waiting for?
- We should hear her new song.

860
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,990
- Let's see it.
- Let's see it.

861
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,890
Let's go!

862
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,050
(Very excited)

863
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,750
("What You Waiting For"
by Jeon So Mi)

864
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,790
Let's go, So Mi!

865
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,470
The song is so good!

866
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,860
- It's so good!
- They're all great dancers!

867
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,740
(It's a great combination of a fresh
melody and powerful choreography.)

868
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,830
(Is he cold?)

869
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,680
It's fast.

870
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,110
(It's hard to wait for
Jeon So Mi's charms.)

871
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,310
So Mi's "What You Waiting For".

872
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,840
Waiting for.

873
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,340
It was so good.

874
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,510
- "What You Waiting For".
- She's really good.

875
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,310
- It's okay.
- Come on.

876
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,320
- Let's go.
- This is not a competition.

877
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,250
- I know. This is not a competition.
- Yes. Okay.

878
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,290
- Let's go. Okay.
- Okay.

879
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,400
Jessi is coming out
with a new song too.

880
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,020
My album is coming out on the 30th.

881
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,140
- Your album is?
- Yes, my new album.

882
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,470
What's your song called?

883
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,100
"Nunu Nana".

884
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,440
- "Nunu Nana"?
- "Nunu Nana".

885
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,680
- "Nunu Nana".
- Let's hear Jessi's new song.

886
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,710
- Okay. Let's do it.
- "Nunu Nana".

887
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,830
- Let's go!
- We don't have expectations.

888
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,040
- "Nunu Nana".
- Please turn up the music.

889
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,650
Yes, Jessi!

890
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,950
("Nunu Nana" by Jessi)

891
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,310
(A groove full of vibes)

892
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,510
- "Nunu Nana".
- Aren't you doing this?

893
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,610
(She rushes towards Se Chan
all of a sudden.)

894
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,960
"Nunu Nana". Why are you
looking at me? Look at the cameras.

895
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
Hey, listen!

896
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,130
(She shows off her true swag
by turning her back to the cameras.)

897
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,750
- 1, 2...
- Look over there.

898
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,350
Why was she looking at me?

899
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,670
- That's right!
- Here we go.

900
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,530
(She flexes her coolness.)

901
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,140
This is so cool.

902
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,070
Put it up, put it up.

903
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,480
(It's a powerful groove
from the charismatic singer.)

904
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,750
(He's cold again.)

905
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,310
The song is good.

906
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,750
(She finishes with a spin.)

907
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,310
(She's not done yet.)

908
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,250
(My performance starts now.)

909
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,730
(Stop the music.)

910
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,550
(She ignores him and continues.)

911
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,320
How long is she going to
promote her song?

912
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,520
Nobody can stop her.

913
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
(In a trance)

914
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,630
- Enough.
- Cut!

915
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,500
- Cut!
- Cut!

916
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,830
- Cut!
- Cut "Nunu Nana".

917
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,860
Okay!

918
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,100
- Hey.
- Hey!

919
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,330
- Hold on.
- That was amazing.

920
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,830
They told me to do it
for one minute.

921
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,740
- No. It was 30 seconds.
- It was good.

922
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,950
Why is everyone so scared of her?

923
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,220
- I purposely went to Se Chan.
- Why?

924
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,110
- I know why.
- In the lyrics...

925
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,510
Every time she forgot
the lyrics, she turned around.

926
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,540
No.

927
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,420
- It's true. You didn't sing...
- That's not true.

928
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,690
- until you remembered the lyrics.
- That's not true.

929
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,250
There is no choreography here.

930
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,580
But here, I sing,

931
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,820
<i>What did you say?
What are you saying?</i>

932
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,970
Okay. That was "Nunu Nana".

933
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,970
- Come on.
- Come on.

934
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,670
- Wow.
- It's okay.

935
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,470
Come on. Wait.

936
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,410
You're the youngest
of three siblings?

937
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,500
You have two older brothers?

938
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,710
- Yes. I have two older brothers.
- This is exactly the same then.

939
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,030
- It's exactly like that right now.
- Right.

940
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,570
But my brothers aren't like them.

941
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,250
What do your brothers
do for a living?

942
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,840
- One of them...
- Your oldest brother.

943
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,450
This is my first time hearing this.

944
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,310
- One of them...
- It's interesting.

945
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,490
- What does one of them do?
- One of them...

946
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,520
I'm not really sure what he does.

947
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,160
- Is he unemployed?
- No.

948
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,320
- He's not unemployed.
- It's okay if he is.

949
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
- No.
- Are you not in touch with him?

950
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,290
He's an entrepreneur.
He does a lot of different things.

951
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,290
He does various things.

952
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,730
My other brother works at the top
for Samsung.

953
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,030
He works at the top?

954
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,830
He works for Samsung in the US.

955
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,940
- Semiconductors?
- At the top?

956
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,440
- Does he have a high position?
- He works in finance there.

957
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,140
- Semiconductors?
- Semiconductors?

958
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,330
I couldn't remember what it was.

959
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,100
- I got confused.
- Was that supposed to be English?

960
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,710
- Semiconductors.
- Semiconductors.

961
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,570
He works for a big company.

962
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,720
Do your brothers worry about you...

963
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,610
working here in Korea?

964
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,690
No.

965
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,850
They raised me to be strong
ever since I was young.

966
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,960
- I could tell.
- Ever since I was young,

967
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,050
they told me I would do well
and that they weren't worried.

968
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,400
What did they see in you?

969
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,730
What do you mean by that?

970
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,790
(She has a straight face.)

971
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,830
Don't get so upset.

972
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,240
- Can't I ask you a question?
- Don't look down on her.

973
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,330
I can ask, can't I?

974
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,760
Don't look down on Korean-Americans.

975
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,300
- When did I look down on her?
- Hey!

976
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,480
Why do you think they said that?

977
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,710
- I was asking a serious question.
- Don't look down on her.

978
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,250
I don't. Don't worry.

979
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,420
- Okay.
- It's been a while,

980
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,110
- but we are...
- Is this how it's ending?

981
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,540
Yes.

982
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,550
This is enough.

983
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,990
- So I guess if you get serious,
- Jessi, that's enough.

984
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,350
- it ends like this.
- No.

985
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,090
I'm sorry, but I'm getting exhausted
just watching you guys.

986
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,730
- I'm exhausted too.
- My stomach hurts.

987
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,860
- I'm getting dizzy.
- Me too.

988
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,740
- "Nunu Nana".
- Why are you dizzy?

989
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,830
There isn't enough oxygen.

990
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,940
Okay. The next guest is
Lee Young Ji.

991
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,740
Lee Young Ji!

992
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,740
Nice to meet you all.

993
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,600
You may all know Young Ji
from "High School Rapper".

994
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,040
Yes.

995
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,310
- First...
- She's going to tear up the stage.

996
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,340
She's really amazing.

997
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,890
Since Young Ji has joined us,

998
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,660
we would love to hear you rap.

999
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,460
- Let's see it.
- Our eardrums are in for a treat.

1000
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,320
("I Am Lee Young Ji"
by Lee Young Ji)

1001
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,090
(It's amazing from the start.)

1002
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,240
(Is he shadow boxing?)

1003
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,940
(They regrouped as Z-KIRI.)

1004
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,880
(Her rap makes everyone groove
from side to side.)

1005
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,710
(I'm Lee Young Ji!)

1006
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,280
Young Ji!

1007
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,010
(Exclaiming)

1008
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,280
She's good.

1009
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,980
(Young Ji's rap cleaned
our eardrums.)

1010
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,920
The younger kids are really good.

1011
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,030
- They're good.
- They are.

1012
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,960
- Her style is different from Jessi.
- So Mi...

1013
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,730
and Young Ji are the only ones
born in the 21st century.

1014
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,730
- 21st century.
- That's right.

1015
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,500
We're a new generation.
We're Generation Z.

1016
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,130
- You're Generation Z?
- I'm Generation X.

1017
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,340
- I'm Generation X.
- No, you're not.

1018
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,730
- No, you're not.
- I am.

1019
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,030
How are you Generation X?

1020
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,110
I'm Generation X.

1021
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,880
- You're Generation 50.
- You're from the Joseon era.

1022
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,380
- Generation 50? You punk.
- Yes.

1023
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,510
You're from the generation
of acoustic guitars.

1024
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,510
Yes, you are.

1025
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,940
- C'est Si Bon.
- C'est Si Bon.

1026
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,610
- C'est Si Bon.
- You are.

1027
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,510
- C'est Si Bon.
- You grew up in that era.

1028
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,650
I'm Generation X.
You and I are Generation X.

1029
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,760
No. Generation X is...

1030
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,860
- C'est Si Bon.
- C'est Si Bon.

1031
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,860
(A, B, C, D, E, F, G)

1032
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,760
(He calls upon Song Chang Sik,
a member of C'est Si Bon.)

1033
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,530
It suits him.

1034
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,630
(He sings the best hit
from his era.)

1035
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,530
- This is it.
- He made it work.

1036
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:10,730
(He made everyone laugh.)

1037
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,510
Why do I know all the lyrics?

1038
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,300
Only the people who know
Song Chang Sik's song...

1039
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,780
laughed at this.

1040
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,050
- I know.
- Right.

1041
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,750
- They don't know the song.
- Everyone.

1042
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,480
You guys got academic points
by finding your sisters.

1043
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,210
The scores haven't been added
to your team's score.

1044
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,650
We're going to have a time
called Sister's Room...

1045
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,960
with the points you gained
after every mission ends.

1046
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,300
What's Sister's Room?

1047
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,130
During every time we have
Sister's Room, the sisters will...

1048
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,820
go into their classrooms...

1049
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,730
and have a choice to either...

1050
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,840
answer an essay question...

1051
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,210
or film an audition tape.

1052
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,340
If the little sister decides
to answer the essay question,

1053
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,170
the points they will get will be
added to your academic points.

1054
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,570
However, if she chooses
to film an audition tape,

1055
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,610
then the points will go to her
audition points.

1056
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,690
If the older siblings
don't trust their younger sister,

1057
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,420
you can open the classroom door
and go in to find out.

1058
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,460
We can find out if they're answering
the question or filming an audition.

1059
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,920
If they're filming an audition tape,

1060
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,500
the points received will go to the
team as academic points.

1061
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,570
(They will get academic points
for catching her filming.)

1062
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,630
But if they were answering
the essay question,

1063
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,880
you will lose all the points
you have gotten.

1064
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,980
You have to be smart.
We need to work well together.

1065
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,110
(The Possibilities
for Sister's Room)

1066
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,250
(Trust, Find Out)

1067
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,550
(The team's point changes depending
on whether or not you trust her.)

1068
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,940
- This is insane.
- You have to use your wits.

1069
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,750
If you trust
your little sister later,

1070
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,860
go to the place where you leave
your stamp on the classroom door...

1071
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,420
and mark it with a good job stamp...

1072
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,590
- and come back.
- Look at her.

1073
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,480
If you don't trust her,
you can open the door.

1074
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,190
You're a broadcasting machine.

1075
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,190
The little sisters will go to
their classrooms.

1076
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,500
Are we starting right away?

1077
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,340
Do I have to do this for my team
or for myself?

1078
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,670
We are a family.

1079
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,730
We're a family, so my happiness
is your happiness.

1080
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,940
Don't you agree?

1081
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,900
My brothers... What should I do?

1082
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,980
(All the sisters
have entered their rooms.)

1083
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,320
Shall we go?

1084
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,710
- Yes.
- Let's go together.

1085
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,860
I can't figure out
what Young Ji is going to do.

1086
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,420
(They have arrived in front of their
sister's rooms with headphones on.)

1087
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,400
(What is Jessi doing?)

1088
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,820
(Ho Hyun Ju's room)

1089
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,760
(Is Jessi answering
the essay question?)

1090
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,630
(Or is she filming
an audition tape?)

1091
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,610
Jong Kook, this is So Mi's room.

1092
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,440
(What did So Mi
finally decide to do?)

1093
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,900
Can we open it now?

1094
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,920
Yes, you can.

1095
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,380
(Their siblings plan
outside their doors.)

1096
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,250
Jessi won't be bothered
to film an audition tape.

1097
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,110
I doubt she'll film one.

1098
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,420
(They decide to trust her.)

1099
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,920
(If she's answering the question,
they'll receive 30 academic points.)

1100
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,420
My brothers
put their trust in me, right?

1101
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,920
(She's answering
the essay question.)

1102
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,670
(Team Jessi receives
30 academic points.)

1103
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,090
Do we trust her?

1104
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,230
(So Min and Ji Hyo
trust their sister too.)

1105
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,400
They decided to trust her.

1106
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,210
I think my sisters will trust me.

1107
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,710
The other two teams
trusted their sisters.

1108
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,210
They showed their trust.

1109
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,250
- Really? Who?
- Let's enter the room.

1110
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,380
- Did you also?
- Not yet.

1111
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,440
Are you going to enter the room?

1112
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,090
(Nodding)

1113
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,480
Let's do this.

1114
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,860
(They don't hesitate
to choose to enter.)

1115
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,690
(If Young Ji
is answering the question,)

1116
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,480
(they'll lose all their points.)

1117
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,980
(If she's filming
the audition tape,)

1118
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,500
(they'll receive
all the academic points.)

1119
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,050
(She was filming the audition tape!)

1120
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,130
What did I tell you?

1121
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,590
(She was busy
filming herself when...)

1122
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,400
(She puts on a straight face.)

1123
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,800
(I can't believe
you didn't trust me!)

1124
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
I knew it.

1125
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,530
Of course, I'm right.

1126
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,570
- Young Ji!
- What did I tell you?

1127
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,780
Why didn't you trust me?

1128
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,300
- You're seriously asking that?
- We knew this would happen.

1129
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,750
- Right? See.
- She was filming.

1130
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,650
- See? She was filming a video.
- I knew it.

1131
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,150
I thought you'd trust me.

1132
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,150
I was wondering
whether you'd come in or not.

1133
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,650
- I knew it.
- That's what I was wondering.

1134
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,820
- We knew it.
- It's over now.

1135
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,420
- Our team is done for.
- Nice!

1136
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,820
There's no trust between us at all.

1137
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,190
But I want to be an idol singer.

1138
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,900
But you should study, Young Ji.

1139
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,230
The essay question
should come first.

1140
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,570
Let's barge in there.
I bet she's filming.

1141
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,340
Shall we?

1142
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,710
(Suk Jin and Jong Kook
decided to barge in too.)

1143
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,170
(Will So Mi be filming
just as they suspect?)

1144
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,650
See?

1145
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,440
What did I tell you?

1146
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,920
(She was filming just like
her days on "Produce 101".)

1147
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,380
See? I knew it.

1148
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,050
- Right?
- Good thinking.

1149
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,780
So Mi, really?

1150
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,260
- Right off the bat?
- Why did you come in?

1151
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,860
I thought you'd at least study
in the first round.

1152
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,860
Right? We made the right decision.

1153
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,230
My brothers are like real parents.

1154
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,940
I can't believe all their nagging.

1155
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,170
(The first round
of Sister's Room is over.)

1156
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,670
(Current points)

1157
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,750
(Where the first game
awaits the members)

1158
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,780
(Three chairs...)

1159
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,250
(and six water balloons?)

1160
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,610
Everyone,

1161
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,420
I hope you're fond of your siblings.

1162
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,750
- Sure.
- Yes, of course.

1163
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,880
- We're the perfect family.
- I'm loving my siblings.

1164
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,820
- I finally met my family.
- Me too.

1165
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,760
What does that matter anyway?

1166
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,260
Is there no bond?

1167
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,760
Come on.

1168
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,030
The first game...

1169
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,860
will allow you to show
your brotherly and sisterly love...

1170
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,420
by asking for phrases
you want to hear.

1171
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,070
The game is Just Say Anything.

1172
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,190
- I love it.
- Just Say Anything?

1173
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,110
- Just Say Anything.
- Hold on a second.

1174
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,280
Bo Pil, wait a second.

1175
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,610
I bet you came up with this game...

1176
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,670
- to make us lose.
- He's right.

1177
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,440
- Be honest with us.
- It's because she lived abroad.

1178
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,610
- Be honest with me.
- You're targeting her, aren't you?

1179
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,070
You know that Jessi's bad
at games like this.

1180
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,710
Of course, he does.

1181
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,880
- It's why we're playing it.
- Okay.

1182
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,960
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1183
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,150
- Unbelievable.
- They'll have a lot of screen time.

1184
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,860
- Okay.
- They'll steal the attention today.

1185
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,090
Jae Suk, wait.

1186
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,000
- Suk Jin's jealous.
- Why?

1187
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,400
He's jealous of you
getting all the attention.

1188
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,800
You can't speak Korean well, right?

1189
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,570
- He's jealous?
- I don't speak Korean.

1190
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,130
- Yes.
- No.

1191
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,840
- You don't speak Korean?
- I don't speak Korean.

1192
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,300
So the little sister...

1193
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,840
will sit under the water balloons...

1194
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,050
with a phrase on her forehead.

1195
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,150
She must guess correctly
what her siblings describe.

1196
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,610
- This will be fun.
- Every 10 seconds though,

1197
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,090
someone from another team
will remove one of the sticks.

1198
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,090
- What?
- Every 10 seconds?

1199
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,190
Time is of the essence then.

1200
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,960
You fail if the balloons all fall
before you answer correctly.

1201
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,860
The remaining number of balloons
will be converted to points.

1202
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,000
- I'm the one answering?
- That's right.

1203
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,030
Let's do this.

1204
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,260
- Let's see who goes first.
- What's this?

1205
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,440
Why?

1206
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
- What?
- Why?

1207
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,110
- Jae Suk, are you kidding me?
- What?

1208
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,110
We're going first?

1209
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,940
I need to watch
other teams play first.

1210
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,010
- But...
- Guys.

1211
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,250
Guys, let's begin with a laugh.

1212
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,510
(Guys, let's begin with a laugh.)

1213
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,250
We know who'll come last.

1214
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,320
Can I ask for a favor?
Since I'm going first,

1215
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,010
let us do a practice run.

1216
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,760
- No way.
- We'll just go ahead.

1217
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,860
- No.
- How about an example?

1218
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,860
Come on!

1219
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,860
- Is it a difficult one to guess?
- No.

1220
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,900
(They calm her down
in order to begin the game.)

1221
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,090
Am I the one guessing the answer?

1222
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,460
Is it difficult?

1223
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,070
- It's super difficult.
- It's difficult.

1224
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,690
Do I know these Korean words?

1225
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,690
- Yes, of course.
- They wouldn't be that cruel.

1226
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,210
- I know these words?
- Yes.

1227
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,260
- We'll describe the situation.
- You know these words.

1228
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,360
- Hold on.
- You have to do a good job.

1229
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,510
Just do it already!

1230
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,380
- Let's just begin the game.
- Begin the game!

1231
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,400
(They protest
that they begin the game.)

1232
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,170
Oh, my gosh!

1233
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,610
Ready, set, go.

1234
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,420
So this is said...

1235
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,480
to immature...

1236
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,460
- Brothers or sisters.
- Yes, brothers or sisters.

1237
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,650
We say this to them.

1238
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,920
- What would you say?
- When they act foolishly.

1239
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,500
- "Gosh..."
- "Gosh..."

1240
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,400
"Gosh, you stupid cow."

1241
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,070
"Gosh, you stupid cow"?

1242
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,460
No, no one curses.

1243
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,170
There are no curse words.

1244
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,570
- Then...
- Jessi, listen up.

1245
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,610
Hold on a second.

1246
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,800
You need to make it easier for me.

1247
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,510
Did you purposely pull the one
that would let a balloon fall?

1248
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,280
- Darn you.
- No, of course not!

1249
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,530
- That's not true.
- Jessi, don't swear.

1250
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:28,900
- How could I...
- Jessi, come on.

1251
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,480
- The clock is ticking.
- Calm down.

1252
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,440
- Okay?
- Kwang Soo, pull out another one.

1253
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,320
That's a lot of water
for just one balloon.

1254
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
It's all right.

1255
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,210
- He got it.
- Did you just poke at it?

1256
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,420
(Video referee)

1257
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,530
(Poke!)

1258
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,780
- Did you just poke at it?
- Seriously?

1259
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,150
- Hey!
- That wasn't my intention.

1260
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,730
- I'm sorry, Jessi.
- You poked it.

1261
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,030
- No, I didn't.
- Hey.

1262
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,090
- You popped it.
- No, not on purpose.

1263
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,500
- Time out.
- Jessi, I'm sorry.

1264
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,590
He popped it deliberately.

1265
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,260
- I can't believe him.
- I swear.

1266
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,570
You're out.

1267
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,440
- What did he do?
- Ji Hyo,

1268
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,480
- you do it.
- Why would you play dirty?

1269
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,650
- But...
- Ji Hyo, you can do it.

1270
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,800
Sure thing.

1271
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,010
Jessi?

1272
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,320
Jessi, you need to
answer this quickly.

1273
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,480
- Jessi.
- Calm down.

1274
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,820
I'm 35, right?

1275
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,690
Someone two years older than you...

1276
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,480
is acting like a child.

1277
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,780
What would you say
in that situation?

1278
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,820
How would you mention
one's older age?

1279
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,190
I don't know.

1280
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,800
What do we do with food?

1281
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,590
- With our mouths...
- That's right.

1282
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,360
- Yes, keep going with that.
- Add on.

1283
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,340
"Shut it!"

1284
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,460
Why on earth
would that be the answer?

1285
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,710
- Calm down.
- That's what you came up with?

1286
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,980
Calm down. Come on, Jessi.

1287
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,070
What do you call
the length of time we've existed?

1288
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,340
- The length of time.
- That's right.

1289
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,050
- What do you mean?
- What's the word for that?

1290
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,070
Wordy?

1291
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,780
We go from 1, 2, 3...

1292
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,710
- What do you call that?
- Age!

1293
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,860
- Yes, that's right.
- All right, good! So I'm...

1294
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,690
- two years older than you.
- That's right.

1295
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,530
- "Gosh, he's..."
- "Gosh, that..."

1296
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,300
- "Age..."
- Yes?

1297
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,230
- "Age..."
- Yes?

1298
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,420
- "Age..."
- She's getting there.

1299
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,690
- "Age..."
- What about it?

1300
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,340
- Jessi, you're almost there.
- I'm almost out of sticks.

1301
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,340
- I cleared most of them.
- Your time is almost up.

1302
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,400
The answer is right in front of you.

1303
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,860
The food...

1304
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,840
- What do you do with it?
- What do you do?

1305
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,610
- You eat it.
- Exactly!

1306
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,480
- Age.
- Yes.

1307
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,670
- Eat.
- Yes!

1308
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,150
(You aged but didn't grow up)

1309
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,090
(She's not going
in the right direction.)

1310
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,090
Why are they saying
that she's on the right track?

1311
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,610
- She's right.
- So the age...

1312
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,650
- You're only confusing her.
- So the age...

1313
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,860
- She's not on the right track.
- So what we eat...

1314
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,400
- Tell me what comes next.
- Okay.

1315
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,150
What do we call
the next location we go to?

1316
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,400
- How do we say it?
- They'll all drop at once.

1317
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,070
- The next location...
- They'll drop at once.

1318
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,900
- I know.
- When we move locations...

1319
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,090
Hold on a second.

1320
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,630
- You're almost there.
- What comes next?

1321
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,900
- What do we say...
- What comes next?

1322
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,010
when we need to
go to a new location?

1323
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,340
"Go!"

1324
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,840
"Grow up and leave."

1325
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,900
No, that's not it.

1326
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,170
- You're almost there.
- You are.

1327
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,420
You almost got it.

1328
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,610
When we're on the move...

1329
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,690
- It's over for you guys.
- What do we say to the taxi driver?

1330
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,260
- Just say anything.
- Shoot at random answers.

1331
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,690
What's the relative pronoun we use?

1332
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,730
(They're in their final moments.)

1333
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,900
- Your older brother...
- "Where."

1334
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,320
When he acts silly...

1335
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,070
(Welcome to the water park!)

1336
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,070
(The water balloons fall
like a stack of dominoes.)

1337
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,860
Your older brother
is being immature!

1338
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,170
What's the answer?

1339
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,570
(What's the answer?)

1340
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,610
"Age..." What?

1341
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,210
You can't just read it!

1342
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,010
She still doesn't know
what it means though.

1343
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,300
"You aged but didn't grow up."

1344
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,210
She doesn't know
what that phrase means.

1345
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,820
- It's too difficult for Jessi.
- She doesn't know what it is.

1346
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,010
I've never heard
of this phrase before.

1347
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,110
It's too difficult for Jessi.

1348
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:25,690
What's this about one's age?

1349
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,760
What does it mean?

1350
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,320
- I bet Solar will do well.
- Look.

1351
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,420
(Next up is Team Solar.)

1352
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,900
This is something many of us say.

1353
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,550
- It could be easy.
- It's not a bad one.

1354
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,630
- Ready, set, go.
- I didn't get mine.

1355
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,360
(Don't you dare tell people
that we're related!)

1356
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,530
If only this was our phrase.

1357
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,230
You and your terrible memory.

1358
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,710
Solar, keep watching.

1359
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,630
Can't you at least
shower more often?

1360
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:44,900
- "Dirty!"
- You embarrass me.

1361
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,710
No, that's not it. My friends...

1362
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,380
(Screaming)

1363
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,980
(She flutters her arms
after getting splashed.)

1364
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,150
What was that?

1365
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:53,780
It was only a splash of water.

1366
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,710
- What's up with you?
- It wasn't a bug, you know.

1367
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,250
- I was completely shocked.
- It startled me.

1368
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,280
What on earth was that?

1369
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,210
- This is quite scary.
- It's all right.

1370
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,820
It's not like the water's hot.

1371
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,730
- Yong Sun, calm down.
- What's up with her?

1372
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,800
How is that scary?

1373
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,230
Let's try this again.

1374
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,090
Watch me, okay? You...

1375
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,960
- You...
- "What do you think you're doing?"

1376
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,300
- "Do you have a death wish?"
- One's scolding the other.

1377
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,610
- These days...
- "Don't you dare..."

1378
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,210
(Screaming)

1379
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,800
- What on earth...
- I'm only removing the sticks.

1380
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,340
I'm not spraying the water on you.

1381
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,570
All I'm doing
is removing the sticks.

1382
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,340
It's just...

1383
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,380
You're almost there.

1384
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,050
"That we're sisters..."

1385
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,050
- You're almost there.
- Stay put, Jessi.

1386
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,690
- Do better when it's our turn.
- So Min...

1387
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,530
(Startled)

1388
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,190
(Every time, she responds
with a high-pitched scream.)

1389
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,960
Look at her.

1390
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,500
You and your reactions.
Please take your seat.

1391
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,030
- She's hilarious.
- You're almost there.

1392
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,130
- She's great.
- I love her reactions.

1393
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,110
No wonder her online channel
is a hit.

1394
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,300
- We should take notes.
- She's doing an amazing job.

1395
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,650
- You...
- I know!

1396
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,800
"How dare you talk back to me."

1397
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,420
- No.
- But it's similar.

1398
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,610
- You're almost there.
- It's similar.

1399
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:00,610
(I know!)

1400
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:01,690
Goodness.

1401
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,690
(She smashes into
the case of water balloons.)

1402
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,480
- Solar, stay calm.
- What's wrong with you?

1403
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,150
Please stay seated.

1404
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,860
"Don't you dare say
that we're related!"

1405
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,320
It's similar. You're almost there.

1406
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,960
- "Don't you dare..."
- You're younger, right?

1407
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,900
"Don't you dare..." Hey!

1408
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,260
(Screaming)

1409
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,260
(Instead of the answer,
she lets out a high-pitched scream.)

1410
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:25,900
- What's wrong with her?
- Hey.

1411
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,800
- Why is Yong Sun...
- It's water, not a bug.

1412
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,170
Oh, my. That's awesome.

1413
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,320
- She's good at reacting.
- Indeed.

1414
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,110
- Have a seat. Sit here.
- Yong Sun.

1415
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,820
- I'm the younger sister.
- Use a different word for "say".

1416
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,820
Yong Sun.

1417
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,150
- So my older sister...
- Oh, I know.

1418
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,090
"Don't you dare tell people
that I'm your sister."

1419
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,920
- But I'm the younger sister, so...
- Correct.

1420
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,280
We'll accept that
as a correct answer.

1421
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,530
(Team Solar got the right answer
with three balloons left.)

1422
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,760
- Great job, Yong Sun.
- Good job.

1423
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,090
"Don't you dare tell people..."

1424
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,860
- You did well.
- Yong Sun is good at reacting.

1425
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,030
That was awesome.

1426
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,300
I'm a fan of Yong Sun's as of today.

1427
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,030
I'm a huge fan.

1428
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,070
(Her funny reaction made him a fan.)

1429
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,360
- Jae Suk.
- Yong Sun was...

1430
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,780
Is it over?

1431
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,780
Everyone, if one of the siblings
succeeds,

1432
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,670
- the team wins additional points.
- We'll do it.

1433
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,250
- Let's go for it.
- Of course, we'll do it.

1434
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,150
- We'll do it.
- No matter what.

1435
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,050
- Everyone, let's begin.
- Okay.

1436
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:12,380
Look. Okay. Good.

1437
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,480
- Right.
- I guess it's an easy one.

1438
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
- No, no.
- That's also easy.

1439
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,630
- Ready. Go.
- Oh, I see.

1440
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,900
It's not hard, right?

1441
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,230
- It's short, right?
- Okay.

1442
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,530
- A short word?
- Let's explain it to him.

1443
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,230
- Ready. Go.
- Is it a short word?

1444
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,500
- Jae Suk.
- What is he doing?

1445
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,500
- What?
- It's hard to pull out.

1446
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,860
- It's hard to pull out.
- It's true. It's hard to pull out.

1447
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,960
- All right.
- It's true. It's hard to pull out.

1448
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,280
- "Horse"?
- Yes.

1449
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,280
- "Hey, you..."
- "Listen to me."

1450
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,840
- It's close.
- "How dare you talk..."

1451
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,280
- Oh, no. I...
- What?

1452
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,320
He said the exact word again.

1453
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,840
- "How dare you..."
- "How dare you talk back?"

1454
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,920
Good. But...

1455
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,980
- What sound is this?
- "How dare you talk back to me..."

1456
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,380
Yes! He got the right answer.

1457
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,610
What sound is this?

1458
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,520
(Jae Suk pulled out
the sticks powerfully.)

1459
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,210
(What?)

1460
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,480
- "How dare you..."
- Yes! He got the right answer.

1461
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,110
"How dare you... How dare you..."

1462
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,190
"How dare you talk back to me
every time I talk to you?"

1463
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:10,190
(Correct)

1464
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,230
(Jae Suk pulls out more sticks
pretending he didn't hear it.)

1465
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:14,530
- You saw that, right?
- "How dare you..."

1466
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,070
(He can't do that.)

1467
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,070
- But Haha said, "talk".
- Yes, he did.

1468
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,630
- True.
- He gave him a word.

1469
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,630
It was a mistake.

1470
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,800
Give us another chance.

1471
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,030
- Try it again.
- Forget this round.

1472
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,270
- It doesn't count.
- Exactly.

1473
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,530
(They're asking to let us
start over?)

1474
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,710
What are you talking about?

1475
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,730
What's wrong?

1476
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,480
- I said the word.
- He said, "talk".

1477
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,840
(It was a little helpful, but...)

1478
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,750
- Start over.
- Even my underwear is wet now.

1479
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,110
- Kwang Soo, you did well.
- How about we deduct a point?

1480
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,170
You did well, Kwang Soo.

1481
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,710
Kwang Soo did a good job.

1482
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,440
- He got the answer quickly.
- He did a great job.

1483
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,480
(Team Young Ji got the right answer
with three balloons left.)

1484
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,420
You thought of it
when you pulled it out, right?

1485
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,150
It's okay.

1486
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,420
- That was cool.
- It's So Min.

1487
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,800
- So Min...
- Kwang Soo will do it, then.

1488
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,090
Kwang Soo should do it for So Min.

1489
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,130
- Enjoy it.
- Kwang Soo.

1490
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,400
- It's showtime.
- It's okay.

1491
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,670
If you think about
the previous questions...

1492
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:54,670
(Kwang Soo.)

1493
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:55,940
Look at him.

1494
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,340
Oh, my.

1495
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,440
Look at Kwang Soo.

1496
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,440
(Everyone is
surprised by Kwang Soo?)

1497
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,840
(He brought a whole bucket
of water balloons.)

1498
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,210
- Turn around.
- Look at that.

1499
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,840
I brought them for the next round.

1500
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,840
(Lying)

1501
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,650
- Seriously. He's so mean.
- I just...

1502
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,550
- brought them for the next round.
- I'm so excited about this sitcom.

1503
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,550
I'm so excited.

1504
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,960
So Min, I'm sure you expected that.

1505
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,480
- This is...
- I'm so excited about this.

1506
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,280
Look at that.

1507
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,690
(He's bringing drinking water.)

1508
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:19,750
Look at that.

1509
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,820
(He's stacking up materials
to do a bad thing.)

1510
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,090
- My goodness. This is...
- Kwang Soo.

1511
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,730
I'm looking forward to it.

1512
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,000
This will be a great comedy skit.

1513
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,440
(Sister, have you lost your mind?)

1514
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,000
- That's easy.
- That's easy.

1515
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,300
- Ready. Go.
- It's too easy.

1516
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,280
- "What is wrong with you?"
- "Who are you?"

1517
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,800
"What is wrong with you?"

1518
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,280
"Is something wrong with this?"

1519
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,250
- "Hey."
- "Are you out of your mind?"

1520
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,610
Yes! But...

1521
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,920
What?

1522
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,750
(Kwang Soo dropped
a lot of water balloons.)

1523
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:49,780
What?

1524
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,880
(Falling down)

1525
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,900
What?

1526
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,800
I didn't...

1527
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,800
(The new technique to pop balloons
without pulling a stick out)

1528
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,960
- Listen. I didn't...
- What was that?

1529
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,300
- I didn't do anything.
- He didn't do anything.

1530
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,270
- He didn't even pull a stick out.
- I didn't do anything.

1531
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,570
- He didn't do anything.
- I really didn't do anything.

1532
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:03,030
- It's close, but...
- "You're out of your mind."

1533
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,900
No. Who am I to you?

1534
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,670
- Who am I to her?
- Sister.

1535
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,380
- "Sister, are you insane?"
- That's close.

1536
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,710
You know, the right mind...

1537
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:11,750
(Kwang Soo won't stop
dropping water balloons.)

1538
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,780
I didn't mean to...

1539
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,170
- "Are you out of your mind?"
- No.

1540
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:16,090
- When you...
- You're running out of time.

1541
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:17,710
"Sister..."

1542
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,020
(Hitting)

1543
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,050
(So Min threw a water balloon
at him.)

1544
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,090
I didn't mean to do that.

1545
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,030
It wasn't my intention.

1546
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,090
(Pouring water)

1547
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,770
(Water balloon war)

1548
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,530
- My goodness.
- "Sister..."

1549
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,230
- Here they go again.
- "Sister..."

1550
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,630
"Sister, are you out of your mind?"

1551
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:36,360
"Are you in your right mind?"

1552
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,460
It's close.

1553
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,230
(He poured the whole bucket.)

1554
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,280
It's close.

1555
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,500
(The audience is fully satisfied.)

1556
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,210
- "Sister..."
- What is wrong with you two?

1557
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,780
(They're too immature
for people with a younger sibling.)

1558
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,550
- Pull another one out.
- What is wrong with you?

1559
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:52,960
- Try a different verb.
- A verb?

1560
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,980
Yes, a verb.

1561
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,480
When you... How should I put it?

1562
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,690
- "Have you lost your mind?"
- Correct.

1563
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,380
- "Sister, have you lost your mind?"
- Yes!

1564
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,030
Good job.

1565
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,590
(Team Solar got the right answer.)

1566
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,360
- She succeeded quickly.
- I expected it, but...

1567
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,420
(The battlefield is
a complete mess.)

1568
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,400
- Gosh. Although I expected that...
- I have a question.

1569
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,170
Is the penalty worse than this?

1570
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,270
- Or is this worse?
- My gosh.

1571
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,960
They say this is worse than
the penalty.

1572
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,030
The penalty is worse than this?

1573
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,340
- No.
- This is worse than the penalty.

1574
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,750
What is wrong with you guys?

1575
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,940
So, this is it.

1576
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:22,480
We tallied the points including
the ones from the additional rounds.

1577
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,050
- Please.
- The first place team is...

1578
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,110
(The first place team)

1579
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,750
Ji Hyo, So Min, and Solar.

1580
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,050
- The team gained 50 points.
- We did well.

1581
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,780
- We did great.
- Team So Mi, 2nd place, 40 points.

1582
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
- Team Young Ji, 3rd, 30 points.
- Okay.

1583
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,630
- Why are we in last place again?
- Team Jessi gained 20 points.

1584
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,460
- I thought we'd be in second place.
- I'm not happy with the result.

1585
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,170
Now, we'll begin the second round
of Sister's Room.

1586
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,770
- A lot of points are at stake.
- According to your scores,

1587
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,440
you will also be given lunch.

1588
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,500
Jessi, we're going to open the door.

1589
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,280
- We'll open the door this time.
- We'll open the door.

1590
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,750
- What will you do again?
- We'll open the door.

1591
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,880
Trust me.

1592
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,710
- Will you take the test?
- Loyalty.

1593
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,420
To get more points,

1594
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,480
the only way is not opening the door
while you're taking the test.

1595
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,110
- If you want to win.
- Okay. Then don't open it.

1596
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,750
- Trust me.
- We won't.

1597
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,820
- Trust me.
- Because...

1598
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,420
- 1, 2, 3. Go, Team!
- Go, Team!

1599
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,050
- We won't open the door.
- Listen.

1600
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,770
I really like our teamwork.

1601
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,190
- Teamwork?
- We had great teamwork.

1602
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:12,940
- We have great teamwork,
- Yes.

1603
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,000
- and I want to eat a nice lunch.
- Okay.

1604
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,710
Right. Let's eat this time.

1605
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:19,840
- I'm serious.
- I know.

1606
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,210
Yong Sun, let's eat lunch.

1607
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,550
- Will you take the test?
- Let's eat.

1608
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:24,050
- Let's eat.
- The first place team can eat.

1609
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,840
The younger sisters,
please go to your rooms.

1610
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,110
Young Ji, I trust you.

1611
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,090
I think that I need to gain...

1612
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,520
more academic points.

1613
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,820
Since I got
almost no individual point,

1614
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,190
I'm going to continue...

1615
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:40,800
to write an answer to a question.

1616
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,230
I have a feeling
that they will trust me.

1617
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:47,590
I asked them to trust me, but...

1618
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:51,270
Oh, no. The strap got stained.

1619
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,210
I'm going to dance
because I'm upset.

1620
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,340
(So Mi broke her promise
and chose to film audition tape...)

1621
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,150
(because she got upset.)

1622
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,940
All right. Let's go. Let's do this.

1623
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,190
It's a little hard to decide.

1624
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,420
My team is in last place, right?

1625
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:09,480
We can't trust So Min,
but we must trust So Mi.

1626
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:10,980
- Shall we trust her?
- Sorry?

1627
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,380
Do you want to go in?

1628
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,590
- We should give her a stamp, right?
- Yes, we should.

1629
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:16,920
- We should give her a stamp.
- Shall I?

1630
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,000
- Shall I?
- Yes. Let's do that.

1631
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,000
Okay. We trust her.

1632
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,230
We trust So Mi.

1633
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,570
We're leaving because we trust her.

1634
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,340
Can we open the door now?

1635
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,570
Yes, you can.

1636
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:30,610
One.

1637
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,400
(The two brothers are ambushing her
unlike the promise they made.)

1638
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,690
(If Jessi is auditioning,
they'll gain academic points.)

1639
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,380
(She is answering a question.)

1640
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,780
Did you not trust me?

1641
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,780
Oh, my gosh.

1642
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,550
What happens now?

1643
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,920
I think that you are not
compatible with us at all.

1644
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,900
We keep choosing the opposite.

1645
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,190
Gosh, Se Chan. I clearly told you.

1646
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:53,360
- Come on. Get it together.
- We doubted you.

1647
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,500
- Se Chan.
- I'm going to be bad now.

1648
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,710
I think my team will be
in first place.

1649
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,500
I'm worried because I think
we'll win too easily.

1650
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,300
See? They won't come in.

1651
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,000
(What?)

1652
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,780
Guys.

1653
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:09,150
(The two reliable sisters
showed up.)

1654
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,380
Oh, no. We couldn't trust you.

1655
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,980
- Because we have a high score...
- We have a high score.

1656
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,730
Let's trust her.

1657
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,320
Wait. Wait. Hold on.

1658
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,860
She might be studying.
I have a feeling.

1659
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,630
No? Are you sure?

1660
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,340
(They're going into the room as
Kwang Soo is sure about it.)

1661
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,000
Darn it. I told you so.

1662
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:30,940
She's studying. I told you
she must be studying.

1663
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,300
(Awkward)

1664
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,070
- I said I'll go to the Ivy League.
- It's not like that.

1665
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:36,380
I said we shouldn't come in.
Young Ji, listen.

1666
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,610
- You'll see later.
- Okay.

1667
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,110
- He insisted.
- Now, we've become a real family.

1668
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,320
- He didn't trust you.
- We've become a real family.

1669
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,380
I trusted you.

1670
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,590
You see...

1671
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,460
Oh, she was... She was writing
an answer to an essay question.

1672
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,550
See? I told you she was studying.
Gosh.

1673
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,280
- We should've trusted her.
- I'm going to be bad now.

1674
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,690
- Hey, I trusted you.
- I'm going to be bad.

1675
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,550
- I trusted you, but he didn't.
- You see,

1676
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,090
we finally became a real family.

1677
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,130
I trusted you.

1678
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,690
- Forget it.
- My gosh.

1679
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,460
- Listen.
- My brothers doubted me.

1680
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,230
- Let's do it. Let's do it now.
- Young Ji, I trusted you.

1681
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,840
As a result of the 2nd round of
Sister's Room, the 1st place team...

1682
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,880
- Is it us?
- We were in first place.

1683
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,340
- Yes, but it might've changed.
- We were in first place.

1684
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,940
- Because we didn't trust her.
- The first place team is...

1685
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:12,500
Ji Hyo, So Min, and Solar.

1686
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,210
- We're still in first place.
- We're in last place?

1687
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,550
- We're still in first place.
- I think all the other teams...

1688
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,320
- went into the rooms.
- Right.

1689
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,710
- What?
- Why?

1690
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,920
Gosh. She filmed the audition tape.

1691
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,360
- Hey, you filmed...
- No, I studied.

1692
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,590
- I studied.
- She filmed the audition tape.

1693
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,050
I guess she filmed
the audition tape.

1694
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,250
- No, I didn't.
- She was the only one I trusted.

1695
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,530
Next.

1696
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,590
2 teams came in joint 2nd place
in academic point.

1697
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,170
Which teams?

1698
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,960
Team Jessi and Team So Mi.

1699
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,460
- Come on.
- Jessi.

1700
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,110
- My gosh.
- Come on.

1701
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,480
- Come on.
- Earlier, we...

1702
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,730
- Good. We're in 2nd place.
- We're in 2nd place?

1703
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,440
- Last place? We're in 2nd place.
- We're in 2nd place at least.

1704
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,340
Are we in last place?

1705
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,710
- So Mi...
- I asked you to trust me.

1706
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,210
(Only if they trusted Young Ji...)

1707
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,610
I knew it. We're not family.

1708
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,440
- How could it be?
- Now, I have to stop her.

1709
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,750
This is a disaster.

1710
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,860
- I think we'll play a game...
- Like throwing balls.

1711
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,050
where we throw balls.

1712
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,130
This is the last mission
before the graduation...

1713
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,030
- that requires teamwork.
- Okay.

1714
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,030
It's Guard Your Sister,
a basketball game.

1715
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,570
- So we have to guard her.
- Okay. You guys will guard me.

1716
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:08,190
You will be given 10 minutes
in 1st and 2nd halves,

1717
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,360
and the team that gets most balls
in the hoop...

1718
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,670
that the other teams carry wins.

1719
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:15,800
In the first half, the little sister
will carry the hoop,

1720
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,300
- and one of her siblings will...
- Okay.

1721
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,980
- carry it in the second half.
- Got it.

1722
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,750
However, you must find balls
that are hidden in different places,

1723
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:24,550
and write your sister's name on them
to score a goal.

1724
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,480
Or else, it won't be
considered a goal.

1725
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,210
- Oh, we have a rule like that.
- We must find the hidden balls.

1726
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,750
In the order of the number of goals
scored by each team,

1727
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,500
the teams will gain
50, 30, 20, and 10 points.

1728
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,030
- This is our last chance.
- Okay. Got it.

1729
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,570
- A chance to turn the game around.
- If we fail again this time,

1730
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:37,820
- it's over.
- Okay, okay.

1731
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:39,340
- A chance to turn the game around.
- Or you can be an idol singer.

1732
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,460
- Okay.
- Become successful...

1733
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,710
- Being an idol singer sounds great.
- Exactly.

1734
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,360
- We want you to be successful.
- To study...

1735
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,300
- Okay.
- But let's do our best in this.

1736
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,480
Okay. Understood.

1737
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,340
- The game will begin shortly.
- Let's do this!

1738
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,110
- 3, 2, 1.
- We must find the balls first.

1739
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,750
- The race begins now.
- Okay.

1740
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,590
(First half started.)

1741
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,090
Is there no ball in here?

1742
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,360
There might be one.

1743
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,090
- I don't think so.
- I'll take a look around.

1744
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,090
I'll go check that room.

1745
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:03,130
The trash can.

1746
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:04,130
(Jessi has a hunch.)

1747
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,090
- How does a ball look?
- My gosh. Gross.

1748
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,130
(My gosh. Gross.)

1749
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:09,770
- Why?
- The trash can was full of trash.

1750
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,320
- Of course, it's full of trash.
- But...

1751
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,300
But there might've been
something in it.

1752
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,730
There's no ball in here.

1753
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,300
- I think...
- We wasted our time.

1754
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,610
We came down here
because you told us to.

1755
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,340
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- I like how she points things out.

1756
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,340
I'm sorry.

1757
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,480
(Haha is searching for a ball too.)

1758
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,480
Wait.

1759
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,090
(He found something!)

1760
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,980
There it is. I found one.

1761
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,190
(Finally, he found a ball.)

1762
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,960
"Lee Young Ji".
I wrote down her name. Let's go.

1763
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,590
(Kwang Soo found a ball too.)

1764
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,550
(He's heading somewhere
with the ball he found.)

1765
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,230
Where are you going?

1766
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,300
(He ran into Suk Jin,
who's not a threat.)

1767
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,340
Wait.

1768
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,400
(But!)

1769
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,270
- Wait.
- What is it?

1770
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:50,360
Just let me pass through.

1771
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,860
- No.
- Just let me pass through.

1772
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,730
- Give me that.
- Young Ji, run!

1773
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,440
- Hey.
- Oh, gosh. Let me go.

1774
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,670
- No, no.
- Did they see me?

1775
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,820
- Where is it written?
- Hey, be careful.

1776
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,250
(He's trying to throw the ball.)

1777
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,320
Don't worry.

1778
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,090
(Moving to the sides)

1779
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,320
(Screaming)

1780
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:08,020
(Lee Kwang Soo has been kicked out.)

1781
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,380
- Bye.
- What?

1782
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,590
- Why would this door...
- Let's go.

1783
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,650
Wait! Wait.

1784
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,230
Why did the door open?

1785
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:15,400
Let's hurry.

1786
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,190
- Hurry up and write it down.
- Haha!

1787
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,670
They're coming.

1788
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:20,570
- Hey, where is Kwang Soo?
- Be careful.

1789
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:23,110
Hurry up and go. Kwang Soo.

1790
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,170
(Jong Kook is rushing to Young Ji.)

1791
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,110
(Lying on the floor)

1792
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,650
Be careful.

1793
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,550
(She's blocking the ball
with quick movements.)

1794
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,150
(Unexpected breakdance)

1795
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,570
Hey!

1796
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,590
You're supposed to stop them!

1797
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:39,190
(The 21st-century girl doesn't
feel intimidated by Jong Kook.)

1798
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:40,460
No. Come on.

1799
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,920
- No.
- You see...

1800
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,860
- No.
- The net is turned inside out.

1801
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,360
(While Jong Kook is confronting
Young Ji...)

1802
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,460
Be careful!

1803
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,030
Hey!

1804
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:53,030
(Kwang Soo is fighting with So Mi
one on one.)

1805
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,860
I failed.

1806
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,230
(Bricked)

1807
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,270
Haha.

1808
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,960
(Haha showed up and succeeded
in scoring a goal.)

1809
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:01,280
No, no. Run. Run.

1810
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,380
- No, no.
- We already lost a point.

1811
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,550
It's turned inside out.

1812
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:05,710
We lost a point.

1813
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,750
Gosh. Where have you been?

1814
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,090
Where?

1815
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,340
(So Min is waiting for
the right time for the attack.)

1816
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,860
- Okay. Gosh. Give me that!
- So Min.

1817
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,920
(Kwang Soo snatched her ball
while chasing after her.)

1818
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,960
Give me that!

1819
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,250
(Kwang Soo ran away from So Min.)

1820
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,730
- So Min.
- He stole my ball.

1821
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,130
I mean, this is...

1822
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,840
There she is.

1823
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:30,730
(Haha's target is...)

1824
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,130
(the weakest, Solar.)

1825
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,000
Kwang Soo, no.

1826
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:36,340
(Solar barely blocked
the second shot.)

1827
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,340
Kwang Soo, no.

1828
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,610
Okay. It's done.

1829
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,940
(Haha and Kwang Soo scored goals
against Team Solar.)

1830
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,340
I stole the ball.

1831
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,820
Haha, this is our chance.

1832
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,960
- They have so many balls.
- Stop. Come back.

1833
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,320
- Come on up.
- Hey!

1834
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,550
Hurry up.

1835
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,280
- Okay.
- Don't get involved in that.

1836
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,500
You don't even have any balls.

1837
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,500
- Hey.
- We have to find a ball.

1838
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,460
I think there's one
in a trash can.

1839
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,360
- I found one!
- Great.

1840
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,070
- Did you find a ball?
- Jae Suk.

1841
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,500
We should write down your name.

1842
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,730
I told you it was in a trash can.

1843
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,730
(Speechless)

1844
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,440
I'm sorry,
but it wasn't in the trash can.

1845
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,340
It was behind the trash can.

1846
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,670
Hey, we... Oh, here it is.

1847
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,250
Did you find another one?

1848
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,650
- Come on. Wow.
- Wow.

1849
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,590
Let's go. Let's go.

1850
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,190
Let's go. Move it, move it.

1851
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,550
Solar.

1852
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,550
Gosh, Kwang Soo.

1853
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:24,860
- What's wrong with you?
- Watch out. So Mi is here too.

1854
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:25,960
- Be careful.
- So Mi, be careful.

1855
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,050
Come over here.

1856
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,860
Kwang Soo, I really don't like you.

1857
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,300
What... Wait. You don't like me?

1858
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,000
- This is how the game is played.
- Hey.

1859
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:36,090
- So Mi.
- What? Hey.

1860
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,670
(Suk Jin is taken aback
as he lost it in an instant.)

1861
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,340
- Darn it.
- Why did you let him take it?

1862
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,980
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you do that?

1863
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,730
- Let's go to Solar.
- No.

1864
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,440
But we... Oh, no. Run. Hurry.

1865
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,440
(Only Ji Hyo is guarding Solar.)

1866
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,750
- He's coming.
- Goal!

1867
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,110
(He scored a goal easily.)

1868
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,380
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

1869
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,210
I mean... Not again. Stop!

1870
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,960
(Jong Kook goes on the offense.)

1871
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,460
I mean... Not again. Stop!

1872
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,750
(Ji Hyo hit the ball
with her elbow.)

1873
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,300
Hey, our net is full now.

1874
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,820
Be careful with that.

1875
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:05,960
Be careful.

1876
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,900
- Hey!
- Jessi!

1877
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,670
(Kwang Soo saw the ball bouncing out
and went crazy.)

1878
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:11,030
(Let go of me.)

1879
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:13,940
(They're punishing
Kwang Soo together.)

1880
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,480
(While they're taking him down...)

1881
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,800
It fell on the floor.

1882
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,170
(Screaming)

1883
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:21,320
Don't bite me.

1884
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,750
Let go of me. Let me go!

1885
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,340
I said, let go!

1886
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,050
I said, let go. What are you doing?

1887
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,750
- Gosh, my hair.
- Who is it?

1888
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,280
(A piece of art on long paper
created by Ji Hyo)

1889
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,590
- What are you doing?
- Gosh, my hair.

1890
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,400
- Who is it?
- My hair.

1891
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,030
(Finally, they're all calm.)

1892
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:36,500
- Jessi.
- My gosh.

1893
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,900
We should score a goal.

1894
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,400
Jessi. Jessi.

1895
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,460
- I'll be here.
- Jessi.

1896
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:42,860
- Who is that?
- Oh, my gosh.

1897
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,130
- What happened to your face?
- What happened?

1898
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,440
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

1899
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,070
What happened?

1900
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,710
- It wasn't me.
- What color is it?

1901
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:49,710
- What color is it?
- It wasn't me.

1902
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,000
- What color is it?
- Kwang Soo.

1903
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,250
It's drawn in this color.

1904
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,280
- It wasn't me.
- It was So Min.

1905
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,320
- No.
- I think...

1906
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,380
(However, Ji Hyo doesn't have
the lid of the marker.)

1907
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,110
It's easy to move.

1908
01:02:58,110 --> 01:02:59,210
(I got you!)

1909
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,860
(Kwang Soo is in a frenzy
with a revengeful spirit.)

1910
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,030
Come here. Let's go.

1911
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,030
(I don't want to be
dragged into that.)

1912
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,770
(You are watching
a basketball game.)

1913
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:13,190
Where is it? An orange ball.

1914
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:17,960
(Ball, please come out.)

1915
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,440
(Team Solar is also busy
looking for a ball.)

1916
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,130
Where did they find so many balls?

1917
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:23,280
- Did you find one, Ji Hyo?
- No.

1918
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:24,840
I think...

1919
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,070
(At that moment!)

1920
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,170
No. Ji Hyo! No!

1921
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,320
No. Go away. Go away.

1922
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,480
- I got it.
- What was that?

1923
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,480
(So Min blocked the shot.)

1924
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,920
That was awesome.

1925
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,960
- So Min.
- Let's get out of here.

1926
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,090
Haha!

1927
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,530
Solar, take this and run.

1928
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,460
- Run.
- He lost the ball.

1929
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,460
Wait.

1930
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,770
Wait. No.

1931
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:47,130
Close the door. Close it, Ji Hyo.

1932
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,860
Close it. Close it now, Ji Hyo.

1933
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:51,500
Close it. Close it.

1934
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,780
I said, close it. Close it now.
Close it.

1935
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:57,110
Where did my marker pen go?

1936
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,440
- My marker pen...
- It's not here.

1937
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:01,110
What do you mean it's not here?

1938
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,190
- Here...
- I don't have it.

1939
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,750
It's right here!

1940
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,590
- Don't make me laugh.
- I'll take it out.

1941
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,920
- Why...
- I'll take it out for you.

1942
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,920
- Give it to me.
- I'll take it out.

1943
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,030
- Give it to me.
- Stop pressing. I'll give you.

1944
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:11,690
- How? How?
- What?

1945
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:12,750
I'll take it out now.

1946
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,130
Wait. You should give it to him.

1947
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,920
What? When and who did this?

1948
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,570
(What? When and who did this?)

1949
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,960
Jessi, earlier... Calm down.

1950
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,300
- Jae Suk!
- Calm down.

1951
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,460
- When did this get in here?
- One ball is okay.

1952
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,340
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

1953
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:27,570
That could happen to any team.

1954
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:28,610
Wait.

1955
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:31,280
Gosh. You can't keep it
under your shirt.

1956
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,340
But we have only girls in our team.

1957
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:33,610
I don't care. Kwang Soo.

1958
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,070
Gosh. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1959
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,020
Stop it. You can't do that.

1960
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,750
Hey, what are you... Oh, gosh.

1961
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:41,750
Stop it.

1962
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,230
(The battle for revenge)

1963
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,150
- What are you guys doing?
- Hey.

1964
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,420
That's ridiculous.

1965
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,360
(Biting)

1966
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:52,400
Hey, you brat.

1967
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,460
(A headlock)

1968
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,860
You shouldn't do that to her.

1969
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,170
(And new face painting)

1970
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,570
That's bad.

1971
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,840
(Kwang Soo is in trouble.)

1972
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,070
Hey, stop it.

1973
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:01,230
- Go. Good job.
- Stop it.

1974
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,280
- What? What was that?
- Jessi.

1975
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,480
- Help me.
- Jessi.

1976
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,940
(While everyone was
looking at Kwang Soo,)

1977
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,710
(So Mi scored a goal too.)

1978
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:10,280
Everyone, the first half is over.

1979
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,940
- The first half is over.
- I put a ball in Young Ji's net.

1980
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,320
- Did you?
- Yes.

1981
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,690
Please go to your team's
starting place.

1982
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:16,860
(Team Young Ji: 26, Team So Mi: 14,
Team Jessi: 8, Team Solar: minus 10)

1983
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,960
There's no way we can...

1984
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,920
We lost too many points.

1985
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,960
I was so surprised.
They came at me like crazy.

1986
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,270
It's no joke.

1987
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:26,670
Which one of you will
carry the hoop?

1988
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,730
- Ji Hyo, you do it.
- I'll do it.

1989
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:30,360
She's better at dodging than me.

1990
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:34,730
I don't know.
There's nothing we can do.

1991
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,750
How about we forget about scoring
goals and beat Kwang Soo up?

1992
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:39,840
(How about we forget about scoring
goals and beat Kwang Soo up?)

1993
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,210
- I won't let it slide.
- I'm sure...

1994
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,420
that Kwang Soo will carry the hoop
because he's tall.

1995
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:45,420
- He's fast too.
- You're right.

1996
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,150
I'm so annoyed.

1997
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,590
(The big sister is still upset.)

1998
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:51,130
I think Jae Suk
will cover for me better.

1999
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,920
Who didn't cover for me earlier?

2000
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:55,030
- What do you mean?
- Who didn't cover for me?

2001
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,800
You? We both protected you.

2002
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,400
- Jessi.
- Get the ball in whenever you can.

2003
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,000
- I'm worried about this guy.
- Why?

2004
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,770
- I just have a feeling.
- No.

2005
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,940
Worry about yourself.

2006
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,610
- Don't fight.
- We're not fighting.

2007
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:06,840
I was complimenting her.

2008
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,210
- Hey.
- I'll be there for you.

2009
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:09,780
- Are you looking down on her?
- No.

2010
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,300
- Never.
- The whole time, you're...

2011
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,300
- No.
- Oh, my gosh.

2012
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,920
- I was...
- Hey, do you watch NBA games?

2013
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,020
- What? Yes, I do.
- You watch NBA games?

2014
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:17,610
- Can you play basketball?
- I can.

2015
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:18,710
I think I got a nosebleed.

2016
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:21,420
- Is this the last game?
- Because you said that...

2017
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,110
- Is this the last one?
- To be honest,

2018
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,730
I'm happy I'm not
on Kwang Soo's team.

2019
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,090
- It's best if you carry the net.
- Me?

2020
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,000
If I do it, everyone will target me.

2021
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,230
- Of course.
- Everyone will come at me.

2022
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:35,000
- It's better if I defend.
- Yes, you should defend.

2023
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,190
All right.

2024
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:37,340
Who should carry the net?

2025
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,270
Who should?
Do you want to play offense?

2026
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,440
They were all coming at you, right?

2027
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,670
I think...

2028
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:44,980
(It shows
that everyone came at him.)

2029
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,110
I'll play offense.

2030
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,550
I'll attack.

2031
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:48,840
Okay, I'll carry the net.

2032
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,150
Let's start the second half.

2033
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,550
- I'll get many balls in this time.
- Let's do this.

2034
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,090
The race starts.

2035
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:56,210
(The second half starts.)

2036
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:00,250
There will be more nets this time.

2037
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,730
Here he comes.
Kwang Soo has two balls.

2038
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:03,770
- Gosh, that crazy punk.
- Here he comes.

2039
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,730
- We have no balls?
- Where did he find them?

2040
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,130
- He's running here.
- They...

2041
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,590
They already have balls.

2042
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:09,860
- What's with him?
- I found one.

2043
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,030
Watch out!

2044
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,000
- Watch out!
- Watch out!

2045
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,400
- Watch out!
- Watch out!

2046
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,650
(He charges at So Mi.)

2047
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,670
Fine, I'll leave.

2048
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,570
I'll leave.

2049
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,480
(He gets scared and runs away.)

2050
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:26,380
Come here! Stop!

2051
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,610
(Se Chan is confronted with So Min
while carrying a net.)

2052
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:29,820
Hey!

2053
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,650
(So Min swears...)

2054
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:32,750
(and punches him.)

2055
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,050
(He gets punched
in the left front side of his head.)

2056
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,090
Hey!

2057
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,300
How could you slap me?

2058
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,770
(After the first half, Yong Sun's
sisters are getting mean.)

2059
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:41,440
(Young Ji looking for balls
on the 2nd floor alone.)

2060
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:42,770
This is insane.

2061
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:44,610
(She finds a ball under the sink.)

2062
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:46,210
You're good at this.

2063
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:47,380
(The staff is impressed.)

2064
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,110
(She hides the balls
inside her T-shirt.)

2065
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,440
Run!

2066
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,880
(There is a war going on.)

2067
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,610
(Young Ji is hiding in the corner.)

2068
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:55,940
Haha! Jae Suk!

2069
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,440
(She lowers her body.)

2070
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,050
(She gets a ball in.)

2071
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:03,880
(She scores a goal
without anyone finding out.)

2072
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,690
(Celebrating)

2073
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,590
(Jong Kook hasn't noticed it.)

2074
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:10,590
(Young Ji finds
another opportunity...)

2075
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:11,670
(and takes action.)

2076
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:12,730
Here she comes. Hey!

2077
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:14,800
(Her second attack succeeds too.)

2078
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,000
Hey, look at her.

2079
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,210
Okay!

2080
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,770
(The 21st-century girl challenges
the invincible Jong Kook.)

2081
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:20,530
Here we go. Okay.

2082
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:23,000
(The 20th-century singer
versus the 21st-century girl)

2083
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,670
(The chase of the century)

2084
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,210
(Screaming)

2085
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:31,240
Young Ji, what happened? Young Ji!

2086
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:32,910
- Young Ji.
- Young Ji!

2087
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:34,410
(Everyone is shocked
at the unexpected situation.)

2088
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,790
(When Jong Kook finds his target,
he never gives up.)

2089
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:39,620
(In the end, Jong Kook
gets 2 balls in.)

2090
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,660
What's with her face?

2091
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,460
(Shocked)

2092
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,530
What's with her face?

2093
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:45,660
(Even her face
intimidates everyone.)

2094
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,740
- It's me.
- Young Ji!

2095
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:47,940
(Even her face
intimidates everyone.)

2096
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:50,700
(Young Ji looks
for her next target.)

2097
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,610
(She suddenly takes her shoes off.)

2098
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:56,370
(Her steps to the battleground
feel much lighter now.)

2099
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,370
(Her feet move incredibly fast.)

2100
01:08:58,370 --> 01:08:59,480
Hey!

2101
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:02,520
(No one dares attack Young Ji...)

2102
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,950
(when she even took her shoes off.)

2103
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,620
Young Ji is hilarious.

2104
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:09,190
Young Ji, why did you
take your shoes off?

2105
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,580
To run faster.

2106
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,990
(Determined)

2107
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:13,750
Young Ji.

2108
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,990
- Do you have it or not?
- It's mine!

2109
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,230
Give it to me!

2110
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,290
Kwang Soo!

2111
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,500
(She tries to defend
against Jae Suk...)

2112
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,330
(but unfortunately fails.)

2113
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:27,630
Hey, you're good at this.

2114
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,630
Young Ji, I love your energy.

2115
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:31,870
- Young Ji, you have so much energy.
- Young Ji, you're amazing.

2116
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,200
Very good.

2117
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,280
(I'm Lee Young Ji.)

2118
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,020
- We have 30 seconds left.
- We got 30 seconds left.

2119
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,340
(The second half ends
in 30 seconds.)

2120
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:41,190
(Faking)

2121
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,120
(His ball is so fast
that no one can see it.)

2122
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,120
Give it to me.

2123
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:46,660
Look at Kwang Soo.

2124
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,230
Good. We can't see it.

2125
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,870
What are you doing?

2126
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:52,900
- This is hilarious.
- It's so fast I can't see it.

2127
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:55,870
I can't see it.

2128
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,130
Gosh, it's so fast.

2129
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,130
(Jae Suk approaches Kwang Soo.)

2130
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,460
(Jae Suk slaps him.)

2131
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,110
(Kwang Soo's one-man show
is over.)

2132
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:05,200
(What's with him?)

2133
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,950
In the end,
it finishes in a silly way.

2134
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,120
(They have 3 seconds.)

2135
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,210
- Two!
- Gosh.

2136
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,820
(Exhausted)

2137
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:12,840
Game over.

2138
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,910
- Everyone.
- Yes?

2139
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,120
In first place...

2140
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,120
(The results are announced.)

2141
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,330
With 40 points,

2142
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:20,030
Team Young Ji.

2143
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,120
(With 40 points, Team Young Ji
finishes in 1st place.)

2144
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,620
(Young Ji took her shoes off,
and Kwang Soo didn't spare himself.)

2145
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:26,660
They got many balls in?

2146
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,660
Our strategy paid off.

2147
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:31,500
In second place,
with only one less ball in...

2148
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,500
I hope we're in second place.

2149
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,000
- With 37 points,
- Team Jong Kook.

2150
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,440
Team So Mi.

2151
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:37,450
- I knew it.
- I'm relieved.

2152
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:38,610
(Satisfied)

2153
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,740
- I'm relieved.
- So am I.

2154
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,740
- We're in second place.
- We won't be penalized.

2155
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,020
With four less points...

2156
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,520
(With 4 less points
than Team So Mi...)

2157
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,710
- Team Jessi is in third place.
- Okay.

2158
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,750
- Gosh.
- And then...

2159
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,550
Team Solar has...

2160
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,290
minus nine points.

2161
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,120
Minus nine points?

2162
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:57,620
What is that?

2163
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,130
They ended up with so many balls
that they carried in their bags.

2164
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:04,330
- It's the last Sister's Room.
- We're at the bottom.

2165
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:06,410
- We have to trust each other.
- Exactly.

2166
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:09,080
- Trust me.
- Okay. Go to your room.

2167
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,540
- We'll trust you.
- We shouldn't open her door.

2168
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,740
- We shouldn't.
- No, you shouldn't.

2169
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,520
- Gosh, what should I do?
- What do we do?

2170
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,170
- I don't know what they'll do.
- Me neither.

2171
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,290
(They go to their rooms.)

2172
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,520
Is Jessi already in her room?

2173
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,820
- What? What's with you?
- What are you going to do?

2174
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,290
I don't know. What about you guys?

2175
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,490
But from my experience...

2176
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,660
Let's say you're working
on your computer.

2177
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,200
They'd think you're doing this.

2178
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:34,130
- Right?
- They want me to work on this.

2179
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:35,790
Don't trust them.

2180
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:36,870
Do whatever you want.

2181
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,160
They can do whatever for the show.

2182
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,370
I'm going to play you against them.

2183
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,110
They've betrayed you, right?

2184
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:44,280
They betray me all the time.

2185
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,300
So should you.

2186
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:47,340
But I don't want to.

2187
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,780
I promised them...

2188
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,040
5, 6 times.

2189
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:53,120
I'm playing them against each other.

2190
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,710
(I'm playing them
against each other.)

2191
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,860
I'm going to dance this time too.

2192
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,120
In my opinion...

2193
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:03,050
I'm having an inner conflict
right now.

2194
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,330
I'll give up on my Ivy League dream.

2195
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:07,960
I need to set this up first
since I'll become an idol singer.

2196
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,330
(Going back on her word,
Young Ji prepares for an audition.)

2197
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,630
If they had won my trust
in the 1st and 2nd rounds,

2198
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:12,800
I would be answering
essay questions now.

2199
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,610
They should have trusted me.

2200
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,870
It's not my fault.

2201
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,740
Okay. I choose this.

2202
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,080
I'll stick to this.

2203
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,450
Oh, my gosh. What do I do?

2204
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:24,840
Tell me what to do.

2205
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,340
(Me?)

2206
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,120
What do you think?

2207
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:29,990
I'll trust them.

2208
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:31,420
(She decides to trust
her teammates again.)

2209
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:32,530
Jae Suk.

2210
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:33,530
(All of them have made up
their minds.)

2211
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:34,750
Young Ji, we trust you.

2212
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,230
(All of them have made up
their minds.)

2213
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,990
(Their siblings arrive.)

2214
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,200
We should trust our little sister.

2215
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,460
Let's trust her.

2216
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:45,200
- Let's give her a stamp.
- Do it. Let's not think too much.

2217
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,410
Rather than losing it...

2218
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:49,000
- Let's trust our little sister.
- Let's do this.

2219
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:52,200
- We should trust her.
- Come on.

2220
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,710
Stop bragging and stamp it already.

2221
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:54,840
Why are you bragging so much?

2222
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,950
- I can't hear you.
- Okay.

2223
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,540
Let's go.

2224
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,650
(Thanks to their trust,
So Min wins audition points.)

2225
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:00,820
Oh, my.

2226
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:02,190
Did they leave?

2227
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,950
(Solar wins a stamp of trust
from her sisters.)

2228
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:08,400
(Thanks to Solar keeping her word,
her team wins academic points.)

2229
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,860
All teams seem to trust
their little sisters.

2230
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,700
We never know.

2231
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,790
What if she is
filming an audition tape again?

2232
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,200
She might.

2233
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:17,370
(They're 100 percent sure
Jessi is filming an audition tape.)

2234
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:19,110
They're betraying me.

2235
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,630
They think
I'm filming an audition tape.

2236
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,410
(They fail to trust her
and decide to open the door.)

2237
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,240
Come on!

2238
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,190
(Screaming)

2239
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:33,820
Come on!

2240
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:34,820
(Jessi can't take it anymore.)

2241
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,880
Come on!

2242
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,950
You...

2243
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,950
(I can't believe
you're my brothers!)

2244
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,490
- Jessi.
- Jessi.

2245
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,700
- I'm not going to see you again.
- Jessi.

2246
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:45,030
- Jessi, I'm sorry.
- I told you.

2247
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:46,330
Jessi, you're mistaken.

2248
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:47,660
- Jessi.
- Jessi.

2249
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,040
I told you we should trust her.

2250
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,570
- I wasn't sure.
- Jessi.

2251
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,300
- Jessi, let us explain.
- You promised me!

2252
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,080
- Calm down.
- Knock, knock.

2253
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,130
Come on!

2254
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:57,740
- Come on, Jessi.
- Jessi.

2255
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,620
I wanted to give you a stamp,
but he insisted on opening the door.

2256
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:03,480
(Team Jessi fails to win
academic points.)

2257
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,580
I'm sorry, Jessi.

2258
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:06,120
Jessi, come on.

2259
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,880
I trusted you! Oh, my gosh.

2260
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:09,860
- You...
- Oh, my gosh.

2261
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:12,360
- Let's give her a stamp.
- I...

2262
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,990
Let's trust her.

2263
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,120
(They don't want to end up
like Team Jessi.)

2264
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,230
- On the far right.
- Has it been three times?

2265
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:19,490
(They give Young Ji a stamp so that
they don't end up like Team Jessi.)

2266
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,630
Let's trust her.

2267
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:22,990
(Kwang Soo isn't feeling good
about this.)

2268
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:27,410
(And he has a good reason
for that.)

2269
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,870
I feel a lot more guilty
than expected.

2270
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,040
Thank you.

2271
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,410
(Young Ji wins audition points.)

2272
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:38,410
We're family.

2273
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:42,080
The race for your little sisters'
graduation is over.

2274
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:45,580
In the last round, all the teams
except Team Jessi...

2275
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:46,880
decided to give stamps.

2276
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,830
- It's touching.
- Let's see.

2277
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:51,420
- Are we really family?
- You guys really are my brothers.

2278
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,230
- You should trust your family.
- Let's see what happens.

2279
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,130
It's touching. It's really touching.

2280
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,770
- This is what family is all about.
- It's a happy ending.

2281
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:58,800
You should trust your family
at crucial moments.

2282
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,830
- We were at the bottom before this.
- What is this?

2283
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,540
When Team Jessi opened the door,
she was answering essay questions.

2284
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,980
- Oh, my.
- Too bad.

2285
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,910
Solar, who was trusted
by her sisters,

2286
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,340
was answering essay questions.

2287
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,370
(Team Solar wins academic points.)

2288
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:10,740
- Moving on.
- Team So Mi.

2289
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,320
So Mi, who was trusted
by her brothers...

2290
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,990
(Team So Mi trusted her.)

2291
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:15,080
- was filming an audition tape.
- What?

2292
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,710
(She was filming an audition tape.)

2293
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:17,990
We beat them.

2294
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,660
- We beat them.
- Yes!

2295
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:22,200
- We beat them.
- We'll move up then.

2296
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:23,830
- We did it!
- We're in second place.

2297
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,460
- I can't believe this girl.
- If she was answering questions...

2298
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,790
I learned it from you.

2299
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:30,270
I hope Team Young Ji beats them.

2300
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:31,740
- Beat them.
- I trust Young Ji.

2301
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:33,500
- Young Ji, who was trusted,
- They beat them.

2302
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,330
was filming an audition tape.

2303
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:40,150
(She fooled us.)

2304
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,120
(She shows off her dance moves
she has been practicing.)

2305
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:44,380
(He's swearing with his eyes.)

2306
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:47,580
So the sister who came in
first place in the audition is...

2307
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:50,050
(It's time to announce the sister
who came in 1st place.)

2308
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,690
It's Jeon So Mi,
who got 100 points.

2309
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:53,120
What?

2310
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:54,660
I didn't come in first place?

2311
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:55,900
Then we don't get the penalty.

2312
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,120
- She got 100 points?
- No, it's just So Mi.

2313
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,460
Only So Mi gets exempt
from the penalty.

2314
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,740
The other two members
will get the penalty.

2315
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:03,490
The sister in second place
who will get a prize is...

2316
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:05,070
(The person who came in 2nd place
and gets a prize is...)

2317
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,940
It's Lee Young Ji.

2318
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:08,330
(The person who came in 2nd place
and gets a prize is Lee Young Ji.)

2319
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,040
Goodness.

2320
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,200
My gosh.

2321
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:14,170
(Young Ji, who came in 2nd place,
will get a prize.)

2322
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,620
- We just need to avoid the penalty.
- Right.

2323
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:18,290
Only the teams in 3rd and 4th place
will get the penalty, right?

2324
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:21,020
- It's time to announce the penalty.
- It's the penalty.

2325
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:22,410
- The penalty...
- Let's just give up.

2326
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:24,050
- I don't think it's going to be us.
- This is fun.

2327
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:25,530
- We won't get the penalty.
- I can get the penalty,

2328
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:26,580
- but...
- She's going to get it too.

2329
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:27,990
I need to get the penalty with her.

2330
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:30,050
- That's my goal.
- I will get the penalty with her.

2331
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:33,200
The team that will graduate with
the highest academic points is...

2332
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,660
(Today's race was filled with
mistrust and betrayal.)

2333
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:38,660
(Despite that, the team that
protected their sibling love...)

2334
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:42,240
(and came in 1st place is...)

2335
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:43,610
It's Team Solar with 70 points.

2336
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,580
(Team Solar graduated
with top marks.)

2337
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,410
This is a good memory.

2338
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:51,790
Girl power!

2339
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:52,880
Solar!

2340
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:54,050
Solar!

2341
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:55,620
Hey, Yong Sun!

2342
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,920
- Our youngest sister, Yong Sun!
- Yong Sun is the best!

2343
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,490
- Our youngest sister, Yong Sun!
- Gosh, Yong Sun!

2344
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:01,590
The second place team will avoid
the penalty too.

2345
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:02,660
The team in second place.

2346
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:03,790
- In second place...
- Tell us it's Jessi.

2347
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,420
- Please hurry!
- I think we're in third place.

2348
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,440
The point difference between the
2nd and 3rd place team is 10 points.

2349
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,790
- Let's come in 2nd place.
- I think we might be in 3rd place.

2350
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:10,910
Let's come in 2nd place.

2351
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,800
- In 2nd place with 30 points...
- 2nd place.

2352
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,000
(The team that came in 2nd place
with 10 more points...)

2353
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,110
Let's come in second place.

2354
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:17,130
(and gets to avoid
the penalty is...)

2355
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:19,240
The team that will graduate
and avoid the penalty is...

2356
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,240
Jeon So Mi.

2357
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:22,820
- Yes!
- Thank goodness.

2358
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:24,320
(2nd place, Team Jeon So Mi)

2359
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,450
- Yes!
- Thank goodness.

2360
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:26,740
She came in 1st place,
but her team also gets exempt.

2361
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,910
Our little sister came in
first place, and we...

2362
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:30,990
If only...

2363
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:33,920
- Stop bragging.
- she studied hard in school...

2364
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,950
- Did we lose again?
- And we got exempt too.

2365
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:37,400
Why are you bragging so much?

2366
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:40,770
Team Jessi came in 3rd place
with 20 points.

2367
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:42,740
Team Young Ji came in 4th place
with 10 points.

2368
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:43,790
- This is...
- We're in last place?

2369
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:44,870
We came in last place?

2370
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:47,200
- It's better to be in last place.
- We got everything we wanted.

2371
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:48,830
Get your hand away from me.

2372
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,280
(Their younger sister fulfilled
her dream to audition.)

2373
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,650
Shall we bring in the prize?

2374
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:57,170
- Are we in fourth place?
- What's the prize?

2375
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,820
- No, we're in third place.
- Wow.

2376
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:01,410
A sound bar.

2377
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,120
The 1st and 2nd place winners
of the auditions,

2378
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,580
Jeon So Mi and Lee Young Ji,
will each get one.

2379
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,590
Congratulations on your debut.

2380
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:08,620
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2381
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,620
They came in 1st and 2nd place
on their 1st time on Running Man.

2382
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,070
- 21st-century kids.
- 21st-century kids.

2383
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:13,870
Congratulations to the 2 people
born in the 21st century.

2384
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:14,900
Amazing.

2385
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,630
We'll go straight into the penalty.

2386
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:19,160
Each of you must stand behind
1, 2, and 3.

2387
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,910
The 3 doors will open, and 2 of them
will have a flour bomb in them.

2388
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,080
- Okay.
- Okay.

2389
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,300
Okay. It's behind there.

2390
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,580
- It's not us.
- It's behind there.

2391
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:26,910
- Young Ji gets the penalty too.
- Right.

2392
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,340
Because she's in second place.

2393
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,820
- Thank goodness.
- Nice.

2394
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:31,410
We came in 2nd place
because of them

2395
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:32,990
- Right.
- Then I...

2396
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,950
(Team Young Ji will start. Only one
of them can avoid the flour.)

2397
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:36,520
- Are you in position?
- Will it reach here?

2398
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:38,730
Does anyone want to switch spots?

2399
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:41,990
(Kwang Soo and Young Ji
switch spots at the last moment.)

2400
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,960
(1 of these 3 will be exempt
from the penalty.)

2401
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,420
- Okay.
- One.

2402
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:46,700
Two.

2403
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:48,090
Three.

2404
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,740
Three.

2405
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:58,540
(Lucky Young Ji
avoided the penalty.)

2406
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,200
(Are we in paradise?)

2407
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,620
How is that possible?

2408
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,670
She avoided it.

2409
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,240
- Hold on.
- Why?

2410
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:05,950
Who got hit with it?

2411
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,040
How did the two of you get it?

2412
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,790
(It's an overwhelming view.
They're covered in flour.)

2413
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:14,250
(They gave it their all.)

2414
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:18,090
- Young Ji is really lucky.
- You look handsome like that.

2415
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:19,920
- I know.
- We changed spots too.

2416
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,540
Wait. Hold on. Is it random?

2417
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:23,070
Yes, it's random.

2418
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,130
Seriously. Please.

2419
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,700
- Door number two?
- I don't know.

2420
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,080
It's either 2 or 3.

2421
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,740
- Okay.
- Okay. Come on. Let's go.

2422
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,120
Does anyone want to switch?

2423
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:35,710
Do you want to switch?

2424
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,820
I don't know.
I'm just standing here.

2425
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,240
- Okay.
- Face the door.

2426
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,050
- Jessi chose door number two.
- You don't want to switch?

2427
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:43,880
You can't complain to us if you
get hit because you didn't switch.

2428
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,920
My gosh. Be quiet, please.

2429
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:49,860
Okay. One.

2430
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,270
Two.

2431
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:52,700
Three.

2432
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,370
Oh, my gosh!

2433
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,870
(What?)

2434
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:04,340
(This is 100 percent real.
Jessi is chosen.)

2435
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:07,820
(Why did it have to be Jessi?)

2436
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:10,120
- Oh, my.
- Jessi, come on!

2437
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,150
I'm so sorry, but I love you.
It's all a lie.

2438
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,580
Oh, no. Jessi.

2439
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:17,730
(The strong sister has been adorned
with white.)

2440
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:18,950
Oh, no. Jessi.

2441
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:21,420
- Jessi. Come on.
- Jessi. Come on.

2442
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,830
(The childish brothers are excited
about their sister's punishment.)

2443
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,960
Jessi.

2444
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:28,370
- Jessi.
- Oh, my gosh.

2445
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,070
You didn't switch!

2446
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:34,980
- You've become flour dough.
- Jessi.

2447
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:36,240
Jessi.

2448
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:37,980
Don't touch me!

2449
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,300
Hey! Don't touch me!

2450
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,170
Hey. You. "Nunu Nana".

2451
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:43,820
Jessi.

2452
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,450
Jessi. Come on.

2453
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:49,050
No, I... I... Today...

2454
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:51,380
- You look so scary right now.
- Don't speak.

2455
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,250
- You look funnier when you speak.
- You look so scary right now.

2456
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:55,400
- Oh, my.
- She looks like a ghost.

2457
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:56,990
(Blowing)

2458
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,160
- You spat on me!
- No, I didn't!

2459
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:02,490
- He spat on me.
- I didn't!

2460
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:04,830
- Why did you spit on her?
- I was blowing the flour off.

2461
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:06,130
I was really blowing the flour off.

2462
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,910
- Jessi.
- Can you tell us how you feel?

2463
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,080
(He can't read the room.)

2464
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,370
You want to know how I feel?

2465
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,870
Jessi, come on.

2466
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,780
- It was so funny today.
- Good job, everyone.

2467
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,210
Good job, everyone!

2468
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:20,860
(Iron gates are shut tightly here.)

2469
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:24,190
(8 inmates are being held
inside a prison.)

2470
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:26,230
- You must be the new guys.
- I'm here to get one of you.

2471
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:27,450
(New inmate 2371, Kim Young Min.
New inmate 2370, Ha Do Kwon.)

2472
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,050
I was a top executive...

2473
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,290
(New inmate 2372, Ji Seung Hyun.
New inmate 2369, Kim Yong Ji.)

(The rules of Running Prison)

2475
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:36,070
(The inmates here are connected
in pairs of 2?)

2476
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:37,800
(However, nobody knows...)

2477
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,000
(who they are connected with.)

2478
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,370
(They must find their partner
without getting caught and escape.)

2479
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,650
(Only those who escape can survive.)

2480
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:49,840
(This was all planned by
a powerful boss and their member?)

2481
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,380
(Who will be the first two people
to escape?)

2482
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,020
(2 Person Prison Break Race,
My Unfamiliar Partner)
