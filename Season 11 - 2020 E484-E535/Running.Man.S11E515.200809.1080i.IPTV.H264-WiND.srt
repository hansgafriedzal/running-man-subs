1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,460
(In a remote building)

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,940
It's a prison.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,630
What is this place?

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,610
Gosh, it's a prison.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,130
"Wisdom comes with age."

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,970
I've been imprisoned so many times
after I became a celebrity.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,070
I know. I wear
this prison uniform too often.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,480
We just got here,
but we're told to get in.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,480
Are we getting in there?

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,790
Get in there, inmates.

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,790
Well...

12
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,410
Suk Jin is relieving himself now.

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,450
(Suk Jin is relieving himself now.)

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,180
Is he trying to take out
the toilet and escape again?

15
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,800
- This is nice though.
- Gosh, I'm in prison again.

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,090
What is this?

17
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,430
I guess we have to crack the
lock combination to get out of here.

18
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,520
- It's an escape room.
- Someone must be coming.

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,490
- It's an escape game.
- This is an escape room.

20
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,490
Let me see.

21
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,940
- What is this?
- This is nice.

22
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,600
There are extra prison uniforms.

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,870
I bet there will be someone else.

24
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,410
There are more uniforms.

25
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,410
(Letting out a sigh)

26
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,600
(She gets ready to sleep
as if she's home.)

27
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,840
So Min is planning something
as soon as she gets here.

28
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,720
Isn't it that only the head
of the cell can sleep?

29
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,780
Is this what we're supposed to do?

30
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,880
Can we lie down like that?

31
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,850
(Is this your first time
in a prison cell?)

32
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,550
Will you hurry, you brats?

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,950
This looks fun.
I like stuff like this.

34
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,760
You're the underling here
because you came late, Suk Jin.

35
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,450
Look.

36
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,970
"Wisdom comes with age."

37
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,690
Suk Jin, time comes with age.

38
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,500
Isn't it that
"Disease comes with age"?

39
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Farsighted eyes.

40
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,110
If you need wisdom,
you should come to me.

41
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,000
I guess we have
some petty criminals here.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,750
I know.

43
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,780
I can see a few.

44
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,970
I'm pretty sure
you're a petty criminal.

45
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,840
I'm not a petty criminal. I'm...

46
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,340
Oh, I see. You're
an economic criminal.

47
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,480
Is he a white-collar criminal?

48
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,520
- That sounds perfect for him.
- There was a misunderstanding.

49
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,780
I had to come here...

50
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,480
- Are you an economic criminal?
- due to some misunderstanding.

51
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,690
It's very unfortunate.

52
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,890
You know he's a gambler, right?

53
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,160
- What?
- He's a gambler.

54
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,970
- Oh, that's right.
- He's a gambler.

55
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,130
- A gambler.
- I'm okay with that.

56
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,500
He's a member of a gang.

57
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,800
And he's his underling.

58
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,440
- I'm his henchman.
- His minion.

59
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,170
- "Minion"?
- A gangster and his minion.

60
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,310
If you took good care of it,
I wouldn't have come here.

61
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,170
- I'm sorry. It's my fault.
- My gosh.

62
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,200
What about you? Why are you...

63
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,970
(It was a crime of passion.)

64
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,340
It was a crime of passion.

65
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,420
A crime of passion?

66
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,390
Are you the woman?

67
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,750
It was a marriage fraud.

68
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,780
- A marriage fraud?
- A marriage fraud?

69
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,060
She says it was a marriage fraud.

70
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,690
Did you get caught
making fake trades?

71
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,060
No. I was charged
with housebreaking.

72
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,060
Housebreaking?

73
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,250
Why did you do that?

74
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,350
- Why?
- Why?

75
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,970
- Why?
- Why did you break in?

76
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,760
Did you break in to sleep in there?

77
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,500
- Housebreaking?
- I did it to steal something.

78
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,590
I had no idea. She broke in.

79
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,910
Why did you break in?

80
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm a real estate fraud.

81
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,600
I didn't ask.

82
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,810
- The thing is...
- What about you, 2365?

83
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,310
I'm afraid I can't talk to you guys.

84
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,720
- It's like...
- He's a petty offender.

85
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,280
It's about sensitive social...

86
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,880
and international issues.

87
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,490
That's ridiculous.

88
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,490
It has something to do with trade...

89
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,780
- and stuff like that.
- Trade?

90
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,320
I guess you did something good.

91
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,750
- Is that why you're here?
- The thing is...

92
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,000
It's about trade deals
between countries...

93
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,090
Do you know stuff like that?

94
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,400
So you're a pickpocket.

95
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,090
- A pickpocket?
- I'm not a pickpocket.

96
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,240
I'm sure that's what he is.

97
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,100
A guy like him usually gets
beaten up in a movie.

98
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,240
"Let's crush him!"

99
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,380
- Then he cries.
- Do you know anything about WTO?

100
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,570
Why are we locked up
in here, by the way?

101
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,570
(The inmates are locked up
in here without knowing the reason.)

102
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,970
What?

103
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,340
- Someone's coming.
- Who's that?

104
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,510
Stay quiet.

105
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,380
He's the prison officer.

106
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,280
(A prison officer shows up.)

107
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
A prison guard?

108
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,380
- He's the guard.
- He's the prison officer.

109
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,960
- What?
- He is...

110
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
- My gosh.
- He's the guard.

111
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,220
Jae Suk, he's my junior comedian.

112
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,790
- Stay quiet.
- What?

113
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,790
It's not like you're here for fun.

114
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,160
He's the one who said
Se Chan can't paint a big picture.

115
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,500
That's right.

116
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,370
Oh, right. It's him.

117
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,910
- Is that him?
- That's the guy.

118
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,340
- It's Gyu Jin.
- Stay quiet!

119
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,600
- Gyu Jin.
- Right.

120
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,600
(Se Chan and Gyu Jin perform
together in "Comedy Big League".)

121
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,310
(You can't paint a big picture.)

122
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,470
(He told Se Chan the bitter truth.)

123
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,690
(A weekend variety show is no joke.)

124
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,380
(You seem ashamed.)

125
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,310
Keep quiet.

126
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,880
Se Chan who can't paint a big
picture should be extra careful.

127
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,400
- Me?
- Be careful.

128
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,590
Okay. I will.

129
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,500
So you told Se Chan that he can't
paint a big picture the other day.

130
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,760
- Yes, I did.
- Right.

131
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,290
"Yes, I did." He sounds
polite to Jae Suk.

132
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,710
- Wasn't it from the script?
- He's doing an interview.

133
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,260
Are you feeling nervous
around Jae Suk?

134
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,310
Can I stop playing my role here?

135
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,250
No, you can't.

136
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,410
He needs an interview.
You should talk to him.

137
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,680
I'll keep playing my character.

138
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,810
How would you describe Se Chan?

139
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,160
He always asks if I had a meal
whenever we meet.

140
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,490
And he offers good ideas
when we plan our skit.

141
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,060
He's very nice.

142
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,230
What about as your senior?

143
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,890
I don't think there's anything
I can learn from him.

144
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,060
(There's nothing
I can learn from him.)

145
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,190
- Then...
- Hey... Excuse me, Officer!

146
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,830
Forget everything.
What do you think of him...

147
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,560
from the perspective
of a viewer of Running Man?

148
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,130
As a viewer of Running Man...

149
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,570
For the cast members of
"Comedy Big League", Se Chan is...

150
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,380
- almost like Jae Suk.
- Really?

151
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,710
- Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey.

152
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,250
Don't say... I mean, Officer.

153
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,880
- Do you really act that way?
- No.

154
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,620
He has absolute power over us.

155
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,810
- Really?
- Yes.

156
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,210
As a matter of fact,
he has a lot of experience.

157
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,360
He's their senior by many years.

158
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,020
But seeing him on Running Man,

159
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,630
he's almost just like me.

160
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,750
He's almost just like me.

161
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,460
(Se Chan's junior comedian realized
he was a big fish in a small pond.)

162
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,320
Hey, did you plan all this or what?

163
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,240
That guard is trying to
trample on me.

164
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,040
I mean, just like me,

165
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,540
- Of course.
- I can see anxiety in his eyes.

166
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,200
(Gyu Jin stopped being nervous
thanks to Se Chan.)

167
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,140
- I'm worried.
- Anyway, Officer.

168
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,480
- Yes?
- Is there any tip...

169
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,070
on how we should behave here?

170
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,580
Of course, you should
get along well with each other.

171
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,120
- When the newbies arrive,
- Yes.

172
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,450
you should give them
the clothes in these baskets.

173
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,190
- We'll give the uniforms to them?
- No wonder we have a changing room.

174
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,320
- Give them the uniforms,
- Yes.

175
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,250
- and inform them, okay?
- Understood.

176
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,100
Newbies, come on in
if you're ready.

177
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,730
- Who could they be?
- Are they here?

178
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,320
- Who are they?
- Are they coming in right away?

179
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,520
- Oh, my.
- Who are they?

180
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,040
- They're coming... What?
- I heard that actors...

181
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,870
- Young Min is one of them.
- Who?

182
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,560
- And Ji Seung Hyun too.
- Oh, they're...

183
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,760
- I know them.
- Ji Seung Hyun.

184
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,940
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

185
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,810
- Yong Ji, hi.
- Hello.

186
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,480
- Oh, my. Hello.
- Hello.

187
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,000
- Hello, hello.
- Oh, my. Hello.

188
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,310
Why did a lawyer come here?

189
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,310
- Why would a lawyer end up here?
- Hello.

190
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,650
(Ha Do Kwon, Ji Seung Hyun,
Kim Yong Ji, Kim Young Min)

191
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,360
First, please introduce yourself.

192
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,930
You're still wearing this when
"Hot Stove League" ended long ago.

193
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,670
(He made a big impression playing
Kang Doo Ki on "Hot Stove League".)

194
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,370
(Ha Do Kwon,
the great supporting actor)

195
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
(I am here...)

196
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,460
(on Running Man!)

197
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,350
"Hot Stove League" ended long ago.
Why are you still wearing it?

198
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,310
- He must be into his character.
- Exactly.

199
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,810
I'm still practicing baseball hard.

200
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,210
- Are you still practicing?
- Yes, I am.

201
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,350
He has such a great voice.

202
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,420
He has a great voice.

203
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,250
Actually, I think he looks like
a prison inmate...

204
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,290
- more than anyone of us.
- Exactly.

205
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,790
Right? You see, he looks like...

206
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,130
an inmate who fights against
Jong Kook over power.

207
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,190
(Ha Do Kwon Clan
versus Kim Jong Kook Clan)

208
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,320
That sounds plausible.

209
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,520
- He looks upset.
- Indeed.

210
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm going to get just one person.

211
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,240
- Oh, gosh. Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

212
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,940
(He declared war fearlessly.)

213
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,240
- It's been a while...
- That's good.

214
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,630
- since Park Sung Woong came here.
- I like this.

215
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,980
Anyway, do you guys know...

216
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,110
- what your crimes are?
- Yes.

217
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,640
Why are you here?

218
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,380
I'm imprisoned because I make
people around me...

219
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,640
feel unnecessarily nervous
with a menacing face.

220
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,420
But your face looks cute.
I don't understand.

221
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,510
He doesn't look menacing.

222
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,690
Look how he chuckles.

223
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,930
- You know,
- He looks just cute.

224
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,750
- they already created tension.
- He says you look cute.

225
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,600
He looks just cute. Why?

226
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,870
- This is real.
- Yes.

227
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,630
But he lives in Anyang,

228
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,940
and I used to live
in Indeokwon, Anyang.

229
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,240
- Really?
- They suddenly became friends.

230
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,330
- Are you younger than Jong Kook?
- How old are you?

231
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,700
You're older than me.
You were born in 1976, right?

232
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,940
- I was born in 1977.
- Really?

233
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,330
Which school did you go to?

234
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,050
I went to school in Gangnam.

235
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,140
Oh, in Gangnam?

236
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,980
- Then...
- Then he wouldn't like you so much.

237
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,440
- His voice is so charming.
- He values his school ties.

238
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,690
- Any school in Anyang.
- He's here to live.

239
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,650
- That's why he's here.
- Jong Kook really is a big fan...

240
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,580
- of regionalism and school ties.
- Exactly.

241
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,580
- I'm a big fan.
- He likes people from his hometown.

242
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,450
- That's right.
- Also, he...

243
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,500
- majored in vocal music at SNU.
- Really?

244
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,960
(Wow. Really?)

245
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,890
- At Seoul National University?
- Oh, Seoul National University.

246
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,940
- What is it?
- Nothing.

247
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,500
- You see,
- Yes.

248
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,980
the point
we should pay attention to is...

249
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,570
- that he majored in vocal music.
- Oh, I see.

250
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,000
- Not the university.
- It's a great university.

251
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,550
- He feels different from us.
- His image has changed.

252
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,810
He feels completely different now.

253
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,070
Do Kwon, could you...

254
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,420
sing a song for us?

255
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,140
The weather was nice
on my way here.

256
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,750
- It was sunny.
- A song to sing on a day like this.

257
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,560
- "O Sole Mio" would be great.
- "O Sole Mio"?

258
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,020
- "O Sole Mio".
- I'll sing the climax.

259
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,750
He has such a great voice.

260
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,890
I've never seen anyone
who graduated from SNU.

261
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,110
(Do Kwon's powerful voice
made their jaws drop.)

262
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,540
(His gentle voice is
resonating in the prison.)

263
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,670
He's amazing.

264
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,330
(His enchanting voice
wins hearts of women.)

265
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,550
(The song reached its climax!)

266
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,790
This is the important part.

267
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,230
(Breathing out heavily)

268
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,840
(He has goosebumps.)

269
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,380
(The dignifying, mesmerizing voice)

270
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,270
- That was amazing.
- And it's early morning.

271
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,480
- In this early morning.
- I practiced a little.

272
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,500
(Even a singer is impressed too.)

273
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,510
It's so early. I bet his voice
hadn't even been warmed up.

274
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,540
- He's incredible.
- My gosh. That was...

275
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,450
- That was absolutely beautiful.
- Next up is...

276
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,490
Ji Seung Hyun.

277
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,620
Hi. I'm Ji Seung Hyun.

278
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,090
(He starred in "The Gentlemen of
Wolgyesu Tailor Shop" and "Wish".)

279
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,750
(He's the actor who created
the legendary scene from "Wish".)

280
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,970
(He's good at emotional scenes
as well as action scenes!)

281
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,790
(He starred in various works.)

282
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
(Ji Seung Hyun,
the popular scene-stealer)

283
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,210
- When I was in Busan,
- Yes.

284
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,980
I was the leader of a gang group
called "Monster".

285
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,980
- He still has that vibe.
- That's exactly how he spoke.

286
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,580
- He still has that vibe.
- He spoke like that in the movie.

287
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,750
Awesome.

288
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,220
- That was the name, right?
- Yes.

289
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,280
- I'm getting nervous.
- That's right.

290
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,220
- Seung Hyun has met...
- Yes.

291
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,910
Ji Hyo before. Right, Seung Hyun?

292
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,830
We both starred
in "Lovely Horribly".

293
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,490
- "Lovely Horribly".
- So did I.

294
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,730
- I also worked with So Min.
- So Min too?

295
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,230
- She can't remember that.
- In the drama, "Maids".

296
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,870
(Laughing)

297
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,130
- She didn't know.
- "Maids".

298
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,470
She said she had never
met him before.

299
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,470
Apologize to him now.

300
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,980
- I'm sorry.
- So Min.

301
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,210
How did you not know
when you starred in the same drama?

302
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,000
She sees only what she wants to see.

303
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,250
- I remember that now.
- She forgot about him.

304
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,670
However...

305
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,640
Seung Hyun, is this your first time
on a variety show?

306
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,380
I appeared on a variety show
that you hosted.

307
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,780
- On another channel.
- You mean, "Happy Together"?

308
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,460
- Hold on. He didn't remember that.
- Did you just realize that?

309
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,680
(He got caught.
He failed to get away with it.)

310
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,250
- You didn't remember that, right?
- Jae Suk.

311
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,330
- I don't think he remembered.
- He usually remembers his guests.

312
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,520
I can't believe you.

313
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,260
I mean, he took a photo with him
like they were friends.

314
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,130
(One Day Friendship Photo)

315
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,630
- He changed his hairstyle.
- You shouldn't be like this.

316
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,240
- He does look different though.
- I was so surprised.

317
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,740
Next up is...

318
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,670
Kim Yong Ji.

319
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,980
(She starred in "The King: Eternal
Monarch" and "Mr. Sunshine".)

320
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,850
(She pulled off a double role
in "The King: Eternal Monarch".)

321
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,140
(Kim Yong Ji, the rising star)

322
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,320
(She stayed by Yoo Yeon Seok's side
quietly in "Mr. Sunshine".)

323
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,250
(Her crime is enchanting the viewers
with her irresistible charms.)

324
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,130
- She looked like Japanese.
- Indeed.

325
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,290
- I thought she was Japanese.
- Are you...

326
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,290
actually fluent in Japanese?

327
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,660
- I can't speak Japanese.
- Not at all?

328
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,890
- It was just her role.
- I see.

329
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,070
- Have you ever studied overseas?
- Yes, I have.

330
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
- Where?
- Oh, my.

331
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,340
In Canada.

332
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,570
- That suits her.
- Really?

333
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,930
- No wonder.
- In Canada?

334
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,900
I have a feeling that
she's good at speaking English.

335
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,250
- She looks like a foreigner.
- We were talking about Japan.

336
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,980
Why did you say "No wonder"?
Based on what...

337
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,640
- What made you think that way?
- Just...

338
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,220
- Don't say anything.
- She looks like Canadian.

339
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,120
- Why would you ask that?
- Just let me continue.

340
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,410
- I was starting to interview her.
- "No wonder."

341
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,820
- Don't say anything.
- She looks like...

342
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,650
- "No wonder."
- I knew it. No wonder.

343
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,000
You like maple syrup, right?

344
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,250
- Yes, very much so.
- "No wonder."

345
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,700
- "No wonder."
- "No wonder."

346
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,030
(The magical comment,
"No wonder.")

347
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,200
- It suits her.
- In Canada.

348
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,370
"No wonder."

349
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,870
(Somehow, it feels like
she'll do well on the show.)

350
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,110
All right. Following Yong Ji,

351
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,470
our next guest is Kim Young Min.

352
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,900
(He starred in
"A World of Married Couple"...)

353
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,340
(and "Crash Landing on You".)

354
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,320
(He played the worst husband
in "A World of Married Couple".)

355
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,220
(His crime is stealing women's
hearts with his fatal charms.)

356
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,120
He played a husband
who cheats on his wife many times...

357
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,330
- in "A World of Married Couple".
- I see.

358
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,050
But in real life, he got married
after dating for five years,

359
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,460
and he's been married for 13 years.

360
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,000
(He's been married for 13 years.)

361
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,970
What kind of husband are you
in real life?

362
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,870
I'm an obedient husband.

363
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,530
- Really? You are?
- Yes.

364
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,130
Are you more like your character
in the drama or the way you are now?

365
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,610
He wouldn't be like that character.

366
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,080
(He burst out laughing.)

367
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,850
- Wouldn't it be weird if he was?
- That's not what I meant.

368
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,720
- Listen to me.
- What kind of question was that?

369
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,750
- That was a bad question.
- You're the worst.

370
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,850
- You can't just pretend like that.
- I mean, what do you even mean?

371
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,820
Trust me. He must have
a little of that side in him.

372
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,780
- That's ridiculous.
- That can't be true.

373
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,830
- How else could he do it so well?
- Suk Jin.

374
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,600
- Gosh. That's ridiculous.
- Think of what he did in the drama.

375
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,050
That was just acting.

376
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,920
By the way, there's a song
called "There She Is".

377
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,160
- <i>I'm so happy you're here</i>
- I know that song.

378
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,530
- When we go to karaoke,
- Yes.

379
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,110
- this song is always the highlight.
- We sing at the climax.

380
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,080
I guess you sing the song often.
Is it your favorite song?

381
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,530
Yes, it's one of my favorite songs.

382
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,880
I see. "There She Is" is very...

383
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,610
<i>One day</i>

384
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,270
<i>- She left me
- She left me</i>

385
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,990
(He suddenly started dancing.)

386
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,960
(No one expected him
to start dancing.)

387
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,460
He's so cute. He's so adorable!

388
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,490
<i>I'm happy, I'm happy,
I'm happy you're here</i>

389
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,360
(He's dancing
like he's being electrocuted.)

390
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,890
(I love funny dances
for variety shows.)

391
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,390
<i>I'm happy you're here</i>

392
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,660
<i>She's back, she's back,
she came back to me</i>

393
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,500
(It's hard to breathe.)

394
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,160
That's his true color.

395
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,670
(After letting out his excitement
to the end,)

396
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,670
(he's back as the shy Young Min.)

397
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,580
- That's his true color.
- Which is?

398
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,000
This is the real him.

399
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,850
- I'm so scared.
- This is the real him.

400
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,320
- I disagree.
- No. Listen.

401
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,910
- It's his character in the drama.
- No way.

402
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,680
- He's faking it right now.
- Jae Suk, this is the real him.

403
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,090
<i>I'm happy, I'm happy</i>

404
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,330
- He acted so playful suddenly.
- He reminds me of Im Chang Jung.

405
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,730
(Young Min revealed
an unexpected side of him.)

406
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,960
- "Dance with Wolf".
- That was unexpected.

407
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,460
Okay. All right.

408
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,570
- We will...
- You have to change your clothes.

409
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,290
You should get changed.

410
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,840
Newbies, please go
and change your clothes.

411
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,930
(While the newbies are gone
to change clothes...)

412
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,110
- Stop it.
- What?

413
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,770
- I'll be back shortly.
- Where are you going?

414
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,080
You shouldn't do that. Come back.

415
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,320
You should immerse yourself
in your character. Come on in.

416
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,750
What is this for?

417
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,960
- To hang clothes.
- Hang your bag here.

418
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,510
Hang it there.

419
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,990
- No, I won't.
- Why?

420
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,150
- No, someone...
- Trust me.

421
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,290
There must be a thief...

422
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,750
- among the inmates.
- They're here.

423
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,390
There's a woman too.

424
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,330
- They are the newbies.
- Okay.

425
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,470
(We are newbies.)

426
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,790
Shall we begin?

427
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,110
- All of a sudden?
- Good. This is nice.

428
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,610
Do you want hazing or something?

429
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,110
- They are good.
- I'm immersed in my role.

430
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,380
There you go.

431
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,980
It's stirring up dust!

432
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,950
Why are you doing it
when there are people around?

433
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,080
We will work hard.

434
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,880
- They are different.
- They're good.

435
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,950
They're different indeed.

436
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,220
It looks perfect for him.

437
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,280
I know.

438
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,460
It looks like he's done this before.

439
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,990
It doesn't seem like his first day.

440
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,830
Do Kwon? Okay.

441
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,660
- Good.
- Well done.

442
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,420
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

443
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,500
What are you doing?

444
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,970
- Why are you acting like the head?
- He wants to be the head.

445
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,370
Don't pretend like
you're the head here.

446
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,340
I just thought they were
being quite obedient.

447
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,270
All right. Are you done
changing your clothes?

448
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,900
Yes.

449
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,580
- You're back, Officer.
- He's back.

450
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,910
You come here quite often.

451
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,620
- What do we do now?
- We get to see you a lot.

452
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,250
There will be more
than that. You'll see.

453
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,650
- He's good.
- You guys look good in the uniform.

454
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,380
- Okay.
- And you look beautiful.

455
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,380
(You guys look good in the uniform.
And you look beautiful.)

456
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,390
So you know we're having
the work program at 3 p.m.

457
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,500
(The work program is...)

458
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,760
(scheduled for 3 p.m.)

459
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,790
(Running Prison Schedule)

460
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,610
(Work Program)

461
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,870
- What's that?
- What's the program for?

462
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,530
Here's a brief description
of the program.

463
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:52,500
You will have a tough time
so you won't commit a crime again.

464
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,080
Make sure to brace yourselves.

465
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,510
There's a rumor that Se Chan's mouth
became like that after the last one.

466
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,650
- I bet he got hit.
- Did I get hit in the mouth?

467
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,460
- He got hit in the head.
- You're doing this well.

468
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,290
- It was pulled out.
- That's because you got hit.

469
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,370
That's why it's sticking out.

470
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,160
You're just like me.

471
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,660
- Did he get hit as well?
- Don't you make fun of me.

472
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,370
Is that why?

473
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,130
It grazed his mouth.

474
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,240
(As they all burst into laughter,)

475
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,670
(he feels at ease.)

476
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,170
I got hit,
and you were just grazed.

477
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,880
- Yours is sticking out a lot.
- You're right.

478
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,120
- Don't even try to escape.
- Okay.

479
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,320
And... Hang on.

480
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,180
(The novice officer
picks up something.)

481
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,360
- What's that?
- What?

482
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
- This is...
- Do we have rules here?

483
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,750
- We have rules.
- Gosh, we have partners.

484
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,000
- What?
- These are the rules.

485
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,230
(Rules of Running Prison)

486
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,100
- "Each inmate has a partner."
- We have partners?

487
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,370
I guess that's why
we have numbers on here.

488
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,570
"Once my partner is eliminated,
I get eliminated as well."

489
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,760
I think we're already paired up
with partners.

490
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,340
- What's going on?
- So who's my partner?

491
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,800
- Do we not know that?
- We don't.

492
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,340
- The right one?
- My number is 22.

493
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,130
- I think it's the left one.
- My number is 10.

494
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,350
We are partners.

495
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,710
- All right.
- Is this it?

496
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,250
- It's a secret.
- Is it 02 "diarrhea"?

497
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,540
- I bet there's a secret.
- Are we partners?

498
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,820
It says 02 "diarrhea".

499
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,640
- I think you're my partner.
- No.

500
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,180
It says farsighted eyes.

501
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,480
You can have a chat later.

502
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,630
Keep quiet.

503
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,450
As you guys know, you should...

504
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,420
- I think you're my partner.
- No.

505
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,460
- It says farsighted eyes.
- What's your number?

506
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,030
- Farsighted eyes.
- All right then.

507
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,070
Let me see.

508
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,490
I'm speaking.

509
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,400
The officer has something to say.

510
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
- I'm still talking.
- You're number 10.

511
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
I'm sorry.

512
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,610
Se Chan! I'm reading my line.

513
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,810
Why is he yelling at me only?

514
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,440
- He wants to rely on you.
- He's yelling only at me.

515
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,780
I'm trying to help you
paint a big picture.

516
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,790
- Are you trying to help me?
- Sure.

517
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,590
Why are your eyes so red?

518
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,060
- That's because he couldn't sleep.
- He couldn't sleep last night.

519
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,360
His eyes are red because
he lacks sleep and feels nervous.

520
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,290
- I know what it is.
- So it's not makeup.

521
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,190
No. Gyu Jin, please continue.

522
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,770
This is a letter, but it doesn't
say a sender or a recipient.

523
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,100
I don't know why we have it here.

524
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,460
- What's that?
- Let me see.

525
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,540
(A mysterious letter
has arrived at the prison.)

526
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,570
- Mr. Yang.
- Me?

527
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,110
He's helping you to paint
a big picture now.

528
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,730
- It's for a big picture.
- Are you serious?

529
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,280
- Follow me.
- Am I becoming a star?

530
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
- It's for your big picture.
- What's going on?

531
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,320
What is he doing?

532
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,050
I'll make you a star. Come here.

533
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,590
What?

534
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,440
- You'll make me a star?
- You'll be a star.

535
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,090
- What's going on?
- He's going to be a star.

536
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,760
Can I leave, Jae Suk?

537
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,650
- Go.
- He just left.

538
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,920
- What now?
- Stay right there.

539
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,130
- Don't turn around.
- Maybe he'll get a mission.

540
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,450
- Maybe he'll be a spy.
- You're not supposed to look.

541
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,360
- What?
- I can see you from there.

542
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,630
Why do I have to be here?

543
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,030
I can see him from there.

544
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,340
- There must be something.
- This isn't a big picture.

545
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,770
He's helping you
paint a big picture.

546
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,040
There must be something.

547
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,370
I think something's going on.

548
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,470
I think there's something important.

549
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,700
- It says 34.
- Can I take a look?

550
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,130
Don't turn around.

551
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,670
Ji Hyo and So Min, come back here.

552
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,350
- What's this supposed to be?
- Don't look at this.

553
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,440
(He feels flustered
as the inmates approach him.)

554
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,740
- "731".
- Gosh, no.

555
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,860
It's not fake.
It's really dangerous.

556
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,380
Bring it back.

557
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,260
- Take it from her.
- It's real.

558
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,650
- What's wrong with her?
- Don't act spontaneously.

559
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,330
- Gyu Jin is flustered.
- What is she doing?

560
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,920
- What's wrong with her?
- What is she doing?

561
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,960
So Min.

562
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,660
He's a rookie comedian.

563
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,300
- Give it back to me.
- Don't act spontaneously.

564
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,270
- Give me that.
- What's wrong with her?

565
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,930
- Why is she being like this?
- It's not an imitation.

566
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,630
- Give me.
- Give it back to him.

567
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,880
Don't be so spontaneous.
He's a rookie comedian.

568
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,350
He'd be flustered.

569
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,080
He has his own script.

570
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,940
Why are you being like this?

571
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,710
Don't do anything weird.

572
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,140
Can we just do anything
we want here?

573
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,240
You can do anything freely.

574
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,360
- Hang on.
- Can I get my own way?

575
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,760
As So Min messed with him,
Do Kwon asked,

576
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,950
"Can we just do anything
we want here?"

577
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,030
(So this is what we do.)

578
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,630
- You can have your own way.
- I can? I see.

579
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,070
- A weekend variety show is no joke.
- I know. It's not easy.

580
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,690
I'll tell you what to do. Come here.

581
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,100
What is Se Chan doing there?

582
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,730
- What is Se Chan doing there?
- He's getting special treatment.

583
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,510
He's talking to Se Chan.

584
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,780
(The officer tells
Se Chan something.)

585
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,630
Are they talking
about something important?

586
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,380
To me? Only me?

587
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,640
- Yes.
- Okay.

588
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,740
(What are these two
talking about now?)

589
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,850
Okay. Please make me a star.

590
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,380
(He comes back after hearing
something from the officer.)

591
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,590
- You can do this.
- Okay.

592
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,180
Tell us what he said.

593
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,060
- This isn't what usually happens.
- I know.

594
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,560
Why is he speaking
openly about something?

595
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,150
Gosh, this is a good one.

596
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,030
- What is it?
- I tried to read his lips.

597
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,660
- He said, "Only me?"
- What is it?

598
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,840
Did he tell you how to escape?
What was it about?

599
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,660
I can't tell you. I don't want
to share it with everyone.

600
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,960
Did he tell you about your partner?

601
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,540
No. It wasn't about partners.

602
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
It was about a benefit.

603
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,880
- A benefit?
- What was the letter for?

604
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,310
- I don't know about the letter.
- He didn't hear about it.

605
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,940
Look at Gyu Jin. He's talking
to the writer with a smile on.

606
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,480
I bet things went well.

607
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,550
Congratulations.

608
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,880
I'm really happy for you.

609
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,060
They seem happy.
As soon as he leaves...

610
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,980
- The writer seems satisfied.
- They even slapped high-fives.

611
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,060
They even slapped high-fives.
She thinks he did a good job.

612
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,990
- They look excited.
- Now he's smiling.

613
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,530
Gyu Jin's hands were
soaked in sweat.

614
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,990
You made a successful debut
in Running Man.

615
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,160
It was successful.

616
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,310
You guys are inmates
of Running Prison.

617
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,900
And you all are paired up
with your partners.

618
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,970
Who's my partner?

619
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,510
As the rules say,

620
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,940
your fates are entwined.

621
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,850
You will receive
what your partner earns,

622
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,380
and once your partner is eliminated,
you get eliminated as well.

623
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,480
Really?

624
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,790
So this is how you will
find out your partners.

625
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,920
You will team up randomly
and play games in each round.

626
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,390
And the winning teams will get
the commissary money of 10 dollars.

627
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,960
And your partners will get
the same amount of money as well.

628
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,930
(The winning team and their partners
will get the same commissary money.)

629
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,700
If you're on the same team
with your partner,

630
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,340
you get another 10 dollars.

631
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,730
(If they team up with their partner,
they get another 10 dollars.)

632
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,610
- Now I understand how it goes.
- So it's important...

633
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,510
to make a good guess
and team up with my partner.

634
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,670
With the prize money you earned,
you can use the commissary.

635
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,790
There's a commissary.

636
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,640
But if your partner spends money,

637
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,480
the same amount will be
deducted from yours.

638
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,680
- So we share our destiny.
- Saving money is no good.

639
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,180
- We should spend the money.
- We should.

640
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,650
The amount of money
you earn or spend...

641
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,860
is not open to others.

642
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,630
You can find out your partner
using the amount.

643
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,930
Before the work program,
find out your partner...

644
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,870
and escape from the prison
while the officer is away.

645
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,110
For the work program, you should
follow the officer's lead.

646
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,110
Okay.

647
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,170
Stand in two lines.

648
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,170
(Officer Shin Gyu Jin guides the
inmates with a comfortable voice.)

649
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,080
- What's all this?
- Follow me.

650
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
(Officer Shin Gyu Jin guides the
inmates with a comfortable voice.)

651
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,120
The gym looks nice.

652
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,140
(There's a gym
in front of their cell.)

653
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,710
- I agree.
- It's a rugby ball.

654
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,910
I guess it's a rugby ball.

655
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,450
- Come here.
- Is it rugby?

656
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,620
This is Jae Suk's favorite game.

657
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,720
- I love watching the NFL.
- He really does.

658
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,130
I don't know the rules though.

659
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,150
- I'm glad that you brought it up.
- All right.

660
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,630
But this is a special rugby game.

661
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,840
- A special rugby game?
- The rules are different.

662
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,660
The men will have
their hands and feet tied up.

663
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,200
You'll tie up our hands and feet?

664
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,430
With your hands and feet tied up.

665
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,080
And the women will have
their feet tied up...

666
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,580
- Only the feet?
- for this game.

667
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,910
The men are supposed
to throw the ball to score.

668
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,410
And the women can
only score a touchdown.

669
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,260
If the men score a goal,
they get three points.

670
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,600
If the women score a touchdown,
they get 10 points.

671
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,660
10 points?

672
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,930
It's a big difference.

673
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,160
You'll be playing for 10 minutes.

674
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,730
And the team with the highest
points wins the game.

675
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,470
All the members
of the winning team...

676
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,880
and their partners will
get the prize money of 10 dollars.

677
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,120
- So I...
- How do we team up?

678
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,650
I've already divided
you guys into teams.

679
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,090
- You did?
- You did it already?

680
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,120
Sure.

681
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,830
I split you guys into teams
to make Se Chan a star.

682
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,990
- Really?
- I planned the whole thing.

683
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,460
He's painting
a big picture for Se Chan.

684
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,690
- Here's the first team.
- Okay.

685
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,430
Song Ji Hyo, Ha Do Kwon,

686
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,070
Ji Suk Jin, and Yang Se Chan.

687
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,900
(Song Ji Hyo, Ha Do Kwon,
Ji Suk Jin, and Yang Se Chan?)

688
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,400
- This is a big picture.
- Hang on. Is this a big picture?

689
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,510
Wait. I can't be a star this way.

690
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,410
This is... It's just not right.

691
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,080
I think he called my name.

692
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,820
(They don't seem to be able
to paint even a small picture.)

693
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,320
This isn't a big picture.

694
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,820
- Are we a team?
- We're a team.

695
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,150
You can lead the team
to paint a big picture.

696
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
I watched all your episodes.

697
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,830
You always get eliminated
in the beginning.

698
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,770
- That was a long time ago.
- Are you sure?

699
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,770
- I want to win the prize money.
- With our hands and feet tied up?

700
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,960
(Team Green:
Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, Se Chan, Do Kwon)

701
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,430
(Team Yellow: Jae Suk,
Kwang Soo, So Min, Seung Hyun)

702
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,510
(Team Blue: Jong Kook, Haha,
Young Min, Yong Ji)

703
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,580
- Ji Hyo, you can score 10 points.
- You should score.

704
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,280
- We should pass the ball to her.
- That's what we need to do.

705
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,710
If things don't go well,
we will have to throw the ball.

706
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,350
All right. Let's begin
the first game.

707
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,320
We can't do this
even for five minutes.

708
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,350
(Team Yellow versus Team Green)

709
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,150
- Go.
- You're so good.

710
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,150
- Grab it.
- You're so good.

711
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,630
Pass the ball.

712
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,450
Gosh, they're fast.

713
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,160
It's okay. Take your time.

714
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,460
Over here.

715
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,490
(Team Green passes the ball
to create space.)

716
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,730
- That's right, Ji Hyo. Go.
- Okay.

717
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,840
We're so good at this.

718
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,110
We have to block Ji Hyo.

719
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,780
We have to block Ji Hyo.

720
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,050
Block her.

721
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,200
(They've got Ji Hyo covered.)

722
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,710
You have to go there. Suk Jin.

723
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,240
Slowly.

724
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,290
I'll block them.

725
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,410
Pass. Pass it to Do Kwon.

726
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,980
No. Why are you passing it to me?

727
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,150
- No.
- Give it to Do Kwon.

728
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,380
(It gets passed to Do Kwon.)

729
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,380
No.

730
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,300
(He spots Ji Hyo in the corner.)

731
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,330
Give it back to me.

732
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,690
- Touch the ground!
- Touch the ground!

733
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,070
(He successfully passes to Ji Hyo.)

734
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,490
- Yes!
- Yes!

735
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,300
(They get a touchdown!)

736
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,770
(It's an unexpectedly amazing
scene created by the weakest team.)

737
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,670
Who was it? They are really good.

738
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,670
We're so good. This is crazy.

739
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,440
Gosh, that was incredible.

740
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,470
Hey.

741
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,880
We can do it like that too.

742
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,790
Let's start in the middle.

743
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,980
In the middle.

744
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,680
(But...)

745
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,380
(He speeds towards the goalpost.)

746
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,560
You said we were starting
in the middle.

747
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,450
You said we were starting
in the middle.

748
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,800
(He plays the game like the infamous
petty criminal he is.)

749
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,330
(You said we were starting
in the middle.)

750
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,030
(Hitting)

751
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,920
(Hitting)

752
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,070
(After a scuffle...)

753
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,100
- Wait. Hold on.
- Okay!

754
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,430
Are we allowed to hit people?

755
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,370
So Min, you need to come inside
no matter what.

756
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,080
Ji Hyo, we're allowed to hit people.

757
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,130
- That's three points.
- Ji Hyo.

758
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,470
- We're allowed to hit people?
- Careful!

759
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,810
There's someone behind you.

760
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,810
(After Kwang Soo's scuffle,)

761
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,940
(Tiger Moth So Min
starts getting physical.)

762
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,880
(At that moment,
Ji Hyo gets through an opening.)

763
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,680
- Ji Hyo!
- Touch the ground!

764
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
(He passes to Ji Hyo right away.)

765
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,560
(They get a touchdown.)

766
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,390
(She caught that?)

767
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,300
Hey. We're in trouble.

768
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,830
Touchdown!

769
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,490
Touchdown!

770
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,340
- Amazing.
- Nice.

771
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,960
This is really like
American football.

772
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,400
- Really?
- Yes.

773
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,110
We have to focus. We do.

774
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,780
- We're on a roll right now!
- Let's go!

775
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,020
This is really like
American football.

776
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,080
- Defense.
- Running back, quarterback.

777
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,180
(He passes to So Min.)

778
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,680
- Touch the ground!
- Hurry up!

779
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,910
(What's this?)

780
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,860
- No!
- You're scaring me.

781
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,290
(She caught the ball, so why is she
rolling on the ground?)

782
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,290
What are you doing?

783
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,150
(Tiger Moth So Min is more concerned
about fighting than getting points.)

784
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,300
(Hitting)

785
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,990
(Tiger Moth So Min is more concerned
about fighting than getting points.)

786
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,600
No!

787
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
What are you doing?

788
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,190
(After a pointless scuffle,)

789
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,800
(she tries to get a touchdown.)

790
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,610
(If the ball crosses the line while
she holds it, it's a touchdown.)

791
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,110
(She let go of the ball.)

792
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,380
No, she didn't get a point.

793
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,380
(Unfortunately,
she failed to score.)

794
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,940
You should've run. That's too bad.

795
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,910
- So Min! Hey, So Min!
- Hey!

796
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
We were almost there.

797
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,150
(Team Green is
on the offense again.)

798
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,590
Ji Hyo. Block Ji Hyo.

799
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,100
(They invoke the ace alert.)

800
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,160
(Kwang Soo marks her.)

801
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,490
Hey. Hold on. Hey! Let go!

802
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,430
Gosh, you're crazy!

803
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,040
(He grabs her by the shirt
and carries her away.)

804
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,780
(Regardless of where the ball is,
his defense is grabbing her shirt.)

805
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,400
We got this. Seung Hyun, go up.

806
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,020
Do it! Pass it!

807
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,470
(They have 2 minutes left.)

808
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,980
(Se Chan interferes
right in front of him.)

809
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,590
(Hitting)

810
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:46,290
(It's a dignified play by someone
who loves American football.)

811
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,760
- Gosh.
- Hey. Seung Hyun!

812
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,870
Do Kwon! Pass it to Ji Hyo!

813
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,100
(He passes the package to Ji Hyo.)

814
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,130
Ji Hyo.

815
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,570
Touch the ground! Nice.

816
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,040
They're no match for us.

817
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,230
(The final score is 3 to 30.
Team Green wins.)

818
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,900
They're so good.

819
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,610
Pass it.

820
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,080
We need to practice.

821
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,280
- Are you practicing?
- We could've done better.

822
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,680
(They're warming up by passing
the ball.)

823
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,680
- She's good at catching.
- Gosh, she is.

824
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,650
- She's good.
- Okay.

825
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,630
I won't look at the ball
for this round.

826
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,950
I won't look at the ball,
and I'll focus on Jong Kook.

827
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,490
If you get the ball, run straight.
I'll grab onto Jong Kook.

828
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,190
- If I get the ball...
- This is Do Kwon's plan.

829
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,630
If I get the ball,

830
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,230
- I'll pass it, then grab Jong Kook.
- Okay.

831
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,340
Jong Kook, Do Kwon is determined
to get you this round.

832
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,900
- He just declared war on you.
- Are they finally facing off?

833
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,580
Right? Look at your arms.

834
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,940
- Why are you determined to get me?
- You will see...

835
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,520
- the ultimate scuffle.
- Do Kwon finally gets his chance.

836
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,470
Jong Kook, you have to be
on your toes this round.

837
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,980
Okay. Ready.

838
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,180
(Kim Jong Kook's Team Blue versus
Ha Do Kwon's Team Green)

839
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,380
(Ha Do Kwon said he's here
to get just one person.)

840
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,650
(And that chance has come.)

841
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,390
(What is the result of this match?)

842
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,390
You're fast!

843
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,690
(The second round starts.)

844
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,600
(Do Kwon runs ferociously
as soon as the game starts.)

845
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,700
(He misses on his 1st collision.)

846
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,230
Where should I pass to?

847
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,110
(They finally go up
against each other.)

848
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,170
(They begin tackling each other
without thinking about the ball.)

849
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,470
Where is it?

850
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,080
(Hitting)

851
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Where is it?

852
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,590
(What?)

853
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,760
Do Kwon... Do Kwon...

854
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,030
Do Kwon. You took a fall.

855
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,630
He's scared.
Do Kwon, don't get scared.

856
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,220
Over there.

857
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,490
Do Kwon is so funny.

858
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,370
Are you okay?

859
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,160
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

860
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,510
I think Do Kwon is sulking.

861
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,010
- Okay.
- Ready.

862
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,110
Do Kwon, get over here.

863
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,670
Start.

864
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,670
(We acknowledge his determination.
He's still covering Jong Kook.)

865
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,980
(He's not looking at the ball.
He's only looking at Jong Kook.)

866
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,260
Come in. Haha.
We have to do it fast.

867
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,150
(They're having a fierce battle
for the ball on Team Blue's side.)

868
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,980
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin!

869
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
(The weakest link, Suk Jin,
grabs the ball.)

870
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,030
Suk Jin.

871
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
- Take it.
- Let go!

872
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,570
Suk Jin.

873
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,190
Young Min is terrible at games.

874
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,510
(He's practically a paper doll.)

875
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,160
Why don't you have any strength?

876
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,130
(After the scuffle, Team Green
successfully steals the ball.)

877
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,170
Give it to Ji Hyo.

878
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,700
(He safely passes the ball
to Ha Do Kwon.)

879
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,120
- You.
- Ji Hyo, get in there.

880
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,520
(He can get a point if he can
get it in there,)

881
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,940
(but a 2nd collision occurs.)

882
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,020
(Flying)

883
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,220
(I feel bad for him.)

884
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,530
- It went in.
- It went in.

885
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,760
Ha Do Kwon.

886
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
(He exchanged his health
for the point.)

887
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,990
I feel like I've been in
a car accident.

888
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,990
(I feel like I've been in
a car accident.)

889
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,390
(The game starts again
with Team Blue on defense.)

890
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,430
Block him.

891
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
(He arrives in front of
the goal post in no time.)

892
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,700
- Block him. What are you doing?
- Block him.

893
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,960
- It's okay.
- What are you doing?

894
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,310
Okay. You have to get it in.

895
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,510
Come here.

896
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,700
(He's biding his time to pass to
Yong Ji to get 10 points.)

897
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,200
- Shoot.
- You have to get it in.

898
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,580
(He's still covering Jong Kook.)

899
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,410
- Good.
- Shoot.

900
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,780
(Because they have a tight defense,
it's hard to pass.)

901
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,180
His facial expression is so cheeky.

902
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,120
(He passes it to Haha.)

903
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,480
- Do Kwon, you have to get it in.
- I'm Do Kwon.

904
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,590
(Se Chan blocks it.)

905
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,680
- Hey.
- Do Kwon!

906
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,950
I'm Do Kwon.

907
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,800
(The ball rolls towards
Jong Kook and Do Kwon.)

908
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,870
(These two people go after the ball
at the same time.)

909
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,130
(After a complete loss,
a second match was created.)

910
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,160
(What are the results this time?)

911
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,700
(Jong Kook fell!)

912
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,130
Do Kwon.
Block Jong Kook. Do Kwon.

913
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,200
(He knocks over Jong Kook
and pushes the ball away.)

914
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,050
Pass it to Ji Hyo.

915
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,670
(He passes the ball to Ji Hyo.)

916
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,410
Nice.

917
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,020
Did she get it in?

918
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,680
(I finally did it!)

919
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,560
(I acknowledge his tenacity.)

920
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,290
He's so cool!

921
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,180
- Goodness.
- Did she get it in?

922
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,420
(Thanks to Do Kwon's pass,
Team Green gets 10 points.)

923
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,370
My goodness.

924
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,990
(They're out of energy.)

925
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,660
Do Kwon, don't get tired. Get up!

926
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,430
Cover Jong Kook some more!

927
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,070
- He's not a human being.
- Let's go!

928
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,130
He's not a human being.

929
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,280
- Do Kwon is amazing.
- Let's go.

930
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,580
I'm going to die here.

931
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,380
- That's right.
- Come in.

932
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,120
- Come here.
- Over here.

933
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,520
We're open here.

934
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,090
(Shouting)

935
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,210
(The tiger is out of control.)

936
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,590
Does this make sense?

937
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,680
- Does this make sense?
- Okay. We got it.

938
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,950
Can't we end this?

939
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,190
Let's end the game.

940
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,040
We still have that left.

941
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,230
With a score of 40 to 13,
Team Kim Yong Ji wins.

942
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,230
Okay.

943
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,160
That was good.

944
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,580
- You should've protected him.
- Hold on.

945
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,810
My mic fell out.
My mic keeps falling out.

946
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,610
Hold on. Jong Kook's mic.

947
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,140
(Fixing his mic)

948
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,520
Hold on. It fell into the crack.

949
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,380
Why did you send a woman?

950
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,390
(Why did you send a woman?)

951
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,720
Why did you send a woman?

952
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,100
It fell into the crack!

953
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,070
Send a guy.

954
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,130
(There was a reason why Jong Kook
was asking for a male staff member.)

955
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,230
It fell right into the crack!

956
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,110
- Just leave it!
- Did you put it in there?

957
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,510
I put it there,
and it went right in.

958
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,670
Can you put my mic back in?

959
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,140
(Jong Kook's mic fell out,
and he asked Kwang Soo for help.)

960
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,180
There's no one here.

961
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,760
(Putting it in)

962
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,680
Okay. We have to get it in.

963
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,100
(That is the secret behind
the crack.)

964
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,720
Why did you do that?

965
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,420
You're out of your mind.

966
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,490
Gosh, that was funny.

967
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,960
The team that came in 1st place...

968
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,540
and will receive 10 dollars each
in commissary money is...

969
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,810
Team Kim Yong Ji.

970
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,040
- We won?
- No way.

971
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,350
Each member of Team Kim Yong Ji
will receive 10 dollars.

972
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,210
Their partners will also receive
10 dollars.

973
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:45,910
The correctional officer will
show you the amount you have...

974
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,560
- in your commissary account.
- If your partner won?

975
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,320
Yes. You will get money too.

976
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
(You can guess your partner by
seeing how much money you have.)

977
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,480
Okay. Good job everyone.

978
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,150
I will give you your statement for
your commissary account.

979
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,390
Ji Suk Jin.

980
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,690
(They each receive a statement
for their commissary account.)

981
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,690
After you see how much money
you have,

982
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,300
- you have to return it to me. Yes.
- We do?

983
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,160
- Song Ji Hyo.
- I hope I have some money.

984
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,110
Yang Se Chan.

985
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,130
(He's checking his statement.)

986
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,230
I'm sure they have 10 dollars each.

987
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,780
- Right. We do.
- You do.

988
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,140
We have some money.

989
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,740
(The partners of these 4 members
have also received 10 dollars.)

990
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,090
(Yong Ji, who won,
is checking her statement.)

991
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,220
(Account statement, Kim Yong Ji,
Received reward, Total: 20 dollars)

992
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,280
(She got an additional 10 dollars?)

993
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,220
Please give it back to me
after you've checked it.

994
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,360
Here you go, sir.

995
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,700
Sure. Thank you.

996
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,300
(Her partner must be either
Jong Kook, Haha, or Young Min.)

997
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,590
Can one have 20 dollars?

998
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,390
If one of them is your partner?

999
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,300
Having 20 dollars
will sure be reassuring.

1000
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,030
(That means...)

1001
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,430
(Yong Ji and Jong Kook
are partners.)

1002
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:48,110
(Seung Hyun and Jae Suk
received 10 dollars despite losing.)

1003
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,950
(Haha and Young Min are paired
with either Seung Hyun or Jae Suk.)

1004
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:55,110
There is a bit of time
until your next work program,

1005
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,760
- so you'll get some free time.
- Free time?

1006
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,390
With the money you earned,

1007
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,860
you can buy anything...

1008
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,360
- from the commissary.
- All right.

1009
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,720
If you didn't earn any money,

1010
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,630
- you can use the time to chat.
- All right.

1011
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,130
- Enjoy your free time then.
- Sure.

1012
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,340
Thank you!

1013
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,970
Let's eat!

1014
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,530
(They can buy the items
or put them on their tab.)

1015
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,140
(However, what one partner spends,
the other partner will lose out on.)

1016
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,610
Hello.

1017
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,570
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

1018
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,720
- What's the price range?
- I should eat something.

1019
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,180
They're all a dollar.

1020
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,840
- A dollar?
- A dollar.

1021
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,990
This will be two dollars.

1022
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,760
I'll take it from
your commissary money.

1023
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,820
(Even in prison, you need to eat.)

1024
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,300
Can you buy me one?

1025
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,630
- Maybe a drink.
- I don't have any money.

1026
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,200
- Put it on your tab.
- If I could, I would.

1027
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,430
Put it on your tab.

1028
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,430
Buy me one since we met
for the first time today.

1029
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,430
- What?
- You're the older one here.

1030
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,740
I don't have any money.

1031
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,530
I'll return the favor
once I'm reborn as your junior.

1032
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,200
Whoever earned money without winning
will have definitely spent it.

1033
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,550
It's not just about
being physically strong.

1034
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,740
- You need to be clever too.
- I don't know.

1035
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,950
Is it important
to find your partner though?

1036
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
- Of course.
- Why?

1037
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,090
Because you'll be eliminated
if your partner is eliminated.

1038
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,660
I feel bad for whomever
Suk Jin's partner is.

1039
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:05,260
- He even told our guest...
- You're all clueless though.

1040
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,490
- not to listen to the rules.
- Why not?

1041
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,030
Because you'll get the hang of it
as the games go on.

1042
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,530
Do Kwon responded by saying that's
why he always gets eliminated.

1043
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,660
(Do Kwon proves that
he's a true fan of Running Man.)

1044
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,360
I just hope that I'm not
partnered with Suk Jin.

1045
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
(In a low voice)

1046
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,610
(His inner voice came shooting out.)

1047
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,640
(But just then...)

1048
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,820
(Se Chan secretly
calls Kwang Soo over.)

1049
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,890
Did you receive any money?

1050
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,260
What? No.

1051
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,280
Whose on your team?

1052
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,660
(They exchange their opinions
in a low voice.)

1053
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,890
Jae Suk and...

1054
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,700
I mean, who do you think
you're partnered with?

1055
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,990
Do you have no idea?

1056
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,300
I didn't receive any money.

1057
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,070
- Did you buy this though?
- Yes.

1058
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,430
- I spent a dollar.
- What?

1059
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,530
I spent a dollar.

1060
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,360
Is that what you
called me over for?

1061
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,680
Or was it just to steal
some of my chips?

1062
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,700
(Se Chan was only after
Kwang Soo's chips.)

1063
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,680
(He played me.)

1064
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,820
What...

1065
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,950
- Jae Suk...
- But I was just sitting there.

1066
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,610
- Unbelievable.
- Jae Suk, hold on.

1067
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,220
I was just sitting there when he...

1068
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,760
(Kwang Soo tells on Se Chan.)

1069
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,450
I thought he was going
to tell me a secret,

1070
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,450
but it was to steal my chips.

1071
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,200
That's what he called me over for.

1072
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,800
You can't eat our snacks
without saying anything.

1073
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,260
Yes, you at least ate half of mine.

1074
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
Okay, I'll tell you.

1075
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,140
- Can I enjoy this then?
- Sure, go ahead.

1076
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,740
(Se Chan gobbles down the chips.)

1077
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,860
So what was it?

1078
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:29,110
(He tells Jae Suk
and Kwang Soo something.)

1079
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,050
Se Chan!

1080
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,720
Why are you ostracizing us
and only speaking to them?

1081
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,970
- Let us know too.
- It's just Jae Suk.

1082
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,410
What were you talking about?

1083
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,050
(What did Se Chan say
to Jae Suk and Kwang Soo?)

1084
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,110
Do Kwon hasn't said a word to you...

1085
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,220
after colliding with you earlier.

1086
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,630
Are you upset about something?

1087
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,550
I didn't know
it would be this violent.

1088
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,160
(He's upset.)

1089
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,220
(The violent plays upset him.)

1090
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,220
- Do Kwon...
- I mean...

1091
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,570
You're pouting.

1092
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,640
- Jong Kook's not a bad person.
- I said this at the beginning,

1093
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,860
but there's something
cute about him.

1094
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,260
He's quite adorable.

1095
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,510
Didn't he enter saying,

1096
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,740
"I'm going to get just one person"?

1097
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,380
(Where did his confidence go?)

1098
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,470
After one game,
I learned that I was wrong.

1099
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,970
(And after the second game...)

1100
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,220
All right,

1101
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,320
so the second work program is over.

1102
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,680
Suk Jin, Se Chan, Ji Hyo,
and Jong Kook earn 10 dollars each.

1103
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,320
(Yong Ji also earns 10 dollars
thanks to her partner Jong Kook.)

1104
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,360
(Do Kwon, So Min, and Kwang Soo
win money despite losing.)

1105
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,260
(Their partners
are in the winning team.)

1106
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,470
Officer!

1107
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,470
(The inmates are one step closer
to guessing who their partners are.)

1108
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,240
I'm sure you're all hungry.

1109
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,530
- I'm starving.
- Of course.

1110
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,070
- Gosh.
- It's already time for lunch.

1111
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,180
A decent "lunsh"
has been prepared for you.

1112
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,740
He said "lunsh" instead of lunch.

1113
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,680
- Lunch time!
- Stack the food on your plate...

1114
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,050
and sit at the table
after taking off your shoes.

1115
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,050
- Thank you.
- Gyu Jin.

1116
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,220
- Take off your shoes!
- You're doing...

1117
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,660
a great job today.

1118
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,280
Sorry?

1119
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,360
(So Min hands the rookie officer
a sausage.)

1120
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,660
Is it for me?

1121
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,890
I hope we get along.

1122
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,160
My gosh. Can you believe
this lunch we're having?

1123
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,700
Everything looks delicious.

1124
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,590
Thank you for the meal.

1125
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,970
(Don't forget what I gave you.)

1126
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,380
(Thanks, I'll enjoy it.)

1127
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,970
(A dirty but warm deal was made.)

1128
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,910
- Who were you gesturing to?
- No one.

1129
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,220
Do Kwon,
why don't you sit with Jong Kook?

1130
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,840
- Over here.
- Have a seat over here.

1131
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,840
(It's obvious
who has seniority now.)

1132
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,450
Have you suddenly lost weight?

1133
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,050
You look gaunt for some reason.

1134
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,720
You can't consider him
as a normal human being.

1135
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,390
I think I've got the hang of it now.

1136
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,030
He has the hang of it now.

1137
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,030
He's clever too.

1138
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,760
I had no idea he'd dodge
out of the way like that.

1139
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,430
(The salad was dropped.)

1140
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,910
(Variety show rookies
Young Min and Seung Hyun...)

1141
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,880
(are the last to get their food.)

1142
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,200
- It's not as far as you think.
- Exactly.

1143
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,110
(A delicious lunch served
at Running Prison)

1144
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,320
Does the food suit your palate?

1145
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,510
Yes!

1146
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:56,010
Since you followed my orders
so well earlier,

1147
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,550
I'm going to...

1148
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,180
give three of you...

1149
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,660
a chance to win five dollars
for your commissary account.

1150
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,700
(Tempting)

1151
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,530
I can't give it away, so...

1152
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,840
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1153
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,140
- I'm trying to explain something.
- I needed more soup.

1154
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,010
We're not here
to have a seminar, you know.

1155
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,240
Does that mean
I can't have more soup?

1156
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,780
Are you here on vacation?

1157
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,380
- Please stay seated.
- Sure.

1158
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,610
He seems like a true prison guard.

1159
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,110
- Let me explain once again.
- He does.

1160
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,340
I can't give it away for free.

1161
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,740
(The game to acquire more money
in the commissary account)

1162
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:31,390
I'll give it to whomever
says the answer that satisfies me.

1163
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,630
So here we go.

1164
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,530
Name a celebrity that I resemble.

1165
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,530
(A celebrity
that Officer Shin resembles!)

1166
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,800
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer!

1167
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,970
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1168
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,070
Se Chan?

1169
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,030
- Let me answer.
- Can I go ahead?

1170
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,240
Just say the answer.

1171
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,360
Park Seo Jun!

1172
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,200
- Nicely done.
- Let me answer.

1173
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,610
- Are you kidding me?
- Let me answer.

1174
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,950
Jung Woo Sung!

1175
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,680
- Nicely done.
- Let me answer.

1176
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,410
V of BTS.

1177
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,410
- That's a dangerous one.
- Shouldn't I have said that?

1178
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,320
- His fans will be mad.
- You're out to get me, aren't you?

1179
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,180
Let me answer.

1180
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,390
- Yes, Jae Suk?
- Jung Chan Sung.

1181
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,130
- Who?
- Jung Chan Sung, the Korean zombie.

1182
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,030
(The resemblance is clear.)

1183
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,220
Nicely done!

1184
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,660
What a treat.

1185
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,470
I thought that Jung Woo Sung
had walked in.

1186
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,090
You look a lot like Jung Chan Sung.

1187
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,260
Thank you for that.

1188
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,890
The three of you...

1189
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,570
won't receive the money right now.

1190
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,930
It will be put into
your commissary account.

1191
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,530
- Great. Thank you.
- All right.

1192
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,840
- Please enjoy your meal.
- Hold on.

1193
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,800
Will our partners
receive the money too?

1194
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,050
- Yes.
- Our partners too?

1195
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,280
Really?

1196
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,180
- They'll also receive the money.
- Our partners too.

1197
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,380
Just remember that my partner
will receive the money.

1198
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,010
After you enjoy your lunch,

1199
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,720
you will participate
in some more work programs.

1200
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,320
Another officer
will be with you for those,

1201
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
- so be nice to him too.
- Are you going somewhere?

1202
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,200
Are you off to "Comedy Big League"?

1203
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,570
- That's not it.
- There's a rehearsal.

1204
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,140
I'll see you later.

1205
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,970
(He suddenly bows.)

1206
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,470
I'll show you how it's done there.

1207
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,910
- What are you doing?
- Just let me be.

1208
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,110
- Gyu Jin, take care.
- Enjoy your meal.

1209
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,680
- Bye!
- You did well today!

1210
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,380
- Bye.
- I hope you come by often.

1211
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,410
(Enjoy the sausage.)

1212
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,450
Everybody.

1213
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,410
Here's your transaction history.

1214
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,780
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1215
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,840
(Their account balances
have been delivered.)

1216
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,910
Haha.

1217
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,050
(They're somewhat aware
of their partners now.)

1218
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,590
This round made things clear.

1219
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,910
Are you close to
guessing your partner?

1220
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,220
Totally.

1221
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,320
Really?

1222
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,660
(Haha and Seung Hyun
make eye-contact.)

1223
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,820
Are you close to
guessing your partner?

1224
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,470
- Totally.
- Really?

1225
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,320
Two dollars?

1226
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,760
(Seung Hyun makes his way to Haha.)

1227
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,930
Why didn't you come to me sooner?

1228
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:23,970
(Why didn't you come to me sooner?)

1229
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,430
(The two share the exact
same transaction report.)

1230
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,970
(Haha and Seung Hyun are partners.)

1231
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:35,050
(The partners are revealed
one by one.)

1232
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,410
(The pairs)

1233
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,430
- Okay!
- Thanks for the meal.

1234
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,430
I'm still not sure,

1235
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,550
but I've narrowed it down.

1236
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,800
My partner will sure know
that we're partners.

1237
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,970
You can go by the commissary
for one last time.

1238
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,660
But we had a lot to eat.

1239
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,840
(It's their last chance
to spend their money.)

1240
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,800
We'll be notified
if the money is spent.

1241
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,780
(Young Min heads inside first.)

1242
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,910
I...

1243
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,380
I am here to paint a big picture.

1244
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,720
(He's here to paint a big picture?)

1245
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,010
- That will be 10 dollars.
- I'll take it.

1246
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,450
Did you buy the water?

1247
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,220
Your name tag is different.

1248
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,510
Really?

1249
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,720
A different name tag?

1250
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,820
- What?
- Why?

1251
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:21,930
- What?
- Hold on.

1252
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,090
- What?
- What is this?

1253
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,260
- What is it?
- What's going on?

1254
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,990
- Let me see.
- Why is his different?

1255
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,090
What is this?

1256
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,570
It's in gold letters.

1257
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,840
(Young Min has a gold name tag?)

1258
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,530
(Young Min came back
with a gold name tag.)

1259
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,760
What is this though?

1260
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,610
(A few hours ago)

1261
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,800
- Se Chan?
- He must be helping you out.

1262
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,070
(Officer Shin called Se Chan aside.)

1263
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,680
If you go into the commissary...

1264
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,410
and say "I am here to paint
a big picture" to the lady inside,

1265
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,410
- she'll give you a Defense Right.
- To me?

1266
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,630
If you say to the lady...

1267
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,700
that you're here to paint
a big picture,

1268
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,950
- she'll give you a Defense Right.
- What's that?

1269
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,630
You'll have a chance
to save yourself from elimination.

1270
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,070
You'll be given an advantage...

1271
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,340
if you say you're here
to paint a big picture.

1272
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,140
- Are you saying that...
- Really?

1273
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,240
What is this?

1274
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
(The gold name tag
is the Defense Right.)

1275
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,780
Can it be bought?

1276
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,140
Is he irrelevant in the game now?

1277
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,410
How did he know that though?

1278
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,890
- What is this?
- The Defense Right.

1279
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,390
I'll buy one.

1280
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,390
- What?
- What are you here to buy?

1281
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,720
Me? I'm here for the shield.

1282
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,030
That's not something we sell here.

1283
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,550
Then is it Defense Right?

1284
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,890
We don't sell that either.

1285
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,030
Defense...

1286
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,320
Next.

1287
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,390
What? What was that?

1288
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,660
What's on sale?

1289
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,660
(Whispering)

1290
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,010
Do I need to say something?

1291
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,200
Go first.

1292
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,410
- I don't have the money.
- Go first.

1293
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,340
(She chants a spell she learned
from Kwang Soo.)

1294
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,450
(Kwang Soo fooled her.)

1295
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:54,090
(She gave the chorus of a song
from the Goryeo Dynasty.)

1296
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,050
- Is it wrong?
- Pretend you don't know anything.

1297
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,260
It's wrong! It's wrong!

1298
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,720
What is it?

1299
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,800
- Did she say "Yalli yalli"?
- "Yalli yalli yallashong".

1300
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,260
Yong Ji, what did you say?

1301
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:05,820
Yong Ji, what did you say?

1302
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,200
(Listening attentively)

1303
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,300
- That's not it.
- Tell me what it is.

1304
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,390
(Another inmate asks
for information.)

1305
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,700
Open, sesame.

1306
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,470
I am serious. I am serious.

1307
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,470
Why won't you believe me?
That's the code.

1308
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,410
That's the code.

1309
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,070
(Do Kwon was watching
without a word.)

1310
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,590
(He gets up stealthily
and heads over to the commissary.)

1311
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,410
Open, sesame. Open, sesame.

1312
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,110
(Showing a cute dance)

1313
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,930
(He completes the dance
as he has eavesdropped.)

1314
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,930
- What would you like?
- What?

1315
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:35,950
The name tag.

1316
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,860
I heard that was the code.

1317
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,470
(Bursting into laughter)

1318
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,360
Open, sesame. Open, sesame.

1319
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,590
(He tries the dance again.)

1320
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,030
Is it wrong?

1321
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,240
(My goodness.)

1322
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,610
What was that?
You looked very cute.

1323
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,970
Hurry up and tell me.

1324
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,380
I am here to paint a big picture.

1325
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,740
Oh, okay.

1326
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,240
(Jong Kook learns the code
through Ji Hyo.)

1327
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,180
I am here to paint a big picture.

1328
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,950
- Would you buy it for 10 dollars?
- Yes.

1329
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,510
What did you say?

1330
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,260
(He shares the method
with his partner, Yong Ji.)

1331
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,320
That was the code.

1332
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,660
I am here to paint a big picture.

1333
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,860
- Would you buy it for 10 dollars?
- Yes.

1334
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,030
(After Jong Kook and Yong Ji)

1335
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,430
I am here to paint a big picture.

1336
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,590
My goodness. He bought it as well.

1337
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:19,340
(Young Min, Suk Jin, Jong Kook,
and Yong Ji get the gold name tag.)

1338
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,470
If there are no prison guards,
can't we escape?

1339
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,240
(After Gyu Jin,
no prison guards are in sight.)

1340
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,070
(Running Prison Schedule)

1341
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,340
(Before the work program,)

1342
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,280
(they must escape
with their partners.)

1343
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,090
(They must take their chance
when the prison guards are gone.)

1344
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:38,280
(A prison guard left
for the transfer of duties.)

1345
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,430
Are there no prison guards now?

1346
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,550
(This is the perfect opportunity!)

1347
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,300
Let's go out and lock the door.

1348
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,240
- Go out.
- Is there something in here?

1349
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,340
What could this be?

1350
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,970
(The mysterious letter in the drawer
must be something important.)

1351
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,740
That safe must be important.

1352
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,110
I saw a prison guard
put an envelope in it.

1353
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,510
There must be a direction.

1354
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:59,880
- Inside the drawer?
- Yes.

1355
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,570
- This is... Hold on.
- How do you open it?

1356
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,380
Does anyone know the combination?

1357
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,590
Why would anyone tell you
so easily?

1358
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,180
(No one knows
the combination of the lock.)

1359
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,390
There must be a hint inside.

1360
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,160
(Somewhere in the prison...)

1361
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,090
(lies a clue.)

1362
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,220
(Wisdom comes with age.)

1363
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,200
(Running Prison Schedule)

1364
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,890
There must be a direction.

1365
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,300
- Inside the drawer?
- Yes.

1366
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,660
(Jae Suk stares at the sign
on the wall.)

1367
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,910
Maybe this means something.

1368
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,740
"Wisdom comes with age."

1369
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,680
(Wisdom comes with age.)

1370
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,610
- It has to mean something.
- Right?

1371
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,570
Wisdom. How old is wisdom?

1372
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,840
- Right?
- Jae Suk.

1373
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,820
(Wisdom comes with age?)

1374
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,890
- Right?
- Jae Suk. The order of age.

1375
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,410
- That's right.
- Let's stand in that order.

1376
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,660
- This is...
- The number.

1377
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,360
Maybe something will happen
if we stand in the right order.

1378
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,760
- Let's stand in that order.
- Shall I move?

1379
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,760
This is...

1380
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,390
Maybe something will happen
if we stand in the right order.

1381
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,430
- Let's stand in the order of age.
- Let's try standing that way.

1382
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,660
- Let's stand.
- Young Min is next.

1383
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,860
- Okay.
- Who is next?

1384
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,360
- Third.
- Am I next?

1385
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,660
- Jong Kook comes next.
- Me.

1386
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,930
- No, no.
- I'm next to Jae Suk.

1387
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,200
Hurry up and come inside.
Let's line up in the order of age.

1388
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,700
- Line up. We need to escape.
- Come here.

1389
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,780
We are one today.

1390
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,950
3, 4.

1391
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,380
Blue...

02DRA 2365, 34WER 2361)

1393
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,490
- Blue.
- Blue drawer.

1394
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,860
Blue drawer.

1395
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,050
(22BL 2366, 10UE 2371,
02DRA 2365, 34WER 2361)

1396
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,780
(Blue drawer)

1397
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,490
- Blue drawer.
- Blue drawer.

1398
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,820
Line up.

1399
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,200
"Com".

1400
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,550
- "Combination".
- "Combination".

1401
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:25,990
Come here.

1402
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,360
- Tell us from there.
- Come here.

1403
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,470
- Tell us from there.
- Cover your tag.

1404
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,660
- This is the right way.
- That's right.

1405
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,470
"Combination".
We have "combination".

1406
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,640
- Eight.
- Hurry up and tell us!

1407
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,110
I won't let you out
unless you tell us the combination.

1408
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:38,410
We figured it out! Come over here.

1409
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,470
- Put your hands down. Attention.
- Cover your tag.

1410
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,910
- Cover your tag.
- Do you want to rot in there?

1411
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:42,950
(The four youngest members' numbers
make up the combination.)

1412
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,320
- Cover your tag.
- Come on out.

1413
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,110
- Combination.
- Combination.

1414
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,340
- 8.
- 8.

1415
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,890
- Come on out.
- Come on out.

1416
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,820
These brats. Jong Kook, get them.

1417
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,260
Come on out.

1418
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,820
I didn't do anything.

1419
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,760
You know I didn't do anything.

1420
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,570
The youngest members.

1421
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,860
- The four youngest members.
- Their numbers are the combination.

1422
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,260
- 8412.
- 84...

1423
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,340
- 8412.
- 84.

1424
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,570
Let's read it together.

1425
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,970
- Okay. Let's read it together.
- Okay.

1426
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,180
All of us can survive
if we escape together.

1427
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,240
- That's what I am saying.
- It will be war after we read this.

1428
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:34,730
It's open.

1429
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,900
(The blue drawer opens.)

1430
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,330
- It's open.
- It's open.

1431
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:40,670
- It's open.
- How did you figure this out?

1432
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,770
- Let's read it together.
- Let's read it together.

1433
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,310
- Hold on.
- Let's read it together.

1434
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,880
- For goodness' sake.
- It's open.

1435
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,080
- Come in.
- Calm down.

1436
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,170
We can survive together.

1437
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:49,710
- Let's escape together.
- We can survive together.

1438
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,350
- Calm down.
- This is it.

1439
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,360
(Will there be a method of escape
in the letter?)

1440
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,810
We will learn how we can escape.

1441
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,420
Read it out loud.

1442
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,420
- Read it out loud.
- It's our last hope.

1443
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:02,900
What? Boss!

1444
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,190
There's a boss?

1445
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,230
What does that mean?

1446
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,730
"Boss, to help with your escape,"

1447
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,560
"I sent a gang member to the prison.
Did the two of you meet?"

1448
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:17,750
(The recipient of the letter is
the boss inside the prison.)

1449
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,610
There is a gang member.

1450
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:24,750
"For your escape, I prepared
a truck behind the gray wall."

1451
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,610
"It will leave at 3 p.m. sharp."

1452
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,920
"In case this letter gets found,"

1453
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,060
"I hid the details
in the cell phone in the prison."

1454
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,960
"Please find it
and check the text message."

1455
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,100
- Inside the prison?
- Where is the cell phone hidden?

1456
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,360
We need to check the text message.

1457
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,270
(The boss and the gang member
aren't partners.)

1458
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:48,170
Boss, if you and your partner get
on the truck, the gang will win.

1459
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,670
If you get eliminated,

1460
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,520
the gang member we sent
will become the next boss.

1461
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,310
If that gang member
and his or her partner escape,

1462
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:58,020
the gang will win.

1463
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,610
If other inmates escape,

1464
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,250
they will receive the prize...

1465
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:05,630
and the gang will lose.
Please don't forget that.

1466
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,000
(If regular inmates escape,
the gang will lose.)

1467
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,330
"The work program that starts
at 3 p.m. is known to be brutal."

1468
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,900
"So please escape safely
without getting eliminated."

1469
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,040
Who is the boss?

1470
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,230
It must be Young Min!

1471
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,830
He was the first one to put on
the gold name tag. How did he know?

1472
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,080
You're right. He had the information
all by himself.

1473
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,310
There is no other way
Young Min found out about it.

1474
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,650
Did you tell him?

1475
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:24,880
I told Suk Jin,
but I didn't tell Young Min.

1476
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,210
How did he know?

1477
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,940
- His partner must have told him.
- That's right.

1478
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,440
Come on out.
It's time for a cleanup.

1479
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,520
(The cleanup begins.)

1480
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,580
Okay.

1481
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,790
I will clean up when I am asked.

1482
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,080
Here.

1483
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,150
I will take something that suits me.

1484
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,600
(Among them are
a boss and a gang member.)

1485
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,420
I think we are partners.

1486
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,920
- We are...
- What?

1487
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,400
Are we?

1488
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,730
- I think so.
- We could be partners.

1489
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,330
I think we are partners.

1490
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,500
Why are Young Min and Jae Suk
so close?

1491
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,630
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1492
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,210
They could be partners, right?

1493
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,940
I am certain
Yong Ji and Jong Kook...

1494
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,210
are partners.

1495
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,650
I see my partner over there.

1496
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,420
(Current Partners)

1497
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,060
The weather is hot.

1498
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,460
We need to clean up.

1499
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,650
(Current Partners)

1500
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:20,130
(The man everyone is suspicious of,
Young Min...)

1501
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:23,230
(as well as Do Kwon,
pretend to clean up diligently.)

1502
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,460
(But everyone is
thinking about escaping.)

1503
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,040
My partner is Seung Hyun.

1504
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,650
(Blowing)

1505
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,770
My partner is Haha.

1506
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,710
I don't know what to do next.

1507
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:38,690
What's certain is
that Young Min is the boss.

1508
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:41,420
I think the boss is...

1509
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,230
one of the guests.

1510
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,900
It's either Yong Ji...

1511
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,960
(He suspects the guests.)

1512
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,630
Young Min.
It's either Yong Ji or Young Min.

1513
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:52,960
Young Min must be...

1514
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,710
either the boss or gang member.

1515
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,330
(Young Min is
under a lot of suspicions.)

1516
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,270
(He suddenly utters a sound.)

1517
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:01,080
(He shrugs.)

1518
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,850
There must be people...

1519
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:08,020
who realized that we are partners.

1520
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,250
Without letting them know,

1521
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,580
I will reveal my partner's name.

1522
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:15,830
As for the identity of the boss,

1523
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,560
I have an idea.

1524
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,330
(Does Young Min know
who the boss is?)

1525
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,600
With my partner,
I will find the cell phone...

1526
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,420
and check the text message.
Then I will help...

1527
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,960
the boss escape.

1528
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,960
(Then I will help the boss escape.)

1529
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,960
(That means...)

1530
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,960
You are the gang member
who entered the prison...

1531
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,630
to help the boss escape.

1532
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,380
I see.

1533
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,480
(The gang member, Kim Young Min)

1534
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,940
Before 3 p.m.,

1535
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,920
you must make the boss
and his or her partner escape...

1536
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,940
in order to bring victory
to the gang.

1537
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,360
You can find out who the boss is...

1538
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,420
by the mark on the sole of the shoe.

1539
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,150
- The boss?
- Yes.

1540
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,560
(He must find the boss first!)

1541
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,960
(During mealtime earlier)

1542
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,000
(They took off their shoes
and had a meal.)

1543
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,630
(Dropping)

1544
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:02,560
(The gang member checked the shoes
by pretending to drop something.)

1545
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:06,630
(While everyone was focused on
winning the commissary money)

1546
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:07,980
(Dropping)

1547
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,980
(He checked other shoes
by using the same method.)

1548
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,020
(On someone's shoes,)

1549
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,850
(Young Min spotted the mark.)

1550
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,650
Boss gave me a sign a few times.

1551
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,080
I hope my clumsy concept...

1552
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,150
worked to my advantage.

1553
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,330
(He suddenly changes.)

1554
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,460
I will look for my partner first.

1555
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,360
(He goes in search of Jae Suk.)

1556
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,000
The boss is...

1557
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,360
(The boss is...)

1558
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,830
Really?

1559
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:40,880
(Surprised)

1560
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,000
- How do you know?
- I am the gang member.

1561
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,350
You are the gang member?

1562
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,350
You are the gang member?

1563
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,350
You are the gang member?

1564
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:49,750
(Since Jae Suk
is the gang member's partner,)

1565
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,520
Really?

1566
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,360
(he can escape the penalty
only if the gang wins.)

1567
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,460
For goodness' sake.

1568
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,730
Firstly...

1569
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:58,960
(Jae Suk needs to work
for the victory of the gang.)

1570
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,750
(Meanwhile, Suk Jin is looking
for his partner.)

1571
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,100
I should hurry up and meet
Doo Kwan.

1572
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,170
(Who is Doo Kwan?)

1573
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,830
(He is Do Kwon, not Doo Kwan.)

1574
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,770
Go to the side.

1575
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:14,770
(He spots Doo Kwan,
also known as Do Kwon.)

1576
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:17,770
- Do Kwon.
- Hello.

1577
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,080
Suk Jin.

1578
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,350
- You are my partner, right?
- Of course.

1579
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,710
All right.

1580
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,540
You used 3 dollars
and I used 2 dollars.

1581
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,040
That's right.
At first, it was a dollar.

1582
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,560
- That's right. A dollar.
- Yes.

1583
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,810
- And at the end...
- Five dollars came in last.

1584
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,130
Then it was 10 dollars.

1585
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,420
Who do you think is the boss?

1586
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,560
- The boss?
- Yes.

1587
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,520
It's likely that Se Chan is
the boss.

1588
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,650
- Right?
- He keeps messing up the games.

1589
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:38,730
Wasn't he too forward
from the start?

1590
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:39,960
- You are right.
- Right?

1591
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,270
I think he definitely has a mission.

1592
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,900
- Jong Kook. Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1593
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,830
So Min, I have something to say.

1594
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:49,980
The cell phone isn't the only thing
we need to find.

1595
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,380
We need to find the fake wall.

1596
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,380
What?

1597
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,270
(There was important information
in the letter.)

1598
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,940
(A truck for two
behind the fake wall)

1599
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,250
We must get on the truck
behind the fake wall.

1600
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,250
- That's right.
- Thus,

1601
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,830
we need to find the fake wall
and stop anyone from getting on.

1602
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,420
People will get on it
as soon as they find it.

1603
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,790
How about the cell phone?

1604
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,790
That's another thing that is hidden.
We need to find the cell phone...

1605
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,790
as well as the fake wall.

1606
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,440
There is the fake wall?

1607
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,730
That's right.
Even in "Prison Break",

1608
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,080
the character escapes
within the prison.

1609
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,630
I think I can break most walls.

1610
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,270
- That's not how it works.
- No?

1611
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,270
- No.
- This could be a fake wall too.

1612
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:26,350
- If I use my strength...
- How will we escape?

1613
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,380
How will we escape?

1614
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,420
- We need to think of a way.
- Yes.

1615
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,440
All right.

1616
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,650
(Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
are looking for a hint.)

1617
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,310
It's cool in here.

1618
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,830
Hold on. The air conditioner is on
in this room.

1619
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,360
- What?
- Okay.

1620
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,360
What is it?

1621
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,460
(Jae Suk spots something.)

1622
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,520
No one is here.

1623
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,560
(They check and see
if they are alone.)

1624
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,900
(What did Jae Suk find?)

1625
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,170
I won't tell a soul. I mean it.

1626
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,310
- Really?
- Yes.

1627
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,540
I can't trust you.

1628
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,580
I won't tell a soul for real.

1629
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,000
- Really?
- Yes.

1630
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
(Jae Suk takes a leap of faith...)

1631
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,110
What is it?

1632
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,540
(and shares information
with Kwang Soo.)

1633
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,650
Here.

1634
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,650
(Handing over)

1635
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:04,020
Air conditioner...
It's an air conditioner user manual.

1636
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,650
Why in the world did you hide
an air conditioner user manual?

1637
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,150
You are the one who came.

1638
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,360
I came because you seemed to be
hiding something.

1639
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,460
- For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

1640
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,460
(Jae Suk stars on Running Man
in order to make fun of Kwang Soo.)

1641
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,600
I need to carry this around.

1642
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,360
- Why did you pick something so big?
- I don't know.

1643
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,270
There must be a use
for this cleaning tool.

1644
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,540
- What?
- There must be a use.

1645
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:25,880
There must be something here.

1646
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,880
(What?
There must be something here.)

1647
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,610
(When they come down the stairs,
a long hallway stretches on.)

1648
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:30,710
What is this place?

1649
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,810
It's just a cool hallway.

1650
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,690
That door leads to the stairs.

1651
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,040
- This door?
- Yes.

1652
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,460
(Halting)

1653
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,150
What? It's the fake wall!

1654
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,150
(No way.)

1655
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,560
It's the fake wall!

1656
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,270
It's the fake wall. What is this?

1657
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,060
(Behind the fake gray wall...)

1658
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,000
(awaits the two-person truck.)

1659
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,900
(It will leave at 3 p.m.)

1660
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:02,810
(If they break the fake wall,
they can escape.)

1661
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,270
(She begins to break the fake wall.)

1662
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,880
Let's break it down.

1663
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,850
(Kicking)

1664
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,380
(It's harder than they expected!)

1665
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,380
What is it?

1666
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,330
It's the fake wall!

1667
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,690
- What is it?
- The fake wall.

1668
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,100
- What?
- The fake wall.

1669
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,100
Really? Can we break it?

1670
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,360
- I don't know. Try breaking it.
- Try breaking it.

1671
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,270
We kicked it,
but we couldn't break it.

1672
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,830
- It's too hard.
- Maybe this isn't it.

1673
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,230
- Could it be a real wall?
- This is...

1674
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,630
Would it be okay to kick it?

1675
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:35,310
- Is it supposed to be this strong?
- Seriously.

1676
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,250
- Hold on.
- We should call Jong Kook over.

1677
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,250
Would it be okay
to work on different spots?

1678
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,980
(They manually take off
the styrofoam.)

1679
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,060
(Will they break it before 3 p.m?)

1680
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,520
- What?
- Is it working?

1681
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,330
Hold on. Let's do this instead.

1682
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,250
Hold on.

1683
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,330
I will stick it in.

1684
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,900
Hold on.

1685
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,420
- It's working.
- Okay. It's working.

1686
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,520
Hold on. I will stick it in there.

1687
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,960
- One...
- Ji Hyo, you are out.

1688
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,170
(All of a sudden)

1689
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,860
- One...
- Ji Hyo, you are out.

1690
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,610
- For goodness' sake.
- Go, Ji Hyo.

1691
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:06,830
Whose partner were you?

1692
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,900
This is driving me crazy.

1693
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,540
(Only Kwang Soo's bag
and name tag remain.)

1694
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,110
Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo are out.

1695
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:16,110
Why?

1696
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:17,690
(When Kwang Soo got eliminated,
his partner got eliminated as well.)

1697
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,650
Are Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo out?

1698
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,580
- Really?
- Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo are out.

1699
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,880
- They are out.
- Really?

1700
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,580
Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo were partners.

1701
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,060
Be quiet. Be quiet.

1702
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,670
- Are you okay?
- Here.

1703
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,690
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo's elimination
makes them work faster.)

1704
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:34,670
Move out of the way.

1705
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,060
(The fake wall finally breaks!)

1706
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,770
We got it.

1707
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:42,980
(Once they get on the truck,
they will escape the prison.)

1708
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,770
(They move past the fake wall.)

1709
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,080
What?

1710
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,810
There is a lock.

1711
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:53,310
(The door is locked.)

1712
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,860
What?

1713
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,420
(The fake wall wasn't the end!)

1714
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:59,690
Hang on. What is this?

1715
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,420
What is this?

1716
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,460
(Other inmates come running
upon hearing the noise.)

1717
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,860
What's here?

1718
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,100
- No, no.
- Let's see.

1719
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,270
- What is up with them?
- One of you is the boss, right?

1720
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,630
No.

1721
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,360
- What is this?
- There is a truck.

1722
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,460
There is a truck.

1723
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,730
Beyond that door?

1724
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:13,980
But we need a lock combination.

1725
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,730
I know. There is a lock.

1726
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:17,150
Can't we go outside?

1727
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,080
No, we can't.

1728
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,110
We need to open the lock.

1729
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:22,650
- We need to open the lock.
- The two of you are a team.

1730
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:24,850
- That's why you are together.
- So Min followed me.

1731
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,710
The two of you are a team.

1732
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,060
Why else would you be together?

1733
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,960
Be careful, So Min!

1734
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,960
(Seung Hyun suddenly attacks.)

1735
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,730
(Se Chan runs over belatedly,)

1736
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:38,230
(but So Min's name tag
got ripped off already.)

1737
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,270
- What happens now?
- The two of you are a team, right?

1738
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,060
The two of you are a team, right?

1739
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,630
(If Se Chan was the boss,
Young Min will be the next boss.)

1740
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,130
So Min.

1741
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:50,770
(Was Se Chan the boss?)

1742
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,980
So Min and Se Chan are out.

1743
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,020
What?

1744
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,290
(They simply got eliminated.)

1745
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,310
(Se Chan wasn't the boss!)

1746
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,520
- This is good news.
- So Min, I am sorry.

1747
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,210
- My goodness.
- Seung Hyun.

1748
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,960
- I am sorry.
- You didn't know.

1749
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,980
No.

1750
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,980
(Who is the boss
among the 8 remaining inmates?)

1751
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:07,960
(The gang member, Jae Suk)

1752
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,770
(Suk Jin, Do Kwon, Haha,
Seung Hyun, Jong Kook, and Yong Ji)

1753
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,860
Let's get out of here.
We can't find a way.

1754
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,560
What could be the combination?

1755
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,710
We need to find the cell phone to
find out the combination. Let's go.

1756
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:18,730
(The clue must be
in the cell phone.)

1757
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,080
(At that moment,)

1758
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,440
(Seung Hyun approaches the lock.)

1759
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,480
Five digits.

1760
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,080
(He checks
that the combination has 5 digits.)

1761
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,540
The combination has five digits.

1762
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,420
Where is Seung Hyun?
Why isn't he coming?

1763
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,150
(Haha approaches the fake wall.)

1764
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,210
Seung Hyun.

1765
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,520
What is going on?

1766
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,380
What's his role?

1767
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,600
He must have a role.

1768
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,460
Why else would he disappear?

1769
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:43,770
- He disappeared so suddenly.
- He must have a role.

1770
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,420
It's strange, right?

1771
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,060
(Seung Hyun is looking
for something.)

1772
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,440
(Why is he suddenly going around
on his own?)

1773
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,080
Here comes Young Min.

1774
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,080
We need to keep our distance.
He is the most suspicious.

1775
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,420
- Be careful.
- Did you find a hint?

1776
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,610
- Did you find a hint?
- No.

1777
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,790
Don't come near. Keep your distance.

1778
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,650
- Okay.
- Where have you been so busily?

1779
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,000
I followed the others to there
and came back.

1780
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,230
To there? Why did you follow them?

1781
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,600
To find my partner.

1782
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,630
Oh, your partner?
Haven't you found your partner yet?

1783
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,730
Your partner or the boss?

1784
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:21,790
(She gets to the point.)

1785
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:24,610
- My partner.
- Something isn't right.

1786
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:26,810
(Meanwhile, Haha)

1787
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,830
Seung Hyun.

1788
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:29,230
(He finally sees Seung Hyun again.)

1789
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:31,480
I have been looking for it.
I finally found it.

1790
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,020
Hey, I like you.

1791
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,750
- I like you too.
- I am serious.

1792
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,790
But you are the boss!

1793
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,210
(But you are the boss!)

1794
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,360
(What?)

1795
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,520
(After Haha's comment,)

1796
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:47,100
(his face became scary.)

1797
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,790
(Is Ji Seung Hyun the boss
as Haha predicted?)

1798
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,460
- Where have you been?
- Jae Suk.

1799
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,000
- I've been looking for you.
- Jae Suk.

1800
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:55,790
He's slowly approaching you.

1801
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:57,670
(Jae Suk already knows
that Young Min is a gang member.)

1802
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,540
He's acting weird.

1803
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,000
Are the two of you partners?
Hang on.

1804
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,610
- They're partners.
- Are they?

1805
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:05,040
- They're partners.
- We're partners, but...

1806
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,210
What? Wait.

1807
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,980
- Wait. She's a fake.
- You two are partners?

1808
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,310
That cleaner is a fake.

1809
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:11,710
Hold on. That cleaner looks like...

1810
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:13,460
We've seen her.

1811
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,650
(She's the same person
they saw at the commissary.)

1812
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:17,980
That cleaner is a fake.

1813
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:20,920
(Jong Kook instinctively sensed
that the cleaner has something.)

1814
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,630
Is there something in here?

1815
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:23,770
Oh, yes. That's it.

1816
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,560
(They found something!)

1817
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,440
I was right.

1818
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,960
- One name tag...
- "Name Tag..."

1819
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,060
He and Jae Suk... What's going on?

1820
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,310
(The other inmates are walking
towards the lobby.)

1821
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,110
We can't let anyone else see this.

1822
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,900
- What should we do?
- What is it?

1823
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,880
- "A five-digit number..."
- Where should we find it?

1824
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,520
(What secret could be written
in the document?)

1825
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,940
(Name Tag Collection Log)

1826
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:47,690
(A 5-digit number was given
in return for 5 name tags.)

1827
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,830
(Could the 5-digit number
they traded 5 name tags for...)

1828
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:53,560
(be the combination for the lock?)

1829
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:55,290
"Name tags"?

1830
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:56,420
Oh, I get it. So the name tags...

1831
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,460
(They can't understand
as they haven't seen the lock yet.)

1832
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,900
- Who has it then?
- It says...

1833
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,600
Ma'am, this is a hint, right?

1834
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:01,860
Excuse me. May I?

1835
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,060
- No, you can't.
- I can check it, right?

1836
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:05,610
- Can we all see it?
- Let me see it too.

1837
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,610
No. You shouldn't have
let them see it.

1838
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:08,670
Take a look.

1839
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,540
(Only Haha who knows it's
a five-digit code understood.)

1840
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,020
- Is this a hint?
- What does it mean?

1841
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,750
There's someone who knows
the combination.

1842
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,310
- For now...
- Excuse me.

1843
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,380
- Did anyone find the cell phone?
- Come here.

1844
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,190
- Haha.
- Yes?

1845
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,310
I found the phone.

1846
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:22,710
- What?
- I found it.

1847
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:24,920
- Where?
- You shouldn't have said that.

1848
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,400
- Sorry?
- Why did you say that here?

1849
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,150
Just tell us. How did you find it?

1850
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,790
- Gosh. I'm so stupid.
- How did he...

1851
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,420
- Just tell us. How did you find it?
- Is that it?

1852
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:32,500
Is that the phone?

1853
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:33,940
Is that the phone?

1854
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,060
Why did you show it to them? Why?

1855
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,630
- What happens now?
- We can check it.

1856
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,610
- We can check it.
- Let's do that.

1857
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:40,830
- I already did.
- Let's go in.

1858
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,080
Close the door.

1859
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,440
- Lock the door.
- Come on in.

1860
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,080
- Show us.
- Why?

1861
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,210
(What? Don't close the door!)

1862
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,880
- What's going on?
- Why are you here?

1863
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,690
(The cameraman who was filming
Do Kwon couldn't go in.)

1864
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:52,020
- Why are we here?
- You should let the cameraman in.

1865
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,190
(You should let the cameraman in.)

1866
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,310
Hey!

1867
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,880
How could you leave the cameraman
alone out here?

1868
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,360
- 1 camera is enough for us.
- It's okay. We have 1 camera.

1869
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,600
- In my opinion...
- You should let the cameraman in.

1870
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,420
- This is...
- Just read it already.

1871
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,460
I can't seem to
organize my thoughts.

1872
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:05,790
(What hint could they find
on the phone?)

1873
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:07,960
(Boss! Go through the gray wall,
and you'll find the final exit.)

1874
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,360
(You need a five-digit code
to open it, which you can get...)

1875
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,730
(by giving the cleaning lady
five name tags. I hope you succeed.)

1876
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,440
We have to get them eliminated.

1877
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,210
(They'll get the combination if they
give the cleaner five name tags.)

1878
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:18,540
What are you doing?

1879
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,670
- Why?
- I'll just let the cameraman in.

1880
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:20,810
What about me?

1881
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,210
(She's trying to go into the room.)

1882
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,350
What about me?

1883
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,460
I was the one who opened it.

1884
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,750
Let me know too.

1885
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,150
- Yong Ji, I'm sorry.
- We can't.

1886
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:30,830
- But I...
- I'm really sorry. Please leave.

1887
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,750
I'm sorry. I think I can tell you
everything later.

1888
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,230
That's weird.

1889
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:36,600
(They stopped Yong Ji
and let only the cameramen in.)

1890
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,900
(What?)

1891
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:41,000
(Jae Suk successfully go in
like a loach.)

1892
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,670
That's not fair.

1893
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,060
They all went in.

1894
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,040
Come on in.

1895
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,130
You're the last one to come in.

1896
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,610
Gosh, seriously.

1897
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:51,900
What just happened? Why would he...

1898
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,170
You're the last one to come in.

1899
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,150
- Can't we share it with others?
- No, never.

1900
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:59,650
- Let me see. Or tell me.
- Who are you to hold that?

1901
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:00,650
My team found it.

1902
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:02,150
- You should show us too.
- Okay. Just a second.

1903
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:03,750
- Let us see it with you.
- You shouldn't do that.

1904
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,480
- It says...
- Gosh. No.

1905
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,600
(Screaming)

1906
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,150
- No.
- What's going on?

1907
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,600
- Go away.
- I'm almost done. Hang in there.

1908
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,670
I said, no.

1909
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,460
(30 minutes ago, he said he wanted
to do something before escaping.)

1910
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:16,060
I want to beat Jong Kook.

1911
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,110
Don't try that.

1912
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:18,230
If you do, you won't be able to
escape today.

1913
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,130
I really want to get back at him
while I'm in here.

1914
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:21,130
(Do Kwon was adamant
although Suk Jin dissuaded him.)

1915
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:23,210
Jong Kook will find his partner.

1916
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:24,540
So I'm going to aim at his partner.

1917
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:25,900
That's a good idea.

1918
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,940
Stop it. I'm serious.

1919
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,270
- Stop it.
- I'm almost done.

1920
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:31,210
- Hang in there.
- I said, no.

1921
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,380
(At that moment, he took off
her name tag.)

1922
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,860
- Defense.
- He wants to...

1923
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,360
- get Jong Kook.
- I have the Defense Right.

1924
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,190
- You have the Defense Right?
- Yes.

1925
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:39,420
Yes, she has the Defense Right.

1926
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,130
I attacked her
just to get Jong Kook.

1927
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:43,020
- But she has the Defense Right.
- Are you all right?

1928
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,330
Excuse me. It's me, Young Min.

1929
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,560
- We can never let him in.
- Of course.

1930
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,170
He's the last one we want to let in.

1931
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,610
Excuse me. It's me, Young Min.

1932
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,860
(He's asking them
to let him in politely.)

1933
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,940
- We can never let him in.
- Of course.

1934
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,710
(But they won't let him in.)

1935
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,110
What is he doing?

1936
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:58,310
Jae Suk.

1937
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,650
(The politest gang member
in the world)

1938
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:01,810
Jae Suk.

1939
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:03,580
That's not it. I should go.

1940
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,580
(Yong Ji who used her Defense Right
left to put on a regular name tag.)

1941
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,860
- Okay. That was crazy.
- Do Kwon is so energetic.

1942
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,790
Do Kwon is...

1943
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,080
(All he wants is
to defeat Jong Kook.)

1944
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,690
He doesn't care about anything else.

1945
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,960
- His son told him to beat him.
- I think so.

1946
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:18,900
- 1, 2, 3, 4... We need name tags...
- Jong Kook.

1947
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,290
(Jong Kook was trying to figure out
how to get the lock combination.)

1948
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:21,360
Yes?

1949
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,630
Oh, I get it.

1950
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:25,130
I get it.

1951
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:27,670
- I get it now.
- I got eliminated once.

1952
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,130
Really? Who did that?
Was it Young Min?

1953
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,900
- It was Do Kwon.
- Do Kwon?

1954
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,380
- Do Kwon.
- Do Kwon?

1955
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:34,710
(I can't believe he did that
while I was gone.)

1956
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:35,940
I think I know what it means.

1957
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,150
Is it here?

1958
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:38,790
So how many name tags do we need?

1959
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:40,860
We need 5 name tags
for a 5-digit combination.

1960
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,860
What do you think that means?

1961
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,020
- We should take off name tags.
- Correct.

1962
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,150
Let's go take off some name tags.

1963
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:45,880
We need to submit five name tags...

1964
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,730
to get the combination and get out.

1965
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:52,790
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk was
kicked out too.)

1966
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,040
Who is it?

1967
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:57,310
What is it?

1968
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,770
I'm just wondering
what the text says.

1969
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,110
Well...

1970
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,250
I'm sorry,
but we can't tell you that.

1971
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,710
Let's get out of this room for now.

1972
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,310
- It turns out...
- You guys are mean.

1973
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:08,480
- This is...
- Come on out for now.

1974
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,920
- I think he has the Defense Right.
- Can you show me the phone?

1975
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,980
(Share the information with me.)

1976
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,290
- I'll give it back to you.
- Hurry.

1977
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:16,520
(While following them,)

1978
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,960
(Young Min came back.)

1979
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,630
- What is it?
- Boss, you should escape.

1980
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,730
(He suddenly changed
his attitude.)

1981
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,630
(Did he just
called Suk Jin "Boss"?)

1982
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:27,330
What are you talking about?

1983
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:29,290
(What is going on?)

1984
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:30,440
- You see...
- Is he the boss?

1985
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,460
I heard you're the boss.

1986
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:34,480
(I heard you're the boss.)

1987
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,480
Yes. But don't tell anyone else.
Why did you say that here?

1988
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,570
(Yes. But don't tell anyone else.
Why did you say that here?)

1989
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:42,620
(Was Suk Jin the boss?)

1990
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

1991
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,450
- It's been a while.
- Seeing that I'm here alone,

1992
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:48,560
- I guess I have a solo mission.
- Correct.

1993
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:50,560
You're taking a risk.

1994
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,860
- We mustered up the courage.
- I see.

1995
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,730
- You are...
- Yes.

1996
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:57,320
the boss of Petty Gang...

1997
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,660
(Suk Jin is
the boss of Petty Gang.)

1998
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,940
who is currently imprisoned.

1999
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:03,070
I see.

2000
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:06,370
Among the new inmates
whom you will meet tomorrow,

2001
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,310
there will be a gang member
who will come to get you out.

2002
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:12,650
And I don't know who that is?

2003
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:15,170
- The identity of the gang member...
- Yes.

2004
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,690
is closely related to the letters,
"Janbaripa", as in Petty Gang.

2005
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:22,450
I advise you to take a careful look
around the commissary...

2006
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,450
and the cafeteria
that will be open tomorrow.

2007
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,060
(He can find out if he focuses on
"Janbaripa"?)

2008
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:30,320
(Boss Big Nose searched items in
the commissary whenever he could.)

2009
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:33,100
(He checked a drink
whose name has "jan" in it.)

2010
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:36,160
(Number two was marked
with a circle.)

2011
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,980
(Next, he found a snack
with "ba" in its name.)

2012
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:43,130
(And he found number three.)

2013
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:45,280
Can I eat the whole box or just one?

2014
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,870
(He skillfully found "ri"
after that.)

2015
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:50,780
(He found number 7.)

2016
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:54,120
(Boss Big Nose suspected green onion
which is "pa" in Korean.)

2017
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,410
(He rummaged through the green onion
for a while.)

2018
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:58,420
(He found number 1.)

2019
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:02,790
(So he found
the 4-digit number, 2371.)

2020
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,370
(It matched the inmate number
of Young Min, the gang member.)

2021
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:09,910
(Tapping)

2022
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:12,330
(Boss!)

2023
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:16,570
(With his outstanding observation
ability and concentration,)

2024
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:19,370
(he won over Do Kwon
as well as the gang member.)

2025
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:21,210
You and I are the stars
of this episode.

2026
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:24,540
Why? This will be over
when we get out.

2027
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:28,990
(However, Kwang Soo who was
with them was a problem.)

2028
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:32,560
(He got eliminated only 10 minutes
after the race began.)

2029
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:35,290
(Young Min was impressed
by the boss' drive.)

2030
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:36,870
Kwang Soo.

2031
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:38,160
You should paint a big picture.

2032
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:40,330
(What is he talking about?)

2033
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,490
That's not it.

2034
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:43,810
- We're off.
- Take care of him, please.

2035
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,940
Let's go. Let's go, Young Min.

2036
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,110
(Now that we've taken care of him,
let's go, Boss.)

2037
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,070
(Kwang Soo was taken aback
as he was eliminated too early.)

2038
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:50,170
But...

2039
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,350
- Are you three on the same team?
- No.

2040
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:53,570
(Who are the three of you?)

2041
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:54,570
What is this?

2042
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:56,850
(Giggling)

2043
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:58,350
You just have to
go to your cell quietly.

2044
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,880
(Teasing)

2045
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,490
(Spitting)

2046
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:04,030
(Kwang Soo got angry
and tried to get back at them.)

2047
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:06,790
(Darn it. I'm so angry.)

2048
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,320
(Kwang Soo's attack
made them laugh.)

2049
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:12,400
- This is the fun of doing this.
- Also...

2050
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,240
- He's the gang member.
- You should know that.

2051
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,830
(They strengthened their unity
while eliminating others.)

2052
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,700
- The 4 of us are on the same side.
- The 4 of us are on the same side.

2053
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,940
(Including Jae Suk,
we're a family.)

2054
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,030
- Go and tell Jae Suk.
- Right. Tell him.

2055
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:23,280
(Suk Jin, the boss of Petty Gang,
worked actively in secret.)

2056
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,350
What's that?

2057
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,480
I am the boss of Petty Gang.

2058
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:31,850
(Rubbing)

2059
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:34,160
(Warning: It can be erased easily.)

2060
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,950
- Look here. It says I'm the boss.
- You really are...

2061
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,620
- You are the boss of Petty Gang.
- And here.

2062
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,230
- You really are in the Petty Gang.
- He's...

2063
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:41,320
the gang member.
He's the gang member,

2064
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,460
- and I'm the boss.
- It seems to suit him.

2065
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:45,700
He looks petty, you know.

2066
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:48,030
However, I'm worried
because I think...

2067
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:50,410
- that Yong Ji brought Jong Kook.
- Exactly.

2068
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,610
I think Jong Kook came with her.
What should we do?

2069
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:54,130
Jong Kook must be...

2070
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:56,440
- furious right now.
- Of course, he's furious.

2071
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,740
Because Do Kwon eliminated
his partner.

2072
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,810
I guess we receive something
if we submit name tags.

2073
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:03,780
(Anyway, they need five name tags
to escape the prison.)

2074
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:04,850
I have a lot.

2075
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,080
He took off the name tag
of everyone he saw.

2076
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,120
I lost the name tag I got,
so I went back to find it.

2077
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,750
(Here's why Do Kwon was
collecting the name tags.)

2078
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,460
I'll take this as a souvenir
because my son likes you.

2079
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,990
(For his children,)

2080
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,830
(he collected the name tags
one by one.)

2081
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:25,940
I'll give these to my children.

2082
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:28,440
I'll take this home too.

2083
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,350
(So he collected four name tags.)

2084
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:33,950
I'm glad I collected them.

2085
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:35,980
He's so lucky.

2086
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,280
He collected the name tags
for his daughter.

2087
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,350
(His love for his children brought
him a great achievement.)

2088
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:40,950
He wouldn't stop collecting
name tags.

2089
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:42,120
I collected them only for my kids.

2090
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,280
I had no idea.

2091
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,060
- You're lying.
- It's true.

2092
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,920
You're lucky.

2093
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,530
Do Kwon is a unique case.

2094
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,030
He's really unique.

2095
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:52,530
I'm glad I collected them.

2096
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:54,370
"You need 5 name tags
for a 5-digit combination.

2097
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,100
We are one short.

2098
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:57,910
If it's too hard to get one,

2099
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,030
we can rip off one of our own
name tags and get it.

2100
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,480
In the end?

2101
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,650
Of course. We'll go together.

2102
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:08,370
Gosh, this punk is really smart.

2103
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,380
(He's too immersed in his role
as a gang boss.)

2104
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,280
- Why did you call me a punk?
- I was in character.

2105
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:14,520
Gang bosses usually say
things like that.

2106
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,580
(Do you think
you're a real gang boss?)

2107
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:16,880
Gang bosses usually say
things like that.

2108
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,860
I thought I was in a movie
because they're here with us.

2109
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:20,820
(Boss Big Nose is overly immersed as
he hasn't been a boss in a while.)

2110
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,200
Here.

2111
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,460
If you get eliminated,
I get eliminated too.

2112
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:24,700
(It's time to go outside.)

2113
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,100
If I get eliminated,
I'll leave it to you.

2114
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:29,330
- Then...
- Please take care of it.

2115
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,270
(At that moment...)

2116
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:34,980
It's been a while since we did this.

2117
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:37,980
We have to rip off
Do Kwon's name tag.

2118
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,120
We have to rip off Do Kwon's
name tag...

2119
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,740
and take all of his things.

2120
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:44,080
(They're looking for the four people
who are hiding.)

2121
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,820
They're not here.
They must've gone over there.

2122
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:48,520
(At that moment...)

2123
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,660
- They were in there!
- Who?

2124
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:53,160
Jong Kook. You're angry, aren't you?

2125
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,230
(They appear in complete fear
befitting of the Petty Gang.)

2126
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,420
I'm quite angry.

2127
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,990
How many of you are there?
Is it the three of you?

2128
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:59,200
Do Kwon is hiding in here.

2129
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,740
- Why is he hiding? Why?
- He said he's scared.

2130
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,160
- He set up a barricade.
- Do Kwon...

2131
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,130
said that he's afraid of you.
That's why.

2132
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:07,280
Do Kwon, come out.

2133
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,700
He said he's going to apologize.

2134
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,370
Do Kwon, why did you do it?

2135
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,480
I wanted the gold name tag.

2136
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,020
That name tag.

2137
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,820
Please forgive me. I was rash.

2138
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,880
Do you only have
one name tag right now?

2139
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,560
- I only have one.
- Really?

2140
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:24,750
- I'm really sorry, but can we...
- In a circle.

2141
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:27,860
- Can we talk in a wider space?
- Let's stand in a circle.

2142
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,450
- Why?
- Pardon?

2143
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:33,100
If we go to a wider space,
it would be easier to film.

2144
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,630
- It would be easier to get beat.
- No.

2145
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:38,770
Go first, and the four of us
will discuss it.

2146
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:40,740
- Because...
- Honestly...

2147
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:43,570
- If we don't have each other...
- Do Kwon has a ton of name tags.

2148
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,500
- Give us a hint.
- He already has a lot.

2149
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:46,910
- He has a bunch of name tags.
- We're going to talk.

2150
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,670
Why did they band together?

2151
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:52,080
We have to go and do it.
We must rip off our own name tags.

2152
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,860
- Right.
- There's no need to face them.

2153
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,410
- The way that I see it,
- Do we need to go that way?

2154
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:58,230
we're going to have to face them.

2155
01:14:58,230 --> 01:15:01,200
Regardless, only one of the teams
can survive.

2156
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,990
Right. Only one team will survive.

2157
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:04,070
- There. Hurry.
- Where?

2158
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:06,290
- The cleaning lady is there.
- Where?

2159
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:08,440
Hold on. Hold on a minute.

2160
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:10,870
Hold on.

2161
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:12,630
We have four right now.

2162
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,870
- Let's rip off your name tag.
- Okay.

2163
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:16,630
- Let's rip it off.
- Okay.

2164
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:20,370
Here you go.

2165
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:22,480
- This is five.
- This isn't enough.

2166
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,520
- Why?
- Why?

2167
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,910
- This isn't enough.
- Why?

2168
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,380
These two are...

2169
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:28,190
- They're not exchangeable?
- Why did we rip it off?

2170
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,710
What do you mean by
it's not exchangeable?

2171
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,360
- You can't exchange Defense Rights.
- You can't exchange Defense Rights.

2172
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,990
Just rip mine off.
Oh, wait, Young Min dies then.

2173
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:34,790
- First...
- I don't die.

2174
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:36,860
Young Min and I must die here.

2175
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:38,270
I think... No.

2176
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:40,200
Then you need to die.

2177
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,440
Right, I do.

2178
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,940
Hurry.

2179
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:43,940
- We have no choice.
- We have no choice.

2180
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:44,960
I don't know if we'll be able
to escape.

2181
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,240
- We have to get out.
- We have no choice.

2182
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,610
We have no choice.
Here. There's five.

2183
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:49,670
(They got five name tags.)

2184
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,500
- Jae Suk and Young Min are out.
- What?

2185
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,480
I told you.

2186
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,410
Do you think they're trying to
go down with the combination?

2187
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:58,780
Should we go to where
the combination is?

2188
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:00,250
Do you think
they're trying to go down?

2189
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,080
We have to catch them and
rip off their name tags then.

2190
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,820
(In the meanwhile, Petty Gang is...)

2191
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,690
You know what I'm saying, right?

2192
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:07,950
- Your name tag...
- 42...

2193
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,250
- needs to be ripped off to win.
- 42098.

2194
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,990
- Okay?
- Can we go down now?

2195
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:13,570
Let's go up.

2196
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,740
- We'll go out and distract them.
- Okay. Distract them.

2197
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,700
- Then go down this way.
- No.

2198
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,240
(They come together to risk
their luck when...)

2199
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,310
They're here.

2200
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:22,810
(The boss has been seen.)

2201
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:23,810
They're here.

2202
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:25,240
- Hey.
- Run!

2203
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,480
Go that way!

2204
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,070
Hold on. That way.

2205
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:30,580
- Go back. Downstairs.
- Downstairs.

2206
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:34,490
- Move.
- Where are you going?

2207
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,660
- Move.
- Where are you going?

2208
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:37,950
Hurry up.

2209
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:39,190
Open the door.

2210
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,160
Open the door.

2211
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,160
Go.

2212
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,490
They're over here!

2213
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:45,570
- What should we do?
- They're over here!

2214
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:46,920
- Haha.
- Come here!

2215
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:50,370
(Jong Kook got him.)

2216
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:52,630
I ripped it off. He's out.

2217
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:53,810
He still has a chance.

2218
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,170
(He survived because it was
a Defense Right.)

2219
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:57,570
(Meanwhile, Do Kwon,
a man who's like fire, is...)

2220
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,810
Try opening that door.

2221
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,410
Suk Jin's name tag.

2222
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,850
(While Do Kwon distracts everyone,
the boss disappears.)

2223
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,850
(Escaping at full speed)

2224
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:07,860
Suk Jin had two name tags.

2225
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:09,990
10 minutes until the truck leaves.

2226
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:11,920
(They have 10 minutes left
before the escape truck leaves.)

2227
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:14,060
- He opened the door. We got him.
- Open it!

2228
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:16,100
Hold on! Jong Kook.

2229
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,820
- You said you'd forgive me.
- We got him.

2230
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:18,870
Okay.

2231
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:21,400
Fine, I'll be heroic
and go against Jong Kook.

2232
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:23,370
Hurry.

2233
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,370
Get in here.

2234
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,030
- Get in here.
- What is this?

2235
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:27,240
Okay.

2236
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,500
- Get in here.
- What is this?

2237
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,500
Okay.

2238
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,410
(Haha is out.)

2239
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:32,480
(Jong Kook eliminates Haha
and Seung Hyun first.)

2240
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,650
- Okay.
- Haha and Seung Hyun are out.

2241
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,710
Why?

2242
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:36,850
Give me a second.

2243
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:37,880
(In the world of inmates, there are
no eternal allies or enemies.)

2244
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,580
There aren't any cameras in here.

2245
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:40,750
Let's take this outside.

2246
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:41,990
Let's do it right outside.

2247
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,860
- Yong Ji, come in here.
- Jong Kook.

2248
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,950
Let's go someplace nice.

2249
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:48,490
This isn't a nice place.
Let's go someplace nice.

2250
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,730
- Let's go someplace nice, please.
- Hold on.

2251
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:53,320
42098. Do Kwon needs to get here.

2252
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,330
- Let's look cool.
- Hold on.

2253
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,660
Yong Ji, follow me.

2254
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,940
You can't go with him!

2255
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,030
Yong Ji, follow me.

2256
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:00,410
- You can't go with him!
- Hurry up and follow me.

2257
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:04,040
(Jong Kook and Yong Ji leave
to go after the boss.)

2258
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:06,540
Do Kwon needs to get here.

2259
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:11,620
(Do Kwon leaves the room
to protect the boss.)

2260
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:12,850
(But...)

2261
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:13,910
Hold on.

2262
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,410
(This was all a set up
orchestrated by Jong Kook.)

2263
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:17,490
I'm standing backward
on the stairs.

2264
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,700
(He successfully lured Do Kwon out.)

2265
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,420
(Ha Do Kwon versus Kim Jong Kook)

2266
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:26,230
Yong Ji, come here.

2267
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:28,460
(Ripping)

2268
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:29,830
Hold on.

2269
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,530
(This is a match where their prides
are on the line.)

2270
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:32,960
Hold on.

2271
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:37,810
(Do Kwon isn't losing to Jong Kook.)

2272
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,780
(At that moment,
Yong Ji goes behind him...)

2273
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:42,540
(and successfully rips off
his name tag.)

2274
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,710
- Ha Do Kwon is out.
- We did it.

2275
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,560
- Ji Suk Jin out.
- What?

2276
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,620
- Why?
- Your partner got eliminated.

2277
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,060
(Boss Big Nose got eliminated
when he was so close to victory.)

2278
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:55,290
This is driving me crazy.

2279
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:58,030
(That was really close.)

2280
01:18:58,030 --> 01:18:59,100
Is it over?

2281
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:01,790
- Good job.
- Good job.

2282
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,030
I wanted to face you 1 on 1.

2283
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:07,980
You have less than two minutes
to escape.

2284
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:10,570
(This is the memo with
the combination he hid earlier.)

2285
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:14,670
(Jong Kook and Yong Ji
need this number.)

2286
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,820
- No.
- Hey!

2287
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:18,820
(He's chewing up the only
record of the combination.)

2288
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,020
You shouldn't eat that!

2289
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,780
You shouldn't do that.

2290
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:22,910
It's delicious.

2291
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,160
- Give it to us.
- Hurry.

2292
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,780
- Hurry.
- Hurry up and give it to us.

2293
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,160
- We should go.
- Share the prize.

2294
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,600
Okay. I'll give it to you.

2295
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,290
You can give it to your daughter.

2296
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:32,960
(Spitting)

2297
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,530
- Don't do this. This is gross.
- Let's go.

2298
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:37,100
(It is 2:59 p.m.)

2299
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,530
This is so gross.

2300
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:40,830
(They have to get on the truck
prepared for the boss to win.)

2301
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:41,940
What is the number?

2302
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:42,940
This is the number.

2303
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,500
What is it?

2304
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,480
(Do Kwon's last fight
took up a lot of time.)

2305
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,780
This is so gross.

2306
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,120
- 2?
- 42098.

2307
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:54,450
- 4, 2, 0, 9, 9, 8. Yes.
- 0, 9, 8.

2308
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:56,380
(They unlocked the lock.)

2309
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,660
- We got it.
- We got it.

2310
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,160
- Gosh.
- Let's get on.

2311
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,060
(They finally found Petty Gang's
escape truck.)

2312
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:04,770
Gosh. In the back.

2313
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:06,120
(After many twists and turns,
they are about to escape.)

2314
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,160
Gosh.

2315
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,700
My goodness.

2316
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:11,830
You've successfully escaped!

2317
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:14,610
(Regular inmates, Jong Kook
and Yong Ji, successfully escape.)

2318
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:16,740
We did it. Okay.

2319
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:17,910
(The race is over.)

2320
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,070
The final result of the race.

2321
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:23,570
Kim Jong Kook and Kim Yong Ji
have successfully escaped.

2322
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:25,380
(Kim Jong Kook and Kim Yong Ji
have successfully escaped.)

2323
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:27,750
I was almost there.

2324
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:29,910
I'll show you the prize set.

2325
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,120
(It's a complete set of tofu
to celebrate their escape.)

2326
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,160
It's tofu.

2327
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,360
It's really tofu.

2328
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,950
There's even a gift card.

2329
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,230
- Congratulations.
- There's a 100-dollar gift card.

2330
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:39,600
- Really?
- Amazing.

2331
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,960
- We'll send you the mobile coupon.
- Okay.

2332
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,200
This supermarket is known
to have a large variety.

2333
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,960
- Right.
- Is this a product placement ad?

2334
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,070
I agreed to give my prize...

2335
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:51,740
to Do Kwon.

2336
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:54,540
- He doesn't like it.
- So he can give it to his daughter.

2337
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,280
This is for Do Kwon.

2338
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,580
(This is a gift for Do Kwon,
who put on a great fight.)

2339
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:00,660
He put the combination in his mouth
and refused to give it up.

2340
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:02,410
He tried to chew it up and eat it
at the end.

2341
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:03,750
- Really?
- Yes.

2342
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:08,820
(Son, this is how hard I worked.)

2343
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:10,990
- He's so nice.
- Well done, everyone.

2344
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:12,660
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2345
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,900
(We'd like to thank Ji Seung Hyun,
Kim Young Min, Kim Yong Ji,)

2346
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,130
(and Ha Do Kwon for running
with us on this hot day.)

2347
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,330
(August 3, 2020 at 3 p.m.,
Inside the Interrogation Room)

2348
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:20,130
(One suspect is shedding tears.)

2349
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:22,240
(And two men are watching him.)

2350
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,280
What is all of this?

2351
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,280
(4 hours before the incident)

2352
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:27,320
(International departure)

(Running Morning Soccer Club

2354
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:31,080
(Kwak Do Won, Kim Sang Ho,
Kim Dae Myung)

2355
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:32,580
(However,)

2356
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:35,080
(they are banned from travel as they
are suspected to be salt smugglers.)

2357
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,210
(Through domestic investigation,)

2358
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:39,360
(they must clear out the criminals
hiding amongst them.)

2359
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:43,200
(Criminals and police officers are
hidden amongst innocent citizens.)

2360
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,530
(A silent pursuit for them
is starting.)

2361
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:49,160
(Everyone is surprised at what
happens in the investigation room.)

2362
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,630
One of us could be the criminal.

2363
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:53,500
(How will the case of
the terrible salt smugglers end?)

2364
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:55,370
I'm a police officer.

2365
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:57,570
My gosh, stop being a fool.
