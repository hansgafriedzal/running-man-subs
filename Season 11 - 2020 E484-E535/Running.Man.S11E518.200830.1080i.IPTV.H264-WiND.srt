1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,120
(This was filmed before the practice
of social distancing step 2.)

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,520
Hello, hello.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,230
- Our spots are marked.
- Hello.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,320
Ji Hyo sent me black raspberries.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,090
Did you send them to everyone?

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,370
- Yes.
- You think I sent them selectively?

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,260
- You didn't send any last time.
- To whom?

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,510
- To me.
- What do you mean?

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,600
Remember gwamegi?

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,030
- Suk Jin.
- I sent it to you.

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,900
- You sent him black raspberries?
- Why?

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,710
They won't be any use to him.

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,370
(You sent him black raspberries?
They won't be any use to him.)

15
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,550
Goodness.

16
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,280
What is he saying?

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,580
Jong Kook, you were waiting
for the right moment to say it.

18
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,480
Suk Jin can use them
to make kimchi.

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,320
- To make kimchi?
- Yes.

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,620
He can enjoy them
because they're sweet.

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,230
They're sweet.

22
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,860
What do you know?

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,300
- Why are you blushing?
- I am not.

24
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,260
You lose if you blush.

25
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,760
- He lost.
- I'm not blushing.

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,540
It's because it's hilarious.

27
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,510
I expected it,
but why is it so funny?

28
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,510
(It's the effect
of black raspberries.)

29
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,580
I heard that Ji Hyo has been
generous these days.

30
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,610
- Why?
- About what?

31
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,300
She sent coffee to everyone.

32
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,680
She sent it to Solar.

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,910
- That's right.
- Yes.

34
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,120
Why are you doing this
all of a sudden?

35
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,680
Are you out of your mind?

36
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,020
- "Out of your mind"?
- I wanted to be generous.

37
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,210
She makes an effort
to maintain her relationships.

38
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,790
- Now...
- She got rid of her walls.

39
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,430
- Ji Hyo broke down her walls.
- Now?

40
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,320
She's opening up to the world.

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,960
- At the age of 40?
- She was in a cave before.

42
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,370
She's 40, and now she's opening up.

43
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,370
- That's impressive.
- That's great.

44
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,400
Ji Hyo, what happened to you?

45
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,660
It's nothing.

46
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,160
Will you be making a sudden,

47
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,660
- important announcement?
- No.

48
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,740
- Are you getting...
- Is it all for your wedding?

49
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,770
(Is that why
she's giving out presents?)

50
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,300
- Are you getting...
- Is that why?

51
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,210
There's a rumor
about So Min's relationship.

52
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,120
- What's going on with you?
- What's with you?

53
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,790
("Rumors about Oh Dong Min
and Jeon So Min's Relationship")

54
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,520
("They Deny Their Relationship",
"They're Just Close Friends")

55
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,160
I have many male friends.

56
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,820
Now they're blocking my way.

57
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,190
Why would you go to an escape room?

58
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,100
Isn't that where you go
with your boyfriend?

59
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,690
- Did you go camping with him?
- By the way...

60
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,770
- Camping?
- No.

61
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,770
We didn't go camping,
but these days...

62
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,740
- That's impressive.
- No.

63
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,740
- Did you even go camping with him?
- That's not true.

64
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,410
Now that I think about it,
she was friendlier than usual...

65
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,740
to Se Chan in the waiting room
today.

66
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,810
Exactly. Suddenly,
she told me to come...

67
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,910
- and offered me a seat.
- She told him to come next to her.

68
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,850
They talked while sitting on a sofa.

69
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,220
You're the only one for me.

70
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,950
(You're the only one for me.)

71
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,910
You're the only one for me.

72
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,590
She's setting up a shield.

73
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,320
My goodness.

74
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,730
I'm an easy target as her shield.

75
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,660
- You know...
- Se Chan must be confused.

76
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,790
She's pretending to be close
to everyone including Oh Dong Min.

77
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,470
Se Chan is acting as her smoke bomb.

78
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,700
Since two days ago, Se Chan
didn't respond to my messages.

79
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,760
- After the news about Dong Min...
- Are you upset?

80
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,510
- That's right.
- Just pay attention to him.

81
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,040
No, he's just a friend.

82
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,310
His name is Oh Dong Min.
You mispronounced his name.

83
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,380
It's Oh Dong Min.

84
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,290
What you said is
a song by Choi Heon.

85
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,410
- You understood what I mean.
- Right.

86
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,720
Today, you're students
at Brahms Music School.

87
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,380
- A music school?
- You'll be showing off...

88
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,630
your music skills.

89
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,030
What's Brahms?

90
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,290
- It's an instrument.
- An instrument?

91
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,100
It's one of the instruments
in an orchestra.

92
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,100
(Johannes Brahms, a composer known
for "The Hungarian Dances")

93
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,260
Four students at the same school
are waiting for you.

94
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,630
- Really?
- Please come out.

95
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,660
Please come out.

96
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,660
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

97
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,010
- Hello.
- What's going on?

98
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,910
- My goodness.
- Ji Hyun

99
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,410
- Gosh.
- Eun Bin.

100
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,410
- Hello.
- It's good to see you.

101
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,910
(Park Eun Bin, a popular actress
appearing on "Hot Stove League",)

102
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,940
("Hur Jun, The Original Story",
and "Hello, My Twenties!")

103
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,290
It's Ji Hyun. Wow.

104
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,320
(Park Ji Hyun in "Gonjiam: Haunted
Asylum", and "Rookie Historian...")

105
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,420
("Goo Hae Ryung"
and Running Man Episode 475)

106
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,730
It's Min Jae.

107
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,730
(Kim Min Jae appeared in
"Dr. Romantic", "Goblin",)

108
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,760
("Flower Crew: Joseon Marriage
Agency" and "Love, Sling".)

109
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,470
All right.

110
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,910
(Kim Sung Cheol appeared
in "Prison Playbook",)

111
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,630
("Kim Ji-young Born 1982",
and "The Wind Blows".)

112
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,410
(The four actors are the cast
in "Do You Like Brahms?")

113
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,040
(The drama tells a story
of dreams and love.)

114
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,320
All right.

115
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,920
What do you think when you look
at the four of them?

116
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,030
- They're in a new drama.
- Are they promoting it?

117
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,390
- Promoting?
- It must be an SBS drama.

118
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,690
Look, Eun Bin seems embarrassed.

119
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,100
- Don't be embarrassed.
- Okay.

120
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,290
Promoting isn't bad.

121
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,290
- In that case...
- What kind of drama is it?

122
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,310
Is it about youth?

123
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,910
That's right. We're here
to promote it anyway.

124
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,500
- Please do.
- Okay.

125
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,040
It's a Mon-Tues SBS drama called
"Do You Like Brahms?"

126
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,410
"Do You Like Brahms?"

127
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,280
- It's at a music school.
- That's why today's theme...

128
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,740
- is a music school.
- Yes.

129
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,020
- It takes place at a music school.
- It's a youthful...

130
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,730
melodrama that's full of emotions
based on classical music.

131
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,920
- Is that so?
- The roles that we play...

132
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,400
are 29 years old.

133
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,920
- What?
- It's about questioning...

134
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,730
dreams and love
at the end of their 20's.

135
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,790
- Love?
- That's what...

136
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,140
- it's about.
- Are you guys couples then?

137
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,560
Is it a love triangle?

138
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,770
Isn't that right?

139
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,930
Should it be a secret for now?

140
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,780
- Of course.
- I see.

141
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,670
I bet there's a couple
and one of them interferes.

142
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,810
You're the one interfering.
My goodness.

143
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,040
- That's what makes it fun.
- Let them promote.

144
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,680
Normally, the way
Eun Bin promotes is...

145
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,790
that she hopes
that people enjoy the drama.

146
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,030
She's discreet about it.

147
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,050
Now, she said the entire synopsis.

148
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,830
(Now, she said the entire synopsis.)

149
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,920
I think she memorized it.

150
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,490
- The first episode is on August 31.
- Like a machine.

151
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,160
- It's tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

152
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,560
That's right.

153
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,910
Please be sure to watch it.

154
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,300
We have these four guests today.
What's the theme today?

155
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,410
All 12 of you are students
at a music school.

156
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,480
You'll take a simple music test...

157
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,810
and be assigned to your grade
from 1 to 4.

158
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,650
- I hope I'm in a higher grade.
- Are questions related to music?

159
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,310
- Yes, they are.
- That's a relief.

160
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,890
It's a total of 10 questions.

161
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,550
The top three enter fourth grade.

162
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,030
The next top three
enter third grade,

163
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,050
second, and first in order.

164
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,550
It's better...

165
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,700
to lie about your score and grade.

166
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,530
- I'll tell you why later.
- Is that so?

167
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,160
- I'm good at that.
- The higher your grade, the better.

168
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,560
I wonder what the questions are.

169
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,230
- We'll bring in desks and chairs.
- Okay.

170
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,430
(What kind of music test is it?)

171
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,080
Please open the test.

172
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,410
(They open the test.)

173
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,150
Okay, do we start?

174
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,720
- Gosh, isn't it that one?
- I can do it.

175
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,480
My goodness.
Why are we taking a test?

176
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,520
- Do we start?
- Now?

177
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,180
- "Listen to the classical piece."
- Do we write it down?

178
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,420
It's a listening question.

179
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,620
Do I write down the answers
with the pen?

180
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,530
Open up the PDF file.

181
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,290
- Take out your pen.
- With the pen?

182
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,200
Write down the answers
and send them.

183
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,340
Do we start?

184
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,700
Here's number one.

185
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,730
(Listen to the piece
and write down the title.)

186
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,500
- What's this piece?
- I definitely know it.

187
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,980
(What's this?)

188
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,410
- It played at Western restaurants.
- Right.

189
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,980
- When you order a course meal.
- Yes.

190
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,890
Either pork cutlet or hamburg steak.

191
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,980
I definitely know it.

192
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,550
(Listen to the piece
and write down the title.)

193
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,890
- What is it?
- Brahms?

194
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,050
- What?
- Isn't it by Brahms?

195
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,120
It's by Brahms?

196
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,250
Isn't it by Brahms?

197
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,620
- This?
- What?

198
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,160
It's 3 syllables plus 2 syllables.

199
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,790
I thought it was something else.

200
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,290
Isn't it what I think it is?

201
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,340
I can't remember the last word.

202
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,540
Here's the second question.

203
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,860
Play music for the second question.

204
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,930
Number one.

205
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,140
(Next are the titles of songs
by Jang Beom June.)

206
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,240
(Listen to the four songs
and list the titles in order.)

207
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,210
(Each is worth 2.5 points.)

208
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,020
(Glancing)

209
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,310
Number two.

210
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,220
(He spots her trying to cheat.)

211
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,830
These are Beom June's songs
that I'm not familiar with.

212
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,200
Number three.

213
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,160
(These are the hit songs
that everyone knows.)

214
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,290
I have no idea.

215
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,830
(They sound all the same.)

216
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,140
I have no idea either.

217
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,230
Number four.

218
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,970
(They all sound familiar.)

219
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,780
(4 similar yet different songs
by Jang Beom June)

220
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,800
What was it?

221
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,670
I don't recognize this one.

222
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,540
Next is a short answer question.

223
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,680
You get an advantage
if you submit first.

224
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,540
Option number three...

225
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,960
and four. Aren't they the same
person with different wigs?

226
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,330
They're definitely different.

227
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,990
I'm just writing down names
that I know.

228
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,120
Did you write "Sam Hammington"?

229
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,100
No way.

230
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,860
These two are confusing.

231
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,540
- Aren't they the father and mother?
- Right.

232
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,540
- What is this?
- Father and mother?

233
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,300
Which one is the father?

234
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,340
But they're both men.

235
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,150
Why are they father and mother?

236
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,870
Father of music and mother of music.

237
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,870
- Is it Vincent van Gogh?
- My goodness.

238
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,350
- Gogh was a painter.
- He was a painter.

239
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,410
Was he?

240
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,910
"Amor Fati"?

241
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,460
I knew it before.

242
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,480
<i>Amor party</i>

243
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,890
(The answer is "love your fate".)

244
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,330
(She tries to cheat again.)

245
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,020
Come on.

246
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,300
(Looking around)

247
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,070
Eun Bin, you can't cheat.

248
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,970
- She's cheating a lot.
- No.

249
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,710
I didn't know she was like this.

250
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,480
"Just imagining it feels like
my heart is about to burst".

251
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,270
"Just imagining it feels like
my heart is about to burst"?

252
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,610
Based on "I might cry",
it's a recent song.

253
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,010
<i>I might cry</i>

254
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,980
- <i>Cry, cry</i>
- What?

255
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,480
<i>- Amor fati
- Amor fati</i>

256
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,750
(Amor fati!)

257
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,020
(They sing along
in the middle of the test.)

258
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,300
That's right.

259
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,230
Is SEVENTEEN a group of 13?

260
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,970
Were there six in god?

261
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,760
How many were in H.O.T?

262
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,840
There were 23.

263
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,970
(It's a very wrong answer.)

264
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,310
If you can get two right,
you'll get the top score.

265
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,580
(They write down their answers.)

266
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,710
I'm finished.

267
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,180
Please send it.

268
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,640
- Is it better to send it quickly?
- I'm done...

269
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,550
If your scores tie, the person
who sent earlier wins.

270
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,350
"Message", "Search PDF".

271
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,110
(It's time to submit the answers.)

272
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,220
Five.

273
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,520
- I sent it.
- I should just write what I know.

274
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,560
(The bad students always
submit their test last.)

275
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,100
(The test is over.)

276
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,030
While we check your answers,
we'll give you the answers.

277
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,490
Number one is "Love's Greeting"
by Edward Elgar.

278
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,100
I wrote "Love's Conversation".

279
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,980
(Continuous wrong answers
that are just extraordinary)

280
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,680
Isn't it called "Our Love"?

281
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,680
Min Jae and Haha wrote "Our Love".

282
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,450
- "Our Love".
- "Our Love".

283
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,110
(They're happy to hear it.)

284
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,320
Question number two.

285
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,690
Number one.

286
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,560
"It's Hard to Face You".

287
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,980
("It's Hard to Face You")

288
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,120
Number two.

289
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,520
"Yeosu Night Sea".

290
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,670
("Yeosu Night Sea")

291
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,030
- Number three.
- "Love, At First".

292
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,360
("Love, At First")

293
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,100
- Number four.
- "If You Really Love Me".

294
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,530
("If You Really Love Me")

295
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,680
Question number three.
The first is Beethoven.

296
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,900
That's obvious.

297
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,310
The second is Mozart.

298
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,640
- I got it wrong.
- I should've written it.

299
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
- The third is Handel.
- Okay.

300
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,240
The fourth is Bach.

301
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,350
That's right. It wasn't van Gogh.

302
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,520
If you wrote Bach,
can you get three points?

303
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,560
- That's amazing.
- I remember them.

304
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,060
- You do?
- I learned it when I was young.

305
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,330
I remember it clearly.

306
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,260
In general,

307
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,260
students with bad grades
are the loudest.

308
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,630
(They're just all talk.)

309
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,130
I'm getting so many correct.

310
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,180
Ji Hyo will definitely
be in first grade.

311
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,370
Instead of listening,
she's watching a video.

312
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,140
She's not curious about the answers.

313
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,320
It's because I did well on the test.

314
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,280
I don't need to check my answers.

315
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,190
Here's question number five.

316
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,380
You'll recognize when you hear it.

317
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,560
Number five?

318
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,750
It was right.

319
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,090
It's "What is Love?" by TWICE.

320
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,350
(The three who cheated
got the same wrong answer.)

321
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,020
It was TWICE as I said.

322
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,170
The lyrics seemed like
TWICE's songs.

323
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,360
Please remember...

324
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,130
that it's not helpful to say
what you got wrong.

325
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,070
- Right.
- It's better to act.

326
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,980
I got everything right.

327
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,900
The questions were so easy.

328
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,740
- I've been lucky thus far.
- These are so easy.

329
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,270
Eun Bin, did you do a terrible job?

330
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,380
I did very well.

331
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,010
- Really?
- Yes.

332
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,350
I was the first to submit
the answers.

333
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,510
- Really?
- Yes.

334
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,750
Question number 10.

335
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,880
The answer is number three.

336
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,960
That's right!

337
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,560
If you don't know, it's always
number three. Awesome.

338
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,620
I should be one of the top students.

339
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,620
Gosh, I got one wrong. I'm doomed.

340
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,940
You got one wrong?

341
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,440
You mean you got one right.

342
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,360
- You mean you got one right.
- How can I...

343
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,630
- Kwang Soo.
- get one wrong?

344
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,760
What's wrong, Kwang Soo?

345
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,440
I got one wrong by mistake.

346
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,400
It might as well as be zero points.

347
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,450
(They're doing everything
that they couldn't do in school.)

348
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,320
Here are the results.

349
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,870
Check your own score.

350
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,380
I'll scold you if you're
in a lower grade than me.

351
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,830
- I...
- We graded you fairly.

352
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,650
We won't receive any inquiries
about the test result.

353
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,150
(The scores make them speechless.)

354
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,300
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

355
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,020
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

356
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,100
Everyone.

357
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,570
No way.

358
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,970
Goodness.

359
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,810
(They're assigned to a grade
based on their score.)

360
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,130
Was I this smart?

361
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,500
We have to decide on the team
for the first mission.

362
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,220
- We have four guests.
- Yes.

363
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,180
Three of you will pick
your members...

364
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,640
by playing rock-paper-scissors.

365
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,090
(Results for Team Ji Hyun,
Team Min Jae, and Team Eun Bin)

366
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,220
- Everyone?
- Yes.

367
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,060
This is the first period
at your musical school.

368
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,330
During this period, you can improve
your music skills.

369
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,100
It's called Dreaming
of Being Gifted in Music.

370
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,470
We're dreaming of being gifted.

371
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,170
Each team
will pick a penalty sign...

372
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,260
and sit next to it.

373
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,940
You'll hear four remixed songs
of different periods.

374
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,810
Answer as soon as you recognize it.

375
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,350
When you answer correctly,
you win one point.

376
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,400
Okay.

377
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,240
If you get a finger flick
from Se Chan or Jong Kook,

378
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,050
you'll die.

379
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,720
Is the weapon for hitting
or getting hit?

380
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,850
I'll explain.

381
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,980
At this time...

382
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,280
You embarrassed him.

383
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,020
- You're so cold to an aged man.
- Come on.

384
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,300
We have guests too.

385
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,330
Why did you scold him?

386
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,200
It's all right.

387
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,430
Suk Jin is close to being 60.

388
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,360
It's all right.

389
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,530
I was the one who interrupted
when you were talking.

390
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,670
- Right.
- It's okay.

391
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,980
- Don't think like that.
- It's okay.

392
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,180
- It's all right.
- Come on.

393
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,950
I stopped Bo Pil from talking.

394
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,770
It's okay, Bo Pil.

395
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,240
That's how he acts
when he's furious.

396
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Every time you answer correctly,
you get a point.

397
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,590
Each team has three members.

398
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,060
A member from three teams
will take a seat.

399
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,090
(1 person from 3 teams)

400
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,850
The one who answers correctly...

401
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,100
performs the penalty
on 1 of the 2...

402
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,650
from the other team.

403
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,390
- After answering?
- You do it?

404
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,430
These six are sitting
in the finger flick zone.

405
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,570
These six are in
the toy hammer zone.

406
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,470
You should sit
in the finger flick zone.

407
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,030
- Can we choose?
- Yes.

408
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,840
In terms of pain, who's
on your team is important.

409
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,350
If Jong Kook and I are
on the same team,

410
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,550
everyone will be doomed.

411
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,420
- You can use different flicks.
- Is this possible?

412
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
It's your choice.

413
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,010
This can't be possible.

414
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,780
Please stand up.

415
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,350
Starting with those in blue vest,
pick your seat.

416
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,020
- Okay.
- Each person?

417
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,460
The one who can answer...

418
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,230
Since there are four songs,
I can do it.

419
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,020
Where should I go?

420
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,390
Jong Kook should go
to the finger flick zone.

421
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,030
- I'll sit here.
- Okay.

422
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,340
Only one person from each team
can sit in the zone.

423
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,180
(He sits next to So Min.)

424
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,000
Go away, Jae Suk.

425
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,710
Don't come here.

426
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,180
Come here, Ji Hyo.

427
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,850
Go.

428
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,510
- Is the team with Ji Hyo full?
- Yes.

429
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,550
- We can be at ease.
- Right.

430
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,690
Be at ease.

431
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,220
- Who's sitting here?
- This is...

432
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,280
Sit here.

433
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,060
- You should sit here.
- No.

434
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,730
No, no.

435
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,570
- I don't hit everyone so hard.
- Okay.

436
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,700
Really?

437
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,170
(There's only one seat
where you can avoid Jong Kook.)

438
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,360
(Approaching at the same time)

439
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,400
Where will you sit, Min Jae?

440
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,480
Hold on.

441
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,400
(They get into a fight.)

442
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,350
Se Chan.

443
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,180
(They struggle to avoid Jong Kook.)

444
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,110
- I can't sit there.
- Why would you sit there?

445
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,380
- You sit there.
- Where are you going to sit?

446
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,820
- Send Kwang Soo here.
- No, no.

447
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,380
- Okay.
- No. Where will you sit? Wait.

448
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,590
(Kwang Soo is taken aback.)

449
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,780
- Nice.
- Where will you sit?

450
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,090
- It's perfect.
- Please sit there.

451
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,430
- Is he really going to sit there?
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

452
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,470
- Why should we?
- Come over here already.

453
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,670
Come here, you punk.

454
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,840
Darn it.

455
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,730
I've been sitting next to him
for 10 years in a row.

456
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,130
I sit next to him whenever
the penalty is finger flick.

457
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,270
- I could've been in trouble.
- When it comes to finger flick...

458
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,870
(Left: finger flick,
right: toy hammer)

459
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,270
(They all found their seats.)

460
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,480
We'll play 4 songs at the same time.
You can just get 1 song right.

461
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,450
- Just the song title, right?
- Four songs at the same time?

462
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,380
You have to tell us both the singer
and the song title.

463
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,060
Okay. Let's go.

464
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,010
Here's the first question.

465
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,570
(Try to guess what songs they are.)

466
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,340
(Four different songs are
being played at the same time.)

467
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

468
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,310
(Sung Cheol was faster.)

469
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,340
Sung Cheol, go ahead.

470
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,180
Hwasa's...

471
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,810
- What was it? "Maria".
- Oh, you just...

472
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,600
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

473
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,770
- Hwasa's "Twit".
- Correct.

474
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,820
- Okay.
- Oh, right. "Twit".

475
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,240
(Oh, I'm such a twit.)

476
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,280
You may hit one of them.

477
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,420
Se Chan, come on.

478
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,430
(They forgot the power
the winner has for a moment.)

479
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,730
You got the right answer
because of me.

480
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,020
- What?
- You knew it because of me.

481
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,800
Right. My team member
practically gave you a hint.

482
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,230
I gave you a hint.

483
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,600
- I choose Min Jae.
- Gosh.

484
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,570
(Min Jae will be hit.)

485
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,630
I'll hit Min Jae.

486
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,200
Oh, gosh. I...

487
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,310
- He's really good at it.
- It stings.

488
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,940
You'll be surprised when you wash
your face tomorrow morning.

489
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,540
(The reason why Kwang Soo was
surprised while washing his face...)

490
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,220
(Hitting)

491
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,540
(The painful finger flick
made him miss her mother.)

492
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,650
- It really hurts.
- At least, he has a fringe.

493
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,960
With the fringe down?

494
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
(He spoke casually to him
because he's scared.)

495
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,320
- Part his fringe.
- I'll do that.

496
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,890
- That would be better. Good.
- Like this.

497
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,430
- Yes, that's good.
- He'll be surprised.

498
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,490
Oh, my gosh.

499
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,520
Don't worry.
It will be over quickly.

500
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,060
- Hey, Min Jae.
- It will be over quickly.

501
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,260
- You can get a chance to hit him.
- It'll be over quickly.

502
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,090
It'll sting a little.
Think of it as getting a shot.

503
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,500
- You can get a chance to hit him.
- Stay still. Here we go.

504
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,730
- I can't watch that.
- Me neither.

505
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,610
(A shot of finger flick
was fired.)

506
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,650
My goodness.

507
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,310
(My goodness.)

508
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,920
(It hurts more than
he thought it would.)

509
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,360
All right. Let's continue.

510
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,550
Min Jae, don't forget this.

511
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,520
- Look at him. He's angry.
- Okay.

512
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,780
Let's get fired up.

513
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,520
- Let's continue.
- He's so cute.

514
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,230
(Three songs are left now.)

515
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,560
(Everyone became more focused
after Min Jae got the penalty.)

516
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,370
All I can hear is "Twit".

517
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,270
Let me answer.
"Sorry, Sorry" by Super Junior.

518
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,110
- Wrong.
- Was "Sorry, Sorry" played too?

519
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,070
(The time for finger flick
came again sooner than expected.)

520
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,740
He's so good at this game.

521
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,150
- How did he know that?
- Should I go with the same person?

522
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,460
You should give Sung Cheol
a chance as well.

523
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,750
Give it a try. It's worth it.

524
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,780
You shouldn't make too many enemies.

525
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,200
Should I go with the same person?

526
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,590
- Of course.
- Yes, you should do that.

527
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,090
- Why would you make more enemies?
- Hold on a second.

528
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,430
- Hang on.
- Exactly.

529
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,940
Don't give Min Jae a hard time.

530
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,230
Why are you meddling in this?
Let him choose.

531
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,370
- They're on the same team.
- Let them both try it.

532
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,610
- Exactly.
- Let him get a taste of it.

533
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,680
Let him get a taste of it.

534
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,070
- He should get a taste of it.
- Of course.

535
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,000
You know what it feels like
only when you try it.

536
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,240
It's worth the pain.

537
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,220
Right. He must be so curious.

538
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,650
- Here we go.
- It will sting.

539
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,310
(He got a taste of it.)

540
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,390
- Exactly.
- Gosh.

541
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,080
(Shocked)

542
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,700
(It looks so painful
that everyone is surprised again.)

543
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,990
(Well...)

544
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,930
(Clenching his teeth)

545
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,230
- That won't be good enough.
- Don't get me wrong.

546
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,990
(Oh, is it not good enough?)

547
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,110
Don't be mad. It's just a game.

548
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,140
- Okay.
- Get the right answer to hit him.

549
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,230
- Let's go!
- I want to get the right answer.

550
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,030
They can endure it
because they're actors.

551
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,500
Now, we'll continue playing
the music.

552
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,480
(He looks bloodthirsty.)

553
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,650
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

554
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,980
Is it "I Really Like You"
by Lee Ji Hye?

555
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,050
- Lee Ji Hye?
- Lee Ji Hye's "I Really Like You"?

556
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,320
I'm sorry.

557
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,750
(They're listening
to the songs again.)

558
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,090
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

559
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,700
Jewelry's "I Really Like You".

560
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,290
(Correct)

561
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,260
Eun Bin almost got the right answer.

562
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,730
She almost got the right answer.

563
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,910
I heard Ji Hye's version
of the song.

564
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,970
I'm sorry.

565
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,180
(Sit down, Jae Suk.)

566
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,070
- Jae Suk, cover your mouth.
- Okay.

567
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,570
- Go ahead.
- To prevent it from popping out.

568
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,740
- If you're going to hit him hard...
- Hit me.

569
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,880
- Shouldn't he take off his glasses?
- Hit me.

570
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,040
Go ahead and hit me.

571
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,690
Just wait and see what I'll do next.

572
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,080
- His front teeth will be revealed.
- Go ahead.

573
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,390
- Hit me.
- His front teeth will be revealed.

574
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,580
Hit me.

575
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,690
(His mouth looks like
it's sticking out more.)

576
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,780
(The hit on the back of his head
caused it to stick out more.)

577
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,290
- That wasn't weak at all.
- Exactly.

578
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,470
- That wasn't weak at all.
- Fine. All right.

579
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,200
- This is war.
- That was good.

580
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,330
- Good job.
- Wait until I get the right answer.

581
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,870
- That felt so good.
- Get the right answer.

582
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,900
Only one song is left.

583
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,300
- Darn. I can't hear any songs.
- Right? Isn't it frustrating?

584
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,230
- Isn't it frustrating?
- Play the music.

585
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,730
(The music is played again.)

586
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,840
I can only hear the songs
that we already got right.

587
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,620
(He's on his knees
with determination.)

588
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,620
What was it?

589
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,040
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

590
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,220
"First Love" by Clon.

591
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,860
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

592
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,120
"Holding onto
the End of the Night"...

593
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,390
- by Solid.
- I think it's Clon's song.

594
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,430
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

595
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,430
"My Only Friend" by Solid.

596
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,360
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

597
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,290
Clon's "Kung Ddari Sha Bah Rah".

598
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,760
Okay.

599
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,140
(Their faces turned pale
in an instant.)

600
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,830
Oh, it was "Kung Ddari Sha Bah Rah".

601
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:09,450
(It's time to check the answer.)

602
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,270
(Se Chan is dancing to the song
to celebrate.)

603
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,810
(But the 2 of them can't smile
as 1 of them will get hit.)

604
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,620
(When you feel blue and frustrated)

605
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,430
(Min Jae is feeling blue
and frustrated.)

606
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:23,930
- Which one...
- He should choose one of them.

607
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,670
They're looking at me
with a pitiful look.

608
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,020
Don't worry.

609
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,870
(The thought of the finger flick
makes them tear up.)

610
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,670
- Let them play rock-paper-scissors.
- That's a good idea.

611
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,800
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- I'll get hit.

612
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,440
- That'll be better.
- Okay.

613
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,110
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

614
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,570
- You see...
- Oh, yes.

615
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,150
- Oh, yes.
- I said I'd get hit.

616
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,150
(After the desperate struggle,)

617
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,010
(Sung Cheol's forehead
showed up again.)

618
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,010
His finger flick is blunt.

619
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,740
I'm going to get hit later anyway.

620
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,890
(Hitting hard)

621
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,250
He hit him really hard.

622
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,890
(Exclaiming)

623
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,780
- He hit him even harder.
- He hit him so hard.

624
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,990
That was amazing.

625
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,630
(He had an out-of-body experience.)

626
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,320
- Sung Cheol.
- That was amazing.

627
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,140
Sung Cheol, you're having
a nosebleed.

628
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,760
(Really?)

629
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,230
Sung Cheol.

630
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,970
- He endured it well.
- Right?

631
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,060
We'll move on to the next question.

632
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,230
(So Min and Haha switched
their seats.)

633
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,110
- The beginning part is important.
- Okay.

634
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,000
- So Min, let's do well this time.
- Play the music.

635
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,720
(Try to guess what songs they are.)

636
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,650
(Everyone is listening closely.)

637
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,310
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

638
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,860
"December" by Turbo.

639
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,160
- Okay. Nice.
- Good job.

640
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,130
(As soon as Jong Kook got
the right answer,)

641
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,900
(Kwang Soo's face turned pale
as if his stomach got upset.)

642
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,670
Good job.

643
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,290
Good job, Jong Kook.

644
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,590
- But Eun Bin...
- Is it Turbo's song?

645
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,760
- But Eun Bin...
- Stay still.

646
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,500
- might want to experience it.
- Why would she?

647
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,640
- Stay still.
- That's scary.

648
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,830
- Just let me hit you.
- Eun Bin...

649
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,950
It'll be over quickly.
You saw them earlier.

650
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,680
(The most powerful finger flick)

651
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,450
(She closed her eyes.)

652
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,280
(He's having dry heaves.)

653
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,460
Good job.

654
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,780
I think he got a dent
on his forehead.

655
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,820
(It hurts, right?)

656
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,230
Play the music.

657
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,460
(Three songs are left.)

658
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,030
- Let me answer.
- But it hasn't...

659
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,590
"10 Minutes" by Lee Hyo Lee.

660
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,470
No, that's not one of them.

661
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,530
- Let me answer.
- Yes.

662
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,610
"I'm Your Girl" by S.E.S.

663
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,440
Let me answer.
"More and More" by TWICE.

664
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,950
(Correct)

665
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,040
(Nice!)

666
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,150
- Eun Bin, how did you know?
- I heard the song many times.

667
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,480
Which one will you hit?

668
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,280
I am going to hit Kwang Soo.

669
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,620
Me? I just got hit.

670
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,480
I just got hit. Why me?

671
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,890
It's better to hit the one
who just got hit.

672
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,730
- He's dazed right now anyway.
- Well, I don't mind...

673
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,170
- I can't hit hard.
- It would be better.

674
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,670
Here we go.

675
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,730
(Hitting lightly)

676
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,400
That was cute. That was really cute.

677
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,230
He seems happy. Kwang Soo liked it.

678
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,610
That's not the reason.
I'm sure none of you knows,

679
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,940
but she hit my nose with the palm
instead of flicking her finger.

680
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,210
(She pretended she would
flick her finger,)

681
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,710
(but she hit his nose.)

682
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,270
- With the bone here on the palm.
- I know.

683
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,070
- It's hard.
- You always do that to me.

684
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,980
How hard did she want to hit me?

685
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,780
Eun Bin seems to like cheating.

686
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,250
Two songs are left.

687
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,080
Play the music.

688
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,630
Let me answer.
"Eternal Love" by Fin.K.L.

689
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,290
(Correct)

690
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,330
(Good job.)

691
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,140
(He finally got a chance
to hit somebody else.)

692
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,300
Which one is it?

693
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,980
(Which one will he hit?)

694
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,840
(He chose Eun Bin right away.)

695
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,180
Did you choose her?

696
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,240
- You'll hit her?
- How could he choose her?

697
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,810
Let me explain.

698
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,840
Rather than fighting
against Jong Kook...

699
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,040
Good. Change your direction.

700
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,620
- He has a point.
- I thought I should...

701
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,860
- make a wise decision.
- You're right.

702
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,190
But Kwang Soo, you know
that Jong Kook will attack you...

703
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,960
if he gets a chance, right?

704
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,990
I can't believe him. Suk Jin,
check the color of your vest.

705
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,290
(What is wrong with him?)

706
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,560
- Check the color.
- Oh, I'm on your team.

707
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,410
(Oh, I'm on your team.)

708
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,610
- I forgot that.
- You see,

709
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,800
- we always join the team...
- Exactly.

710
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,070
that's the rival
of Jong Kook's team.

711
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,650
- Check the color of your vest.
- We're on the same team.

712
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,310
- I should check it often.
- Yes.

713
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,450
Can I hit my team member
when I get the right answer?

714
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,190
(No, you can't do that.)

715
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,740
Can we volunteer to get hit
instead of her?

716
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,580
- Yes, you can.
- Sung Cheol.

717
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,550
(Me?)

718
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,780
- Me?
- He's good at reacting.

719
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,020
Continue the momentum.
You were hit already.

720
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,630
You can do it.

721
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,970
- You should do it for her.
- You're a man.

722
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,290
Sung Cheol is contemplating.

723
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,020
- I'll get hit.
- Okay.

724
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,730
I didn't hit you
hard earlier, right?

725
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,730
By the way, Eun Bin,
do you have a shoot tomorrow?

726
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,300
- Yes, I do.
- Eun Bin, do you have a shoot?

727
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,480
I have a shoot tomorrow.

728
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,380
I'll hit her on the head,
not the forehead.

729
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,210
- On the head?
- It won't be visible.

730
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,800
- That's a good idea.
- Here.

731
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,650
- I'll hit on the side of the head.
- On the side?

732
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,270
- I can't hit hard either.
- Right?

733
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,010
- Kwang Soo can't hit hard.
- It's just a game.

734
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,050
Hey, how could you...

735
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,010
(He hit the side of her head.)

736
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,580
(Oh, boy.)

737
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,550
- Goodness.
- Eun Bin.

738
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,200
- Hey.
- Are you a human?

739
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,560
- How could you do that?
- Are you insane?

740
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,670
- No...
- You call yourself a human?

741
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,060
I didn't know how to do it.

742
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,060
Eun Bin. I'm sorry.

743
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,560
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Eun Bin. Are you okay?

744
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,830
- You should check.
- Eun Bin. I'm sorry.

745
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,870
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

746
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,210
How do you call yourself a human?

747
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,940
Can I go home?

748
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,740
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

749
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,680
- It's okay.
- She must be startled.

750
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,720
She has a good reaction.

751
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,740
I think I can answer
the questions better now.

752
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,190
Right. You can do it.

753
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,040
- Let's go.
- Are you okay? You can do it.

754
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,390
Okay.

755
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,660
- Go, Team Green.
- Play the music.

756
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,230
(I'll get it for sure.)

757
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,970
Let me answer.

758
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,490
"Love and Remember" by god.

759
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,330
(Correct)

760
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,030
Really?

761
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,560
- We need to improve.
- How did you know?

762
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,640
We better improve.

763
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,680
I really can't hear anything.

764
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,770
Who?

765
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,180
Wait. Who should I pick?

766
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,740
Make them play rock-paper-scissors.

767
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,840
Right. Play rock-paper-scissors.

768
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,920
Rock-paper-scissors.

769
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,980
- Honestly, I want to hit So Min.
- She won.

770
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,280
Ji Hyo. Did you win?

771
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,750
- Yes, I won.
- Okay.

772
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,660
- But I won.
- You won.

773
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,690
I won.

774
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,290
Jae Suk wanted to hit Ji Hyo
from the beginning.

775
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,820
Maybe he was thinking he will
hit the winner in his head.

776
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,790
Right. I wished you'd lose.
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

777
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,530
I'd already made up my mind.

778
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,230
- Okay.
- Okay, Ji Hyo.

779
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,330
Then now...

780
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,370
Okay.

781
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,000
- That sounded refreshing.
- Right.

782
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,480
(Current Points)

783
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,770
This is the third question.
Play the music.

784
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,390
Let me answer.

785
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,580
(As Min Jae shouts out,)

786
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,960
(Se Chan looks nervous.)

787
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,050
- Min Jae. You should answer it.
- Five,

788
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,690
4, 3...

789
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,320
(His forehead still hurts
from the flick.)

790
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,900
(He finally got a chance
to revenge.)

791
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,090
- Don't be nervous. Answer it.
- Okay. It's Haha's...

792
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,590
"Nino Maximus Keyser Soze".

793
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,730
(Incorrect)

794
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,870
"Nino Maximus Keyser Soze".

795
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,730
(Sneering)

796
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,270
- Let me answer.
- Oh, please.

797
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,680
(Oh, please.)

798
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,540
"Story of a Little Kid" by Haha.

799
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,310
("Story of a Little Kid" by Haha)

800
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,480
(Correct)

801
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,080
(Screaming)

802
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,540
- Hey.
- Oh, please.

803
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,220
- I forgot.
- You didn't know the title.

804
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,050
- Gosh.
- Oh, thank you.

805
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,020
- That was...
- You didn't know the title.

806
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
You didn't know the title.

807
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,460
Why do you keep giving it away?

808
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,490
- I know. Why?
- I...

809
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,260
I forgot the title.

810
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,230
Who are you going to hit?

811
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,560
Why aren't you taking it off?
Take it off.

812
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,170
(He already chose the target
in his mind.)

813
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,480
Here?

814
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,030
Okay. Just hit anywhere. Hurry up!

815
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,150
Hit me already. I need to answer
questions. Hurry up.

816
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,540
Gosh.

817
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,570
(Delayed spike)

818
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,570
(He got a strong one
for acting tough.)

819
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,580
Good shot.

820
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,580
(He got a strong one
for acting tough.)

821
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,920
- I'm so angry.
- You have three songs left.

822
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,310
Play the music.

823
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,660
(Wait. This song is...)

824
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,290
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

825
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,930
"Aing" by Orange Caramel.

826
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,820
- Let me answer.
- Yes.

827
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,790
- Two...
- It's ZE:A's

828
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,560
- "After Effect".
- "After Effect".

829
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
(Correct)

830
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,610
Okay.

831
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,110
- Pardon?
- Why do you look sad?

832
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,140
Why do you look sad?

833
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,480
How about hitting the back
of Kwang Soo's head instead?

834
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,770
- Why...
- Hit Kwang Soo?

835
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,310
Sure. I won't hit his forehead.
The back of your head doesn't hurt.

836
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,680
Me?
The back of my head doesn't hurt?

837
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,390
- It doesn't hurt.
- You want me to hit you with this?

838
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,690
No.

839
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,120
Hey. The top of the head
doesn't hurt.

840
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,810
- Wait.
- It doesn't hurt at all.

841
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,930
I...

842
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,930
(Cracking)

843
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,860
(His head is split in half.)

844
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,560
(Swearing)

845
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,590
(Shocked)

846
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,830
(Screaming)

847
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,730
That was really loud.

848
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,140
That was loud.

849
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,270
(It feels good to hit
the top of the head.)

850
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,950
Hey. The top of the head
doesn't hurt.

851
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,950
Everything looks green.

852
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,070
Don't lie.

853
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,540
- I'm serious. Everything is green.
- I said stop lying.

854
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,120
That was amazing.

855
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,310
I think that was the loudest.

856
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,390
That sounded like
a watermelon though.

857
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,550
That was strong.

858
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,480
You have two songs left.
You can't get up and discuss.

859
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,750
- Let's do this!
- Play the music.

860
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,790
(Music plays again
to find 2 hidden songs.)

861
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,470
(Let me answer.)

862
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,830
Let me answer.

863
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,230
It's Park Hyo Shin's...

864
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,000
(Sung Cheol got flicked twice.)

865
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,270
(He finally got a chance
to revenge.)

866
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,570
Let me answer.

867
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,570
(Will he be able to take his revenge
on Se Chan?)

868
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,380
5, 4...

869
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,480
(It's Park Hyo Shin's...)

870
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,190
- "Memories Resemble Love".
- Let me answer.

871
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,960
(He lost his chance.)

872
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,480
"Snow Flower" by Park Hyo Shin.

873
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,860
(Correct)

874
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,460
"Snow Flower" by Park Hyo Shin. Yes!

875
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,200
(Oh, right. "Snow Flower".)

876
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,590
Come on.

877
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,700
You're out of control.

878
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,290
(My Jong Kook.)

879
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,060
You're out of control.

880
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,470
(Happy ceremony)

881
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,070
(Jong Kook is excited.)

882
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,180
Calm down.

883
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,980
That's scary.

884
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,880
- Hey.
- That was scary.

885
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,120
- Yes!
- Anyway, I'm happy.

886
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,480
- I'm happy.
- That was good.

887
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,650
- Good.
- That was close.

888
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,920
- Was it correct?
- Good.

889
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,280
Was it correct?

890
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,580
(His legs feel weak. He staggers.)

891
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,430
That was insane, Jong Kook.

892
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,870
Look at Kwang Soo.
He doesn't want to get hit.

893
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,200
He's sitting politely
to avoid the hit.

894
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,940
The back of the head wouldn't hurt.

895
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,610
I already hit the forehead
and the top of the head.

896
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,640
Hit me in the back.

897
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,030
- Here?
- That's...

898
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,270
- How about here?
- Honestly,

899
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,270
I can't hear well since the last
hit. I can't answer the questions.

900
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,210
Then you tell me.

901
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,040
- In the back.
- I'll stroke. You tell me.

902
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,840
I'll stroke. Tell me to stop.

903
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,650
- Stop.
- Here?

904
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,780
Okay. Is this okay?

905
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,810
We'll get to see Kwang Soo bowing.

906
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,460
- Thank you.
- Wait.

907
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,090
Kwang Soo. It's all right.
This doesn't hurt at all.

908
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,400
Did you hit in the back of the head?

909
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,560
Happy New Year.

910
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,290
(Happy New Year.)

911
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,870
Give them a bow.

912
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,440
Good.

913
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,570
It's okay, isn't it?
It doesn't hurt in the back.

914
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,650
(It's already been 8 months,
but still, Happy New Year.)

915
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,880
- Good job.
- It doesn't hurt, does it?

916
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,300
Okay. Okay.

917
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,310
(It's a lie that the back of
the head doesn't feel pain.)

918
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,340
It's the last question.
Play the music.

919
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,550
(They can only hear the songs
they answered already.)

920
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Let me answer.

921
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,400
- <i>All I can think of is her</i>
- No.

922
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,470
Let me answer.

923
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,760
Let me answer.

924
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,030
(Jae Suk from Jong Kook's team
gives it a try.)

925
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,140
It's Hong Kyung Min's...

926
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,640
- 5, 4...
- It's...

927
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,030
"Broken Love".

928
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,180
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

929
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,270
(Let me answer!)

930
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,270
Let me answer.

931
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,910
- It was Sung Cheol.
- Let me answer.

932
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,120
Sung Cheol was fast.

933
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,570
"Broken Friendship"
by Hong Kyung Min.

934
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,310
Okay. Let's do this.

935
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,120
- Let's do this.
- Why couldn't I remember it?

936
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,860
- Why didn't you remember?
- My flicks aren't strong.

937
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,280
I feel sorry for Kyung Min.

938
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,480
Sung Cheol. Make it good.

939
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,490
I can't do it.

940
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,200
- You have to do it.
- Hit this for practice.

941
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,400
Practice on this.

942
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,760
(It's pretty strong.)

943
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,670
- That was pretty strong.
- Right. That's what you do.

944
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,900
That's what you should do.

945
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,910
He's strong.

946
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,210
I've never done it before.

947
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,230
Right here...

948
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,180
You should practice on this.

949
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,980
That's right. That was good.
You got it.

950
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,010
(He can't help but smile
at the thought of flicking Se Chan.)

951
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,380
Okay. Remember this.

952
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,840
- If you...
- No. I don't know anything.

953
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,050
- I'm going to be a gangster now.
- Okay. Sure.

954
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,750
- He's going to be a gangster.
- I sure will.

955
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,820
- I need a support.
- Put your hand. That's right.

956
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,320
Put your hand on the protruding...

957
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,200
(Hitting)

958
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,290
(Eyes opening wide)

959
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,590
(Unimaginable power)

960
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,590
You did it.

961
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,170
He has the talent.

962
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,300
- You have the talent.
- Good job.

963
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,180
(He found an unexpected talent.)

964
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,830
(That's how it feels.)

965
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,740
You have the talent for it.

966
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,770
- Good job.
- Well done.

967
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,070
- Was that good?
- Yes.

968
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,380
- That was really strong.
- Okay.

969
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,390
No. Now I have a reason
to become a gangster.

970
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,980
Good. Okay. Let's do this.

971
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,190
All gangsters have a reason.
They didn't just become a gangster.

972
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,460
That hurts.

973
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,580
It's the last question. Play...

974
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,960
(Team Green answered "SOLO"
and "Because You're My Woman".)

975
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,990
the music.

976
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,290
(They look for the third song.)

977
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,170
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

978
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,490
Gosh.

979
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,990
"Bingo" by Turtles.

980
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,560
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

981
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,880
- No.
- Let me answer.

982
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,480
You should play rock-paper-scissors.

983
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,040
Let's do it. Let's go.
Rock-paper-scissors.

984
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
(If Team Green answers
this question, they win.)

985
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,380
Now, now. Rock-paper-scissors.

986
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,540
Okay.

987
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,190
- Nice job, Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo.

988
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,690
So Min.

989
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,580
Kwang Soo. We need to take revenge.

990
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,480
This is the last one.
If we win, it's over.

991
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,660
(Two proud geniuses)

992
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,930
(The result of the first game
depends on the rock-paper-scissors.)

993
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,820
Rock-paper-scissors. Okay!

994
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,460
"Airplane" by Turtles.

995
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,130
Okay!

996
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,400
(Correct)

997
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,240
(That was close.)

998
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,260
That was good.

999
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,400
That was close.

1000
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,380
Now, Team Green won.

1001
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,010
Why... I don't get to hit someone?

1002
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,980
Go ahead.

1003
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,170
(Hitting means more to Kwang Soo
than his team winning.)

1004
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,490
- Wait.
- He didn't hit me right.

1005
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,380
(He ruined it
from straining too much.)

1006
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,880
- It's over.
- No.

1007
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,820
- You hit me. It's over.
- It doesn't count.

1008
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,230
- It doesn't count.
- It's over.

1009
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,590
- No.
- You flicked already. It's over.

1010
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,730
- No, it doesn't count.
- It's over.

1011
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,800
- No, it doesn't count.
- It's over.

1012
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,760
(He finally hit Jong Kook right.)

1013
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,760
I'm sorry.

1014
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,670
(He's acting cute
with all his body.)

1015
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,380
He just hit me.

1016
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,030
I'm sorry.

1017
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,670
Okay, okay.

1018
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,980
He's generous.

1019
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,980
(The first mission ends
with Jong Kook's tolerance.)

1020
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,840
I'll announce the result
of the first mission.

1021
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,490
- Ji Hyun's Team Green placed first.
- That was close.

1022
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,210
- I'll tell you the benefit.
- You tried hard.

1023
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,090
It's the first Promotion Time
where you can guess...

1024
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,990
each other's grade
and earn the Promotion Badge.

1025
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,650
You can ask one person
from each team their grade...

1026
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,490
in front of everyone.

1027
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,190
(They can ask 1 person's grade
from Team Blue and Orange.)

1028
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,690
After guessing the grade,

1029
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,170
we'll pick 1 person randomly
among you 4.

1030
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,440
That person will place
three people in each group.

1031
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,800
Then the person
with the highest grade...

1032
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,380
will receive the Promotion Badge.

1033
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:41,190
So, if Sung Cheol's the highest,
he receives one badge.

1034
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,340
(The person in the highest grade
will get the Promotion Badge.)

1035
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,440
They'll be able to place them.

1036
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,860
So based on the results, we have
to guess one another's grades.

1037
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,260
But what's important here is...

1038
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,260
If there are two people
who are in the same grade,

1039
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,090
they will be eliminated, and
the next highest grade will get it.

1040
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,150
Really?

1041
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,260
- Either you win or get eliminated.
- Overlapping is the worst.

1042
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,670
- Really?
- First,

1043
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,840
Team Green must decide
which person they want to ask...

1044
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,690
from each team.

1045
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,960
- Should we gather up in our teams?
- Yes.

1046
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
We can ask two people.

1047
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,010
Yes, we can ask two people.

1048
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,010
Should we ask
who's in the lowest grade...

1049
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,110
- or who's in the highest grade?
- The lowest grade.

1050
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,300
- The lowest?
- That way,

1051
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,650
when we place each person,

1052
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,380
we can write them down.

1053
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,240
We have to ask about
Jong Kook or Jae Suk...

1054
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,150
because at the end
during the race...

1055
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,190
- we can calculate our moves.
- It will help us.

1056
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,420
Should we ask about Jong Kook first?

1057
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,860
We've decided. We want to know
about Haha from Team Blue...

1058
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,490
and...

1059
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,050
- Jong Kook from Team Orange.
- Jong Kook from Team Orange.

1060
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,530
Haha...

1061
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,360
- is in second grade.
- Goodness.

1062
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,570
(This child who cried out
when he got one wrong...)

1063
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,900
(barely got 25 points
and was placed in 2nd grade.)

1064
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,010
Haha...

1065
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,510
- is in second grade.
- Goodness.

1066
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,170
Kim Jong Kook is also
in second grade.

1067
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,840
(Jong Kook is also in 2nd grade.)

1068
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,210
- Goodness.
- Now,

1069
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,780
the four of you must come
to a consensus,

1070
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,710
and the person that is chosen
will go inside the booth.

1071
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,690
We don't know
who will go inside the booth, right?

1072
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,240
Right. We'll choose that person
in three minutes

1073
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,650
Then what grade are you in?

1074
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,510
Are we not allowed to tell?

1075
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,590
We need to know that...

1076
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,860
- We need to know. Let's reveal it.
- to place them together.

1077
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,090
I'm in fourth grade.

1078
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,900
- It's true.
- I'm sorry, but...

1079
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,860
If you're in fourth grade,
it's over because I...

1080
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,340
I'll be honest, I'm in third grade.

1081
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,670
- I'm in third grade.
- I will...

1082
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,260
bet everything I have on the fact
that you're in first grade.

1083
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,800
No. That's not true.

1084
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,010
- He's a kid.
- I...

1085
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,070
(He's a young kid.)

1086
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,650
I'll choose the person now.

1087
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,980
(They will start the random draw
to choose the representative.)

1088
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,070
The person
who will place everyone...

1089
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,010
- is Song Ji Hyo.
- Oh, my gosh.

1090
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,210
- Did you understand the rules?
- Song Ji Hyo will...

1091
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,460
- Ji Hyo...
- To be exact,

1092
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,710
do you know what she said earlier?

1093
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,150
I told her we needed to place them,

1094
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
and she asked me what a badge was.

1095
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,690
It's "place", not "badge".

1096
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,190
You should go.

1097
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,400
You can go in now.

1098
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,190
You can't explain it to her.

1099
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,900
- She needs to go right in.
- I have high hopes.

1100
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,030
- Yes, me too.
- Ji Hyo...

1101
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,690
I have high expectations.

1102
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,940
I hope Ji Hyo makes a complete mess
of things.

1103
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,740
- I am expectant.
- You know what we mean, right?

1104
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,710
- I understand.
- We'll show you the placement,

1105
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,710
and then we will announce who won.

1106
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,300
You can make your guesses with that.

1107
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,820
So you have to go in there
no matter what.

1108
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,780
You can betray your team
from in there.

1109
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,110
Ji Hyo will place them so that
she benefits from it.

1110
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,550
(Ji Hyo contemplates for a long time
with a vacant look on her face.)

1111
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,300
(She places herself
in the fourth box.)

1112
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,570
(She places Haha and Jong Jook
who overlap in 2nd grade with her.)

1113
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,840
(Surprisingly, she understood
the rules well.)

1114
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,090
(If she's not in 2nd grade,
she gets the badge.)

1115
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,170
You know what you're doing, right?

1116
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,260
(Ji Hyo understands the rules
very well today.)

1117
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,480
I expect something nice, Ji Hyo.

1118
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,130
- I'll show you the placement.
- Okay.

1119
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,010
This is how Ji Hyo placed everyone.

1120
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,550
Okay.

1121
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,550
- Ji Hyo...
- Okay.

1122
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,590
- In the first room...
- understood the rules.

1123
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,940
- The person to get the badge...
- This is hard.

1124
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,320
in the first room is...

1125
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,710
Park Ji Hyun.

1126
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,460
Ji Hyun is in a higher grade.

1127
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,760
In the second room,
it's Kim Sung Cheol.

1128
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,820
(Promotion)

1129
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,090
In the third room, it's Jeon So Min.

1130
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,960
(Promotion)

1131
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,760
In the fourth room,
it's Song Ji Hyo.

1132
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,170
(Promotion)

1133
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,440
- Hold on.
- We were fooled.

1134
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,010
(Ji Hyun, Sung Cheol, So Min,
and Ji Hyo get promoted.)

1135
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,650
- They are in a higher grade?
- Hold on.

1136
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,740
We don't know if they're
in a higher grade.

1137
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,420
There could've been eliminations
because they overlapped.

1138
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,420
That's possible too.

1139
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,010
- Hold on. Wait a minute.
- Ji Hyun is in a high grade.

1140
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,380
You will use the badges
during the race.

1141
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,150
It doesn't change your grade
right now.

1142
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,860
Please put it on.

1143
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,650
I guess So Min got a lot right.

1144
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,860
I can't believe this happened.

1145
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,360
I got bad grades
when I was a student.

1146
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,960
- We'll move on to the next mission.
- Okay.

1147
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,130
I think our guests definitely got
better scores than us.

1148
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,300
Did you guys cook here?

1149
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,300
They must've cooked.

1150
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,630
- What is this?
- Soy sauce marinated crabs.

1151
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,840
- It looks delicious.
- Soy sauce marinated crabs.

1152
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,650
- This looks amazing.
- It's acorn jelly.

1153
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,150
- I love acorn jelly.
- Are you letting us just eat it?

1154
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,570
- This looks delicious.
- Can we just eat it?

1155
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,240
Why? What did we do to deserve it?
Do you just like us?

1156
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,510
Are you just giving it to us?

1157
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,260
- They must be taking dishes away.
- Before the final race,

1158
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,860
this is the final mission.
We're in second period.

1159
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,030
We're going to test your sense of
beat and rhythm for a chance to eat.

1160
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,420
We're going to play
Break Up Strawberries.

1161
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,800
- Break Up Strawberries?
- Break Up Strawberries?

1162
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,090
What are we breaking up this time?

1163
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,490
Using the word "Strawberry",

1164
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,030
you're going to break it up
according to the beat.

1165
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,110
<i>- St-raw-ber-ry</i>
- For one, it's...

1166
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,010
<i>- St-raw-ber-ry
- St-raw-ber-ry</i>

1167
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,510
- For two, it's...
<i>- Straw-berry-straw-berry</i>

1168
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,880
- For three, it's...
<i>- Straw-berry-strawberry-strawberry</i>

1169
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,880
For four,

1170
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,480
it's "Strawberry-strawberry
strawberry-strawberry".

1171
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,610
<i>- St-raw-ber-ry
- St-raw-ber-ry</i>

1172
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,510
<i>- Strawberry-strawberry
- Strawberry-strawberry</i>

1173
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,090
(Song Ji Hyo, a student at the music
school, lacks a sense of rhythm)

1174
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,860
<i>St-raw-ber-ry</i>

1175
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,530
(Guys...)

1176
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,320
Show me.

1177
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,360
(Ji Hyo's hopeless.)

1178
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,690
- St-raw... Strawberry.
- Someone who's good should show us.

1179
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,230
<i>- Straw-berry-strawberry-strawberry</i>
- Everyone.

1180
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,400
Every time you get one wrong,

1181
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,670
you must give up one dish.

1182
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,130
- What?
- You must return it when you lose.

1183
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,010
Gosh, Jae Suk is bad at this.

1184
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,670
<i>Straw-berry-strawberry-strawberry</i>

1185
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,440
- We'll start with Suk Jin.
- I'll start.

1186
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,780
- Let's go! Let's do this!
- We'll start with Suk Jin.

1187
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,380
- Let's cheer before we start.
- Do three no matter what.

1188
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,740
Let's cheer before we start. One...

1189
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,440
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

1190
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,510
Let's go!

1191
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,610
We should go after Ji Hyo.

1192
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,530
Okay. I understand.

1193
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,990
Right? That member is bad, right?

1194
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,360
- Suk Jin too.
- Get ready.

1195
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,400
- Suk Jin.
- We're starting.

1196
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,920
- Jae Suk.
- Let's go!

1197
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,690
- Ready, set, go.
- Let's cheer before we start.

1198
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,460
Let's cheer before we start.

1199
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,090
(Team Green is giving Ji Hyo
a last-minute lesson.)

1200
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,490
<i>- Straw-berry-straw-berry
- Straw-berry-straw-berry</i>

1201
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,260
- <i>Straw-berry-strawberry-strawberry</i>
- Strawberry-strawberry, It's three.

1202
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,800

1368
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,170
(Trembling)

1369
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,150
Let go of him.
Get a grip on yourself!

1370
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,510
(The split wakes him up good.)

1371
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:12,940
Get a grip on yourself.

1372
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,340
- Why...
- He must've dreaded his turn.

1373
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,590
- Unbelievable.
<i>- Straw-berry-strawberry-strawberry</i>

1374
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,610
- I got it now.
- Exactly.

1375
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,690
- Don't tense up.
- I won't.

1376
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,230
Always think that it's your turn.

1377
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:25,260
I was like this in my rookie days.

1378
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,730
- You know what I mean, right?
- Let's practice.

1379
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,090
Jae Suk, three.

1380
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,590
<i>Straw-berry-strawberry-strawberry</i>

1381
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,630
(His gesture is wrong too.)

1382
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,360
- Jae Suk, three.
<i>- Straw-berry-strawberry-strawberry</i>

1383
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,460
(He failed to tap his thighs.)

1384
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,860
- Right?
- Tap your thighs first.

1385
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,260
- Tap here.
- Hold on.

1386
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,240
Tap... Hold on.

1387
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,170
Tap here.

1388
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,340
(His thighs get smashed.)

1389
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,980
Tap your thighs first.

1390
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,670
Got it?

1391
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,840
(The terrorizing Jong Kook
gives a lesson he'll never forget.)

1392
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,490
- Tap your thighs first.
- Got it.

1393
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,190
- I will.
- Tap your thighs first.

1394
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,880
- I got it.
- Unbelievable.

1395
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,960
Okay, I won't forget that.

1396
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,360
That'll help you
stay within the beat.

1397
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,730
Let's practice once more.

1398
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,800
- Jae Suk, four.
<i>- Straw-berry-strawberry-strawberry</i>

1399
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,630
(He chanted the 3-beat
instead of the 4-beat.)

1400
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,340
You need to say "strawberry"
four times.

1401
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,690
- Okay, got it.
- What's with your fingers though?

1402
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,760
- What's this?
- Don't you dare chime in.

1403
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,630
- What are you trying to say?
- Don't you dare speak.

1404
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,130
Is it a white flag or a blue flag?

1405
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,150
- Like and dislike.
- What?

1406
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:17,610
Like and dislike.

1407
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,420
Unbelievable.

1408
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,740
- Let's give up the lettuce.
- Sure thing. It's useless.

1409
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,280
What about the dried laver?
Okay, that could go next.

1410
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,820
The doenjang stew is cold now, so...

1411
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,190
- I'm sorry, but...
- Sounds good.

1412
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,760
Did you taste the food?

1413
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,360
- Who ate the food?
- What on earth?

1414
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,130
- What...
- You actually ate it?

1415
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,690
- Eun Bin, really?
- What do you think you're doing?

1416
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,360
Here.

1417
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,070
(She takes a bite.)

1418
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,240
Is it good?

1419
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,740
Is it good?

1420
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,510
(She takes a bite.)

1421
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:46,130
I don't get it though because
no one knows that we ate it.

1422
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,840
(She shares how she cheats
as if it's a clever skill.)

1423
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,510
I'm sorry,
but did you taste the food?

1424
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,440
- Who ate the food?
- What on earth?

1425
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,940
- What...
- You actually ate it?

1426
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,610
- Eun Bin, really?
- What do you think you're doing?

1427
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:57,780
You should give one up.

1428
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,380
I get why So Min did it, but
I didn't expect this from Eun Bin.

1429
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,280
- What?
- You corrupted her.

1430
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,260
I'm regretting liking you
in "Hot Stove League".

1431
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,320
Let's go again.

1432
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,670
- All right.
- Let's do this.

1433
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:09,860
Ready, set, go.

1434

1435
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,460

00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,860

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,290
- Se Chan, three.
- <i>Strawberry-strawberry</i>... Gosh.

1439
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:25,790
Nice!

1440
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:26,860
<i>Strawberry-strawberry</i>... Gosh.

1441
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,460
(Jae Suk manages to score
for the first time.)

1442
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,560
All right!

1443
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,090
- See?
- Nicely done.

1444
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,860
- You can do it, you know.
- What did I tell you?

1445
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,230
He's actually gotten better.

1446
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:37,270
- I had no idea he'd manage this.
- He's actually gotten better.

1447
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,440
- Sometimes, a beating is required.
- That was nice.

1448
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,810
I have a feeling
that Jae Suk will be able...

1449
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:43,900
to return my attack.

1450
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,670
- You...
- You can be sharper.

1451
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,750
Think more about
how you'll manage his attack.

1452
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,420
I can't believe
it's Ji Hyo saying this.

1453
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,110
She's not bad at this, that's why.

1454
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,420
Se Chan can take it once,
but not twice.

1455
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,790
- Not twice.
- Yes, I can see that.

1456
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:56,960
Please give up a dish.

1457
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,060
- Let's give this up.
- Jae Suk's back in the game.

1458
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,400
I know.

1459
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,500
- I can do this game perfectly now.
- As irony would have it...

1460
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,190
The chemistry...

1461
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,590
(Se Chan's on the offensive next.)

1462
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,400
- Attack Jae Suk again.

00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,770

00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:36,920
- What was that?
- I mean...

1506
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,630
Didn't it remind you
of this catchphrase?

- Yes.

1522
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,610
You can ask one from each team.

Right, Jae Suk.

We'll ask Eun Bin from Team Blue...

1527
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,290
and Jae Suk from Team Orange.

1528
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,730
(They'll check the grades
of Jae Suk and Eun Bin.)

1529
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,340
This will probably reveal
the answer. Let's write it down.

1530
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,360
Eun Bin is...

1531
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,630
- in fourth grade.
- Okay.

00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,310

00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,110
(Eun Bin received a high score
which put her in 4th grade.)

1535
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,170
(Eun Bin's in 4th grade?)

1536
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,690
(Ji Hyun was promoted because
Suk Jin is also in 4th grade.)

1537
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,380
- Then Suk Jin is in fourth grade.
- Right.

1538
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,560
(Running Man Music Test)

1539
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,130
(Suk Jin's in 4th grade
with 37.5 points.)

1540
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,250
And Jae Suk...

1541
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,520
(Jae Suk...)

1542
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,360
- He's in first grade.
- What?

1543
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,060
- That kid!
- Hold on.

1544
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,270
- Really?
- Are you kidding me?

1545
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:54,440
You're in first grade?

1546
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,630
I'll probably be top of the class.

1547
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,500
(Jae Suk bragged
about getting a high score.)

1548
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,900
(But in reality, he only scored 15.)

1549
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,210
- Seriously?
- You were bluffing!

1550
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,610
You got most of
the questions wrong.

1551
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,310
You told me that
you had a high score.

1552
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:08,340
First grade?

1553
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,150
- You said you scored higher.
- Oh, dear.

1554
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:11,210
First grade?

1555
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,710
- He...
- Consider yourself dead.

1556
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,090
First grade?

1557
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,630
Our grades have
mostly been revealed.

1558
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:18,650
(1st grade, 4th grade, 2nd grade)

1559
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,630
- And Eun Bin's in 4th grade.
- Mine's been revealed too.

1560
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,290
Gosh, that's awesome.

1561
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:23,360
(Eun Bin received the top score
with 57.5 points.)

1562
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,790
This time,
Kwang Soo will decide the groups.

1563
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:27,060
- Okay!
- Kwang Soo...

1564
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,360
He only thinks of himself, you know.

1565
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,270
(It's the last opportunity
for a promotion.)

1566
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,400
(How will Kwang Soo
sort out the groups?)

1567
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,250
What matters the most
is my promotion.

1568
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:40,170
How the others do
is none of my business.

1569
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,110
In order to figure out
their grades though...

1570
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,790
(He places himself
with Jae Suk and Haha.)

1571
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,250
- Kwang Soo?
- Yes, I'm done.

1572
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:53,090
Just like last time,
the ones at the top...

1573
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,860
will receive the Promotion Badge.

1574
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,770
- Hold on.
- What happened?

1575
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,060
No way.

1576
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,420
Kwang Soo got promoted?

1577
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,960
- Out of those three...
- Kwang Soo?

1578
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,290
He's in third grade then.

1579
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,310
- He's in 3rd grade then.
- Yes, 3rd grade.

1580
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:05,860
- Kwang Soo's in third grade then.
- You're right.

1581
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,480
- He's in third grade then.
- We figured it out.

1582
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,270
We figured out his grade.

1583
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,840
Kwang Soo's in third grade.

1584
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,080
(1st grade, 2nd grade, 3rd grade)

1585
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,610
(Promoted)

1586
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,790
Then So Min's in 4th grade.

1587
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,110
- I'm sure of it.
- Kwang Soo's in third grade.

1588
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,210
(2nd grade)

1589
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:24,790
(Promoted)

1590
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:28,000
Kwang Soo, Ji Hyun,
Eun Bin, Sung Cheol,

1591
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,690
- you all get a badge.
- Got it.

1592
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,170
Can we eat now?

1593
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,460
We'll get together after we eat.

1594
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,270
Thank you for the meal.

1595
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,440
I can't believe
my grade was revealed.

1596
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,360
- It's now time for the final race.
- Right.

1597
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,440
This is The Sole Winner,

1598
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,400
the chance to be the sole winner
at Brahms Music School.

1599
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,400
(The Sole Winner)

1600
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,710
The Name Tag Elimination
will take place for 30 minutes.

1601
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,610
Out of those who survive,

1602
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,480
the one with the highest grade
will win.

1603
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,060
(The one person
with the highest grade will win.)

1604
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,630
(Two or more with the same grade
will not be eligible to win.)

1605
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:58,980
You're eliminated for good...

1606
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,400
when your name tag gets ripped off
as a first grader.

1607
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,900
- If I lose it as a 3rd grader...
- You'll become a 2nd grader.

1608
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,860
- That means Jae Suk...
- Then we have an extra life.

1609
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,230
- I mean...
- Then if Jae Suk...

1610
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,500
- loses his name tag...
- How can first graders survive?

1611
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:09,960
Jae Suk is mine.

1612
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,000
(Jae Suk is mine.)

1613
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,810
You can only take off the name tag
of a person...

1614
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:15,170
in the same grade as you
or in a lower grade.

1615
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,540
The person who took off a name tag
gets to be promoted,

1616
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,110
and the person who lost a name tag
gets demoted to a lower grade.

1617
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,520
But if you remove the name tag of
someone in a higher grade than you,

1618
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,150
you get demoted to a lower grade.

1619
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,690
Oh, we get demoted?

1620
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,190
However, you can form an alliance
with others.

1621
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:32,520
If you hold hands together,
your grades will be tallied.

1622
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,690
You can eliminate others
in the same or lower grades.

1623
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,690
What's important is that only
the person who removed a name tag...

1624
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:39,690
can move up to a higher grade.

1625
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,670
Likewise, if you ally with someone
else and remove the name tag...

1626
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:45,230
of a person in a higher grade,
only you will be demoted.

1627
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,230
Even if you formed an alliance.

1628
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,540
Then some of us will probably
attack others as a group,

1629
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,670
and then attack their allies too.

1630
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,500
- That's possible.
- Can I...

1631
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,170
drag my partner around?

1632
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,170
(Can I drag my partner around?)

1633
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:55,540
Can I drag him around
in a lying position?

1634
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,750
Yes, you can.

1635
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,020
- There won't be a problem, right?
- If I drag him around...

1636
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,480
What does the Promotion Badge do?

1637
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,380
You will move up to higher grade
according to the number...

1638
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,330
of the badges you have
before we begin the race.

1639
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,960
- I see.
- Ji Hyun has two.

1640
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,230
(Ji Hyun moves up from 3rd
to 5th grade as she has 2 badges.)

1641
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:13,630
Also, there are Up and Down Rooms
here and there, which open randomly.

1642
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:16,340
Only the first one to find it
can use it.

1643
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,940
- Oh, I see.
- They will open randomly.

1644
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,980
Right. Those are our last hope.

1645
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,500
Do you think we can enter
any of the Up and Down Rooms?

1646
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,340
- You think we have enough time?
- I know.

1647
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,920
- No one will pair up with Jae Suk.
- This is frustrating.

1648
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,980
- He must be lonely.
- You'll be alone.

1649
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,380
- It'll be a lonely fight.
- This is driving me insane.

1650
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,420
Please move to your starting place.

1651
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,650
Jae Suk is mine, everyone.

1652
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,920
(The result of the music test
will be revealed.)

1653
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,400
The result came out.
We'll reveal the result to you.

1654
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,060
Don't share it with others.

1655
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,290
(Suk Jin in 4th grade, Eun Bin
in 5th grade, So Min in 5th grade)

1656
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,840
We graded you fairly.

1657
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,170
We won't receive any inquiries
about the test result.

1658
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,080
That's great.

1659
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,040
- My gosh. Today is my lucky day.
- Oh, gosh.

1660
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,810
- I can't believe this.
- Nice.

1661
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,500
(1st: Jae Suk, Min Jae, 2nd:
Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, Haha, Se Chan)

1662
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,580
(4th: Kwang Soo, Suk Jin)

1663
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,670
(5th: Ji Hyun, Sung Cheol,
Eun Bin, So Min)

1664
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,790
You're in second grade now, right?

1665
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,610
I'm in third grade, you brat.

1666
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,790
- You moved up?
- Of course.

1667
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,520
(They're lying to each other
from the beginning.)

1668
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:13,900
Did you say you're in 4th grade?
You're in 3rd grade now.

1669
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,630
- I'm in 5th grade.
- Oh, I see.

1670
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,920
- I'm not asking for a high-five.
- You're in 3rd grade now.

1671
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,790
(She gave him a high-five
as he revealed his grade.)

1672
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,060
What can we do when we can't
even communicate with each other?

1673
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,540
Why did you hit my hand?

1674
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,130
Hey, then were you
a fourth grader?

1675
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,540
Yes, I was. How many times
should I tell you?

1676
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,540
(Brazen)

1677
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,440
That can't be right
as far as I know.

1678
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:32,840
You'll see.

1679
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,690
I wrote down what I found out.

1680
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:40,150
I'm in 5th grade.
So Min is in 5th grade.

1681
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:44,330
I can stay in the race
until I lose my name tag five times.

1682
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,920
(Jeon So Min, fifth grade)

1683
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,330
Sung Cheol is in 5th grade.
Ji Hyun is in 5th grade.

1684
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,170
I'm going to attack...

1685
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:53,130
(Kim Sung Cheol, fifth grade)

1686
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:54,670
whomever I run into.

1687
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,500
I'm a fifth grader.

1688
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,340
(She looks relaxed.)

1689
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:02,710
Suk Jin is in fourth grade.

1690
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,400
Kwang Soo is in fourth grade.

1691
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,940
I'm planning to let Jae Suk
tag along with me as my assistant.

1692
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,340
Petty Gang is back.
He'll be my right-hand man.

1693
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,110
- You'll ally with him?
- Yes, I'll ally with him.

1694
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,250
From the moment she gave me
a high-five,

1695
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:18,560
I only thought of sending her
to jail so she can rest.

1696
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,860
You're unusually confident today.

1697
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,130
It's because...

1698
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:23,230
(Lee Kwang Soo, fourth grade)

1699
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,400
As I told you earlier,
I studied music as a little boy.

1700
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,040
I learned to play the piano
and other types of...

1701
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,770
musical instrument
including the violin.

1702
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,170
Jong Kook is in second grade.

1703
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,480
Rather than forming an alliance,

1704
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,440
I should eliminate them...

1705
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,270
and use their power to...

1706
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,920
Se Chan is in second grade.

1707
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,040
And don't ally with So Min.

1708
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,210
- She'll definitely betray you.
- I understand.

1709
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,650
So Min and Kwang Soo
are dangerous.

1710
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,250
Ji Hyo is in second grade.

1711
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,790
You know that the Up and Down Rooms
will open later, right?

1712
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,920
I know the rules.
Up and Down Rooms?

1713
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,250
I missed that part.

1714
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,500
You can worry about it
when you enter it.

1715
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,130
Haha is in second grade.

1716
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,290
It will be pointless
to ally with lower graders.

1717
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,400
That's what only Petty Gang
would do.

1718
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,810
The only way I can survive is...

1719
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:10,170
to ally with a person
in a higher grade.

1720
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,000
Because I'm in first grade,
I have no confidence.

1721
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,090
But I will show you how I go up
from the last to the first place.

1722
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:18,610
Now, the race will begin.

1723
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:19,920
I really hope
I can make that happen.

1724
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,090
"The race starts."

1725
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:24,830
The race starts.

1726
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:25,880
Oh, gosh.

1727
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,420
(Jae Suk starts looking for
someone to ally with.)

1728
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:32,920
(He found Eun Bin,
the fifth grader.)

1729
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,730
- Eun Bin.
- Shall I come to you?

1730
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:39,310
- Eun Bin.
- You're in first grade, right?

1731
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,310
- Eun Bin, I think...
- Oh, no.

1732
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:43,980
(At that moment,
Kwang Soo showed up!)

1733
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,770
(If those small fish join forces,
things will get complicated.)

1734
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,440
(Kwang Soo said he would
hunt for small fish.)

1735
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:54,650
(He started running
when he saw Jae Suk.)

1736
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,380
(The small fish hunting has begun!)

1737
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:04,230
(Jae Suk will be out
if he loses his name tag.)

1738
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,230
Hey. Wait.

1739
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:07,730
Wait. Hold on.

1740
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:10,540
(Jae Suk allied with
Se Chan and So Min.)

1741
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,630
- Hey.
- What's going on?

1742
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:12,770
Se Chan.

1743
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:15,130
- Kwang Soo, take off his name tag.
- Kwang Soo, hold him.

1744
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,540
(Kwang Soo makes
a strategic retreat.)

1745
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,710
So Min, let's go and help Jae Suk.

1746
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:19,840
Hurry up.

1747
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,310
(They start chasing Kwang Soo
right away.)

1748
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,210
Go back. Too many are
coming down here.

1749
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:26,310
- Too many are coming down.
- Let's go.

1750
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:27,420
(Urgent)

1751
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,650
- Come join us.
- Let's form an alliance.

1752
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,630
- The three of us?
- We'll be invincible.

1753
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,690
- Really?
- We'll be...

1754
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:34,060
- in 15th grade.
- Now, we're in 15th grade.

1755
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,630
- Let's say it. We're in 15th grade.
- We're in 15th grade.

1756
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,290
- Okay.
- Let's go downstairs.

1757
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,330
Let's get them all.

1758
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:40,670
(The 15th graders
got into action right away!)

1759
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,060
Take off his name tag. Come on.

1760
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,500
- I'm holding your hand.
- Take that off.

1761
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,060
- Wait. Let me think.
- Take it off.

1762
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,940
They're in 4th, 5th, 1st,
and 2nd grade. Take it off.

1763
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,940
Someone is coming.

1764
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:52,250
(Haha heard the commotion
and came.)

1765
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,710
- He's in first grade. Take it off.
- Let's join forces.

1766
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:55,980
- Eun Bin, hold my hand.
- Hurry up.

1767
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,340
- Hold my hand.
- Hurry up.

1768
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,420
(We shouldn't ally with them.)

1769
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,150
- Take off his name tag.
- Haha.

1770
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:02,920
- What are you doing?
- What?

1771
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,380
(The unexpected peace treaty)

1772
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,730
- Why did you hold Kwang Soo's hand?
- I'm stuck.

1773
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,750
I didn't mean to...

1774
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,020
I'm stuck here.

1775
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,520
- But...
- Eun Bin... Wait. No, wait.

1776
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,230
- Why are you...
- Jae Suk.

1777
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:15,440
No, don't let go.

1778
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,900
- Jae Suk.
- Let go.

1779
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,840
- Hold on.
- Jae Suk.

1780
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,840
Hey, Jae Suk is...

1781
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,840
(Taking off the name tag)

1782
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,880
Gosh.

1783
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,670
(His name tag was removed!)

1784
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:26,040
- Gosh.
- I removed his name tag.

1785
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,580
- I removed 1 of his name tags.
- Kwang Soo took 1.

1786
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,040
(As the 4th grader, Kwang Soo
eliminated the 2nd grader Haha.)

1787
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,190
Kwang Soo gets promoted,
and Haha gets demoted.

1788
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:35,750
- Wait.
- Can we remove their name tags now?

1789
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,590
- Yes, you can.
- Stop. Don't do that.

1790
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,330
- Don't take it off.
- I should avoid them.

1791
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,420
I need to find
the Up and Down Rooms first.

1792
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,060
But there are too many people
up there.

1793
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:46,330
Seriously...

1794
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:48,090
The Up and Down Rooms are open now.

1795
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,440
The Up and Down Rooms are open now.

1796
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,130
(The Up and Down Rooms where they
can get promoted are open now.)

1797
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,940
Where are the Up and Down Rooms?

1798
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,750
We have to find
the Up and Down Rooms.

1799
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:01,920
Is there an Up and Down Room there?

1800
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,380
This is crazy. I really need to
find an Up and Down Room.

1801
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:08,150
Oh, gosh. What is it?

1802
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:09,310
(He must find it
before the others do.)

1803
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:13,330
I found an Up and Down Room.

1804
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,290
(He found an Up and Down Room!)

1805
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:19,690
(The first grader Kim Min Jae
got into the booth.)

1806
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:22,290
Where is it? Okay.

1807
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:24,610
(He's checking the mission
that he has to do in the booth.)

1808
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,230
Next. There.

1809
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:29,980
First, choose one person
you want to promote or demote.

1810
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:33,980
Next, write down your name
and someone else's on three balls,

1811
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,540
and put the balls in the Up Box
or the Down Box.

1812
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,340
You will pick one ball by yourself,

1813
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,810
which will decide the person
to be promoted or demoted.

1814
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:44,860
For example, if you want to
get promoted,

1815
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,830
(If you pick your name,
you'll be promoted.)

1816
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:52,630
Write down someone else's name
on 1 of the 3 balls,

1817
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:55,270
and write down your name
on the rest 2 balls.

1818
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:56,770
Next, put the balls in the Up Box.

1819
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,770
If you pick a ball with your name
on it, you'll get promoted.

1820
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:01,810
(Promoted to 2nd grade)

1821
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,980
I can write down my name
on two balls, right?

1822
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,880
I'll write down Eun Bin's name
on one ball.

1823
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,340
I'll write my name on another ball.

1824
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,790
So there's a better chance
that I'll pick my name.

1825
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,810
Now, I'm putting the balls
in the Up Box.

1826
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:23,230
(Min Jae is mixing the balls
unlike the cast of Running Man.)

1827
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:24,860
Please let me get promoted.

1828
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,000
Okay.

1829
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,630
(2 balls with his name on them
and 1 with Eun Bin's name on it)

1830
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:33,610
(Which one of them
will be promoted?)

1831
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:34,900
Okay.

1832
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,170
(He picked one ball.)

1833
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:39,400
How could I pick this one?

1834
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,420
(Eun Bin)

1835
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,770
How could this happen?

1836
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:42,810
(Eun Bin?)

1837
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,520
(I'm done for.)

1838
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,480
Does that mean
this person will be promoted?

1839
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,290
Gosh, seriously.

1840
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:52,690
(Eun Bin is promoted
thanks to him.)

1841
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:54,520
Let's go together.
We're invincible.

1842
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,020
Let's go inside.

1843
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Okay. Let's go.

1844
01:02:58,330 --> 01:02:59,520
This is crazy.

1845
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,790
How dare you?

1846
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,770
(Glancing)

1847
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:05,940
Why? I wasn't doing anything.

1848
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,170
- I won't take off your name tag.
- She's holding...

1849
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:09,840
- I won't take it off.
- Hey.

1850
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,250
- I'm just checking.
- Let go of my hand.

1851
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,500
- Haha.
- We're holding hands together.

1852
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,310
Haha, let go of my hand
just for a moment. I'm hot.

1853
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:16,250
- It's too hot. That's all.
- Let's abandon him.

1854
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,750
(Se Chan got caught.)

1855
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:20,690
So Min, you're
a fifth grader now, right?

1856
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:24,250
10th grade...
And you're in 1st grade, right?

1857
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,590
(He got the message.)

1858
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,730
- No.
- What do you mean?

1859
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:32,520
- No. Don't betray me.
- Haha.

1860
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,770
- No.
- Why?

1861
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:35,960
- Don't do that.
- What? I wasn't doing anything.

1862
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,940
- Don't let go of my hand.
- Haha, let go.

1863
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,080
- Let go of Eun Bin.
- No!

1864
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,670
- So Min.
- You're so mean.

1865
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:44,310
I came on a variety show
after a long time.

1866
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,750
- I know.
- You'll be on another show.

1867
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,750
One show wouldn't be a problem.

1868
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,940
- No.
- One show wouldn't be a problem.

1869
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,040
Hold on. I...

1870
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,840
- Let me catch my breath.
- Okay.

1871
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,310
- Before I stand up...
- Wait. How could you...

1872
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:55,150
(They changed the target!)

1873
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:56,290
Eun Bin, get up.

1874
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,880
- Come on. Get up.
- I... I got him.

1875
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,020
Hey, don't...

1876
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,150
(He lost his name tag in a blink.)

1877
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,520
- Eun Bin, get up.
- Hey!

1878
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:04,860
Can I just get up?

1879
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,360
- I am out.
- Let's summarize.

1880
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,360
(Wasn't Haha a 1st grader?)

1881
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,170
- I am out.
- Don't lie.

1882
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:10,610
- I was a first grader.
- Don't lie.

1883
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,340
I was a first grader.

1884
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:13,810
Haha is out.

1885
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:15,880
- My goodness.
- Haha is out.

1886
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,040
(Haha's name tag got removed
in 1st grade, so he is out.)

1887
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,110
- Se Chan,
- Did I move up a grade?

1888
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,580
you moved up a grade.

1889
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,590
- Let's go, Eun Bin.
- What?

1890
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,610
That little...

1891
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,150
(Haha was discarded in cold blood.)

1892
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:28,810
Gosh, I am so annoyed.

1893
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,560
How did this happen?

1894
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:33,460
Give me that.

1895
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,290
(Even an eliminated student
gets a mission.)

1896
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:40,360
It's an important mission.

1897
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,860
(An important mission?)

1898
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,170
Let's go.

1899
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,270
Hold on!

1900
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:46,810
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

1901
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:49,310
(Haha reappears
with an important mission!)

1902
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,580
- Hold on.
- What's going on?

1903
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:51,770
Haha.

1904
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:53,610
- Were you given a role?
- Was it the Up and Down Room?

1905
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:56,250
- Was it the Up and Down Room?
- You are very curious, right?

1906
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,250
- Yes.
- What's your role?

1907
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,880
- Take a look at this.
- What is it?

1908
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,190
(Which important mission
did he take on?)

1909
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:05,250
(The status board
of the current members?)

1910
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:06,630
"The number of members per grade"?

1911
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,150
I see.

1912
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,090
- The sixth grade.
- You managed to survive.

1913
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:12,130
Who are the first graders?

1914
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:13,360
One of them must be Jae Suk.

1915
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:14,900
Who is the other one?

1916
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,500
- Min Jae. Where is Min Jae?
- Min Jae.

1917
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,710
You are right. Where is Min Jae?

1918
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,270
- I haven't seen him around.
- He must be hiding.

1919
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:20,670
- What is he doing?
- Shall we go and take him out?

1920
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:22,080
Shall we go and find Min Jae?

1921
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,500
- Let's go and find Min Jae.
- Okay.

1922
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:25,210
Someone's name tag got ripped off.

1923
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:27,040
(He is having a lonely fight.)

1924
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,110
Is Haha out?

1925
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:29,380
- Are you a fourth grader?
- Yes.

1926
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:31,020
Then our combined grade is 10.

1927
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,810
- 10.
- I am in the middle.

1928
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:35,810
If one of you...

1929
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,020
You know the Electricity Game,
right?

1930
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,750
- If one of you...
- I will stand in the middle...

1931
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:40,020
- so that it doesn't happen.
- Hold on.

1932
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,420
If one of you squeezes my hand
to send me a sign,

1933
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,360
I can attack right away.

1934
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:46,860
There is no reason for us
to turn against each other.

1935
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,090
Let's not do that.

1936
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:52,400
(So Min feels the squeeze
as soon as they finish talking.)

1937
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,000
Kwang Soo.

1938
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,710
Give me your hand.

1939
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:58,880
(It's like the calm
before the storm.)

1940
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,420
- Come on. Don't be like that.
- So Min.

1941
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:02,880
What's the use of ripping
each other's name tag?

1942
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,110
What's the use of moving up
a grade?

1943
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:05,690
Hold on.

1944
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:07,460
(They talk of trusting each other,
but uncomfortable silence ensues.)

1945
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,690
This is driving me crazy.

1946
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:09,710
Come here.

1947
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,090
Let's go someplace quiet.

1948
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:16,330
(They move to someplace quiet
to take someone out.)

1949
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,960
This is like...

1950
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,170
the Mafia Game.

1951
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,270
- We are close...
- I am feeling the squeeze.

1952
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,840
- to having a ruckus break out.
- Seriously.

1953
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,040
In order to survive,

1954
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,880
- you can either stay still...
- Yes.

1955
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,210
or rip off someone's name tag.

1956
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,170
All right.

1957
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,110
Did everyone send a signal?

1958
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,250
This is my signal.

1959
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,420
All right.

1960
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,420
(Squeezing)

1961
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,440
By the way,

1962
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,940
both of you are giving me a squeeze.

1963
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,210
Hey.

1964
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,750
(The signals of betrayal are
all over the place.)

1965
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,810
Hey. I thought you gave me a signal.

1966
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,980
Stop sending him a signal.

1967
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,420
All right.

1968
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,630
1, 2,

1969
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:50,630
(They try
the Electricity Game again.)

1970
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:52,020
three. Let go.

1971
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,590
(They twist Se Chan's arms
so that he wouldn't run away.)

1972
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,670
- No.
- They are coming!

1973
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,860
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyun, and Min Jae
appear!)

1974
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:01,630
Hold on. Hold on.

1975
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,440
We can't win against them.

1976
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,940
- Hold on.
- We can't win against them.

1977
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:07,480
I got him.

1978
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,770
Kwang Soo, cut ties with them.

1979
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,880
Cut ties with them.

1980
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,040
- Do it.
- No, no.

1981
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,690
- No.
- Cut ties with them.

1982
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,060
We won't survive without you.

1983
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:17,250
You were struggling before.

1984
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,860
(Should I cut ties or not?)

1985
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,690
Hold on.
Why are you doing this to me?

1986
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:23,000
(Jong Kook goes after Se Chan.)

1987
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,170
Rip off Se Chan's name tag.

1988
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:25,360
Okay.

1989
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:27,500
(He removed Se Chan's name tag!)

1990
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,590
(The moment
his name tag got ripped off,)

1991
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:32,170
(Kwang Soo let go
of Se Chan's hand!)

1992
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:35,110
- Let's summarize.
- Let's summarize.

1993
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,650
- Their grades are too high.
- My grade isn't that high.

1994
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:39,040
Jong Kook's grade is too high.

1995
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:41,150
- Their grades are too high.
- No, my grade isn't that high.

1996
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:42,840
Please put this back on.

1997
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,440
(This is ridiculous.)

1998
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,090
Why do you guys betray each other?

1999
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:47,590
- Don't hang out with Kwang Soo.
- No, no.

2000
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:49,710
- I didn't start this.
- Se Chan, don't...

2001
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:51,560
- Really?
- They are just like me.

2002
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:54,520
- The three of you should scatter.
- Let's scatter.

2003
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,270
We are in a pretty good place.

2004
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:58,330
Our combined grade is 10.

2005
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,020
That this rate,
Jong Kook will win again.

2006
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,940
- We shouldn't fight.
- Let's not do that.

2007
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,110
- Let's not do that.
- We lost because we fought.

2008
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:06,610
I won't do it.
Let's not betray each other.

2009
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:07,980
Okay. Keep your promise.

2010
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,340
- Okay.
- 20 minutes remain.

2011
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,400
There is a time limit too.

2012
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,810
(Se Chan sends So Min a signal.)

2013
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,980
I didn't do anything!

2014
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,310
You little...

2015
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:18,690
(A war breaks out.)

2016
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:19,840
Stop it.

2017
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,480
So Min. So Min.

2018
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,960
I am sorry.

2019
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,130
(A betrayal after a betrayal)

2020
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:25,380
- So Min.
- I am holding his hand.

2021
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,460
- I am holding his hand.
- You two, make up.

2022
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,460
(The trio can't trust each other.)

2023
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,430
Let's hold hands again.

2024
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:32,390
My arms are about to fall off!

2025
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,720
Let's just...

2026
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,560
I am sorry, but please get us
a small room.

2027
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:37,230
We will put an end to this.

2028
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:38,340
It won't end.

2029
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:40,840
All right. We're done.

2030
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,430
I need to survive no matter what.

2031
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,180
I will show you.

2032
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:48,750
If I enter the Up and Down Room
and become a second grader,

2033
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,510
anything could happen.

2034
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:52,010
(I will move up a grade
no matter what!)

2035
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:54,310
- All right.
- You know,

2036
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:57,390
a 6th grader doesn't need to stay
a 6th grader.

2037
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:59,090
We could rip off
a sixth grader's name tag.

2038
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:01,350
- That's right.
- We could do that.

2039
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,430
Do you want to see the status board?

2040
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:04,800
- Yes!
- Yes, we do.

2041
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,130
- Do you want to see it?
- Yes!

2042
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:07,190
(Haha appears
with the status board.)

2043
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:09,100
Let's see it.

2044
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,600
The fifth grade is...

2045
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,430
The fifth grader will win
at this rate.

2046
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:14,430
(Only 1 person is in 5th grade.)

2047
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,400
Hold on. Hold on.

2048
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:19,400
To be honest...
Hold on. Please listen to me.

2049
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:21,310
Shall we take them on?

2050
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:22,310
(Provoking)

2051
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:23,880
- Let's do that.
- Right now?

2052
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,350
- Hold on.
- So Min.

2053
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:26,420
- It's not a good idea.
- So Min.

2054
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,760
- Is our combined grade higher?
- Yes, it is.

2055
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,590
Then Kwang Soo should attack.

2056
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:33,650
- Okay. Let's do it.
- Kwang Soo.

2057
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,430
Hold on. Stay still.

2058
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,860
It's okay even if your name tag
gets ripped off.

2059
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:39,970
- Our combined grade is higher.
- It's okay even if it happens.

2060
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:41,500
- You are right.
- It's okay even if it happens.

2061
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,600
It's okay even if your name tag
gets ripped off.

2062
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,690
(Certain that their combined grade
is higher, the 6 members attack.)

2063
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:44,860
So Min, why did you hold her hand?

2064
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,260
(At that moment,)

2065
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,040
(So Min suddenly betrays her group.)

2066
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,600
- We can still win.
- No, no.

2067
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,680
- Can we attack?
- We aren't sure.

2068
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,440
- Hold on.
- Should we go ahead and attack?

2069
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,350
(Sung Cheol goes ahead and attacks.)

2070
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:57,140
- No, no.
- Should we go ahead and attack?

2071
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,810
- Should we try it?
- Hold hands.

2072
01:09:58,810 --> 01:09:59,890
- Should we try it?
- No, no.

2073
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:01,220
(He can't finish the attack
because he is unsure.)

2074
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,050
- Should we try it?
- Their combined grade is lower.

2075
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,650
- I think we can win.
- No, no.

2076
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:05,930
- We need to attack now.
- Really?

2077
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:07,220
- You...
- Okay.

2078
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:09,600
- Hold on.
- Okay.

2079
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,360
- Where are you going?
- I am staying here.

2080
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:12,970
Let go of my hand, you fool.

2081
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,000
(His voice shakes terribly.)

2082
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,140
- What is up with you?
- Why are you so excited?

2083
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,100
Suk Jin must be in first grade.

2084
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,210
- Me? Think that I am in 1st grade.
- He isn't in 1st grade.

2085
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,140
Should I rip off
Suk Jin's name tag?

2086
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,080
Sung Cheol and Eun Bin's grade
is too high.

2087
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,750
Their combined grade alone is 12.

2088
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,110
- Is it 12?
- Hold on.

2089
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:30,980
- Shall we scatter?
- Shall we do that?

2090
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,640
- Let's do the calculations first.
- Let's scatter.

2091
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,220
- There are too many people.
- Go.

2092
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:36,050
- Go.
- Isn't our combined grade higher?

2093
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:37,630
- I don't think so.
- No.

2094
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:39,850
Sung Cheol and Eun Bin's grade
is too high.

2095
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,690
- I am sorry.
- They are coming!

2096
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:42,720
(At that moment)

2097
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,560
Hold on.

2098
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:46,170
It's okay.

2099
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:47,860
They held hands.
They held hands again.

2100
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:48,890
This won't do.

2101
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:50,390
(Suk Jin attacks Se Chan.)

2102
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,510
I did it.

2103
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:52,860
(He succeeded to rip off
the name tag.)

2104
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,400
- I did it.
- Wait.

2105
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,640
- The result...
- My name tag got ripped off.

2106
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,010
Kwang Soo didn't let go.

2107
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:58,180
He didn't let go.

2108
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,970
Suk Jin, you moved up a grade.

2109
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:01,380
Really?

2110
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,420
(Suk Jin becomes a 4th grader,
and Se Chan becomes a 1st grader.)

2111
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,420
- Is his grade higher?
- Okay. I will put it back on.

2112
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,090
We can attack them
as a group again, right?

2113
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,890
- In that case...
- I am going to leave.

2114
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:12,290
Can we rip their name tag off?

2115
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:13,550
- Here...
- Let's resume right away.

2116
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:15,390
Se Chan left. Se Chan left.

2117
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,100
- Se Chan left. Se Chan left.
- Let's rip off Min Jae's name tag.

2118
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,390
Let's rip off Min Jae's name tag.

2119
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:19,500
- Hold on!
- Let's rip off Min Jae's name tag.

2120
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,690
- I don't want to get eliminated.
- Don't do it.

2121
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:23,930
Hold on. Hold on. Let's talk.

2122
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:25,640
- Hold on.
- Hold on. Hold on. Let's talk.

2123
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,470
Listen to what I have to say.

2124
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:28,640
- I...
- What is it?

2125
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,800
What is it?

2126
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,880
(His name tag gets ripped off!)

2127
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,750
(HIs name tag got ripped off
before Kwang Soo held his hand.)

2128
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,580
- That's good.
- His name tag got ripped off.

2129
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,810
- Is he out?
- Sung Cheol ripped it, right?

2130
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,390
- I was a 1st grader.
- Were you a 1st grader?

2131
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,960
- Really?
- Does that mean you are out?

2132
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,150
- I was a first grader.
- I told you not to do it.

2133
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:44,720
- I told you to listen to me.
- I didn't know.

2134
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:45,850
Why did you have to rip off
my name tag?

2135
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,220
For goodness' sake.

2136
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,520
Now...

2137
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:50,860
- We will leave.
- Go ahead.

2138
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,170
- What's your grade?
- 5... 4th grade.

2139
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:54,260
- Are you in fourth grade?
- Yes.

2140
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:55,890
- You are in third grade, right?
- Yes, I am.

2141
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:57,640
If I rip off your name tag,

2142
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,040
I will be a fifth grader.

2143
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,060
(Kwang Soo attacks her.)

2144
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,040
You can't rip off my name tag.

2145
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,470
(If Ji Hyun is in 4th grade
and Kwang Soo is in 3rd grade,)

2146
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,880
(Kwang Soo will move down a grade
upon ripping off her name tag.)

2147
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,610
Is it okay for you to do that?

2148
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:11,680
Aren't you in third grade?

2149
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,680
(Why did he rip off her name tag
if he is in 3rd grade?)

2150
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,180
I guess he isn't in third grade.

2151
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,110
Kwang Soo.

2152
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,850
(Isn't Kwang Soo in 3rd grade?)

2153
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:19,020
You moved up a grade.

2154
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:20,650
I am sorry, Ji Hyun.

2155
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:22,430
Let's go.

2156
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:24,470
(Ji Hyun moves down a grade.)

2157
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,600
I am sorry, Ji Hyun.

2158
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,860
(He means it.)

2159
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,360
Where is the Up and Down Room?

2160
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:31,540
I don't think this will end
anytime soon.

2161
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:33,210
(So Min spots Haha
with the status board.)

2162
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:34,340
It will take some time.

2163
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,900
(She uses her cell phone
to zoom in on the status board.)

2164
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,010
It's Haha.

2165
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,770
It will take some time.

2166
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,550
Two sixth graders,
two fourth graders,

2167
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:42,610
and two first graders.

2168
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:44,640
(Upon checking the status board)

2169
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,480
- It's So Min.
- Jong Kook.

2170
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:47,810
Jong Kook.

2171
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:50,180
(Please team up with me.)

2172
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:51,480
Hey, forget it.

2173
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,980
You are a betrayer. Come here.

2174
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,460
Hold on!

2175
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,650
- Hold on.
- Done.

2176
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:57,390
(He removed her name tag
without hesitation.)

2177
01:12:57,390 --> 01:13:00,020
(Jong Kook becomes a 6th grader
and So Min becomes a 1st grader.)

2178
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:01,340
You are so mean.

2179
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,060
- Okay, okay.
- You are so mean.

2180
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:04,300
So Min, come here.

2181
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,710
(He is an expert
in teaching people a lesson.)

2182
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,430
What am I going to do?

2183
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,880
What am I going to do?

2184
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:10,080
I need to run away.

2185
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:12,770
This became a game of wits.

2186
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,610
What's your grade?
I will give you a consultation.

2187
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,880
- You are in 5th grade, right?
- 6th grade.

2188
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:17,080
- 6th grade?
- Yes.

2189
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,720
You moved up too much.

2190
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,390
Right? Right?

2191
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:21,720
In order to make you win...

2192
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,110
- Third graders have no chance.
- No? Why not?

2193
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:26,520
It's most likely
that a fourth grader will win.

2194
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,350
You should rip off
these two members' name tag.

2195
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:29,430
(It's an on-point lesson.)

2196
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:31,130
It's crystal clear.

2197
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,470
The status changed.
Let's think of a way.

2198
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,340
Sixth grade?

2199
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:36,730
- That changed fast.
- No one is in fifth grade.

2200
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:39,210
This is it. This is the way.

2201
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,760
You should get betrayed.

2202
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,430
So I should get my name tag
ripped off.

2203
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:43,930
Get your name tag ripped off
and hide.

2204
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:44,940
That's right!

2205
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:47,140
(This customer is touched.)

2206
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,310
- Good luck.
- Okay.

2207
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:49,640
(Haha doubles as a counselor.)

2208
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,810
Why are you alone?

2209
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:52,940
(Sung Cheol and Ji Hyun show up.)

2210
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:54,850
What's your grade?

2211
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:57,180
Are you in sixth grade?

2212
01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:58,520
- Which grade are you in?
- Second grade.

2213
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:00,480
- Take him out.
- It doesn't seem that way.

2214
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,050
You can't avoid it. Fight him!

2215
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,970
Fight him! Get a good shot!

2216
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,040
(Jong Kook is planning to be
the final winner.)

2217
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,540
Fight him! Fight him!

2218
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,210
Ji Hyun, watch your hair.

2219
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:17,750
(Jong Kook let Ji Hyun rip off
his name tag.)

2220
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,100
Jong Kook, you moved down a grade.

2221
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:20,440
(He moves down to the 5th grade
as he has planned.)

2222
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,440
- This is driving me crazy.
- Ji Hyun, you moved up a grade.

2223
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,010
Let's scatter.

2224
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,850
(The timid 1st grader,
Jae Suk is hiding.)

2225
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:29,680
(He runs away
upon hearing someone's footsteps.)

2226
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,960
Jae Suk!

2227
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,290
I won't rip off your name tag.
I don't need to do that.

2228
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,630
- Really?
- Yes.

2229
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:35,930
I don't need to do that.

2230
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:39,060
There is only one fifth grader,
and it's Jong Kook.

2231
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:41,970
- Which grade are you in?
- 4th grade. No, 3rd grade.

2232
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:44,970
There are so many fourth graders.

2233
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:47,510
I saw you walk around
while holding someone's hand.

2234
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,600
I had teamed up with Ji Hyun.
I ripped off her name tag once.

2235
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,510
You shouldn't do that
when you have a girlfriend.

2236
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:53,080
What are you saying?

2237
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,140
My girlfriend has nothing to do
with this.

2238
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,110
I don't understand
what you are saying.

2239
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:58,440
Hold on.

2240
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,810
You shouldn't do that.

2241
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,110
What are you saying?

2242
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:03,310
- You were alone with Ji Hyun.
- Someone is coming.

2243
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:04,310
Hey.

2244
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:06,260
Kwang Soo.

2245
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,690
(They move downstairs
upon hearing someone approach.)

2246
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,390
The situation keeps changing.

2247
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:12,100
- It's Se Chan.
- Jae Suk.

2248
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:14,470
- Which grade are you in?
- First grade.

2249
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,140
How about you?

2250
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,230
I am in third grade.

2251
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:19,670
Things became complicated.
It's a ruckus upstairs.

2252
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:24,300
Se Chan, you moved up a grade
due to the Up and Down Room.

2253
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:25,600
Me?

2254
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,300
- You are in second grade.
- Hold on.

2255
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:31,140
- Hold on.
- Then Jae Suk is the only one.

2256
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,550
(So Min picked Se Chan's ball
in the Up and Down Room.)

2257
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,980
The status board is here.

2258
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:36,790
- Min Jae.
- Min Jae, come here.

2259
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:37,960
Min Jae, come here.

2260
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,150
So many things changed.

2261
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,630
There are two people in every grade.

2262
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:42,930
This is giving me a headache.

2263
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:44,690
(The number of members per grade)

2264
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:46,260
This is giving me a headache.

2265
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,760
You said you are in third grade,
but you aren't.

2266
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,260
Why is no one in third grade?

2267
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:53,510
(He got caught lying.)

2268
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:54,840
- What happened?
- What is the meaning of this?

2269
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,600
- Are you a ghost?
- What are you?

2270
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,210
- What are you?
- What are you?

2271
01:15:58,210 --> 01:15:59,680
- Let's hold hands and talk.
- What are you?

2272
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,220
- What are you?
- Are you a ghost?

2273
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,470
No one is in third grade.

2274
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,050
What happened?

2275
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:05,350
(Tell me honestly.)

2276
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:06,590
I don't know.

2277
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:07,680
(He stops thinking.)

2278
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,890
(He can't think of an excuse.)

2279
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:12,720
- I mean...
- I forgot about my grade.

2280
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:15,000
- Which grade are you in?
- My name tag got ripped off a lot.

2281
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,100
This is...

2282
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,430
I am in second grade.

2283
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:20,000
- You are in second grade?
- Yes.

2284
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:23,040
Hold on. Hold my hand. Listen.

2285
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:24,730
Things will be interesting
if we team up.

2286
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:27,770
If we rip off Jae Suk's name tag...

2287
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,340
- What are you saying?
- I mean...

2288
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:33,010
- It was just a discussion.
- Don't be like that.

2289
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:35,310
There is no reason
for the three of us to argue.

2290
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:38,390
- Let's move.
- I will keep updating the board.

2291
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,610
Hold on. It looks like...

2292
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:42,850
I am in the highest grade. Let go.

2293
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:44,010
- What?
- Let go.

2294
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:45,130
Are you in the highest grade?

2295
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:46,550
Which grade are you in?

2296
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,000
- He is in 2nd grade.
- I am in 2nd grade.

2297
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,390
- He is in second grade too.
- If we team up,

2298
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,170
our combined grade is higher.

2299
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:52,600
I was joking around.

2300
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:54,300
Don't joke around like that.

2301
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:56,390
- Let's hold hands for a while.
- Seriously.

2302
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:57,430
Okay.

2303
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:58,470
This is driving me crazy.

2304
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:59,760
(They move
with their hands held tight.)

2305
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,710
I can't act rashly.

2306
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:04,400
(Glancing over)

2307
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,210
(Jae Suk tries to attack.)

2308
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,270
Hey.

2309
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,550
(Annoyed by the betrayal,
Kwang Soo strikes back.)

2310
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,310
Hold on. Hold on.

2311
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:14,590
(They grab each other's name tag
at the same time.)

2312
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:17,480
(Se Chan is holding
Jae Suk's hand.)

2313
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,550
Hold on.

2314
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,330
(Jae Suk ripped off
Kwang Soo's name tag first!)

2315
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:25,300
All right.

2316
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,670
(Kwang Soo said he is in 2nd grade.)

2317
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:32,510
(Then Jae Suk and Se Chan's
combined grade is higher.)

2318
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:34,680
- Jae Suk, you are out.
- Why?

2319
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,800
(Is Jae Suk out?)

2320
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,640
- Jae Suk, you are out.
- We were holding hands.

2321
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,970
- That's right.
- So?

2322
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:40,970
Which grade are you in?

2323
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:42,920
I didn't lie.

2324
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,250
Kwang Soo, which grade are you in?

2325
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,720
Don't ask, you punk.

2326
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,290
He must be in sixth grade.

2327
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,420
Are you in fifth grade?

2328
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,010
(We were fooled again.)

2329
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:52,480
I can't believe him.

2330
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:54,630
Okay. Let's stay together for now.

2331
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:56,500
I really am in fifth grade!

2332
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,800
(It's nearly the end of the race.)

2333
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,860
Come on.

2334
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,060
Three...

2335
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:01,130
What?

2336
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:03,600
- We are doing you a favor.
- Why?

2337
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,800
- We are doing you a favor.
- What?

2338
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:10,470
Either a 4th grader
or a 5th grader will win.

2339
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:11,940
- Promise to share the prize.
- Okay.

2340
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:13,880
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2341
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,810
- Make sure you win.
- Let me change the status.

2342
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:17,550
- Come on.
- You are so mean.

2343
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:19,750
Sung Cheol, you are so mean.

2344
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:21,460
- No! Don't do it!
- Come on.

2345
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,310
- No!
- Hold her hand.

2346
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:24,650
(The status changes rapidly
towards the end of the race.)

2347
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,790
All right.

2348
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:27,330
(The status changes rapidly
towards the end of the race.)

2349
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:28,500
The race ends.

2350
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,760
Please gather around.

2351
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,890
As I explained earlier,

2352
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:35,970
the only member
of the highest grade will win.

2353
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,800
Sung Cheol is in sixth grade.

2354
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:40,710
(He will win if there are
no other 6th graders.)

2355
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:43,100
Eun Bin is in sixth grade.

2356
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:44,970
My goodness.

2357
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:46,440
Suk Jin is...

2358
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,810
- in fifth grade.
- Okay.

2359
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,810
- Why did you become a fifth grader?
- Seriously.

2360
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,220
Jong Kook is in fifth grade.

2361
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:54,350
Kwang Soo.

2362
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:55,480
Kwang Soo is...

2363
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,150
- in fourth grade.
- I knew it.

2364
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,680
- Yes!
- Kwang Soo will win.

2365
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,550
Ji Hyo and Ji Hyun are
in third grade.

2366
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:02,800
- Kwang Soo is the winner.
- Yes!

2367
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,300
I can't believe it.

2368
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,830
(Kwang Soo's strategy for victory)

2369
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:09,430
I should get my name tag ripped off.

2370
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:11,760
That's right.
I should get my name tag ripped off.

2371
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,170
Who will do it?

2372
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:14,430
Who are they?

2373
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:15,770
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2374
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:18,750
Hold on. He wants
to get his name tag ripped off.

2375
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,750
- Let go.
- Let go for a second.

2376
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,050
Let go for a second.

2377
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:23,180
What? What is up with him?

2378
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:25,180
Let's go.

2379
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:26,610
(He succeeded to move down
to 4th grade.)

2380
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,790
- Which grade are you in?
- I am in second grade.

2381
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:30,350
(Kwang Soo lied and said
that he is in 2nd grade.)

2382
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:31,630
- Are you in second grade?
- Yes.

2383
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:35,050
(He didn't want to move up
to 5th grade,)

2384
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:37,520
(so he made Jae Suk rip off
his name tag!)

2385
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:42,690
(It was Kwang Soo's strategy
to become the sole 4th grader.)

2386
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:45,800
- Thank you, Suk Jin and Jae Suk.
- How did he keep it that way?

2387
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,140
- How strange!
- Like I always say,

2388
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:49,010
it's a good idea to take him out
in the beginning of the race.

2389
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,300
- We shouldn't leave him behind.
- We shouldn't leave him behind.

2390
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,350
Please bring in the prize
for the best student...

2391
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:56,770
- from the music school.
- What is it?

2392
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,390
Please let it be a xylophone.

2393
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,390
A triangle.

2394
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:02,090
- Please let it be a xylophone.
- I haven't won a prize in a while.

2395
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:03,790
Please let it be a xylophone
or a recorder.

2396
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:04,830
A pipe.

2397
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,050
That's incredible.

2398
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:07,090
Really?

2399
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:08,650
- He will receive a turntable.
- It's nice.

2400
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,800
- It's a good prize. It's pretty.
- It's really nice.

2401
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,930
It's pretty.

2402
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,390
Thank you. Thank you.

2403
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:14,430
It's an antique.

2404
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,140
The four members who were eliminated
will get a penalty.

2405
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,430
- Bring in the penalty.
- I forgot about the penalty.

2406
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:22,100
- There is a penalty.
- There is a penalty.

2407
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:25,140
Out of 4 sponges, 2 contain ink...

2408
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,100
- and two contain water.
- Oh, no.

2409
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,080
- Please.
- Please.

2410
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,610
- It's pretty visible.
- You can't change your choice.

2411
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:32,980
- I choose this one.
- Number four.

2412
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,050
(Haha picks the 4th one.)

2413
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:35,290
So Min picked number two.

2414
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:36,290
Min Jae.

2415
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,890
- I pick number four.
- I can't tell.

2416
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,090
You can't tell by looking.

2417
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,960
2 sponges have water
and 2 sponges have...

2418
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:43,720
- One,
- That's right. Hold it up.

2419
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,720
two,

2420
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,860
- three.
- Stamp your face.

2421
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,690
Rub your face.
Get your face in there.

2422
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:49,800
Keep going. There you go.

2423
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,360
(Haha gets a sponge with water.)

2424
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,040
Keep going. There you go.

2425
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,900
(Min Jae gets
a sponge with water too.)

2426
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,800
(In that case)

2427
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,100
Keep going. There you go.

2428
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,470
(So Min and Jae Suk get ink
on their faces.)

2429
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:05,480
(How did the two of them get
those sponges?)

2430
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:08,290
(It's a shocking look.)

2431
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:09,460
My goodness.

2432
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:11,790
- I can't believe it.
- This is the best.

2433
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:14,390
The drama will start airing
tomorrow.

2434
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:16,460
Please watch "Do You Like Brahms?".

2435
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,060
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2436
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:21,300
(Please Watch
"Do You Like Brahms?".)

2437
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:23,730
We did it!

2438
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:25,930
(Running Man Thief Race ended
with the thieves' victory.)

2439
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:28,270
(Jae Suk, Haha, and Ji Hyo's
joint birthday party)

2440
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:29,600
(Is there a copycat criminal?)

2441
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,940
(They set out to catch a thief
who is aiming to steal a jewel.)

2442
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:34,010
(Profiler, detective)

2443
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:35,720
(Who are watching them?)

2444
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,050
What?

2445
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,610
(The real ones are here.)

2446
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:41,090
I heard about the crime.

2447
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,810
(The 1st profiler in Korea,
Pyo Chang Won)

2448
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:43,980
I have experiences.

2449
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,020
(The model of "The Outlaws",
Detective Yoon Seok Ho)

2450
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:47,180
(The experts...)

2451
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:49,330
(will catch the 2 thieves!)

2452
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:50,690
(They will analyze...)

2453
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:52,600
(and dig deep
for the interrogation!)

2454
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,360
So here they are. There are so many.

2455
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:59,140
(The moment you let your guard down,
the photos will remain.)

2456
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,360
(A match of deductions will keep you
on your toes!)

2457
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,470
(What will become of the thieves
who are aiming for the jewel?)

2458
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:06,750
(Running Man Thief Race 2,
The Copycat Criminals)
