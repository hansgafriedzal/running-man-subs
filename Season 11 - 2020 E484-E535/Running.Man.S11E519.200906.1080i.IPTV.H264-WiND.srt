1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,680
(This was filmed before the practice
of social distancing step 2.)

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,460
(Someone arrives 40 minutes before
the beginning of the shoot.)

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,950
Hello.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,190
(So Min arrives early again.)

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,360
I didn't mean to,
but I got here early again.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,630
I'm the first one here.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,310
No one's here, right?

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,810
- Good job today.
- Well done.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,470
You will get to choose
a role tomorrow morning.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,240
Really? Should we
arrive early again?

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,850
Yes. We will start at 8 a.m.
Whoever comes first will pick first.

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,210
- Are we choosing a role again?
- We should come early.

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,310
(Is it something like the Thief Race
where we get to pick an occupation?)

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,560
Hello.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,560
Get her a microphone.

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,020
I'm Jeon So Min who got here first.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,160
You told us to come early.
Do you know what time it is now?

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,100
The crew members are
complaining a lot.

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,440
I woke up at 4 a.m.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,340
I'm really tired. We need to hurry.

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,200
(She turns on a light for herself.)

22
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,200
There's no lighting.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,310
Hello. Can I get my microphone?

24
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,640
When I came in and asked
why things weren't ready,

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,920
I heard a crew member say...

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,020
it's my fault that I came too early.

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,450
(They exchange words of blessing
from early morning.)

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,890
Please take a look around.

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,330
I didn't see this.

30
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,160
"Jae Suk, Haha, and Ji Hyo's
joint birthday party".

31
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,050
(Are we having
a birthday party today?)

32
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,530
Are we having
a birthday party today?

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,300
(Then she finds
something on the table.)

34
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,890
This is nice. I like it.

35
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,110
There's a new occupation.

36
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,280
(There are several occupations
like the Thief Race episode.)

37
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,140
Why did you put these separately?

38
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,140
(A profiler and detective
are put aside.)

39
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,350
They are for the guests.

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,550
(A profiler and detective are
for today's guests.)

41
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,750
I guess this one is useless.

42
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,490
It has no power.

43
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,220
Honestly, I find
this one attractive.

44
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,780
I want to pick this one.

45
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,330
Why did So Min come here so early?

46
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,100
- Hey.
- Se Chan is here.

47
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,330
Why are you here so early?

48
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,890
- Se Chan's here.
- Hello.

49
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,890
Why did you come so early?
Just tell me.

50
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,270
My house is only 15 minutes
away from here.

51
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,500
You're the one who's being weird.

52
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,030
I always come early.

53
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,440
- Did you pick one already?
- Not yet.

54
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,530
Are we supposed to wait?

55
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,700
- I need...
- You can pick one if you want.

56
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,970
I need to do some thinking.

57
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,650
What is a headhunter?
Is it about blowing a head off?

58
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,440
(What is a headhunter?
Is it about blowing a head off?)

59
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,010
Gosh, no. It's like finding someone
who meets the qualifications.

60
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,160
Like employees.

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,190
(He thought it was like
hunting people.)

62
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,460
I think this one suits you well.

63
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,750
- Audio engineer?
- Yes.

64
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,130
I'll pick this. Audio engineer.

65
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,320
Audio engineer?
It's right up your street.

66
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,660
What should I pick?

67
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,060
A photographer or a hacker?

68
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,100
(She's stuck between
a photographer and a hacker.)

69
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,470
I think Haha will make
a good photographer today.

70
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,910
- I'll pick hacker then.
- It's settled.

71
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,440
- He's here.
- Hey, Se Chan.

72
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,250
- Haha.
- She came here really early.

73
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,280
- Again?
- Yes.

74
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,040
Hang on. You're crazy
about see-through shirts.

75
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,540
- Just stay quiet.
- Take a look at this, Haha.

76
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,120
We need to talk about this.

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
He's crazy. He's wearing it again.

78
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,560
- What's wrong with you?
- Why are you being like this?

79
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,280
- What?
- You need to pick one.

80
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,250
- Just pick one.
- I want to be a hacker.

81
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,460
Pick something else.
You can't pick this one.

82
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,970
I think this one sounds cool.

83
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,160
Haha, do you know
what a headhunter is?

84
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,440
- What is a headhunter?
- Do you know what a headhunter is?

85
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,470
It means a boss, you silly.

86
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,940
- What?
- It means...

87
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,440
(He sounds so confident
giving a wrong answer.)

88
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,630
(Se Chan didn't know it,
but he laughs at Haha.)

89
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,350
- Why?
- Are you saying...

90
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,470
- a headhunter is a boss?
- Sure.

91
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,470
- Like a head?
- Yes.

92
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,350
- Why are you laughing?
- I mean,

93
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,570
I didn't know too.

94
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,380
You can't pick these two.

95
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,940
I think this one suits you.

96
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,090
I think Photographer suits you best.

97
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,960
It sounds like an insurance agent.

98
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,460
You're here.

99
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,560
- Hello.
- Hang on.

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,720
I came early
because I live in Hapjeong.

101
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,900
Why do you wear a see-through shirt
so often these days?

102
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,370
We talked about that earlier.

103
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,030
- I think he's an exhibitionist.
- What's his problem?

104
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,260
- You should choose.
- Should I choose one of these?

105
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,840
- Then I'll pick this.
- Which one?

106
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
A photographer? Good choice.
That suits you.

107
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,680
- You should be a headhunter.
- Jae Suk.

108
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,970
- These two won't be helpful.
- Why?

109
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,220
- Think about the last time.
- They had no power.

110
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,150
But a prosecutor is different.

111
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,090
- Let him do as he wants.
- A prosecutor can...

112
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,220
- investigate the case.
- I think...

113
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,280
his hunch is...

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,810
He seems to want to have
a powerful job today.

115
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,960
- Let him do as he wants.
- Let's trust his hunch.

116
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,590
- I'll be a prosecutor today.
- Okay.

117
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,720
Gosh. You shouldn't be late.

118
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,220
I'm not late, Jae Suk.

119
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,290
You're late.

120
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,370
I have no idea
what the interior expert does.

121
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,840
I'll be the security guard.

122
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,530
Just as you predicted,
today, we're going to have...

123
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,370
- Running Man Thief Race 2.
- I see.

124
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,440
(Do you remember
the Running Man Thief Race?)

125
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,410
(The thieves, Kwang Soo and Se Chan,
aimed to steal gold bars...)

126
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,170
(at CEO Big Nose's party.)

127
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,450
(They arrived early and chose to be
the judge and detective.)

128
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,740
(Se Chan moved the gold bars
instead of stealing them,)

129
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,780
(which made it difficult
to investigate the case.)

130
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,720
(Se Chan and Kwang Soo
worked together...)

131
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,050
(and successfully confused
the others.)

132
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,100
(The thieves won as Se Chan survived
at the final trial!)

133
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,160
(Today's race is
Running Man Thief Race 2.)

134
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,870
While you were choosing your roles,

135
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,210
our two guests were watching you.

136
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,450
- What?
- Why were they watching us?

137
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,170
They were here?

138
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,820
(Who are the guests who saw them
arriving and choosing their roles?)

139
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,080
(This is the monitor
that the guests watched.)

140
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,410
Because they are not
actual criminals...

141
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,850
(The two guests will play the roles
of a profiler and detective...)

142
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,680
(that were already assigned
to them.)

143
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,680
Profiler and Detective,
please come out.

144
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,350
- They were here?
- Where were they watching us?

145
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,030
What? Who are they?

146
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,030
- What?
- Isn't he a real detective?

147
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,200
- They are...
- What?

148
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,160
- real detective and profiler.
- Really?

149
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,430
- Hey, Seok Ho.
- No way.

150
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,510
- They're really here.
- How...

151
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,730
(The real ones are here!)

152
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,970
- They're really here.
- How...

153
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,730
- My gosh.
- He's a friend of mine.

154
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

155
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,850
- Hello.
- The real ones are here.

156
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,240
(Lieutenant Yoon Seok Ho,
Profiler Pyo Chang Won)

157
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,040
(Lieutenant Yoon Seok Ho was
the model...)

158
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,980
(of Ma Dong Seok's character
in "The Outlaws".)

159
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,050
(He was on the front line of
the gang mop-up operation in 2004.)

160
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,760
(He's here to catch thieves
with his keen eye.)

161
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,330
(Lieutenant Yoon Seok Ho, the master
of investigation and interrogation)

162
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,700
(A former professor at Korean
National Police University)

163
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,600
(The criminal psychologist who can
see through criminals' minds)

164
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,730
(The current director of
Pyo Institute of Crime Science)

165
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,370
(Pyo Chang Won,
the master of psychological fight)

166
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,010
- How have you been?
- Hello.

167
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,220
- They never come on a variety show.
- I can't believe this.

168
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,020
They never appear
on a variety show, right?

169
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,950
- What do you expect us to do?
- Hello.

170
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,390
The real detective and profiler
are here.

171
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,720
Why would you take this game
so seriously?

172
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,680
My goodness.
The real ones are here.

173
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,350
- This is unbelievable.
- Actually,

174
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,030
we heard that a crime
happened here.

175
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,790
- Here?
- Yes.

176
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,160
We received a report
and came here.

177
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,070
- But...
- He's already into his character.

178
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,600
- My gosh. This is unbelievable.
- We must not...

179
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,860
- make any mistakes today.
- First of all,

180
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,930
Director Pyo Chang Won is...

181
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,740
- the first profiler in Korea.
- That's right.

182
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,020
He studied overseas.

183
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,780
Didn't he appear
on Running Man once?

184
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,090
- We played some kind of mind game.
- Exactly.

185
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,960
- He lost to me.
- Yes, he lost to you.

186
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,590
- He lost to me.
- He lost.

187
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,420
(Chang Won appeared in Episode 257
as the reasoning master.)

188
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,790
(He played the Catch the Thief
Card Game with Suk Jin.)

189
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,140
(He ended up with the Thief Card.)

190
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,230
(He lost to Suk Jin because he
couldn't hide his emotions.)

191
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,100
As a matter of fact,

192
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,370
I realized that he was very smart.

193
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,040
- I was just lucky.
- That's not true.

194
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,950
A few years ago,

195
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,850
you played rock-paper-scissors
with Haha and lost on another show.

196
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,760
- He was lucky.
- True.

197
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,030
I had no strategy.
I didn't think of anything.

198
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,350
- I'm embarrassed.
- Today...

199
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm determined to win today.

200
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,100
Director Pyo is here with us today.

201
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,700
It's not that surprising to see him
on this show if you think about it.

202
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,330
Detective, what are you doing here?

203
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,200
- He's a real detective.
- Why did you come here?

204
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,470
To be honest, it was hard for me
to decide to come here.

205
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,280
- And?
- Because I'm not good with words.

206
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,240
(Everyone is listening to
Detective Yoon closely.)

207
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,650
Now that I'm here,

208
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,910
it's really hard.

209
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,780
You can relax.

210
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,780
- He seems nervous.
- You're too nervous.

211
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,980
- You know Suk Jin personally.
- He and I...

212
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,990
Yes, we first met about 10 years ago
through our mutual acquaintance.

213
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,620
He may seem very gentle,

214
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,420
- but he's scary to a criminal.
- Of course.

215
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,570
- It's true.
- Did you see that?

216
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,790
- Pardon?
- Did you see that?

217
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,970
I heard about it.

218
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,970
Didn't you watch "The Outlaws"?

219
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,430
Ma Dong Seok's character was
modeled after him.

220
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,470
- He's the model of that character.
- You've never seen him...

221
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,780
catching a criminal before.
Why do you act like you know?

222
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,580
Everyone, we gathered here today
for the joint birthday party...

223
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,740
of Jae Suk, Haha, and Ji Hyo
who were born in August.

224
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,480
We prepared jewels for the guests
as a gift.

225
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,220
(The guests will receive
jewels as a gift.)

226
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,460
However, among you, there are
two thieves who aren't invited.

227
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,550
They're after your jewels,
so you should catch them.

228
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,170
The 10 of you are suspects of theft.

229
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,700
You'll receive a prize if you
succeed in catching the thieves,

230
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,630
but if you fail to catch them,
you'll receive a penalty.

231
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,710
There are three steps in arresting
the thieves like the last time.

232
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,970
At the 1st trial, you can find out
if any of 2 suspects is the thief.

233
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,500
You will arrest 1 thief
at the 2nd and final trials.

234
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,050
(They will arrest the thieves
through three trials.)

235
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,140
Just like the last time,

236
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,370
you will have three chances
to search rooms before the mission.

237
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,950
Each of you will have 70 seconds.

238
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,320
(2 members search each room
for 70 seconds.)

239
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,720
This time, you will partner up with
someone else to search the rooms.

240
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,620
(Each team of two people will go to
the rooms where the jewels are.)

241
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,200
And each of the two people
will go into a different room.

242
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,330
(They will go into two rooms
separately.)

243
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,620
But only one of the rooms
has real jewels.

244
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,890
In the other room, there are bags
full of fake jewels.

245
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,360
(Only one room has real jewels!)

246
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,810
In the bags of the eight of you
who are not the thieves,

247
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,540
there are 100 pieces of real jewel.

248
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,970
In the thieves' bags,
there are 100 pieces of fake jewel.

249
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,550
(There are real jewels
only in the civilians' bags.)

250
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,420
In the room with fake jewels,

251
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,510
there are 100 pieces of fake jewel
in all the 10 bags.

252
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,480
(There are fake jewels
in all the 10 bags.)

253
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,520
(There are more fake jewels
here and there in both rooms.)

254
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,020
(The two thieves must go into
the room with real jewels,)

255
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,560
(and steal more than 100 pieces
of real jewels.)

256
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,100
(The thieves know the combination
for the locks of all the bags.)

257
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,490
(The civilians must find ballots
and the trail of the thieves.)

258
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,670
(However, the civilians don't know
the combination for the bags.)

259
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
In each round, the thieves...

260
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,340
will be informed which room has
real jewels,

261
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,100
and search the rooms knowing
the combination for all the bags.

262
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,350
(Only the thieves know
the combination.)

263
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,080
Just like the last time,
additional ballots are hidden.

264
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,590
You can use it whenever you want.

265
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,750
There's only one thing
different from the last time.

266
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,980
The videos were revealed last time,

267
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,650
but this time, photos will be taken
at a set time.

268
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,890
(The photos of the last two places
will be revealed after the mission.)

269
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,930
(Room A, Room B)

270
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,860
(Photos will be taken at 10th and
20th seconds during the search.)

271
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,800
Some photos will be revealed
according to the mission result.

272
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,310
(The photos to show will be chosen
according to the mission result.)

273
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,000
Since we have two experts,
the thieves will be caught.

274
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,000
- But they might be the thieves.
- Could they be...

275
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,180
- the thieves as well?
- One of them...

276
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,640
- must be a thief.
- We never know.

277
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,720
- Maybe they wanted the roles.
- Right.

278
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,880
- They never get a chance to do it.
- Exactly.

279
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,350
First, I'll announce the benefits
of different roles.

280
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,250
Please come in.

281
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,830
(What could be
the upgraded benefits?)

282
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,560
- He can interrogate someone alone?
- Oh, gosh.

283
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,390
- "Before the third trial..."
- We get great benefits this time.

284
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,570
Being the prosecutor isn't
very helpful.

285
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,860
(The Power of Each Role)

286
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,700
First, Lieutenant Yoon Seok Ho,
who plays the detective,

287
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,630
can call one person who he thinks
is the most suspicious...

288
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,210
- for an interrogation.
- That's scary.

289
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,810
(The 1-on-1 interrogation
with an active detective)

290
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,900
- Really?
- Should we put on a helmet too?

291
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,370
- For an interrogation.
- That's scary.

292
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,470
Should we put on a helmet too?

293
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,580
Like a real interrogation?

294
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,380
- We made the interrogation room.
- It's like the Room of Truth.

295
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,690
It'll be a whole new experience.

296
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,720
(Detective Yoon can interrogate
1 person before the 1st trial.)

297
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,150
Next, Profiler Pyo Chang Won...

298
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,350
can watch everyone
going in and out of the rooms...

299
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,800
and hear what they say.

300
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,020
- He can hear us too?
- Yes.

301
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,600
(Profiler Pyo can watch and hear
everyone as they go into the rooms.)

302
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,170
We should be careful with our words.

303
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,860
- What did you just say?
- Hold on a second.

304
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,370
- I meant the thieves.
- Be careful with our words?

305
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,740
- The thieves must be careful.
- Okay.

306
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,810
Is that so?

307
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,400
You know what Jong Kook does
when he suspects someone, right?

308
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,180
- You're done for.
- The security guard caught you.

309
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,820
You won't be able to do anything.

310
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,880
As for the interior expert...

311
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,220
In each round, he can decide...

312
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,750
which room should have real jewels.

313
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,960
- I thought of choosing that role.
- That's great.

314
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,490
(Kwang Soo will decide which room
has real jewels in each round.)

315
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,700
The headhunter will decide...

316
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,490
- the team members and the order.
- He got a great benefit too.

317
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,300
You will maintain the teams
during the missions as well.

318
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,490
That's great.

319
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,040
(Ji Suk Jin, the headhunter)

320
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,500
(He will organize teams and decide
the orders for search and missions.)

321
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,680
The prosecutor has
the final decision...

322
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,000
for choosing 2 suspects
for the 1st trial.

323
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,210
That's amazing.

324
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,580
- The prosecutor is powerful.
- Indeed.

325
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,350
The hacker will receive the passcode
of one person's bag...

326
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,090
before the second Room Search.

327
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,850
You can open it as many times
as you want.

328
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,020
- Can I open it?
- Yes.

329
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,190
You got a good benefit.

330
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,480
(Jeon So Min, the hacker)

331
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,060
- You got a good benefit.
- Then you can check...

332
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,330
- if the jewels are gone.
- Then...

333
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,720
do I get to open it
only before the second search?

334
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,340
That's when you will be given
the passcode,

335
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,990
and you can open the bag
as many times as you want.

336
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,730
- I can open it just once?
- You can open it more than once.

337
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,360
- She's asking too many questions.
- Exactly.

338
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,000
- I mean, the first search.
- She asked unnecessary questions.

339
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,040
- You didn't see her, did you?
- He's suspecting her.

340
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,450
- Her eyes looked like this.
- We're all acting like a detective.

341
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,550
- She could've waited.
- Exactly.

342
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,970
- She can ask him privately later.
- That was unnecessary.

343
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,080
That was unnecessary.

344
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,980
- But she didn't wait.
- I can't ask him privately.

345
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,350
That was unnecessary.

346
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,880
The security guard...

347
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,480
can check the photos of the person
of his choice.

348
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,590
Oh, is that so?

349
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,350
(Jong Kook can check the photos of
1 person before the 3rd trial.)

350
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,330
The photographer will decide
the time to take...

351
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,600
the third photos of everyone...

352
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,360
following the 10th and 20th
seconds during Room Search.

353
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,230
- Good. Okay.
- That'd be helpful.

354
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,100
(Haha will decide the time for
taking photos during Room Search.)

355
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,770
The judge will receive two
additional ballots from the start.

356
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,770
You can use them anytime
at the 2nd or 3rd trial.

357
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,350
(Ji Hyo has two additional ballots
that she can use anytime she wants.)

358
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,320
The audio engineer can put a mask
on one person of his choice...

359
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,010
to make that person stay silent
for three minutes in each round.

360
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,650
- What's that?
- For a talkative person.

361
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,480
- That won't be useful at all.
- It's like a penalty.

362
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,350
- It won't be useful.
- It's like a penalty.

363
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,930
(Se Chan can make 1 person
stay silent for 3 minutes.)

364
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,390
(Hacker, Interior Expert, Audio
Engineer, Headhunter, Detective)

365
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,600
(Photographer, Security Guard,
Prosecutor, Judge, Profiler)

366
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,310
Actually, the two guests were
watching you come in here.

367
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,310
Really?

368
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,440
We were watching you.

369
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,350
- On a monitor.
- They might have noticed something.

370
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,350
(The two guests were watching
the members on a monitor.)

371
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,580
There was no camera
when I got here.

372
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,580
So you've been watching them.
Given what you saw,

373
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,450
- Was anyone acting strange?
- is there anyone suspicious?

374
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,010
Of course,
they could be thieves too.

375
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,290
- They can give professional advice.
- We need an expert opinion.

376
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,060
- Please tell us.
- What do you think?

377
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,590
You go first, Detective Yoon.

378
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,390
They should know about
the members of Running Man.

379
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,800
Who was being strange?

380
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,960
(It's hard to tell because they've
never met the members before.)

381
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,220
Since you guys aren't
real criminals...

382
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,890
I guess there's a difference.

383
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,200
So it's hard to tell.

384
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,540
- Just tell us your hunch.
- You can't pick out the thieves.

385
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,630
What does your hunch say?

386
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,500
To be honest, I guess
she's the thief.

387
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,270
- So Min?
- So Min?

388
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,500
Why is that?

389
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,470
Because she was the first to arrive.

390
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,740
- She was the first to arrive.
- I got here first.

391
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,510
She's suspicious because
she was the first to arrive.

392
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,880
But she's too enthusiastic
in everything.

393
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,330
- She also came early the last time.
- She was the same the last time.

394
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,150
- I just came early...
- But she's being strange today.

395
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,720
- You think?
- She's making a strange face now.

396
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,490
Who do you think is a thief
considering their looks?

397
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,520
- What?
- Considering their physiognomy.

398
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,860
Their physiognomy?

399
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,400
He's not a physiognomist.
Why would you ask that?

400
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,840
That's ridiculous.

401
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,770
Detectives can tell.

402
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,870
It's not like he's a fortune teller.

403
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,550
Hey, detectives know
stuff like that.

404
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,140
I get that you're trying
to get your friend to talk.

405
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,180
- It's not like that.
- But he's a forensic expert.

406
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,920
Why would you make him
talk about his hunch?

407
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,290
Director Pyo, who do you think
is being suspicious now?

408
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,190
Like what Detective Yoon said,

409
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,800
So Min got here way too early.

410
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,600
What's wrong about coming early?

411
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,520
We just don't know
what you're like at other times.

412
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,100
I came an hour early last time.

413
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,700
So I came only 30 minutes
early this time.

414
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,730
Really?

415
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,130
She doesn't need
to make an excuse like that.

416
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,540
- Anyway...
- This is just the beginning.

417
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,230
- But she keeps making excuses.
- Do you think I'm the thief?

418
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,470
- Go ahead and say it.
- I knew it.

419
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,040
- I thought she was being strange.
- Just say it. Is it me?

420
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,810
- From the beginning.
- That's enough.

421
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,140
- She didn't think it was strange.
- Okay. I get it.

422
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,320
- All right. Fine.
- So she's flustered now.

423
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,850
- But the thing is...
- I want to secure my part here.

424
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,850
Listen.

425
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,850
Hang on. Are you doing this
to make a strong impression?

426
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,290
This is what we can see in a movie.

427
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,990
What are you talking about?

428
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,650
- Is he the thief?
- He might be the thief.

429
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,360
I don't even know what I'm like.

430
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,940
- We don't know him well.
- I don't know what I usually do.

431
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,340
- Actually, Director Pyo would...
- That was spontaneous.

432
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,570
- make a good thief.
- I know.

433
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,710
It would be fun that way.

434
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,080
- He can be a thief anytime.
- Who knows? He might be the thief.

435
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,370
Before you get changed,
we need the interior expert.

436
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,370
(Kwang Soo is an interior expert.)

437
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,050
We need you to mark the rooms
without showing it to others.

438
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,740
- Now?
- Yes.

439
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,950
And keep it to yourself.

440
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,250
According to his choice,
we will mark the rooms...

441
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,790
Room A and Room B.

442
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,520
And only one of them will have
the bags with real jewels.

443
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,670
(Once Kwang Soo makes his choice,)

444
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,040
(the bags will move accordingly
in each round.)

445
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,940
(Room A, Room B)

446
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,270
(He's not supposed to talk about
what he chose before the search.)

447
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,080
(Kwang Soo's choice will be shared
with the thieves in secret.)

448
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,870
Please go get changed then.

449
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,240
- All right.
- Let's go.

450
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,220
(Now they need to catch the thieves
who are here to steal the jewels.)

451
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,420
Just relax.

452
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,150
Are you sure you're
dressed as a headhunter?

453
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,350
Yes. I'm a headhunter.

454
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,930
Aren't you a waiter?

455
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,250
I'm not a waiter.

456
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,430
I'm a headhunter.

457
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,720
You look like a waiter
at a nightclub I used to frequent,

458
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,520
who went by the name Dandelion.

459
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,070
I almost shouted for a waiter.

460
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,000
I do look like Dandelion,
a famous waiter back in the days.

461
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,940
You should've gotten me
a decent outfit.

462
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,040
- Look at him.
- This is really lame.

463
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,940
- Isn't he a fisherman?
- I'm an interior expert,

464
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,580
- Isn't he a clerk at a supermarket?
- but I don't look like one.

465
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,250
- He looks like a fisherman.
- What?

466
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,640
I got one.

467
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,850
What's with Kwang Soo's outfit?

468
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,180
Before we start the mission,
you will do the first Room Search.

469
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,830
You'll get 70 seconds.

470
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,260
You will search in pairs
as the headhunter says.

471
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,100
You can talk with your partner...

472
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,460
and decide which room
you will enter.

473
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,120
The thieves already know
about the rooms.

474
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,860
Those who are not the thieves
can lift the bags to weigh them.

475
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,200
If someone moved the bags,
they might be different in weight.

476
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,930
Or you can look for ballots.

477
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,980
Now we want the headhunter
to decide the order.

478
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,550
Let me tell you one thing. I know
it's different in a variety shows.

479
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,550
But I tried to sort out
the occupations.

480
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,610
- That's great.
- Nice.

481
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,060
He's a real profiler.

482
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,950
If you were a thief, you'd pick an
occupation that makes stealing easy.

483
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,850
Or you'd pick something that
helps you to hide your identity.

484
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,830
An occupation that makes it
easy to conceal your identity.

485
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,300
And lastly, you'd pick an occupation
that can confuse the ruling.

486
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,310
Exactly.

487
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,340
If the two thieves
planned this together,

488
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,170
- they would've divided the jobs.
- I know.

489
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,280
And they would come early
to pick a good occupation.

490
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,480
This is what we should do
when we solve a case.

491
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,780
But we only talk about our facial
expressions and tones of voice.

492
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,680
It's just a mess.

493
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,060
I'm sure the thieves will
get caught today.

494
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,380
This is what we need to do.

495
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,450
(Now the headhunter needs
to pair them up.)

496
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,560
I don't think the order is important
in the beginning.

497
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,150
I just need to pair them up, right?

498
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,830
- You have to split up the thieves.
- Based on my hunch.

499
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,390
It's better
to let them work in a pair.

500
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,430
You think?

501
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,660
All right. So Min, who was
considered a suspect, will go first.

502
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,460
- I like that.
- And...

503
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,840
Ji Hyo is going with you.

504
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,900
- With Ji Hyo?
- Ji Hyo is your partner.

505
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,010
- Really?
- You two are a team.

506
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,940
It's not like he has
some special plan.

507
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,320
Did you pick them randomly?

508
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,820
- I have a plan.
- You do?

509
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,850
We have a detective
and a profiler here.

510
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,730
You should ask them
before making any decisions.

511
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,030
- He's right.
- I don't want to.

512
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,500
You should ask them for advice.

513
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,760
I have my own plans.

514
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,190
Why are you being so stubborn?

515
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,230
In the restroom, I heard you say,
"Seok Ho, just trust and follow me."

516
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,070
- What do you think you're doing?
- "Trust and follow me."

517
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,200
Seok Ho.

518
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,340
Who do you think are the thieves?

519
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,740
You don't think it's me, do you?

520
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,310
- No.
- Okay.

521
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,010
- He sounds tired.
- That doesn't sound sincere.

522
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,640
- He's right about that.
- He's tired of Suk Jin.

523
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,020
See? He's the best detective.

524
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,850
He just said it half-heartedly.

525
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,410
You two should go first. There are
two people who look relaxed today.

526
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,450
Who are they?

527
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,820
Se Chan and Jae Suk.

528
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,120
- You two will go together.
- Okay.

529
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,390
You two are a team. Seok Ho,
I'll get you an underling.

530
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,190
- Haha is going with you.
- Okay.

531
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,500
All right. So Min
and Ji Hyo will go first.

532
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,860
You should remember...

533
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,540
that Director Pyo will be
watching you search the room.

534
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,840
Is he watching the whole thing?

535
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,810
- Why don't you start?
- Go.

536
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,440
Please start.

537
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,380
Director Pyo, please go
to the monitoring room.

538
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,110
(The profiler is going
to the monitoring room.)

539
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,120
(He will be watching all the actions
and communications in real-time.)

540
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,260
This way.

541
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,850
(He will be watching all the actions
and communications in real-time.)

542
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,500
So Min, you were
the first one to come, so...

543
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,570
(The thieves and the interior expert
know the room with real jewels.)

544
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,540
I don't even care
about what they say now.

545
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,960
I just came early
to pick a good one.

546
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,510
And it wasn't even that early.

547
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,810
It was just 30 minutes early.

548
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,780
- Where should we go?
- These are Room A and Room B.

549
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,250
(They are standing
in front of the two rooms.)

550
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,580
- You...
- Either one will be fine.

551
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,640
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

552
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,850
Rock-paper-scissors.

553
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,750
(They play rock-paper-scissors
to pick a room.)

554
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,450
I want Room B.

555
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,560
(So Min picks Room B.)

556
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,060
- Room B?
- Do you want to change?

557
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,450
You seem quite confident.

558
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,260
Room B?

559
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,360
I'll do as you say.

560
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,300
- It doesn't matter.
- No. You won.

561
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,540
- You go in there.
- Okay.

562
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,600
I don't know anything about this.

563
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,310
Hang on. Does it start
as soon as I step in?

564
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,510
It starts as you step into the room.

565
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,810
We should hurry.

566
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:04,170
(They get only 70 seconds.)

567
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:09,790
(They have to find ballots
or steal jewels in the given time.)

568
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,710
There's nothing.

569
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,290
(They leave the rooms.)

570
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,450
Did you lift the bags?

571
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,950
No. I was looking for the ballots.

572
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,060
Did you find anything?

573
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,500
Is there only one ballot?

574
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,960
I found only one.

575
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,530
- Me too.
- I just touched it.

576
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,240
They're back.

577
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,190
The rooms have the same structure.

578
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,310
- What?
- That's right.

579
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,810
So Min, you have a weird look
on your face.

580
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,840
So Min, you're being
really strange today.

581
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,900
Director Pyo is watching you.

582
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,940
- You should remember that.
- Me?

583
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,870
- Next is me and the audio engineer.
- Is he watching me?

584
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,850
- Look at her smiling.
- Me and...

585
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,410
She's forcing a smile.

586
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,210
She's been like that the whole time.

587
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,320
- Really?
- This is what I'm talking about.

588
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,710
She's smiling.

589
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,490
Can he hear us talk
as we go into the room?

590
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,620
(Se Chan and Jae Suk
are next to go.)

591
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,330
You can choose the room you want.

592
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,960
- It doesn't matter for me.
- Either one will be fine.

593
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
I don't care either.

594
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,360
Okay. You passed my test.

595
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,070
Even if I was the thief,
I wouldn't have picked one.

596
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,580
- It's an amateur thing to do.
- That's what an amateur would do.

597
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,980
I want to choose Room A.

598
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,170
- You?
- Yes.

599
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,440
Okay. I'll go into Room A then.

600
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,850
- You are suspicious of me.
- Right.

601
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,520
- Then I'll go to Room B.
- Okay.

602
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,820
I'll go to Room B then.

603
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,910
- I'll choose Room A then.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

604
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,060
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

605
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,760
Okay. I choose Room A.

606
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Okay.

607
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,950
I'll go to Room B then.

608
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,060
(Se Chan searches Room A,
and Jae Suk searches Room B.)

609
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,600
There are bags.

610
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,740
There's nothing.
Did you find anything?

611
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,100
I knew it. I didn't find anything.

612
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,130
I found this.

613
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,700
Where do you want to go?

614
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,780
- Well, I...
- Whatever you want.

615
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,130
I'm fine with anything.

616
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,200
Just pick what you want.

617
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,250
Either one will be fine for me.

618
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,440
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Do as you like.

619
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,780
All right then.

620
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,210
- I'll search Room A.
- Room A?

621
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,320
- Yes.
- Okay.

622
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,750
- All right.
- Please go ahead.

623
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,650
I guess the thief will choose
the room with real jewels.

624
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,060
- I think so.
- Okay.

625
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,290
All right.

626
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,450
I should find ballots.

627
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,330
(Haha and Detective Yoon
are done searching the rooms.)

628
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,360
Which one?

629
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,960
We should check the bags first.

630
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,500
Room A and B.

631
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,010
(Kwang Soo knows which one
is the room with real jewels.)

632
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,810
You can pick the room you want.

633
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,370
I'll go into Room A.

634
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,850
Room A has real jewels.

635
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,940
Actually, it doesn't matter
which room I go into.

636
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,610
We should do this for the cause.

637
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,910
- You're not the thief.
- I'm not the thief,

638
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,350
so I don't need to go
into the room with real jewels.

639
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,350
The ballots are hidden
in both rooms anyway.

640
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,380
All right.

641
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,620
Kwang Soo.

642
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,890
(Room B: So Min, Jae Suk,
Jong Kook, Haha, and Suk Jin)

643
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,770
(Room A: Ji Hyo, Se Chan,
Chang Won, Seok Ho, Kwang Soo)

644
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,890
Se Chan who had been quiet
turned out to be a thief last time.

645
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,460
- Yes, he was so quiet.
- And you know that, right?

646
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,840
Also, when Jong Kook takes you
under his wing, you'd be so happy.

647
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,170
The moment he picks you
as his partner, the game is over.

648
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,170
You wouldn't have to do anything.

649
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,020
That's why Jong Kook would
never get caught...

650
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,820
- if he were a thief.
- I would never get caught.

651
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,710
It was the same for Suk Jin.

652
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,880
He stayed right by my side,

653
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,290
- acting as my right-hand man.
- It was so great.

654
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,590
- I'm sitting too far...
- It was so great.

655
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,760
- away from him.
- Hurry up and sit next to him.

656
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,530
I sat too far away from him.
This is so annoying.

657
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,730
So Min, go back to your seat.
You see,

658
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,360
criminals tend to sit at the end.

659
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,630
But listen, Jong Kook.

660
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,270
- Whenever we gather around,
- For a psychological reason,

661
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,770
- I sit around the end.
- they don't sit in the center.

662
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,580
- So Min, it's you today.
- But you've never sat at the end.

663
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,100
(Swearing)

664
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,170
The detective got surprised.

665
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,280
- Detective Yoon is shocked.
- My gosh.

666
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,590
(The quick-tempered So Min surprised
even a violent crimes detective.)

667
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,180
- Almost everyone is here now.
- Do you know how I felt?

668
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,790
- You brat.
- I'm so frustrated.

669
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,180
Director Pyo wrote down
so many things.

670
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,730
- I've been observing all of you.
- Our behaviors?

671
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,730
I'll give you some tips.
Let me organize my thoughts first.

672
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,730
- He's amazing.
- That's good.

673
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,270
- He's a real profiler.
- Exactly.

674
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,190
We need to know which room
has the real jewels.

675
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,040
- That's the biggest issue we have.
- That's right.

676
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,010
- And the thieves know.
- Yes.

677
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,400
- So they probably...
- I also know which room has.

678
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,810
- tried to pick the right room.
- Absolutely.

679
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,750
So Min and Ji Hyo said
they didn't care...

680
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,910
about which room they'd go into,
but they played rock-paper-scissors.

681
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,710
- So Min won and picked Room B.
- Yes.

682
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,880
(The scientific investigation based
on facts is used on Running Man.)

683
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,150
- Please remember this. And third...
- Okay.

684
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:14,300
As for Kwang Soo and Suk Jin...

685
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,530
They fought to go into Room A.

686
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,390
Both of them wanted to enter Room A?

687
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,190
- Did they fight?
- Yes.

688
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,430
In the end, Kwang Soo
went into Room A,

689
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,540
and Suk Jin entered Room B.

690
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,540
- It seems that Room A...
- I will...

691
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,600
I will give you an important hint.

692
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,780
Okay. Go ahead.

693
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,520
Who was suspected the most
in the beginning?

694
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,680
- It was So Min, right?
- So Min.

695
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,440
- So Min is not the thief.
- Why?

696
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,790
- Kwang Soo decided on the rooms.
- Yes.

697
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,180
So he knew which room had
the real jewels.

698
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,290
And he wanted to go into Room A.

699
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,690
- But I didn't have to...
- Then why did she pick Room B...

700
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,690
when she won the game?

701
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,730
- Maybe it was to confuse us.
- Exactly.

702
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,030
- I think...
- Because she was cornered.

703
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,390
Suk Jin is trying to help So Min...

704
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,930
be freed from suspicion.

705
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,100
- But that wasn't so convincing.
- Are you defending her?

706
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,040
It just doesn't make any sense.

707
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,200
If you were a thief, wouldn't you
want to go into the real room?

708
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,780
You know which room is the real one.

709
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,980
- Since there are two thieves,
- To be honest...

710
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,790
maybe she let the other thief
search the real room.

711
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,110
- That's right.
- That's what Kwang Soo did.

712
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,610
Right. She must've been flustered
because she was suspected.

713
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,530
It would be the scariest...

714
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,650
- if Director Pyo is a thief,
- Indeed.

715
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,500
or if Detective Yoon
who has been quiet is a thief.

716
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,690
If the interior expert is a thief,

717
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,000
- that would cause great confusion.
- Exactly.

718
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,690
He must've picked the wrong room
on purpose.

719
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,040
Gosh. I really don't know
who are the thieves now.

720
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,200
It's hard.

721
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,170
I have no idea except for So Min.

722
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,200
(Not again.)

723
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,170
Gosh, you. Haha, stop it.

724
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,870
I think we should get rid of So Min
since we all think she's a thief.

725
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,350
- I'm the prosecutor, right?
- Yes.

726
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,760
I'll put her on the first trial
no matter what.

727
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,150
(I'm the prosecutor, right?
I'll put her on the first trial.)

728
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,990
- I'm the thief. Put me on trial.
- I mean it.

729
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,090
I'm the thief. Put me on trial.

730
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,120
- All right. Go back to your seat.
- Put me on trial.

731
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,030
So Min seems excited although
she's acting like she's upset.

732
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,600
She's enjoying this situation.

733
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,690
- I don't think she's a thief.
- She likes getting attention.

734
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,660
Detective Yoon, would you like to
share your opinion?

735
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,890
He has a keen eye.

736
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,010
Usually, thieves... You know...

737
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,310
Listen to his voice.

738
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,580
(Usually, thieves... Well...)

739
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,080
(He gives off his charisma
as a detective.)

740
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,750
- The tone of his voice...
- It's so scary.

741
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,850
- I'm so scared.
- It makes it feel realistic.

742
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,780
- It makes it feel realistic.
- I'm scared.

743
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,380
I peed my pants.

744
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,750
Exactly.

745
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,020
- Please continue.
- The thieves might just confess.

746
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,180
I bet the thieves are
shuddering now.

747
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,530
Before national holidays
or before they steal from houses,

748
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,850
"Before they steal"?

749
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,530
thieves go around
in a residential area.

750
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,300
They check if there are any CCTVs,

751
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,070
- and where they are,
- Really?

752
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,100
and if the lights are on or off
for a few days in a row.

753
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,130
- After checking everything,
- Yes.

754
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,810
they start making their moves.

755
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,140
- So the two of them...
- Kwang Soo and Jong Kook?

756
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,680
One of them could've been hired
as insiders.

757
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,880
I see.

758
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,090
- You see... How should I put it?
- Because of their occupations.

759
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,090
- His job is useful for theft.
- That's true.

760
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,680
- The interior expert.
- But as you all know,

761
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,150
the thieves know which room
has the real jewels.

762
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,800
If I were a thief,

763
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,390
I wouldn't have chosen to be
the interior expert...

764
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,890
- You're trying to avoid suspicion.
- That also...

765
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,010
- makes sense.
- Okay. I'll cover his mouth.

766
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,930
(I will cover his mouth!)

767
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,310
- Hey, wait.
- No.

768
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,780
- Hear me out.
- No.

769
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,050
Wait. You should...

770
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,550
- Hear me out, please.
- That vile mouth of his.

771
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,780
- I'll cover it with this mask.
- No, wait. Hear me out.

772
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,250
- All right. Good.
- I don't want to hear him anymore.

773
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,550
- Good job.
- I'm glad you did that.

774
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,880
- Good job.
- Good job, Se Chan.

775
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,180
Fisherman, please be quiet
for the meantime.

776
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,730
Secondly, what if...

777
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,760
A thief should not get caught
after stealing jewels.

778
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,800
- Yes.
- To avoid getting caught...

779
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,390
In my opinion, the hacker...

780
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,360
She can find out the passcode
of a suspicious person's bag.

781
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,270
And she can see if that person is
the thief or not right away.

782
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,630
- That's right.
- So she couldn't let anyone...

783
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,310
- get her job.
- Absolutely.

784
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,750
We can ask the hacker
to check if a suspicious person...

785
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,410
- is the thief or not.
- That's right.

786
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,170
I can't stop thinking about
what Jae Suk said earlier.

787
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,490
Did you arrive earlier
than Jae Suk?

788
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,380
(Did you arrive earlier
than Jae Suk?)

789
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,920
- He can't speak right now.
- Oh, right.

790
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,800
- Three minutes haven't passed yet.
- But he can nod instead.

791
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,450
- He can use body language.
- I put the mask on him.

792
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,500
Tell us.
Out of all the great jobs...

793
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,390
I can't forget
what Jae Suk said.

794
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,160
Why did you pick the interior expert
out of all the great jobs?

795
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,360
You could've chosen the headhunter
or the security guard.

796
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,700
- You chose it first.
- Did I?

797
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,040
- He didn't know what it is.
- Really?

798
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,370
(I didn't know
what headhunter does.)

799
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,940
- Good. You can interpret for us.
- Okay.

800
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,280
Great. Now, we have an interpreter.
He didn't know what it is?

801
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,990
That's right. He thought...

802
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,790
a headhunter meant a hairdresser.

803
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,180
- He thought it was a hairdresser.
- Because it has the word "head"?

804
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,760
- Cutting hair.
- I get it now.

805
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,290
- Okay. Thanks.
- Okay.

806
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,350
- That's so funny.
- He thought it was a hairdresser.

807
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,890
Before we begin the first mission,

808
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,300
the photographer can decide
which time can be revealed.

809
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,460
We took photos of you in the rooms
at every second.

810
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,900
- I see.
- As for the last place team,

811
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,630
the photos that were taken
at the 10th, 20th seconds,

812
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,370
and the time
chosen by the photographer.

813
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,110
As for the 3rd place team, only
the 1st 2 photos will be revealed.

814
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,820
Photographer, please tell us
the time you want now.

815
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,990
- The photos of a suspicious person.
- When would be the best?

816
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,260
- Please tell us.
- They must've been more active...

817
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,180
at a later time after pretending
to search at first.

818
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,730
But if the photographer
can decide the time,

819
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,190
he can avoid doing
a certain action at the time.

820
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,600
You have a point.
Because he knew he'd decide it.

821
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,730
- Okay. That's true.
- He could've avoided the time.

822
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,840
Hold on a second.

823
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,300
(Hold on a second!)

824
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,270
One of the strangest things
I've seen today is...

825
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,630
- Go ahead. Tell us.
- I was the fourth to arrive.

826
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,630
- Okay.
- He looks at me while speaking.

827
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,010
But no one had picked
the prosecutor and the judge.

828
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,310
- That's weird.
- That's right.

829
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,550
- What?
- No one had chosen those roles.

830
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,080
It would have been only natural...

831
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,090
if the two roles had been chosen.

832
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:42,020
That means 1 of the 3 people
who arrived before me...

833
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,880
- is one of the thieves.
- That's possible.

834
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,380
- I agree.
- Okay.

835
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,030
- I won't argue with that either.
- Who arrived before you did?

836
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,530
But I'll tell you what we said
before you came.

837
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,300
As Detective Yoon and Director Pyo
must've heard us,

838
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,770
we said, "The prosecutor and judge
won't be helpful."

839
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,930
We didn't want to be
the prosecutor or the judge.

840
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,770
We thought the roles
wouldn't have much power.

841
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,810
- We decided not to choose them.
- Yes, we did.

842
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,870
- Se Chan said it first.
- It's because last time...

843
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,670
If you think that way, everyone is
suspicious... What are you doing?

844
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,370
(What are you doing?)

845
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,980
- That's great.
- He wants you to shut your mouth.

846
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,020
I want you to shut your mouth.
Just shut it.

847
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,820
- When I was an insurance agent,
- Jae Suk.

848
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,450
my superior used to
harass me like this,

849
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,350
- so I hated my job.
- You know what you put me through.

850
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,560
It's so strange
that the photographer...

851
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,350
Please make your decision now.
Kwang Soo, your time's up.

852
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,350
(Please make your decision now.
Kwang Soo, your time's up.)

853
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,120
This is so fun.
Let's do this more often.

854
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,840
- Who could be the thieves?
- I feel like I became ill.

855
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,630
I felt so frustrated. I hadn't
felt that way in a long time.

856
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,630
I bet he was dying to speak again.

857
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,510
What time will you choose?

858
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,200
I think you should pick
a later time.

859
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,310
I'll pick...

860
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,320
- the 45th second.
- The 45th second?

861
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,440
Let's think about
the time again later.

862
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,380
According to the result
of the mission we'll begin now...

863
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,490
You'll pair up with the same person
for the mission.

864
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,790
Three photos of the members
of the last place team...

865
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,690
- will be revealed to everyone.
- All right.

866
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,190
- The last place team.
- And two photos of the members...

867
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,190
of the fourth place team
will be revealed to everyone.

868
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,390
- Okay.
- Okay.

869
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,500
Here's your first mission.

870
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,600
You have to find someone on set
with a composite sketch you draw.

871
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,360
It's Composite Sketch Operation.

872
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,580
What's that?

873
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,630
You'll play the game
with the same partner.

874
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,750
One has to complete
a composite sketch...

875
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,210
through an interview
with a staff member.

876
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,750
The other has to find the person
using the composite sketch...

877
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,180
wearing headphones
once the sketch is done.

878
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,520
2 photos of the 4th place team...

879
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,990
and 3 photos of the 5th place team
will be revealed.

880
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,150
- Okay.
- This is a very important mission.

881
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,300
Please sit with your partner,

882
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,390
and decide who will draw the sketch
in the first round.

883
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,600
- Okay. Detective Yoon, please come.
- Please come here, Prosecutor Yu.

884
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,360
Take turns to ask questions to me.
Each team has two questions.

885
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,810
Starting with a question
about the gender.

886
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,310
You can't ask about the gender. I'll
only tell you about the appearance.

887
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,780
- Okay.
- It's one of the people here?

888
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,250
Correct. And the photo was taken...

889
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,670
- this morning.
- This morning?

890
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,750
- But they're all wearing a mask.
- All of them?

891
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,140
They will pull down the mask
when you approach them.

892
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,290
- Just for a moment.
- I see. Okay.

893
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,680
I'm very good at drawing
this kind of drawing.

894
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,910
- Jae Suk's team is done for.
- We can do this.

895
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,350
He's lousy at drawing.

896
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,490
Starting with So Min,
you may start asking questions.

897
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:04,230
What fruit would you compare
to this person's face shape?

898
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,730
(A fruit shape?)

899
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,740
- Please compare it to a fruit.
- That's a weird question.

900
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,840
Compare the face shape to a fruit?

901
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,160
She could've just asked,
"Please describe the face shape."

902
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,740
Whether it's long or round.

903
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,480
- But if it's compared to a fruit,
- Or if it's a square face.

904
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,630
If it's compared to a fruit,
it will be more accurate.

905
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,580
A wide and flat mango.

906
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,780
- A wide and flat mango?
- A wide mango.

907
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,880
- Okay. See? It's more accurate.
- I don't know how a mango looks.

908
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,820
- Hold on. A wide mango?
- A wide and flat mango.

909
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,490
The question was wrong.

910
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,180
- I'll draw it just as I heard.
- A wide and flat mango?

911
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,100
- Okay.
- A wide and flat mango.

912
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,270
A wide and flat mango?

913
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,460
How big are the eyes?

914
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,430
Somewhat large.

915
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,500
Somewhat large?

916
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,600
(Face: A wide and flat mango,
Eyes: Somewhat large)

917
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,630
A wide and flat mango?

918
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,360
Wide and flat?

919
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,980
(Who can it be?)

920
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,600
A wide and flat mango.

921
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,700
Next question, please.

922
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,870
Please describe the eyebrows.

923
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,050
The eyebrows...

924
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,940
They're quite bushy.

925
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,590
- Bushy.
- Bushy eyebrows.

926
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,760
- A little bushy.
- Bushy?

927
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,190
- Let me ask an important one.
- Large eyes.

928
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,030
Does this person wear glasses?

929
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,070
No, no glasses.

930
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,190
(Kwang Soo's composite sketch)

931
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,940
- I'll ask an important one.
- Sure.

932
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,610
Does this person have on makeup?

933
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,080
- Makeup? A little, I think.
- Okay.

934
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,480
- That indicates a woman.
- It must be a woman.

935
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,650
Hold on. That changes everything.

936
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,710
So Min, you're up.

937
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,110
This is called the top zone,

938
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,020
the middle zone,
and the bottom zone.

939
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,960
Is this person's bottom zone
on the longer side?

940
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,110
What's the bottom zone?

941
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,360
Is the mouth situated
toward the center or the chin?

942
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,690
What kind of question is that?

943
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,920
You call that a question?

944
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,000
You already asked.

945
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,170
- The mouth is close to the chin.
- I mean...

946
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,560
What kind of question is that?

947
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,000
She must desperately want
to be suspected as the thief.

948
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,710
Why not ask about the nose instead?

949
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,940
- Let's move on.
- Jae Suk?

950
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,710
- Tell us about the hair.
- What was her question?

951
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,270
The hair...

952
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,940
This person has bangs,
and the hair is shoulder-length.

953
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,080
Jong Kook?

954
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,380
Tell us about the nose.

955
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,810
How about the nostrils?

956
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,580
The nose bridge is high.

957
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,480
It's on the higher side?

958
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,380
Is the mouth big or small?

959
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,830
- I think it's small.
- I did a good job then.

960
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,830
- Small?
- A small mouth?

961
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,900
To me, it is.

962
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,290
Is it closer to
the center of the face or not?

963
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,400
Why is she so bad
at asking these questions?

964
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,500
- Some are closer to the nose.
- So Min is...

965
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,130
the thief which is why...

966
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,000
She's making it seem too obvious.

967
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,330
How else can I sketch properly?

968
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,400
We need to know...

969
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,440
- if this person has a long chin.
- Haha?

970
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,150
- Is there a mole on the face?
- Yes.

971
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,400
- A mole on the face?
- That's what I said.

972
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,940
I know that there's a mole,

973
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,420
- but where exactly?
- You have five seconds.

974
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,580
- Where is the mole?
- 5, 4,

975
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,020
- 3, 2, 1.
- I think I know who it is.

976
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,360
Put this sticker on that person.

977
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,980
- Go ahead.
- I don't know where the mole is.

978
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,250
- Hurry.
- Hurry. You need to get going.

979
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,960
- How is this supposed to be done?
- Take the sticker.

980
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,100
- Come on.
- Who on earth is this?

981
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,290
Here's the sticker.

982
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,360
Are you okay?

983
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,630
- Hold on.
- Over here.

984
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,860
There's a mole.

985
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,940
- Wait.
- Hold on.

986
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,000
(Jae Suk's composite sketch)

987
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,830
(She looks like the sketch.)

988
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,610
Is it you? Okay, hold on.

989
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Here.

990
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,400
Is it Yoo Ri?

991
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,080
It looks just like her!

992
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,670
This person has big eyes.

993
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,520
(Does she look like the sketch?)

994
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,540
She looks like it.

995
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,150
- See?
- What's this?

996
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,380
- What on earth is this?
- I found her.

997
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,480
Min Hee?

998
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,150
- I think you're right.
- Right?

999
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,380
Perfect, right?

1000
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,100
- You're right.
- It's Min Hee.

1001
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,460
- He's right.
- It's Min Hee.

1002
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,400
I drew Min Hee, didn't I?

1003
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,560
That staff member though...

1004
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,060
- Right.
- See?

1005
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,830
- She looks like the sketch too.
- A wide and flat mango.

1006
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,710
I didn't think that a face
that had the shape...

1007
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,500
of a wide and flat mango made sense,

1008
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,670
but that's all I could see.

1009
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,250
- Guys...
- She has a mole there.

1010
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,500
Let me reveal the answer.

1011
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,540
Someone got it right.

1012
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,770
- What?
- Really?

1013
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,380
The answer is...

1014
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,110
Just know that I kept it
as objective as possible.

1015
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,060
The answer is...

1016
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,210
(Who was he describing?)

1017
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,380
Min Hee.

1018
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,150
This is amazing!

1019
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,330
- Hey...
- This is what I had to go on.

1020
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,750
- I mean...
- Based on this...

1021
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,020
- How did you figure it out?
- Jae Suk,

1022
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,440
- she immediately came into my view.
- Jae Suk.

1023
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,270
- How did you know?
- Look at my sketch.

1024
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,270
It looks exactly the same.

1025
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,540
Yours looks just like her.

1026
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,540
- It looks just like you.
- It looks like Min Hee.

1027
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,670
Mine too.

1028
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,610
(Kwang Soo's sketch?
She refuses to agree.)

1029
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,650
A wide and flat mango.
That was a perfect description.

1030
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,610
Anyone can tell
that this is Min Hee.

1031
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,880
- You have great teamwork.
- Nice.

1032
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,920
I have received the photo
of the next staff member.

1033
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,360
We'll start with Ji Hyo.

1034
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,080
Tell us about the shape of the face.

1035
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,960
It's on the slimmer side.

1036
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,230
(Face: On the slimmer side)

1037
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,460
- Okay.
- Is it my turn then?

1038
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,400
Does this person
have double eyelids?

1039
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,400
Yes.

1040
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,520
- Double eyelids?
- Yes.

1041
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,830
(Face: On the slimmer side,
Eyes: Double eyelids)

1042
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,360
- Go ahead and draw.
- Does this person have long hair?

1043
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,670
- Go ahead.
- How long is it?

1044
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,540
- The hair...
- It's on the shorter side.

1045
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,040
- The shorter side?
- This person has short hair.

1046
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,880
- Short hair?
- It's on the shorter side.

1047
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,210
- Then it's a guy.
- Is the mouth big or small?

1048
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,250
I'd say average.

1049
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,480
Does this person have a long nose?

1050
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,080
It's not short,

1051
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,710
but it's also not long.

1052
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,650
This is someone's foot, not a nose.

1053
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,360
Does this person have big eyes?

1054
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,380
There are double eyelids, so yes.

1055
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,600
But they're not huge.

1056
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,830
Everything about this person
is average.

1057
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,770
- Does this person wear glasses?
- No.

1058
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,360
All right.

1059
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,440
- 5, 4...
- Do we get going?

1060
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,000
- 3, 2...
- Is that it?

1061
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,810
- Who on earth is this?
- One.

1062
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,480
How am I supposed to find
anyone with this?

1063
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,480
(Detective Yoon's
mediocre drawing skills)

1064
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,480
- Can you believe it?
- What on earth is this?

1065
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,810
- How is this a good enough sketch?
- This isn't enough.

1066
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,880
No one that looks like this exists.

1067
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,150
- We should hurry.
- This can't be a person.

1068
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,650
Where is a guy that looks like this?

1069
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,520
(I've never seen a person
with this face before.)

1070
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,230
Does this person even exist?

1071
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,630
- I mean...
- Jae Suk, use your sharp eyes.

1072
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,960
Yes, he looks like the drawing.

1073
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,170
(Jong Kook already
brought someone over.)

1074
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,270
This hair can be called short.

1075
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,960
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo...)

1076
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,810
(He spots someone.)

1077
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,000
This guy... What?

1078
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,880
It's like his photo.

1079
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,480
I have his photo!

1080
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,170
(He looks exactly like the drawing.)

1081
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,750
I didn't think this person exists,
but this was a photo of him!

1082
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,540
(Beware: It's not a photo.)

1083
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,710
(The drawing looks
exactly like him.)

1084
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,040
Can you believe it?

1085
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,290
(Cho Sung Oh, cameraman)

1086
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,060
I can't believe you took
a photo of him.

1087
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,810
- It's you.
- No, this one looks like you.

1088
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,190
- He was here.
- You were here all along.

1089
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,500
Look at this!

1090
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,520
(He has the face
that fits all composite sketches.)

1091
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,330
- This looks like you too.
- I found you!

1092
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,520
- I must be gifted in this field.
- I can't find one.

1093
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,040
But he doesn't have double eyelids.

1094
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,440
- He does.
- He has them.

1095
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,900
Can it be one of us?

1096
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,210
It can be anyone in this auditorium.

1097
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,270
- It could be Detective Yoon.
- You're right.

1098
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,850
Kwang Soo found
the perfect person though.

1099
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,420
Can you believe it?

1100
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,690
They look the same!

1101
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,850
I thought it was him at first too.

1102
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,610
- Guys...
- Did someone get it right?

1103
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,110
Yes, someone got it right.

1104
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,190
- What?
- Really?

1105
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,190
It must be Detective Yoon.

1106
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,250
The answer is...

1107
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,020
(Detective Yoon?)

1108
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,920
(Or the cameraman
who had his photo taken?)

1109
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,400
It's Na Dong Geun.

1110
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,730
(Chang Won and Jong Kook
got it right.)

1111
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,060
I knew it.

1112
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,940
- What did I tell you?
- But...

1113
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,170
I had to give up though.

1114
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,480
(That's too bad.)

1115
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,610
I said it was him.

1116
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,270
How can one find
the right person with this?

1117
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,480
I knew it almost immediately.

1118
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,770
He was right there.

1119
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,710
(Chang Won and Jong Kook
score a point.)

1120
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,080
- Shall we begin?
- Yes, ask away.

1121
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,080
Please describe the face again...

1122
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,520
in the shape of a fruit.

1123
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,690
That turned out...

1124
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,830
- to be a smart question.
- Right?

1125
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,130
- It gives you the shape.
- The shape of the face?

1126
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,560
- All the way up to the head.
- Well,

1127
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,000
it's like...

1128
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,500
a rotten zucchini.

1129
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,940
(Hesitant)

1130
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,110
A rotten zucchini?

1131
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,230
Come on.

1132
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,230
We'll feel bad about
guessing who it is.

1133
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,710
A rotten zucchini?

1134
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,310
It's not completely rotten,

1135
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,940
- but...
- Only a bit?

1136
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,880
- A wilted zucchini.
- Something like this?

1137
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,580
One that's about 15 days
past its expiration date.

1138
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,520
- Is that a radish?
- What about the hair?

1139
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,540
Near shoulder-length.

1140
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,380
Near shoulder-length?

1141
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,290
- Next?
- Are there bangs?

1142
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,650
Kwang Soo?

1143
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,250
(Jae Suk's, Kwang Soo's,
Chang Won's)

1144
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,830
Are the eyes small or big?

1145
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,400
They're on the bigger side.

1146
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,100
- Haha?
- A rotten zucchini?

1147
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,290
The eyes are big and...

1148
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,270
- What about the eyelids?
- Tell us about the nose.

1149
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,610
The bridge is high...

1150
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,400
and on the long side.

1151
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,580
- Really?
- Yes.

1152
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,980
(So Min's, Chang Won's)

1153
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,750
- Jae Suk?
- What about the mouth?

1154
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,350
Is it large?

1155
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,020
The mouth...

1156
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,880
I guess it's not small.

1157
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,380
- This one's difficult.
- Director Pyo?

1158
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,810
- I'm clueless right now.
- Does this person have makeup on?

1159
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,730
Yes, a bit.

1160
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,020
The nose is long.

1161
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,600
If there's a mole,
tell us where it is.

1162
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,790
There seems to be a mole,

1163
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,860
but I can't tell from the photo.

1164
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,400
So it's not a big mole.

1165
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,810
No big ones.

1166
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,460
5, 4,

1167
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,830
3, 2, 1.

1168
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,210
Does a person like this exist?

1169
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,880
What now?

1170
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,150
Hold on.
Go and look for this person.

1171
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,480
- Unbelievable.
- Me?

1172
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,920
- Wait.
- Is this even human?

1173
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,920
I think I saw this character
in a film.

1174
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,150
Look and you'll find.

1175
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,860
- Who can this be?
- Look and you'll find.

1176
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,880
("Rotten Zucchini" by Lee Kwang Soo)

1177
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,310
This actually looks like her!

1178
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,980
- It does.
- This is you.

1179
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,100
- I think it's you.
- Me too.

1180
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,600
Wait, you resemble
this drawing the most.

1181
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,420
The detective already
put a sticker on me.

1182
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,330
- It's you.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1183
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,830
- I can't believe it.
- You will find the right person.

1184
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,810
There's no one here
that looks like this.

1185
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,000
Why does she look like the drawing?

1186
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,580
She does, right?

1187
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,170
Why does it look like her?

1188
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,610
I can't find anyone.

1189
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,480
- Just bring over anyone.
- I can't find anyone.

1190
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,670
Go ahead
and compare it to the photo.

1191
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,750
Honestly,

1192
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,790
this has to be Kwang Soo.

1193
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,110
- It's him.
- No way. That's insane.

1194
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,690
- You're right.
- How is this not him?

1195
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,110
I drew exactly what I heard.

1196
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,380
- Are the eyes big?
- That's you.

1197
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,790
Someone found...

1198
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,560
- Really?
- the right person.

1199
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
- Seriously?
- I knew it!

1200
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,920
From the start though,
Detective Yoon came to me...

1201
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,270
searching for a rotten zucchini.

1202
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,560
(A rotten zucchini)

1203
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,770
- Who said that?
- Detective Yoon!

1204
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,900
- Really?
- For real?

1205
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,400
He then twisted my arm
to bring me over.

1206
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,610
- Really?
- Yes!

1207
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,810
I'm amazed that
there's a right answer here.

1208
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,400
The answer to Round Three is...

1209
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,580
(Who has the right answer?)

1210
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,940
Interior Expert Lee Kwang Soo.

1211
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,980
Nice!

1212
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,610
- See what I mean?
- I knew it wasn't you.

1213
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,210
- Just look at this.
- It's Kwang Soo.

1214
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,150
The 2 teams
who failed all 3 rounds...

1215
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,360
are in 4th and 5th place.

1216
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,230
Since Suk Jin and Kwang Soo
couldn't submit the final answer,

1217
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,830
they'll be in 5th place.

1218
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,560
So Min and Ji Hyo are in 4th place.

1219
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,400
We'll get to see their photos then.

1220
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,000
You'll be able to see...

1221
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,040
their photos
at the 10-second mark...

1222
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,710
- and the 20-second mark.
- It's okay.

1223
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,670
And with Suk Jin and Kwang Soo,

1224
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,610
you'll see their photos
at the 10, 20,

1225
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,170
and 45-second mark.

1226
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,750
Please bring them in.

1227
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,290
There's nothing to see in my case.

1228
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,580
(The photos will help them
catch the thief.)

1229
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,750
There really can't be anything.

1230
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,880
(Thief Investigation Log:
Room Search 1)

1231
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,960
Before you look at the photos,

1232
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:38,020
I will reveal how many jewels were
stolen during the first room search.

1233
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,190
So they're going to reveal this.

1234
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,130
The number of jewels that
the thieves stole...

1235
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,270
is a total of...

1236
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,110
(The number of jewels that
the thieves stole is...)

1237
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,130
zero jewels.

1238
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,380
- Right.
- Really?

1239
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,110
(The thieves weren't active.)

1240
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,440
- They didn't do anything.
- It's hard in the beginning.

1241
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,920
They didn't go into that room.

1242
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,020
Take a look at the pictures
and talk among yourselves.

1243
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,520
Afterward, the detective will choose
one person and interrogate them.

1244
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,380
Which room is the real room?

1245
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,360
Jeon So Min is making it...

1246
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,730
a point to not go near the bag.

1247
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:11,560
- I went near it.
- Is it because I'm suspicious?

1248
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,770
She's not here or there.

1249
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,130
- It's not that...
- So Min.

1250
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,440
Look. This is what I did.

1251
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,730
I went in and looked around.

1252
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,230
(So Min claims the photo was taken
after she looked at the bag.)

1253
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,610
I noticed the bag and touched it.

1254
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,210
Then I went to look over here.

1255
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:26,080
When you look at Kwang Soo's angle,

1256
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,850
doesn't it look like he's opening
something? He's tall.

1257
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,310
This angle is of him
opening something.

1258
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,690
I think he's just checking.

1259
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,790
Is he checking to see
if it's right or wrong?

1260
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,210
- He checked it.
- I didn't open it.

1261
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,690
- So were you checking it?
- I was checking to see...

1262
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:39,080
if there was one where
the passcode was moved a lot.

1263
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,400
I'm sorry, but Suk Jin's angle
also looks like he's opening it.

1264
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,650
- Me?
- Kwang Soo...

1265
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:43,960
- At 20 seconds.
- This one?

1266
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,230
- We need to choose one person.
- Do you think it's them?

1267
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,230
At this angle?

1268
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,230
I think Suk Jin is the one
who is pairing up with someone.

1269
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,630
No, not that.

1270
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,040
We can choose this person now,
and then...

1271
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,770
- Detective Yoon and Director Pyo...
- Oh, their role?

1272
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,110
are deep in conversation.

1273
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,040
- They're so serious.
- I think it's because of this.

1274
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,110
It's like a documentary over here.

1275
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,420
- Kwang Soo, why did you...
- It's meaningless.

1276
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,350
put all the bags on top?

1277
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,540
I didn't put them up.
They were already up.

1278
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,210
It was already like this.

1279
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,560
You went into Room B.

1280
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,860
- Kwang Soo went into Room A.
- I went into Room A.

1281
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,630
- Who went into Room A?
- Right.

1282
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,560
- Someone touched the evidence.
- Did you go in there?

1283
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,600
(Did Kwang Soo
turn all the bags up?)

1284
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,900
First, based on these pictures,

1285
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,040
Kwang Soo is the only one
who is acting suspiciously.

1286
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,230
- Why?
- All the bags were lying down.

1287
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,360
(Every bag was lying down, but in
Kwang Soo's turn, they weren't.)

1288
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,810
So why were they all up
when Kwang Soo entered the room?

1289
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,480
I can tell you why.

1290
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,270
I didn't turn them up.

1291
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,440
- Really?
- When I went in,

1292
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,610
- the bags were already like that.
- Were they?

1293
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,080
Yes. Then Detective Yoon...

1294
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,150
(Kwang Soo claims that someone else
moved the bags.)

1295
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,440
- Among the two of us?
- Yes.

1296
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,310
I turned them up.

1297
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,880
(What?)

1298
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,920
You did?

1299
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,250
(After everyone suspected Kwang Soo,
Detective Yoon came forward.)

1300
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,690
- Director Pyo...
- You did?

1301
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,020
- Why did you do that?
- Why?

1302
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,250
Why didn't you say anything before?

1303
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,730
- Why didn't you say anything?
- You touched the evidence.

1304
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,290
I thought I wasn't allowed
to say anything.

1305
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,170
But everyone was blaming
Kwang Soo for it.

1306
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,770
I wanted to feel how heavy
they were, so I picked them up.

1307
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,310
Why didn't you say anything when
everyone was blaming Kwang Soo?

1308
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,250
My gosh. Jong Kook acts like this
to a detective too.

1309
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,270
He does this to a detective too.

1310
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:09,670
Why are you interrogating
a detective?

1311
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,350
Detective Yoon. You can choose one
person you think is suspicious...

1312
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,310
and interrogate him or her.
Whom do you choose?

1313
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,730
Isn't Detective Yoon the person
whom everyone is suspecting?

1314
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,080
He should bring a mirror in
with him.

1315
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,830
I want Detective Yoon to
take Jong Kook in and say,

1316
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,270
"You need to keep your mouth shut."

1317
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:28,060
(It's a place to threaten others
to keep his identity a secret.)

1318
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,630
- "You're dead meat."
- I feel like he'll call me in...

1319
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,210
and ask about something
completely different.

1320
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,210
Right.

1321
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,750
Detective Yoon,
who will you interrogate?

1322
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,380
I will...

1323
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,520
(Who will Lieutenant Yoon Seok Ho
call in for interrogation?)

1324
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:45,710
I choose Se Chan.

1325
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,690
- Me?
- I choose Se Chan.

1326
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,310
Me?

1327
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,310
Se Chan?

1328
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,480
- Se Chan?
- Se Chan?

1329
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,290
The two of you will move to...

1330
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,100
- the interrogation room.
- Okay.

1331
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,150
(Detective Yoon and Se Chan will
move to the interrogation room.)

1332
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,730
- Se Chan?
- We found something suspicious.

1333
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,940
- Go to the Room of Truth.
- He found something he can't say.

1334
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,290
Yes, we caught something suspicious.

1335
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,730
I can't tell you because it's
confidential, but...

1336
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,610
You should tell me
why you brought me here.

1337
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:10,540
It looks like this?

1338
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:15,380
(This space looks like
a real interrogation room.)

1339
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,650
(There is even an interrogation log
with everyone's information on it.)

1340
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,210
It looks like this?

1341
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,690
(He is nervous as he
feels pressured for some reason.)

1342
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,810
This is intimidating.

1343
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,250
- May I take a seat?
- Yes, you may.

1344
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,980
You can interrogate me like
you would do in real life.

1345
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

1346
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,750
(Sighing)

1347
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,500
(Flinching)

1348
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,000
- What is your name?
- It's Yang Se Chan.

1349
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,830
What's your ID number?

1350
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:40,900
You want me to tell you
my ID number?

1351
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,170
You told me to do
as I would in real life.

1352
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,770
It's 861208.

1353
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,750
- Are we being filmed?
- Yes.

1354
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,420
Don't worry about it.
Just pretend we're not.

1355
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,710
(He forgot and focused on
doing his job.)

1356
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,460
It's okay. It's fine.

1357
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,480
What time did you get here?

1358
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,460
They told us to come by 8 a.m.,

1359
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,860
but I came 30 minutes early.

1360
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,290
- I was watching everyone,
- Yes.

1361
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,190
but there was something
I didn't understand.

1362
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,130
(Swallowing)

1363
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,130
- When you were choosing your roles,
- Right, when we were choosing them?

1364
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,540
- Yes.
- I chose the audio engineer first.

1365
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:14,830
Right. You chose it.

1366
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,330
Do you want to know why I chose it
when there were better roles?

1367
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,730
No, it's not that.

1368
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,980
- You told the other members...
- Yes?

1369
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,080
which role they should play.

1370
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,690
- I suggested roles to them.
- Yes, you did.

1371
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,580
I told them which roles
I'd like them to play.

1372
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,150
I don't understand why.

1373
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,880
(During the opening)

1374
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,250
(I think Jong Kook will go
well with a security guard.)

1375
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,730
(Se Chan suggested a role
to each member.)

1376
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,440
It's similar to the insurance agent.

1377
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,400
(At the same time,
in the monitoring room,)

1378
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,500
(Detective Yoon found this behavior
to be suspicious.)

1379
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,380
If you're the thief, it could be
how you kept your composure.

1380
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,810
That's the composure of
a criminal.

1381
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,080
That's the composure of a criminal?

1382
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,290
Yes, that's right.

1383
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,850
I'm not really composed.

1384
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:05,060
Why did you move the bags?

1385
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,920
(He asked him a question
out of nowhere.)

1386
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,100
I had to try picking them up,

1387
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,600
but I didn't have much time.

1388
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:14,460
- When it's sitting upright...
- Right.

1389
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,460
(Detective Yoon fell for Se Chan's
change in subject.)

1390
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,830
How can you do it?
You need to pick it up like this.

1391
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,400
But I couldn't put it back
in its place.

1392
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,380
- Because you didn't have time.
- Yes, I didn't have enough time.

1393
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,150
Ji Hyo is suspicious of someone.

1394
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,750
- I'm suspicious of someone.
- Tell us who it is.

1395
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:30,670
- Me?
- Jong Kook?

1396
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,350
She's always suspicious of me.

1397
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:36,380
You might just be looking around,

1398
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,880
but you're watching everyone's
movements as you talk.

1399
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,790
- Your eyes are.
- That's necessary.

1400
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,750
- Look at that.
- I need to watch.

1401
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,360
- Look at that.
- He is glaring at everyone.

1402
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,960
- Look at his eyes.
- He has daggers...

1403
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,330
- Fists are coming out of his eyes.
- He keeps shooting lasers.

1404
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:50,940
- In the beginning...
- I must do that.

1405
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,230
In the beginning, Jong Kook tried
to make everyone think it's So Min.

1406
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,580
- He did, right?
- What is it?

1407
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,250
- The criminal...
- What is it?

1408
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,110
What kind of fish
can you catch around here?

1409
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,150
- Pardon?
- What kind of fish can you catch?

1410
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:05,440
(He asks about fishing
to the fisherman.)

1411
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,880
He's sitting next to me
when he asked...

1412
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:12,920
what kind of fish one can catch
around here.

1413
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,130
Does he want to figure out
who the thief is?

1414
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,290
What do you think?

1415
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,560
- What can you catch here?
- How would I know?

1416
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,500
(While Prosecutor Yoo interrogates
the fisherman,)

1417
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,040
(Detective Yoon finishes
interrogating Se Chan.)

1418
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,270
- Did you get something?
- Did you...

1419
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,400
- get anything?
- Give us a hint.

1420
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,770
Why did you suspect him
in the first place?

1421
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,980
The reason why I suspected him is...

1422
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,940
Before I knew anything,
I said it was So Min,

1423
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,270
- Was that a fake?
- but honestly...

1424
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,480
- Right, and I kept watching.
- He was pretending.

1425
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:40,940
I don't have enough evidence yet.

1426
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,290
Because the thieves
haven't done anything yet.

1427
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,920
I had a thought.

1428
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,920
I thought these two...

1429
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,020
- teamed up again.
- That's possible.

1430
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,480
- Right. That's possible.
- Just like how Suk Jin...

1431
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,960
played the role of
the boss of Petty Gang...

1432
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,600
- for two weeks in a row.
- Right.

1433
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,860
That's possible.

1434
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,500
You're quite talkative today.

1435
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,330
- You're talkative today.
- Me?

1436
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,040
- Sit down.
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1437
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,730
My gosh. Just because he's
playing the role of a prosecutor...

1438
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,980
It's time to start the first trial.

1439
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,480
The prosecutor, Jae Suk, must
choose two people to go to trial.

1440
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,610
Is it finally my turn?

1441
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,270
Gosh, the prosecutor is up.

1442
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,940
How can we put him...

1443
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,040
Settle down.

1444
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,940
- Focus on your fishing cork.
- This is really important.

1445
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,610
- Fishing cork?
- Look over there.

1446
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,080
What about the headhunter?

1447
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,330
- What gave me chills was...
- This is insane.

1448
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,830
- Then you can tell us later.
- Okay.

1449
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,460
(Okay, I understand.)

1450
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,100
Gosh, I got chills.

1451
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,600
If you have chills,
you need to take a break.

1452
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,230
- After they settle down.
- When you have chills,

1453
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,130
you may say something
you didn't intend to say.

1454
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,230
- Right?
- Right.

1455
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,500
What about you, Director Pyo?

1456
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:40,270
I believe that the combination
of the interior expert and hacker...

1457
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,980
is ideal to commit a crime.

1458
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,880
I recommend those two people.

1459
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,880
What do you think, Fisherman?

1460
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,150
Right.

1461
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,960
- To be honest, I...
- How many fish did you catch?

1462
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,790
- I caught five.
- You caught five?

1463
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,750
How big was the biggest fish?

1464
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,290
- It was 30cm big.
- 30cm?

1465
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:00,690
- I need to put two people to trial.
- Right.

1466
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,170
Just choose the two people
you think are guilty.

1467
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,330
- Should I?
- Yes.

1468
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,670
(Who will Prosecutor Yu
put to trial?)

1469
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,330
The first person I choose is
the photographer.

1470
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,000
(The photographer!)

1471
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,040
- Okay.
- Right.

1472
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,170
- That's not a bad idea.
- I accept that.

1473
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,750
It's not a bad choice.

1474
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,940
It's because I'm angry.

1475
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,940
What if they all come out now?

1476
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,940
- That's possible.
- They won't tell us how many.

1477
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,580
- They'll say if there is or isn't.
- Only if there is or isn't.

1478
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,580
Just choose someone
who's suspicious.

1479
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,060
- Jeon So Min. Come up.
- Just one. Right.

1480
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,460
- Right.
- Get it out of the way.

1481
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,020
- It's not me.
- To be honest,

1482
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,400
- You can get rid of suspicions.
- in the beginning,

1483
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,600
- Let's find out.
- most people suspected her.

1484
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,790
- Right.
- It's not me.

1485
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,040
One more thing.
If they tell us there is a thief,

1486
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,170
we must figure out if it's one
of them or both of them.

1487
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,230
It would be like last time.

1488
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,830
That's why everyone suspected me.

1489
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,630
Right. That's right.

1490
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,110
Telling us that there isn't one
is good too.

1491
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,810
Okay. The prosecutor,
Yoo Jae Suk, chose...

1492
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:49,980
the suspects, Jeon So Min and Haha.

1493
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,810
Among them, there is...

1494
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:03,340
Among them, there is...

1495
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,790
(Among the two suspects...)

1496
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,860
a thief.

1497
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,500
(One or more thieves exist!)

1498
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,540
- I am not a thief!
- I knew it!

1499
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,750
I am not a thief. I am not a thief.

1500
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,270
- I knew it!
- I am not a thief.

1501
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:16,650
I am not a thief.
I am telling you I am not a thief.

1502
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,380
- Jae Suk.
- I got goosebumps.

1503
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,650
I was wrong.

1504
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,020
I am not a thief.

1505
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,460
- That was unbelievable.
- Good job.

1506
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,960
I swear I am not a thief.

1507
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,380
(Both of them claim
that they aren't a thief.)

1508
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,290
- Things became complicated.
- I swear I am not a thief.

1509
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,960
It's like the last race.

1510
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,000
- Listen.
- This is driving me crazy.

1511
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,270
You saw.

1512
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:37,860
The other thief
will keep a distance now.

1513
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,230
- This is driving me crazy.
- It's bound to happen.

1514
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,810
It's time
for the second Room Search.

1515
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,080
- Headhunter Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1516
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,940
Please decide on
the order and teams.

1517
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,540
Okay. I will separate
the two of them.

1518
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,380
- The hacker and photographer.
- Okay.

1519
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,650
(The two thief candidates
will be separated.)

1520
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,290
The thieves will steal
no matter what this time, right?

1521
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:58,110
- That's right.
- In that case,

1522
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,630
make So Min and Haha enter Room B.

1523
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:02,150
You should team up with So Min
and enter Room A.

1524
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,790
- I will do that.
- All right.

1525
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:05,900
Do you know which room is real?

1526
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,170
All right! Now,

1527
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,400
(Jong Kook cuts Kwang Soo off.)

1528
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,860
people who are suspicious...

1529
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,460
- Listen.
- That's right.

1530
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,110
The rooms keep changing.

1531
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:15,110
Do rooms keep changing?

1532
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:16,630
- The rooms keep changing.
- Then Kwang Soo should tell us.

1533
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,110
- Only the bags move.
- In that case,

1534
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:19,650
- Kwang Soo...
- Listen.

1535
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,250
should give
that information to those...

1536
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,920
(But I am the one
who decides on the order.)

1537
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,610
Kwang Soo should give
that information to those...

1538
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,110
- Hold on.
- He is the headhunter.

1539
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:28,420
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

1540
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,520
- Sit down.
- Is Jong Kook the headhunter?

1541
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,330
This is exactly what I am saying.

1542
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,960
He does everything!

1543
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,190
- Seriously.
- Sit down.

1544
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,190
- He doubles as the headhunter.
- You are the prosecutor...

1545
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,790
and headhunter.

1546
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:43,000
- Headhunter, judge,
- Hey!

1547
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,960
thug, delinquent...
He does everything.

1548
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,710
Kwang Soo, give the information
to those who team up...

1549
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,980
with So Min and Haha.

1550
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,340
(I have had enough.)

1551
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,500
- Jong Kook.
- Okay?

1552
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,110
- That's it.
- I will cover Jong Kook's mouth.

1553
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:57,750
Cover his mouth. Good job.

1554
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,150
- He is so annoying.
- I refuse to listen to him further.

1555
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:01,480
Are you in the race alone?

1556
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,020
Everyone has a role to play, okay?

1557
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,150
- I am the headhunter!
- Good job.

1558
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,590
- Cover his mouth.
- All right.

1559
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,860
- Good job.
- It's finally quiet now.

1560
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,230
Seriously.

1561
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,500
- Let's go.
- All right.

1562
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,270
It's nice that
Jong Kook's mouth is covered.

1563
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,630
(Jae Suk and Kwang Soo set off!)

1564
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,460
(Director Pyo enters
the monitoring room.)

1565
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:19,960
Which room do you want to go to?

1566
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,230
Take your pick.

1567
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,310
Director Pyo is watching us.

1568
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,270
(Kwang Soo enters Room A,
and Jae Suk enters Room B.)

1569
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:30,210
(So Min enters Room A,
and Jong Kook enters Room B.)

1570
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:32,610
Did you find anything?

1571
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,710
- I did.
- I opened it.

1572
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,210
What did you open? A bag?

1573
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:37,810
I am the hacker.

1574
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,980
You can open the bag. What happened?

1575
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,090
(So Min claims that she opened a bag
using her ability as a hacker.)

1576
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,730
Do real and fake jewels
look different?

1577
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:47,770
Can you tell by looking?

1578
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,090
The colors are the same,
but I don't know...

1579
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,610
if they are real or fake.

1580
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,630
You don't know?

1581
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,880
(Seok Ho enters Room A,
and Haha enters Room B.)

1582
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,880
(Seok Ho and Haha finish
the search.)

1583
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,310
The jewels got robbed.

1584
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,380
- Where?
- Room A.

1585
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,440
What?

1586
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,750
My bag became a bit heavy.

1587
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,920
(My bag became a bit heavy.)

1588
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:11,420
(Detective Yoon suddenly says
that his bag became heavy.)

1589
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,480
What?

1590
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:13,860
My bag became a bit heavy.

1591
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,900
- It's strange.
- Why?

1592
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,420
- Why are you tilting your head?
- What is it?

1593
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,090
- Is something off?
- Why are you tilting your head?

1594
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,500
- Something must be off.
- What is it?

1595
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,690
Detective Yoon, is something off?

1596
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:25,090
(What is up with him?)

1597
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,230
This is getting interesting.

1598
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,500
(This is getting interesting.)

1599
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:30,610
(Detective Yoon makes
a mysterious comment.)

1600
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:32,610
I got goosebumps.

1601
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,650
Okay. We need to figure out
who went before us.

1602
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:36,650
(The 2nd Room Search)

1603
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:37,810
I lifted all the bags.

1604
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,110
Everyone else's bag is light,

1605
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,190
but Seok Ho's bag is...

1606
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,920
- noticeably heavy.
- What?

1607
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,960
It became heavier.

1608
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:48,960
Maybe it's So Min's doing.

1609
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,130
Maybe So Min put jewels in my bag
and made it heavier.

1610
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:54,670
- She went before you.
- Maybe...

1611
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,860
one of them put jewels...

1612
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,540
- in my bag.
- Was it Jae Suk?

1613
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:02,900
Another possibility is
that you did it yourself.

1614
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,900
- That's one possibility.
- That's right.

1615
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,000
(Who put jewels
in Detective Yoon's bag?)

1616
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:11,440
Photographer Haha, decide on
the time to check.

1617
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,710
- Make it 30 seconds.
- 30 seconds should be good.

1618
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,480
I choose the 31-second mark.

1619
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:17,610
- That's his pride.
- That's my pride.

1620
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:18,790
He has his pride.

1621
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,190
All right.

1622
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,230
I will reveal the number of jewels
the thieves stole...

1623
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,250
the thieves stole...
during the second Room Search.

1624
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,590
(The total number of stolen jewels
will be revealed.)

1625
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,420
- How many did they steal?
- I bet they stole a lot.

1626
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,770
The total number of jewels
the thieves stole is...

1627
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:30,790
Did they steal the jewels?

1628
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,340
(How many jewels
did the thieves steal?)

1629
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,170
- 100.
- What?

1630
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:38,110
(100 jewels!)

1631
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,500
The thieves poured in the jewels.

1632
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,250
They opened the bags
and poured in the jewels.

1633
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,610
That must have happened.

1634
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:48,020
(Who stole so many jewels
in such a short amount of time?)

1635
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:51,860
But Detective Yoon's bag
became heavy.

1636
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:55,090
It's not just his bag.
Director Pyo's bag...

1637
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,250
also became heavy.

1638
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,330
- They poured in the jewels.
- There must be jewels inside.

1639
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:00,900
- Their bags aren't empty.
- Thieves...

1640
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,060
completed their mission
by stealing 100 jewels.

1641
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,190
They will win
if they aren't arrested.

1642
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,460
Let's catch them.

1643
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,480
(The thieves could either stay low
to avoid arrest...)

1644
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,000
(or steal more jewels
to win a bigger prize.)

1645
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,270
I will bring in the photos.

1646
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,710
You already met the goal.

1647
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,340
I didn't do it.

1648
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,150
Look at Haha's shameless face.

1649
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,920
(As per the result
of the second mission)

1650
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,380
Two photos
of Chang Won and Ji Hyo...

1651
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,110
will be revealed.

1652
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,590
(Photos of the 2nd Room Search,
Chang Won and Ji Hyo)

1653
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,630
Three photos of Jong Kook and So Min
will be revealed...

1654
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,290
since they placed fifth.

1655
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,770
(Photos of the 2nd Room Search,
Jong Kook and So Min)

1656
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,900
It looks like So Min is opening...

1657
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,400
- She is holding up the bag.
- That's right.

1658
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,810
- She opened it.
- She held it up.

1659
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,880
So Min said she opened a bag.

1660
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,540
- Why?
- Why did she say it?

1661
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,580
She didn't need to say it.

1662
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,040
She probably knew
that she would get caught.

1663
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,520
The posture makes me wonder
if she is studying the bag.

1664
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,290
Director Pyo seems to be studying
the bag too.

1665
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:56,710
Right? He is studying the bag.

1666
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,590
Ji Hyo's outfit...

1667
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:00,980
(Watching intently)

1668
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,360
That's the case with Ji Hyo.

1669
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,000
Detective Yoon is looking
at the details.

1670
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,920
I think he is opening it.

1671
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,290
Do you think he is opening it?

1672
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,500
(I think he is opening it.)

1673
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,170
I think he is opening it.

1674
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:13,710
- Did he open it?
- That's right. Look at his pose.

1675
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,500
Detective Yoon, don't be like that.

1676
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,880
Hold on. Are you serious?

1677
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,400
- What?
- I got goosebumps.

1678
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,480
Could he be a thief?

1679
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,110
Seok Ho singled out Chang Won
for the first time.

1680
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,340
If he gets arrested...

1681
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,190
Detective Yoon, don't be like that.
Wake up.

1682
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,480
I can't believe you.

1683
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,750
He turned red.

1684
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,380
Why is your face so red?

1685
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,630
Your face is about to burst.

1686
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,230
- Even his neck is red.
- I mean...

1687
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,400
- Even his ears are red.
- I am really flustered.

1688
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,460
You turned so red.

1689
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,190
I am really flustered.

1690
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,730
- Let's see.
- You want some water, right?

1691
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,190
- My goodness.
- You want some water, right?

1692
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,000
No, no.

1693
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:49,630
Even before I entered the room,
Detective Yoon's bag was...

1694
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:50,900
already heavy.

1695
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,710
- That's right.
- I didn't do it.

1696
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:56,440
Why is Detective Yoon framing me?

1697
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,650
It's hard to tell from the photos.

1698
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,110
(Could one of them be a thief?)

1699
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:04,810
We were narrowing down
the candidates...

1700
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,690
when he suddenly clouded the issue.

1701
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,520
It gives the thieves an advantage.

1702
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,090
The two of them are the thieves.

1703
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,060
- We are open to all possibilities.
- Who?

1704
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:16,340
The hacker and the spoiler.
Oh, that came out wrong.

1705
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,170
- Spoiler!
- The hacker and the spoiler.

1706
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,610
(Spoiler?)

1707
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,500
Spoiler! Spoiler?

1708
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,000
No spoilers are allowed.

1709
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,980
- Hold on.
- No spoilers are allowed.

1710
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,080
Spoiler?

1711
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,080
- It's the worst thing.
- He is a profiler.

1712
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,610
(Profiler!)

1713
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:30,610
Profiler.

1714
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,880
That was funny. That was funny.

1715
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,520
That made everyone laugh.

1716
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,810
- Spoiler.
- Detective Yoon.

1717
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,750
We are colleagues.

1718
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,360
You should know my title.

1719
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,360
- I am sorry, but...
- The interrogation will begin.

1720
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,230
(He suddenly becomes interrogative.)

1721
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,590
In the photos,

1722
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,060
you...

1723
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,690
(Detective Yoon finds him
suspicious.)

1724
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:51,730
He is making a move, right?

1725
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:53,130
No matter how I look at it,

1726
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,710
he isn't simply holding the bag.

1727
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,210
- He is making a move, right?
- Yes.

1728
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,500
They are going back and forth.

1729
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,400
I am really flustered.

1730
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,480
It would make the perfect story.

1731
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,810
It's time to start the second trial.

1732
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,190
For the second trial,
use your ballots as you want.

1733
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,380
The person with the most number
of votes will be arrested.

1734
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,980
We will give you one ballot each.

1735
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,290
Whom should we vote for?
The one we know?

1736
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,230
That's right.
We should do that this time.

1737
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,250
Let's write down the name.

1738
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,290
- Write down So Min's name.
- We should do that.

1739
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:21,500
- We need to know.
- Listen.

1740
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,360
If So Min isn't a thief...

1741
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,730
- Then Haha is.
- Haha.

1742
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,060
That's right.

1743
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:29,710
(Haha enters the ballot box first.)

1744
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:37,020
(He casts his ballot quickly.)

1745
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,080
(He comes out.)

1746
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,520
We should do that this time.

1747
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:43,750
Haha entered and came out too fast.

1748
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,090
I guess that makes sense
since he is a thief.

1749
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,060
This is driving me crazy.

1750
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,380
All right.

1751
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,520
Let's do this fast and move on.

1752
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,590
(Jong Kook casts his ballot
as well.)

1753
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,790
Our decisions
won't be revealed, right?

1754
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,520
They won't know, right?

1755
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,270
(Thinking)

1756
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:00,610
Here is the problem.

1757
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,810
We need to figure out
if only one of them is a thief.

1758
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,080
- That's right.
- If So Min turns out to be a thief,

1759
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:10,420
we won't know if Haha is a thief.

1760
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,610
- That's right.
- That's right.

1761
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:13,110
- Haha.
- We must cast our ballots for Haha.

1762
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,940
If Haha isn't a thief,

1763
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,380
- we will know that So Min is.
- Shall we do that?

1764
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,520
- Let's go with Haha.
- That's right.

1765
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,380
- We must cast our ballots for Haha.
- That's right.

1766
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,060
- Why?
- If Haha isn't a thief...

1767
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,790
Let's find out if he isn't.

1768
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:26,270
I don't think
both of them are thieves.

1769
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,900
It makes sense to write
Haha's name.

1770
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,560
It doesn't matter
as long as it's one of them.

1771
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,670
Just cast your vote.

1772
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,670
One of them is a thief.

1773
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,500
(All of them cast their votes.)

1774
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,080
- I will announce the results.
- Okay.

1775
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,540
The member who received
the most number of votes is...

1776
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,110
(Who received
the most number of votes?)

1777
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:46,040
(Is it So Min, the member
who was highly suspected?)

1778
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,650
(Did they cast their votes for Haha
as Chang Won asked?)

1779
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:52,210
(Is it Chang Won, the member
who behaved in a suspicious way?)

1780
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:55,290
(Is it Seok Ho, the member
who cornered Chang Won?)

1781
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:56,920
The member who received
the most number of votes is...

1782
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:58,690
- So Min.
- All right.

1783
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,130
(So Min received
the most number of votes.)

1784
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:02,330
- Please come forward.
- Go up the stand.

1785
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:03,400
So Min.

1786
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,500
All right.

1787
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,770
Many people wrote down her name
in the beginning.

1788
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,900
They did that
before Chang Won voiced his opinion.

1789
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,130
I should have written down
Haha's name.

1790
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:11,730
This is driving me crazy.

1791
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,580
You keep...

1792
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:19,020
(A strong thief candidate,
So Min goes up the judgment stand.)

1793
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:22,750
Since So Min has been put on trial,
I will reveal her identity.

1794
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:23,980
(It's time to check
So Min's identity.)

1795
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,110
So Min is...

1796
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,880
- She is a thief. Of course she is.
- So Min...

1797
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,650
(Is So Min really a thief
as everyone expected?)

1798
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:30,860
So Min is...

1799
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,270
She is a thief.

1800
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,020
A thief.

1801
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,690
(So Min is a thief!)

1802
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,790
I knew it.

1803
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:39,400
I was certain of it.

1804
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,730
(Thief 1 was So Min.)

1805
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:41,730
All right.

1806
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,670
She is still acting. Come on down.

1807
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,210
Thief, sit down.

1808
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:47,310
(So Min's secret)

1809
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:52,520
(She chose to be a hacker to prevent
other members from seeing her bag.)

1810
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,440
(During the 2nd Room Search)

1811
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:59,380
(She opened Jong Kook's bag...)

1812
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:03,290
(and succeeded to transfer
the jewels to her bag.)

1813
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:06,130
(Thus, So Min acquired 100 jewels.)

1814
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,500
Thief, sit down.

1815
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,940
(She couldn't shake off
people's suspicion.)

1816
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,440
There is a problem.

1817
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,810
- We didn't clear Haha's name.
- That's right.

1818
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,960
You can vote for me the next time.

1819
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,400
- No. It will be our last chance.
- We can't do that.

1820
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,000
- That's right.
- We have one chance left.

1821
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,980
You can put 1 person
on the 3rd trial.

1822
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,540
Now comes the last round.

1823
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,670
- The last Room Search begins now.
- This is really hard.

1824
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:26,920
All right. Now,

1825
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:30,190
we need to keep So Min
from entering the real room.

1826
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:32,710
So Min will steal
without hiding now.

1827
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,230
I need to enter the real room.

1828
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:35,980
Headhunter, decide on the order.

1829
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,330
Me?

1830
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,360
- In that case...
- You should go last.

1831
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,360
Kwang Soo can't tell us
which room is real in advance,

1832
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,590
so send him and So Min together.

1833
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,270
That's the only way.

1834
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,560
- Go with her.
- Go with her.

1835
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,360
What if she enters the real room?

1836
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:50,310
Tie her. You are strong.

1837
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:51,900
- Should I use force?
- Yes.

1838
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:54,270
For fairness,

1839
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,770
you can decide through discussion
or rock-paper-scissors.

1840
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,750
We will get going then.

1841
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,590
(The order of the 3rd Room Search)

1842
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:01,710
Go. Go ahead.

1843
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:04,690
We must catch the other thief.

1844
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:06,730
- Why?
- We must.

1845
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,090
- Which room did you go to?
- The real room or the fake room?

1846
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:11,830
Did you send her to the fake room?

1847
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:13,790
Did she go to the real room?

1848
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:16,360
- Who went to the real room?
- Did you send her to the real room?

1849
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:18,230
I didn't send her.
We played rock-paper-scissors.

1850
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:19,770
- You shouldn't have done that.
- For goodness' sake.

1851
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,500
Rules are rules.

1852
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:23,770
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1853
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:25,730
The winner gets to choose.

1854
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,040
- Okay. Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1855
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,650
Okay. Thanks, Kwang Soo.

1856
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,110
Look forward to it.

1857
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:32,710
(After winning, So Min the thief
entered the real room.)

1858
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:35,150
That throws off our deductions.

1859
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:36,380
Why did you do that?

1860
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,810
- Kwang Soo is suspicious.
- We can't make deductions.

1861
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:42,230
- Kwang Soo is suspicious.
- He really is.

1862
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,520
My hands are shaking.

1863
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,020
- I wanted to go to Room A.
- Okay.

1864
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:46,960
But it really doesn't matter
which room I enter.

1865
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,940
I am curious about this room.
I have never entered it.

1866
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:51,290
Let's see.

1867
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,670
(My goodness.)

1868
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:55,500
- It's a mess.
- What happened?

1869
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:58,400
Jae Suk's bag is empty.

1870
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,670
- Really?
- Was it open?

1871
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:01,610
Kwang Soo's bag is empty too.

1872
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:03,440
And...

1873
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,610
(I can't believe her.)

1874
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,590
Ji Hyo's bag is open,
but filled with jewels.

1875
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:10,650
- Thieves didn't have enough time.
- It seems that way.

1876
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:12,960
The jewels are all over the place.
They didn't have enough time.

1877
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,690
- And...
- It was like that before.

1878
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,130
Detective Yoon's bag is still heavy.

1879
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,360
- Right?
- Is it still heavy?

1880
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:19,900
- Is it still heavy?
- It's still heavy.

1881
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,690
- Is it still heavy?
- Is it still heavy?

1882
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,690
Chang Won's bag...

1883
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,290
is as light as ours.

1884
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:26,400
- Really?
- Yes.

1885
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,440
That came out of nowhere.

1886
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,210
- How did that happen?
- I guess jewels got taken out.

1887
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:30,270
I guess so.

1888
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,440
- I will go.
- In that case...

1889
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,580
I will go.

1890
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:36,670
- Se Chan, go.
- Detective Yoon.

1891
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:38,770
Detective Yoon is suspicious.

1892
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,980
(Whispering)

1893
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:47,360
Jong Kook, So Min said,
"That punk is a shaman."

1894
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,090
I am serious.

1895
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:52,590
She said, "All of this happened
because of that punk."

1896
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,500
She said she will give me
50 percent of the prize...

1897
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,840
if I let her go into the real room.

1898
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:59,770
(So Min tried to strike a deal.)

1899
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,840
(Se Chan and Detective Yoon
come back.)

1900
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,310
- How was it? Was your bag heavy?
- Well,

1901
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:05,710
it was exactly as Suk Jin said.

1902
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:07,210
- It's a big mess, right?
- Yes.

1903
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:09,500
Hold on. So are there
still a lot of jewels in your bag?

1904
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,310
Yes. My bag is still heavy.

1905
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:13,650
If we were to focus on the fact,

1906
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:16,860
the person
whose bag is the heaviest...

1907
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,860
with jewels is you.

1908
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:20,150
Right?

1909
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,520
Haha, you are quite chatty today.

1910
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,830
I have always been chatty.

1911
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:27,670
No. You are acting differently
today.

1912
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,420
Do you think Haha is a thief
as well?

1913
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,500
- He is suspicious.
- This is driving me crazy.

1914
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:35,540
Photographer, decide on the time
one last time.

1915
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,940
- 25 seconds.
- 25 seconds.

1916
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:40,750
- Bring in the photos.
- I will say it as the photographer.

1917
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,250
- 25 seconds.
- 25 seconds.

1918
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,920
Everyone.

1919
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:47,110
I will reveal the number of jewels
the thieves stole...

1920
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,880
- during the last Room Search.
- Okay.

1921
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:53,230
The total number of jewels
the thieves stole is...

1922
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:58,020
(Although So Min has been arrested,
her accomplice is still hidden.)

1923
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,290
(How many jewels
did they steal today?)

1924
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:03,060
- 352.
- What?

1925
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,690
(352 jewels)

1926
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:06,940
So Min let go
and stole all the jewels.

1927
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:10,670
Simply put, there are
352 red jewels...

1928
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,340
inside the thieves' bags right now.

1929
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,920
Shouldn't we add Detective Yoon...

1930
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,020
to the list of thief candidates?

1931
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:21,310
When you think about it,
he is right.

1932
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:24,980
So Min stole
as many jewels as she could.

1933
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:29,430
- Then Suk Jin entered Room A next.
- Yes.

1934
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,760
You saw the room in a disarray.

1935
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,390
I left it as it was.

1936
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:39,800
And Detective Yoon's bag was
as heavy as it was before.

1937
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:41,140
Yes, it was.

1938
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,340
Did you lift up So Min's bag?

1939
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:44,600
I didn't pay attention to it.

1940
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,340
I lifted up everyone's bag,
but no bag was particularly heavy.

1941
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,250
Only Detective Yoon
could have stolen more jewels.

1942
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,080
- You are right.
- No one else could have done it.

1943
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,350
But a total of 350 jewels
got stolen.

1944
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,310
So Min stole as many as she could,

1945
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:58,010
but another person
must have taken part.

1946
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:59,790
Then Detective Yoon is the only one
who could have done it.

1947
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:02,090
Your deduction is wrong.

1948
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:03,550
(Chiming in)

1949
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:06,260
A few bags were heavier
than the others.

1950
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,860
About two bags were heavier.

1951
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:12,170
Whose bags?

1952
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:13,340
I don't remember the names.

1953
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:15,360
If we study the fact,

1954
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,730
- he has the most number of jewels.
- That's right.

1955
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:19,300
Let's sit down.

1956
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,940
What should we do?

1957
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,180
This is so hard.

1958
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,350
- Director Pyo.
- Yes?

1959
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:27,090
I get that you are helping us
as a profiler,

1960
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:30,960
but you never explained why
you aren't a thief.

1961
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,180
- Me?
- Yes.

1962
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:33,830
I can't be a thief.

1963
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,220
- Why is that?
- Why is that?

1964
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:39,000
From the start, I said So Min is
a strong thief candidate.

1965
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,520
Isn't that right?

1966
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,000
If I were an accomplice,
I wouldn't have put her in danger.

1967
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,760
We do that sometimes.

1968
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,040
(We do that sometimes.)

1969
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,640
We do that on purpose.

1970
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,470
That's right. We do that a lot.

1971
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,710
It could be a ploy
to avoid suspicion.

1972
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:57,110
We use such a tactic a lot.

1973
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:00,680
The other thief had no reason
to enter Room A.

1974
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,850
- That's right.
- So Min did all the work.

1975
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:06,350
So Min was the only thief
who entered Room A.

1976
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:08,590
It must be one of the people
who entered Room B.

1977
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:11,190
Who entered Room B?

1978
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:13,390
Room B. Haha entered Room B.

1979
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:14,720
- I entered Room B.
- Room B.

1980
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,360
- Who else? Room B.
- I entered Room B.

1981
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,930
(Ji Hyo, Haha, Se Chan,
Jong Kook, and Kwnag Soo)

1982
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:21,400
The security guard can check...

1983
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,680
three photos of a member.

1984
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,880
Jong Kook, pick a member.

1985
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,080
Whose photos should I look at?
Give me recommendations.

1986
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,750
How about Director Pyo?

1987
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,580
I recommend Director Pyo too.

1988
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:31,750
Why...

1989
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,640
do I want to see
Haha's photos like crazy?

1990
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,810
Look at Haha's photos.

1991
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:36,510
Jong Kook has suspected Haha
from a while ago.

1992
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:38,980
- Jong Kook has a hunch.
- This is driving me crazy.

1993
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:43,130
But it would be meaningless
to look at Haha's photos.

1994
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,100
I say that...

1995
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,100
because he probably did nothing
in Room B.

1996
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,020
- So it would be meaningless.
- Don't do it.

1997
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,140
I should look at So Min's photos.

1998
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:52,560
(I should look at So Min's photos.)

1999
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,210
- Again?
- I should see how she moved them.

2000
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,900
That's right.

2001
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,230
- That's right.
- How she moved the jewels.

2002
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:00,050
- I should do that.
- That's a good idea.

2003
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:02,800
It would be better to see
where she put the jewels.

2004
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,050
That will give us the answer.

2005
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:05,580
- That's right.
- You are like a profiler.

2006
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,980
So Min is the only one...

2007
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:09,810
- whose action can give us clues.
- That's right.

2008
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,350
Will you look at So Min's photos?

2009
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,420
- Yes.
- He is smart.

2010
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:13,520
(So Min's photos will be provided
as soon as they are ready.)

2011
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,720
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo are
at fourth place,

2012
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,550
and Jae Suk and Chang Won are
at fifth place.

2013
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,430
- The third Room Search.
- Look at the last ones.

2014
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:21,560
- Here.
- The last ones.

2015
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,500
Let's look at the last ones.

2016
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:25,560
Is Ji Hyo lifting up the bag?

2017
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,340
I lifted up the bag.
I did it with every bag.

(Photos of the 3rd Room Search)

2019
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:32,930
(Ji Hyo seems to be straightening
the bag.)

2020
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:34,270
Jae Suk is shaking it.

2021
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,850
- Jae Suk is checking.
- I checked.

2022
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:41,810
(Jae Suk seems to be checking
the bags in the photos.)

2023
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,980
It looks like he is opening it.

2024
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:49,350
- He is opening it.
- It looks like he is opening it.

2025
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:52,690
(Director Pyo seems to be opening
the bag in the photos.)

2026
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:56,190
(Chang Won, Room B, 10 seconds,
Chang Won, Room B, 20 seconds)

2027
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:57,730
(Chang Won, Room B, 25 seconds)

2028
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,840
Why is he picking it up like that?
Don't you usually do this?

2029
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,430
This is right. You have to
pick it up like Jae Suk.

2030
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:04,540
Or when you shake it.

2031
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,540
- This is...
- This is... Look.

2032
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,770
It looks like he's opening it,
not shaking it.

2033
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,720
(What is the truth behind
the suspicions?)

2034
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,290
Suk Jin.
What is this bag that's open?

2035
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:17,010
- The ones that were open are...
- This one was open.

2036
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:18,590
Kwang Soo's bag...

2037
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,920
and your bag.

2038
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:26,970
(He gave a clear testimony that
the bag was open and it had jewels.)

2039
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:31,890
(He got excited and told everyone
that the bags were open.)

2040
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,860
You said that two of the bags
were open.

2041
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:35,100
Kwang Soo's and yours.

2042
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,040
- But it's not open here.
- It's not open.

2043
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,210
It's closed here.

2044
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:40,800
(The bags are all closed?)

2045
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,050
(Come to think, all of the bags...)

2046
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:44,610
(are closed in Suk Jin's photos.)

2047
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,350
- They're all closed.
- I opened them later.

2048
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:47,440
- What?
- Later.

2049
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,850
- Later? How?
- Later?

2050
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,850
- I was touching them, and...
- You opened them?

2051
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,050
Suk Jin.

2052
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:54,480
- You clearly said...
- This is driving me crazy.

2053
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,830
- I did this.
- that two were open.

2054
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,130
I shook the bags, and they opened.

2055
01:12:58,130 --> 01:12:59,300
I shook them, and they opened.

2056
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,330
You said my bag was on the floor.

2057
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:02,860
- He said it was open.
- You said it was open, right?

2058
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:04,860
- None of them are open.
- Two of them were open.

2059
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,390
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

2060
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:07,900
- We caught him.
- It was Suk Jin?

2061
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,470
(Could Suk Jin be the thief?)

2062
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:10,680
Jong Kook.

2063
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,900
You can't share this with anyone.
You must look at it alone.

2064
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:22,550
(So Min's fellow thief's identity
will depend on her movements.)

2065
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:26,350
First, she opened it.
She opened it and...

2066
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:28,680
(So Min touched the fourth bag on
the right as soon as she started.)

2067
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,890
(So Min, Room A, 10 seconds)

2068
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,360
(So Min, Room A, 20 seconds)

2069
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,970
(So Min, Room A, 25 seconds)

2070
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:42,260
(Nervous)

2071
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:46,300
(What did Jong Kook find out?)

2072
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,640
Guys, come here.

2073
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,180
Tell me if you know what it is
after you listen to me. Hold on.

2074
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:52,920
- This is...
- After So Min went in.

2075
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,290
- after So Min went in, right?
- Yes.

2076
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,180
Whose bag is this? This one.

2077
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,510
Does anyone know?

2078
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:59,050
Whose bag did you say it was again?

2079
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:01,020
- This one.
- I don't know.

2080
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,090
(Jong Kook believes that this bag
belongs to her fellow thief.)

2081
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,890
- So Min took out the first bag...
- Hey.

2082
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:06,690
Isn't the middle bag Haha's bag?

2083
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:08,890
(Does the bag belong to Haha?)

2084
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:11,840
(If so, is Haha a thief?)

2085
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,060
(The thief, So Min's decisive
evidence has been revealed.)

2086
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,510
This is driving me crazy.
I have no idea.

2087
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:17,380
I really have no idea today.

2088
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:19,580
The suspect list keeps changing.

2089
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,140
(It's almost time to do
the last vote.)

2090
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:22,970
- Se Chan is suspicious too.
- This means...

2091
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:24,380
Isn't So Min's partner
always Se Chan?

2092
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:26,350
- It's clear that...
- No. It's not that simple.

2093
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:30,110
(He takes a look at
all the pictures they've collected.)

2094
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:31,110
Jae Suk...

2095
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:35,050
Director Pyo's suspect list is...

2096
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:37,890
Hold on.
Let me ask one last question.

2097
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,860
Who entered Room B
during the second search?

2098
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,260
Yes, please stand up.

2099
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:44,060
Who entered Room B
during the second search?

2100
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,470
(After finding out who went into
Room B during the second search,)

2101
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:46,690
- The people who went into Room B.
- During the second search?

2102
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:47,760
Room B during the second search.

2103
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,510
Who went into Room B
during the third search?

2104
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:51,230
(he asks who went into Room B
during the third search.)

2105
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:52,380
I went into Room B
during the third search.

2106
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,900
Haha is the only one who kept
going into Room B.

2107
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,010
- Right.
- And Ji Hyo.

2108
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:01,350
After the first trial where
we determined that...

2109
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:03,850
Haha and So Min might be thieves,

2110
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:07,220
they might've divided up their roles
and agreed to go into one room,

2111
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,480
- so he kept going into Room B.
- But I...

2112
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,520
(Haha is suspicious because
he never went into Room A.)

2113
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,760
But I... You can suspect me,

2114
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,930
but I never chose
which room I wanted to go in.

2115
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:18,470
From the beginning,
I can't stop suspecting Haha.

2116
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:21,230
If you look here, there aren't
any photographs of Haha.

2117
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:22,360
Right.

2118
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,730
(Haha isn't in any of the evidence.)

2119
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:25,270
(Thief Investigation Log)

2120
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:30,970
(Haha's whereabouts haven't been
revealed in the slightest.)

2121
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:38,480
I'm wondering if he purposely
tried to keep himself hidden.

2122
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,390
I didn't do anything.

2123
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:42,630
- I think I have to go with my gut.
- Right.

2124
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:43,630
I don't have a choice.

2125
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,190
(Potential Thief 1,
Pyo Chang Won, Profiler)

2126
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:47,760
(Powerful authority as a profiler,
Looked like he was opening a bag,)

2127
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,300
(Seemed flustered
and his face turned red)

2128
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:52,140
(Potential Thief 2,
Yoon Seok Ho, Detective)

2129
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:55,260
(Bag got heavier,
Last one to enter Room A)

2130
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:57,300
(Potential Thief 3,
Haha, Photographer)

2131
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,270
(Came early and chose photographer,
Went into Room B all three times,)

2132
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:01,580
(Doesn't have picture evidence,
Quite talkative)

2133
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:04,470
(Potential Thief 4,
Ji Suk Jin, Headhunter)

2134
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:06,510
(The photo contradicts
his testimony.)

2135
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:08,590
(Possibility of another
Petty Gang crime)

2136
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,680
We'll start the vote quickly.

2137
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:13,850
You can use all of your ballots.

2138
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:16,220
Shouldn't we put Lieutenant Yoon
on the list too?

2139
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,390
He has the most jewels.

2140
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,000
(Are you?)

2141
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
- I'm not. I'm really not.
- They went to Room A then Room B.

2142
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,930
If it's you, I'm really going to...

2143
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:26,140
- It's not me.
- Right.

2144
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,230
If it's you, then...

2145
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:29,140
- It must be Haha.
- Haha?

2146
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,710
- Write it down.
- I don't think it's you.

2147
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:33,270
- It's not Suk Jin.
- Because you...

2148
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:35,140
didn't go in at the end.

2149
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,750
I'm really happy right now.

2150
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,380
The thief must not be
one of the people we mentioned.

2151
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,680
We're done voting.

2152
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:42,510
- We're done counting the ballots.
- Please.

2153
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:44,420
Show your determination.

2154
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:47,390
The final person to go
to the third trial is...

2155
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:51,050
(They'll reveal the person who got
the most votes...)

2156
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:53,020
(and will go to the third trial.)

2157
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:57,100
(The person to go to
the 3rd trial is...)

2158
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,300
- Haha.
- Okay.

2159
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,670
(The person to go to
the 3rd trial is Haha)

2160
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:01,170
(Haha got 46.7 percent of the votes
and will go on the Judgment Stand.)

2161
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:02,640
I don't know why it's me.

2162
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,680
That's right.

2163
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:04,840
We lost.

2164
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,210
- I don't think it's him.
- I don't know why you chose me.

2165
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:09,550
- I have no idea who it is.
- Why did you choose me?

2166
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,550
I didn't even consider Haha because
there's no way we chose...

2167
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:14,010
both thieves during the first trial.

2168
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,510
That's what I thought too.

2169
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:16,680
It's fine.

2170
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,090
If Haha is a thief,

2171
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:19,480
- Team Thieves will lose.
- Right.

2172
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,460
If not, the civilians will lose.

2173
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,650
I don't know who it is,
but you're a great actor.

2174
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:25,130
- It's not Haha.
- You're great.

2175
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,350
I acknowledge you.

2176
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,670
Haha's identity is...

2177
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:31,690
(Haha was suspected from the start
and was uncomfortable all day.)

2178
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:32,970
He is...

2179
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:37,010
(What is Haha's identity?)

2180
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:38,300
- Please.
- He's not.

2181
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,180
He's not.

2182
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,770
He is a thief. The civilians win.

2183
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:45,680
(Haha was a thief.)

2184
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,750
(The civilians win.)

2185
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,050
- Seriously?
- Didn't I tell you?

2186
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:50,010
- Kim Jong Kook!
- We found...

2187
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:51,980
- We found them at the beginning.
- What did I tell you?

2188
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:53,550
I told you he was, right?

2189
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:55,180
He is a thief. The civilians win.

2190
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,980
- We found them at the beginning.
- What did I tell you?

2191
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,000
(Kim Jong Kook!)

2192
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:00,930
(I know how you feel.)

2193
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,020
I can't believe it.

2194
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:05,360
I'm so annoyed.

2195
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,000
- Jae Suk.
- I told you it was him, right?

2196
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:09,840
We wouldn't have gotten it right
if it weren't for you.

2197
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,340
- The two of you...
- The two of you...

2198
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,940
(The second thief duo was
Jeon So Min and Haha.)

2199
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,580
The two of you will
become thieves...

2200
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,610
Thieves?

2201
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,850
and get your revenge.

2202
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,140
I'm not confident.

2203
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,420
I can't do this.

2204
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:26,460
I already have
a bad feeling about this.

2205
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,590
- Is it jewels this time?
- Depending on how many you steal,

2206
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:31,260
we'll give you a gift accordingly.

2207
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:33,350
Then our first pick is photographer.

2208
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,170
The photographer
is really important.

2209
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:36,220
Hacker and photographer?

2210
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,760
(They followed their plan,
came early,)

2211
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,010
(and became the hacker
and the photographer.)

2212
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,640
(Everyone was suspicious because
So Min came really early.)

2213
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,680
(Their plan failed because
they came really early...)

2214
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,470
(and made artificial choices.)

2215
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:51,850
(They altered the weight of
the bags in each room.)

2216
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:54,610
(So Min used the fake jewels
to make the bags heavier.)

2217
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:58,510
(Detective Yoon and
Director Pyo's bags became heavier.)

2218
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:02,150
(Haha, who was in the fake room,)

2219
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:04,330
(also altered the weight of the bags
to cause confusion.)

2220
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:09,430
(They briefly mentioned that
Room B was manipulated,)

2221
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:11,670
(but Jong Kook's senses kicked in
and said it might be fake.)

2222
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:13,360
(Their plan failed because nobody
focused on Room B...)

2223
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,260
(because they believed that Room A
was the real room.)

2224
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,470
I'll say that it's you.

2225
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,970
What if we get caught in
the 1st or 2nd trial?

2226
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:22,080
That won't happen.

2227
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,210
There's no way.

2228
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:26,850
(As everyone suspects So Min,
Haha cut her off as planned.)

2229
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:29,590
(Are you already cutting me off?)

2230
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:32,550
(However, Jae Suk caught Haha.)

2231
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:36,930
(The results were humiliating as
they were both put on trial.)

2232
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,100
(Haha saved himself.
So Min got caught,)

2233
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,190
(so she stole while Haha
didn't do anything suspicious.)

2234
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:42,670
(Exhaling)

2235
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:46,390
(However, Jae Suk figured him out.)

2236
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,340
(That tenacious...)

2237
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:53,800
(Have Jong Kook on our side.)

2238
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,850
(The criminals...)

2239
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:56,880
(tend to sit on the edges.)

2240
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,080
(They were sitting with Jong Kook
between them...)

2241
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,980
(when they got flustered.)

2242
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:03,680
(These two people kept bothering
the thieves from the beginning.)

2243
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,590
(They were Jae Suk and Jong Kook
who have good intuition.)

2244
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:09,520
(This resulted in the failure
of the two thieves.)

2245
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,000
(Jae Suk and Jong Kook's
splendid achievement.)

2246
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,520
- Jae Suk.
- I was right, wasn't I?

2247
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,830
(This is how dangerous it is
for them to be on the same team.)

2248
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:20,360
(These two suffered a lot today.)

2249
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,670
Let's not have them guess based on
how they speak.

2250
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,580
His hands were like this all day.

2251
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,040
He kept moving them.

2252
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,380
(The theory of profiling doesn't
work in this universe.)

2253
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,470
Jong Kook is amazing too.

2254
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:33,980
I know.

2255
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,310
(You tenacious people.)

2256
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:37,890
I could tell.

2257
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,590
They had no evidence whatsoever.

2258
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:42,790
The two civilians
who will receive the prize are...

2259
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:44,430
Detective Yoon, please enjoy.

2260
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,600
Goodness. Thank you.

2261
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,260
Director Pyo and Detective Yoon,

2262
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,930
- please say goodbye.
- Right.

2263
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:50,330
We had so much fun today.

2264
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,900
Thank you so much for inviting us.
It was delightful and fun today.

2265
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,340
- Come in.
- Thank you.

2266
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,600
- The two of you made it more fun.
- I agree.

2267
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,300
- Seriously. We had so much fun.
- Let's thank them again.

2268
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,270
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2269
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:03,580
Your penalty will be combined...

2270
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,250
- with the next one.
- Okay.

2271
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,510
Okay, let's go.

2272
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:07,790
Good job everyone.

2273
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:09,050
(1st place, 37g of gold)

2274
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:10,760
(37g of pure gold
is waiting for them.)

2275
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,260
(Among them, the luck of
winning the lotto...)

2276
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,220
(will go to 1 lucky person only?)

2277
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:16,590
(A desperate struggle
to become that 1 person)

2278
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:19,460
(The 8 hobbies of 8 people
will start.)

2279
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:21,720
(1st period, Teamwork is important
when dancing the Samba.)

2280
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,670
(She's the only who's
overly passionate.)

2281
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:27,300
(Passionate newlywed couple...)

2282
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,680
(versus two people
who are about to fight)

2283
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,710
(This is Hawaii.)

2284
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:34,710
(2nd period, Your expression is
important when dancing the Hula.)

2285
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,010
(Expressing love, happiness,
and gratitude with his body)

2286
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:41,250
(The winner is the person
who enjoys this stage.)

2287
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:46,050
(They try singing in a capella,)

2288
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:47,460
(but they fail.)

2289
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:50,830
(Their attempt at hobbies doesn't
seem easy. Will they succeed?)

2290
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:52,800
(8 People, 8 Colors Preference Race,
Lucky Hobbies)
