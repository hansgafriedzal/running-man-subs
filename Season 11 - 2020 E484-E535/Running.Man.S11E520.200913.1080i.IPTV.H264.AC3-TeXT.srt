1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,330
(A cool breeze is blowing.)

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,830
Hello.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,470
Ji Hyo is like the actress
from the movie, "Bichunmoo".

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,700
- A slave hunter.
- It's "Bichunmoo".

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,770
She doesn't like her bangs.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,910
Ji Hyo, you look
like a school bully...

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,620
from the 1980s.
They wear bangs like yours.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,180
- Either put your hair up or down.
- That's what old ladies did.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,820
- Right.
- They went to a salon for that.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,090
- This is in style now.
- Look at the hair claw clips.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,090
(- This is in style now.
- Look at the hair claw clips.)

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,730
- Look at the hair claw clips.
- Earlier in the waiting room,

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,590
how did you guys hold out
without talking about it?

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,650
- We were waiting.
- I wanted to say it here.

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,700
I was waiting to mention it here.

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,600
- We just bite at each other.
- It's the retro trend.

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,390
- I see.
- She says it's retro.

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,430
That's funny.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,640
(There's news about Jae Suk
taking 1st place as always.)

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,710
It's about Jae Suk.

22
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,740
- He took first place again.
- "Korea's most influential people".

23
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,680
- That's right. Thank you.
- You're unbelievable.

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,970
"Korea's most influential people".

25
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,470
- You're a great man.
- The most influential person.

26
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,970
There will be a biography of him.

27
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,180
Aren't you sick of taking
first place in stuff like this?

28
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,280
He even ranks above BTS.

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,580
- This is unbelievable.
- He's even above BTS.

30
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,820
- He got a lot more votes than them.
- Even BTS?

31
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,780
It's not like that. Anyway,

32
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,820
it was a weekly newsmagazine.

33
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,530
Did you call people around you
for the poll?

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,700
Who would he call?

35
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,400
- What is he talking about?
- Why are you being so sarcastic?

36
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,170
- What's wrong with you?
- Just congratulate him heartily.

37
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,640
What's with the sarcasm?

38
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,540
- It just doesn't make sense.
- Just be happy for him.

39
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,060
Why does it not make sense?

40
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,230
- This is too big a deal.
- Just congratulate him.

41
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,140
Why is he being like this?

42
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,670
It's just too hard to believe.

43
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,510
You should be happy
that he's our member.

44
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,810
We are very proud.

45
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,340
- I guess you're right.
- There's one more thing.

46
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,510
- That's right. Suk Jin.
- What?

47
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,920
- He's got more than...
- It's about "Ji Suk Jin World".

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,260
- 100,000 subscribers.
- Over 100,000 subscribers?

49
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,790
- That's right.
- He's got the silver button.

50
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,180
It's about 150,000 people now.

51
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,000
- The silver button...
- What is it called?

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
- What?
- Silver...

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,860
- Silver...
- Silver town?

54
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,920
- Isn't it a silver town?
- Like a town for the aged?

55
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,200
- He's in a silver town.
- He can show it live.

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,500
- He got into a silver town.
- Did you get into a silver town?

57
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,260
Why did you go to a silver town
instead of getting a silver button?

58
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,480
Town. Haha, you have
more than 100,000 subscribers.

59
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,340
- That's true.
- He does?

60
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,980
- Right.
- When Haha...

61
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,670
first started his channel,
he was a little...

62
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,370
- He did all sorts of stupid things.
- Exactly.

63
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,390
He has a lot of
painful memories about it.

64
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,560
- It was ridiculous.
- He feels bad about it.

65
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,420
He made his videos like a film,
but no one watched it.

66
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,920
- "Daddy Free".
- It didn't get him subscribers.

67
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,790
- In short...
- No one watched it.

68
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,990
He had no idea about
what things were like in the field.

69
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,630
- He was so out of touch.
- I need videos that fit YouTube.

70
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,490
He just started it
without knowing what's what.

71
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,990
I'm a YouTuber now.

72
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,730
I was really surprised
when he started his channel.

73
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,200
I'll try some eating show next week.

74
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,440
That was funny.

75
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,700
Kwang Soo, you should
also start something.

76
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,300
- Start what?
- YouTube.

77
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,670
You should start working.

78
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,070
I'm working now.

79
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,480
- Really?
- I'm working now.

80
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,170
- These days...
- Kwang Soo will...

81
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,240
start Haduri.

82
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,890
- Why would I start Haduri?
- It's SkyLove.

83
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,350
- That was a long time ago.
- He will start SkyLove.

84
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,790
With a lighter.

85
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,860
Why would I start Haduri
with a webcam?

86
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,080
You can use Cheollian.

87
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,520
Or Nownuri.

88
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,790
With the COVID-19 spreading,
picking up private hobbies...

89
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,260
is more important than ever
these days.

90
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,420
- I agree.
- Exactly.

91
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,830
Today, you will get to learn
different hobbies and win a lottery.

92
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,830
- A lottery?
- That sounds nice.

93
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,570
It's called Lucky Hobbies Race.

94
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,640
"Lucky Hobbies?"

95
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,140
There will be three different
one-day classes today.

96
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,670
- That's nice.
- You'll be divided...

97
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,510
into two teams for each class.

98
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,570
And we will give you lottery tickets
according to your performance.

99
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,920
The lottery works
in the same way as Lotto.

100
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,040
But you have numbers
only from 1 to 10.

101
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,980
That sounds good.
How many numbers should we guess?

102
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,360
We will choose six numbers.

103
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,520
And you will get prizes
according to the results.

104
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,290
- It's worth a shot.
- That sounds great.

105
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,790
There's a way to increase
the chance of winning.

106
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,470
The teachers of each class
will select the best student.

107
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,470
The member who gets picked can
select one of the winning numbers.

108
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,110
That's really good.
We can select a number?

109
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,830
We will draw the winning numbers
with a few of them selected.

110
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,880
I've never bought
a lottery ticket before.

111
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,270
After the class,
you will perform as a team.

112
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,540
And the winner will be decided
by the living legend...

113
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,980
of variety shows,
Camera Director Kang Chan Hee.

114
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,550
(The legend of variety shows,
Camera Director Kang Chan Hee)

115
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,390
(Camera Director Kang Chan Hee
has 35 years of experience.)

116
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,160
I've seen him in variety shows
for over 25 years.

117
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,690
I remember seeing him
in "Dream Team".

118
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,260
He will decide the winner.

119
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,920
He is a legend.

120
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,070
You should be
on "Immortal Songs" soon.

121
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,940
What are they going to do
with his episode?

122
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,830
They usually have legendary singers.

123
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,800
They can sing
Director Kang's favorite songs.

124
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,610
- He's a legend.
- He really is.

125
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,770
He might be a big fan of BTS.

126
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,170
Once Director Kang
picks the winning team,

127
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,670
they will select the best student.

128
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,350
And the losing team will
select the worst student.

129
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,680
- That sounds fierce.
- And...

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,160
the best student gets one extra
ticket while the worst returns one.

131
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,360
Oh, no.

132
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,050
Let me show you today's prize then.

133
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,900
- I'm curious.
- What is it?

134
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,100
They offer great prizes these days.

135
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,670
The fact that they're
revealing them now...

136
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,290
- It's Korean beef.
- What is it? Meat?

137
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,190
- It's gold.
- Do we get gold?

138
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,710
- Seriously?
- If you get all six numbers right,

139
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,360
you will get 40g of gold.

140
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,610
- Really?
- Yes.

141
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,230
How much would this be?

142
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,910
If it's 40g,
it's about 3,000 dollars.

143
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,980
If there's more than one winner,
they will have to share the prize.

144
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,480
We should share the gold.

145
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,920
Those who get five numbers right
will get Korean beef.

146
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,480
- Even second place is good.
- And third place...

147
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,520
gets a box of peaches.

148
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,920
- Do we really get the prizes?
- Sure.

149
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,180
- And we don't have guests today.
- We have no guests today.

150
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,550
- These are for us.
- Right.

151
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,290
- I'll give you three tickets each.
- It will be fun.

152
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,620
You get three tickets each.

153
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,900
Just get me one.

154
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,100
Three tickets per person.

155
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,190
- Three tickets each?
- Yes.

156
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,710
- Here you are.
- Okay.

157
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,970
- Here.
- Thank you.

158
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,340
Okay.

159
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,580
- Are they three?
- Yes.

160
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,870
I guess I'll get
a few numbers right.

161
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,350
- Are they three?
- Yes.

162
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,940
- The number...
- We have leftovers.

163
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,150
- Really?
- You didn't give me mine, you fool.

164
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,170
(You didn't give me mine, you fool.)

165
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,720
- Why are you swearing at him?
- It's not like that.

166
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,880
Why are you so upset?

167
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,610
I wasn't swearing.
I was being friendly.

168
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,090
- You don't have to be upset.
- You didn't get one?

169
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,090
Let's go take our first class then.

170
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

171
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,660
(They head to
the first hobby class.)

172
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,620
(What is the first class about?)

173
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,100
- Is this it?
- Yes.

174
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,270
What's what?

175
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,830
(What's all this?)

176
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,840
What's going on?

177
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,100
(Some people greet
the members shouting out loud.)

178
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,110
Hello, ma'am.

179
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,210
- Who are they?
- The other day...

180
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,610
Hello.

181
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,170
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

182
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,080
(The first class, yodel)

183
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,350
(Lee Eun Kyung is the doyenne
of Korean yodel songs.)

184
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,350
("Park Sung Ho Became a Yodel Singer
Thanks to Lee Eun Kyung")

185
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,040
("Lee Eun Kyung Works to Improve
the Status of Korean Culture")

186
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,050
(She was also Pengsoo
and Haha's yodel teacher.)

187
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,420
(Kang Dong Hye and Lee Eun Kyung)

188
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,680
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

189
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,250
- Attention.
- Yes, ma'am.

190
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,290
(Is this a close-order drill?)

191
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,830
- Yodel.
- Yodel.

192
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,100
(They thought they would
learn how to yodel.)

193
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,290
- At ease.
- At ease.

194
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,400
- At ease.
- Yodel.

195
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,410
- Yodel.
- Attention.

196
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,170
(The teacher seems
somewhat extraordinary.)

197
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,280
Bow.

198
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,710
- Hello.
- Hello.

199
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,870
That was so cool.

200
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,910
- You guys are the best.
- She sounds cheerful.

201
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,910
She's very energetic.

202
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,670
- You guys are the best.
- Thank you.

203
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,350
- You're the best.
- So...

204
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,150
Ms. Lee Eun Kyung is
Pengsoo's yodel teacher.

205
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,090
- I see.
- Right.

206
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,590
I used to be in a children's show,
"Ppoppoppo".

207
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,980
"Ppoppoppo?"

208
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,530
Do you remember her now?

209
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,830
How long have you been doing this?

210
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,690
It's been only 38 years.

211
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,230
- Really?
- Yes.

212
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,270
(She has 38 years
of experience in yodel.)

213
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,170
I started it
when I was in her belly,

214
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,290
- so it's about...
- Are you her daughter?

215
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,610
- Really?
- Yes, I am.

216
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,080
It's three generations old.

217
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,630
Will you stay quiet?

218
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,110
- Just stay still.
- It's three generations.

219
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,080
So three generations
of your family are doing this?

220
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,040
That's what I just said.

221
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,680
- Stay quiet.
- Yes, that's right.

222
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,350
And you did this.
What's the difference?

223
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,590
- They are yodel masters.
- Right.

224
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,980
So you're her daughter.

225
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,420
Yes. Nice to meet you.

226
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,830
Let's hear the teachers yodel first.

227
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,160
Let's do that.

228
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
(Excited)

229
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,620
This is really nice.

230
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,670
You can dance.

231
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,610
(Jaw-dropping)

232
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,730
(Clapping her hands)

233
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,780
My goodness.

234
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,410
Her falsetto voice is impressive.

235
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,080
(Her yodel captivates their eyes
and ears from the beginning.)

236
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,650
- She's amazing.
- It's unbelievable.

237
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,460
(The yodel master steps up.)

238
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,790
All right. Let's walk together.

239
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,990
(Fascinated)

240
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,290
(They are so into
the charm of yodel.)

241
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,670
(They are done...)

242
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,560
(falling for yodel.)

243
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,210
Yodel! Yodel!

244
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,800
- Yodel! Yodel!
- Yodel! Yodel!

245
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,230
- I love it.
- I got goosebumps.

246
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,800
- That was amazing.
- Yodel!

247
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,480
This is really exciting.

248
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,650
It was the best.

249
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,580
- Thank you.
- They are great.

250
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,180
You will put on some costumes...

251
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,050
and learn how to yodel.

252
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,680
So Min looks good.

253
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,530
- You look beautiful.
- It fits you nicely.

254
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,920
She's pretty.

255
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,290
- Now you should learn how to yodel.
- Yes.

256
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,530
Yodel is all about making
a good chest voice.

257
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,900
- Yo, yo, yo.
- Yo, yo, yo.

258
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,400
- Ya, ya, ya.
- Ya, ya, ya.

259
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,790
- Ye, ye, ye.
- Ye, ye, ye.

260
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,970
- This is the chest voice.
- Let's do this.

261
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,340
This time, let the air
through your nose.

262
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,080
(Singing together)

263
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,680
My goodness. That's good.

264
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,550
- Perfect. That's how you do it.
- Ms. Lee.

265
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,680
Yes, you can ask me any questions.

266
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,090
- Am I doing it right?
- That's good.

267
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,750
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

268
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,590
Hey, stop it.

269
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,650
You two, stay away from each other.

270
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,190
- Why? Are we too loud?
- Se Chan, come over here.

271
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,830
- Come here.
- I'm sorry.

272
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,230
They do that
whenever they're standing together.

273
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,360
(I'll see you again soon,
my brother.)

274
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,600
- They're both great. That was good.
- Yes.

275
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,700
- The most important thing is "ay".
- "Ay".

276
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,160
Once you master singing "ay",
you're ready to yodel.

277
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,310
- "Ay".
- Watch my mouth.

278
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,210
(They're trying to sing as she did.)

279
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,110
One of you didn't smile.

280
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,850
- Who?
- Kwang Soo didn't smile.

281
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,220
- Hey, Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo didn't smile.

282
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,090
- Me?
- Hey, smile a little bit, will you?

283
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,650
That's good. Great job.

284
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,510
You should always smile.

285
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,860
- Of course.
- Stop smiling.

286
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,250
- You should smile while yodeling.
- Stop smiling.

287
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,360
Se Chan, your gums might dry out.

288
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,830
What is wrong with him now?
Move aside.

289
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,100
Move aside.

290
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,130
Repeat after me.

291
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,070
(They put a smile on their faces,
and class began again.)

292
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,900
(Ho-ho-ho, yo-yo)

293
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,110
Now, try this.

294
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,580
I'm sorry to interrupt,

295
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,180
but do people usually learn to yodel
in a large group like this?

296
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,850
- Is this normal?
- My ears hurt.

297
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,640
- My ears hurt so much.
- I mean,

298
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,240
- does everyone learn this way?
- I have something to say.

299
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,320
- I'll tell you one thing.
- Go ahead.

300
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,980
I met her not long ago.

301
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,720
I took her class
with six-year-old children.

302
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,360
And we're learning
exactly the same as I did then.

303
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,280
- It's exactly the same.
- Can we get another teacher?

304
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,650
- It's exactly the same.
- I know.

305
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,930
The average age of us is 40.

306
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,120
- That's so funny.
- Together.

307
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,260
(The yodel lesson that covers
all generations resumes.)

308
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,470
This is yodeling.

309
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,070
You've learned everything.

310
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,530
All you need to learn is
how to sing "ay" and "oh".

311
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,260
One more important thing.

312
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,340
"Yo-la..."

313
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,870
(Yo-la-la-la-di-oh)

314
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,000
- Good. You've learned everything.
- Yes.

315
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,080
- You can start singing now.
- Really?

316
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,240
- Are you sure? Already?
- You're ready now.

317
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,980
- I don't think we're ready yet.
- You've learned everything.

318
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,350
- You don't think you can?
- No, I don't.

319
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,380
She's like a gambler.

320
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,590
It feels like she's skipping
several steps.

321
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,060
I'm so anxious. I feel like
I'm being chased.

322
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,120
My back is sweating.

323
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,560
- You see...
- I'm feeling so hot right now.

324
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,390
- I'm sweating a lot.
- She's moving on so fast.

325
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,890
- Of course. We don't have time.
- That's true.

326
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,630
- Shall we try to sing?
- Okay.

327
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,970
I bet you all have heard this song.
It's a very famous yodel song.

328
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,730
- Yes, I know this song.
- It's an Austrian folk song.

329
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,400
I'll sing it for you first.

330
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,640
Listen carefully.

331
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,870
(Listen carefully
since you'll perform later.)

332
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,780
(Searching for a mountain valley)

333
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,280
(Where water flows)

334
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,800
(I walk in the forest)

335
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,160
(It always makes me so happy)

336
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,100
(I sing a joyful song)

337
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,260
This is the hardest part.

338
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,130
There she goes.

339
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,770
(Yodel-lay-di-oh, lay-di-oh,
lay-di-oh, lay-di-oh, lay-doo-ri-di)

340
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,770
That's all.

341
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,550
(She sang such a difficult song
effortlessly.)

342
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,410
- That was fantastic.
- She yodels so easily.

343
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,850
- That was beautiful.
- Indeed.

344
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,280
- She sang it so easily.
- Really?

345
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,510
- That tickled my ears.
- That was beautiful.

346
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,190
- Really? Was it beautiful?
- Yes, it was perfect.

347
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,750
The two of them...

348
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,490
look like a newlywed couple...

349
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,150
who are visiting Austria
on their honeymoon.

350
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,970
With her?

351
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,070
- In Austria...
- He's a photographer.

352
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,100
Right?

353
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,840
They look like a newlywed couple.

354
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,810
The husband seems rich.

355
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,340
- He looks rich?
- He looks rich.

356
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,580
I'm a rich man.

357
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,680
(Love? I'll buy it with my money.)

358
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,140
Are you going to learn how to yodel?

359
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,500
- Yes.
- I see.

360
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,320
You're all too talkative.

361
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,910
- You're more talkative than us.
- Focus.

362
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,510
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- Jae Suk is right.

363
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,010
- She's our guest, but...
- She keeps complaining.

364
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,060
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

365
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,590
(Repeat after me.)

366
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,060
Oh, my. I sang with Jae Suk.
I'm so happy.

367
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,990
- Really?
- Of course.

368
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,860
I enjoyed singing with you as well.

369
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,360
- I love you.
- Likewise.

370
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,730
I don't think he did so well.

371
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,840
I see. Okay. Let's move on.

372
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,530
- "I see."
- Let's sing.

373
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,500
(She responded half-heartedly.)

374
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,610
(Kwang Soo got upset.)

375
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,010
- She won't listen to you.
- Gosh, I'm so upset.

376
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
- I'm so jealous!
- Calm down.

377
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,980
- She doesn't care.
- Your words don't mean anything.

378
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,010
But how could she...

379
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,880
- Just don't say anything.
- I'm so frustrated.

380
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,250
(The 36-year-old Kwang Soo
wants attention like a little boy.)

381
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,620
This song has every element
of yodeling.

382
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,200
And what we're going to do
at the end is...

383
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,390
to imitate animals you like.

384
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,570
- Animals?
- Yes, animals.

385
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,160
- Any kind?
- Any animal you like.

386
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,230
- I'll imitate an elk.
- I'll do a pigeon.

387
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,340
Show me. Ready, go.

388
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,900
That's great.

389
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,160
Imitate an elk for me.

390
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,500
(Imitating an elk)

391
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,580
(He's the first person to imitate
an elk on a TV show.)

392
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,500
- An elk actually makes that sound.
- It's true.

393
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,610
- Right.
- Really?

394
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,870
- But can the elk smile?
- Yes?

395
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,950
(He's smiling this time.)

396
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,980
That's great.

397
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,880
- That's how an elk actually sounds.
- Okay. Which animal?

398
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,620
- I'll be an elephant.
- Okay. Ready, go.

399
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,860
(An elephant is here!)

400
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,930
- Good job.
- Is this...

401
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,160
Is this a talent show or what?

402
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,940
- He's trying to impress Ms. Lee.
- That's not true.

403
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,440
He's showing off.

404
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,630
- We're all so enthusiastic.
- Which animal?

405
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,660
- A dolphin.
- A dolphin? Ready, go.

406
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,580
(She's making
a high-pitched scream.)

407
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,850
- Did you imitate Jeon Do Yeon?
- That was good.

408
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,240
I like that.

409
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,320
- "I can shoot you."
- She's a pretty dolphin.

410
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,780
Let us divide into teams now,
Ms. Lee.

411
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,090
- Will you?
- Yes.

412
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,590
Ms. Kang, please help them.

413
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,590
(Team Lee Eun Kyung,
Team Kang Dong Hye)

414
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,750
(The two teams are practicing
separately.)

415
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,200
(They learn to sing
the easy part effortlessly.)

416
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,930
<i>- Where water flows
- Where water flows</i>

417
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,390
(He's making nasal sound
while singing.)

418
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,730
(Team Jong Kook is
practicing hard as well.)

419
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,210
(Extremely enthusiastic)

420
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,080
- Hey, be quiet.
- What?

421
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,230
We're practicing here.

422
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,350
- We're practicing too.
- We're practicing here.

423
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,080
- We're practicing too.
- Do not interfere us.

424
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,910
Which family restaurant
do you guys work at?

425
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,910
(Their clothes look like a family
restaurant's staff uniform.)

426
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,950
We don't work at a restaurant.

427
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,740
We're preparing for the contest.

428
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,690
- He has a point.
- Outback Steakhouse.

429
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,410
We'll start practicing.
So please keep it down.

430
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,750
We need to practice too.

431
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,060
- Then...
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

432
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,150
Together.

433
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,330
(Team Jae Suk starts
practicing again excitedly.)

434
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,860
Let's sing the next part together.

435
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,940
(Yo-ro-ro, lay-di-eh, ee-di-oh-oo,
di-eh-ee-ri, oh-oo-di-eh)

436
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,760
(He sticks his tongue out
while lip-syncing.)

437
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,400
(They've reached
the first difficult part.)

438
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,310
(And the song continues.)

439
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,550
- This is really difficult.
- Yes, indeed.

440
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,450
In 3, 4.

441
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,250
(They're practicing
the difficult part intensively.)

442
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,860
(My gosh. What are they doing?)

443
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,980
- Do something funny instead.
- Okay.

444
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,860
- How about this?
- Yes, I'll do that.

445
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,520
Okay. We're done, right?

446
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,200
- Next...
- What's the melody in this part?

447
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,800
Please let us listen to the melody.

448
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,860
(Team Jong Kook is
practicing the latter part.)

449
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,130
Just make sure
to make plosive sounds.

450
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,760
It sounds like a techno song.
I like it.

451
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,440
- 1, 2. Don't you like it?
- Indeed.

452
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,400
(They suddenly start
doing techno music dance.)

453
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,610
(Shy)

454
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,210
(The last few bars are
their favorite part.)

455
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,610
Put emphasis on the last bar.

456
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,770
We should practice that part too.

457
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,720
- Okay.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

458
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,240
(They're walking
toward the other team.)

459
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,610
Stop. What are you doing?

460
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,860
(They're trying to
strike sparks off each other.)

461
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,980
You shouldn't cross the line.

462
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,250
Ms. Lee, please let us
do the same thing.

463
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,520
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Let's go.

464
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,430
(Counterattack)

465
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,160
(The elk is running forward.)

466
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,890
(They look like they're playing
a children's game.)

467
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,710
(Jae Suk kicked Kwang Soo's hips.)

468
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,530
- All right. Good job, everyone.
- That was good.

469
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,980
(They're practicing again
after the war of nerves.)

470
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,240
(Looking serious)

471
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,910
- This is really difficult.
- Shall we try singing together?

472
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,220
- Let's sing together.
- It's so difficult.

473
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,410
(So Min and Se Chan are
practicing the hardest part.)

474
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,860
That sounds so creepy.

475
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,010
(They just need to nail that part.)

476
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,060
(They're confident in singing
the last part.)

477
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,090
- Okay.
- Great.

478
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,590
- My, that was good.
- I can sing it now.

479
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,750
The competition will begin shortly.

480
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,860
Just as I said earlier,

481
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,860
Director Kang
will decide the winning team.

482
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,990
It's Immortal Chan Hee.

483
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,260
- Immortal Chan Hee?
- Immortal Chan Hee?

484
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,360
- That sounds nice.
- Right?

485
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,080
- Immortal Chan Hee.
- Immortal Chan Hee.

486
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,080
Regardless of the result, your
teachers will pick the best student.

487
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,450
- You go first.
- It's okay. Don't worry.

488
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,550
Oh, my. My adorable team.

489
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,590
- You can do it.
- Should I lift it up like this?

490
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,220
Please move a half step back.

491
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,780
(They practiced as hard
as they could in a short time.)

492
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,250
- Will you play it for them?
- We practiced with it.

493
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,750
I'll do that.

494
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,960
(Will they be able to
shine on stage?)

495
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,650
The first performance
will begin shortly.

496
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,260
(The long-awaited first performance)

497
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,840
(Searching for a mountain valley)

498
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,130
(Where water flows)

499
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,870
(Flaring his nostrils)

500
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,720
(I walk in the forest)

501
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,220
(It always makes me so happy)

502
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,520
(He doesn't look happy.)

503
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,710
(It always makes me so happy)

504
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,650
<i>I sing a joyful song</i>

505
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,920
(They finished the first verse
smoothly under So Min's lead.)

506
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,690
(Terrible body roll)

507
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,100
Why is he dancing like this?

508
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,270
(Se Chan sang Kwang Soo's part
by mistake.)

509
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,540
(He forgets his mistake
and concentrates again.)

510
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,510
(They have reached
the most difficult part.)

511
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,640
- I feel dizzy.
- Good job.

512
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,790
(It's hard to catch your breath
or control your tongue.)

513
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,290
This is the difficult part.

514
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,450
(Will they be able to
pull off this part?)

515
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,150
(It's a total mess.)

516
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,960
(They lost motivation.)

517
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,500
(They're singing the wrong lyrics.)

518
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,130
This is a total mess.

519
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,610
(Is this a newly developed
yodeling technique?)

520
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,310
(Yodel-oh-hoo-hoo, ri-oh-lay-di-oh,
yodel-oh-hoo-di-ri, ri-oh-lay-di-oh)

521
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,400
(What's that?)

522
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,580
(When it's too difficult to sing,
he imitates an elk instead.)

523
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,090
(It's a disaster.)

524
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,950
(Finally, they're singing the part
they're confident in.)

525
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,650
(They recovered their confidence
while dancing a techno dance.)

526
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,000
That's not yodeling.

527
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,100
(The ones that are watching them
feel embarrassed.)

528
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,220
That's embarrassing.

529
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,300
(She goes overboard.)

530
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,510
(The Alps girl has turned
into the Techno Amazon.)

531
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,310
What's this mess?

532
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,370
This is ridiculous.

533
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,670
(They finish the performance
with some animal noises.)

534
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,250
We will show you
what real yodel is.

535
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,640
Let me show you. Just move over.

536
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,850
We will show you what real yodel is.

537
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,880
Gosh, this is...

538
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,050
Do you think this is a joke?

539
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,360
I get that we didn't have
enough time, but you can't do this.

540
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,920
It's harder than you think.
You should try.

541
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,000
- I've never heard the MR.
- Why did you dance techno here?

542
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,360
- I've never heard the MR.
- Don't belittle our performance.

543
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,360
- I didn't know when to start.
- Me neither. I didn't do it right.

544
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,660
Immortal Chan Hee,
please enjoy our performance.

545
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,960
This is "Immortal Songs"
with Kang Chan Hee.

546
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,340
We should say hello first.

547
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,240
Please push the key.

548
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,510
Good.

549
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,640
Chan Hee.

550
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,550
Kang Chan Hee!

551
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,020
(They are trying to flatter him.)

552
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,350
Why are they
flattering him like that?

553
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,640
They are pulling off some tricks.

554
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,490
Why would they say Kang Chan Hee?

555
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,560
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

556
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,060
Can we say hello in a yodeling way?

557
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,120
(Without flattering)

558
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,560
Bow.

559
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,600
(They've been saying hello
for 5 minutes.)

560
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,030
<i>Kang Chan Hee</i>

561
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,420
<i>Please live a long and healthy life</i>

562
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,100
(I just want to
hear you sing yodel.)

563
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,460
(Searching for a mountain valley)

564
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,900
(Where water flows)

565
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,370
(He's too into the song.)

566
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,850
Gosh, it's a mess.

567
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,820
(I walk in the forest)

568
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,850
My gosh.

569
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,290
(It always makes me so happy)

570
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,180
(I sing a joyful song)

571
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,390
(The middle-aged man
with a nasal voice steps up.)

572
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,030
(This is exciting.)

573
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,930
They can't pull this off.

574
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,340
(They are reaching
the most difficult part.)

575
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,870
(Se Chan had a meltdown
singing this part.)

576
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,940
(We will show you
what real yodel is.)

577
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,910
(They give up too soon.)

578
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,880
(Let's just move on like this.)

579
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,420
(This isn't right.)

580
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
I can't believe this.

581
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,060
(It's a mess.)

582
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,800
(This is the part
that they are most confident at.)

583
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,860
(It's time for the finale.)

584
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,770
Kang Chan Hee! Kang Chan Hee!

585
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,540
<i>Kang Chan Hee</i>

586
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,010
That was amazing.

587
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,170
The best student of the winning team
will get an extra ticket.

588
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,910
- Okay.
- The worst student will return one.

589
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,910
All right.

590
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,820
Director Kang Chan Hee.

591
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,820
(It's time to make a choice.)

592
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,150
Please pick the first winning team.

593
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,650
Please just consider
our singing abilities.

594
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,830
- Based on our singing abilities.
- Please make a fair decision.

595
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,120
- With no flattery.
- Sure.

596
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,190
He will zoom in. Be ready.

597
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,650
This is the old way.

598
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
(He will pick the winning team
with the camera.)

599
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,770
Are they the winners?

600
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,430
- Which one?
- We used the MR.

601
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,190
(The team caught
in the camera wins.)

602
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,360
Which team?

603
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,510
(Team Jae Suk wins.)

604
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,610
- I think...
<i>- Kang Chan Hee</i>

605
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,610
<i>- A long and healthy life
- Kang Chan Hee</i>

606
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,020
You can't score us
based on flattery.

607
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,520
<i>- Kang Chan Hee
</i>- He fell for their flattery.

608
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,990
I didn't know
you liked stuff like that.

609
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,050
- We had no idea.
- You just like to be flattered.

610
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,090
If I knew, I would've
prepared some money.

611
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,290
- Bring some money.
- He's right.

612
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,060
He likes flattery.

613
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,420
It wasn't because of flattery.

614
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
- That's not it.
- Tell us why you picked them.

615
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,420
Suk Jin might know this,
but back then,

616
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,740
we used to have a lot of
yodel show when we were young.

617
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,770
- Like children's shows.
- That's true.

618
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,930
- And it was always fun.
- I agree.

619
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,780
Both teams weren't
good enough to be examined,

620
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,310
but Team Jae Suk
made it sound more similar...

621
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,050
to real yodeling songs.

622
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,550
Immortal Chan Hee!

623
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,850
<i>Thank you</i>

624
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,950
We should've done things like that.

625
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,380
We should've made
deep bows and everything.

626
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,450
I should've tried
something like camera dance.

627
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,620
- I should've done something.
- I know.

628
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,330
(I didn't pick them
because of the flattery.)

629
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,330
Now the teachers will
have a discussion...

630
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,430
and pick the top student who gets
to choose a lottery number.

631
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,540
Meanwhile, the losing team
will pick the best student,

632
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,970
and the winning team
will pick the worst student.

633
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,170
(The winning team gets to pick
the worst student.)

634
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,640
Then we should...

635
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,320
Is it Se Chan or So Min?

636
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,580
- So Min was a little over the line.
- I agree.

637
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,020
(They are discussing seriously.)

638
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,210
We should mention
Suk Jin's name first.

639
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,860
They seem very serious.

640
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,990
They are serious.

641
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,380
All right. Should we announce
the best student first?

642
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,420
- We were unanimous on this.
- It was very close though.

643
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,260
- We picked the one who sang well.
- We picked it seriously.

644
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,120
1, 2, and 3.

645
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,220
- Ji Suk Jin...
- Okay. Thank you.

646
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,270
- is out.
- is out.

647
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,570
(Ji Suk Jin is out.)

648
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,700
- You're out.
- He's out?

649
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,840
You're out.

650
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,630
- Is he out?
- This is fun.

651
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,280
I hated it that he sang well.

652
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,580
- You were so good that I hated it.
- That was close.

653
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,250
- Is he out?
- He made it so close.

654
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,900
- By only 1 vote.
- By only 1 vote.

655
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,470
- This one is real.
- We will announce the real one.

656
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,610
1, 2, and 3.

657
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,210
- Haha!
- Haha! Congratulations.

658
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,210
Really?

659
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,410
I can't believe this.

660
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,450
- Well done.
- What's the reason?

661
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,790
- Did he sing well?
- He didn't show off.

662
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,060
He didn't overstep the line.

663
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,390
He didn't show off.

664
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,620
I'm disappointed.

665
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,920
We agonized between two members.

666
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,360
- 1, 2, and 3.
- 1, 2, and 3.

667
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,040
- Jeon So Min, it's you.
- Jeon So Min, it's you.

668
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,860
(The worst student
of the yodel class is Jeon So Min.)

669
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,780
- Me? Really?
- My gosh.

670
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,170
Yes. We hated the techno dance.

671
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,780
- I hated the dance.
- Why?

672
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,250
(It's because of
the ugly techno dance.)

673
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,670
The thing is...

674
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,780
Right. I hate it so much.

675
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,290
- Me?
- It didn't sound like yodel.

676
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,290
I agree.

677
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,210
What do you know about yodel?

678
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,610
Why are you being so serious?

679
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,290
- You even bit your lips.
- I know about yodel.

680
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,650
I learned it
from these two teachers.

681
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,390
- I did learn it.
- It's Yudel for you.

682
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,620
- Yudel.
- Yudel? That makes sense.

683
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,740
So Min, you should give
one ticket to Haha then.

684
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,770
(One of So Min's tickets
goes to Haha.)

685
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,610
And the top student
selected by the teachers...

686
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,280
- can pick one lottery number.
- This is the most important one.

687
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,900
You can pick one student
regardless of the results.

688
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,780
(Who will be selected
as the top student by the teachers?)

689
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,780
Here I go.

690
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,990
Who will it be?

691
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,150
(Singing)

692
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,680
- What?
- So Min?

693
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,260
It's Jeon So Min!

694
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,260
(So Min is picked by the teachers.)

695
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,690
Let me tell you the reason.

696
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,570
- So Min was good though.
- She was very passionate.

697
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,600
- And I appreciate her creativity.
- Thank you.

698
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,130
It was really cool.

699
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,460
- Congratulations.
- You're at an advantage now.

700
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,540
Right.

701
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,310
So Min, you can pick a number now.

702
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,780
You better not share it
with other members.

703
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,250
Pick your favorite number.

704
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,870
So Min, pick seven.

705
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,870
- A number? What were the numbers?
- From 1 to 10.

706
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,250
(She has the privilege
of picking 1 of the 6 numbers.)

707
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,090
(The number So Min picks is...)

708
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,990
So Min has picked a number.

709
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,380
You will be divided
into two teams for the next class.

710
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,650
And here are the key words.

711
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,720
What are they?

712
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,860
You can pick
either Brazil or Hawaii.

713
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,960
- Samba!
- Brazil.

714
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,100
(They each pick
a key word they like.)

715
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,160
(Brazil: Jae Suk, Haha,
So Min, Se Chan)

716
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,770
(Hawaii: Suk Jin, Jong Kook,
Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo)

717
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,930
(Suk Jin, Jong Kook, Jo Hyo,
and Kwang Soo picked Hawaii.)

718
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,110
(There's a beautiful beach
next to the blue Pacific ocean.)

719
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,080
- Where is it?
- Over here.

720
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,170
(What is the class
for the members who picked Hawaii?)

721
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,250
Okay.

722
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,410
(They are surprised
as soon as they come in.)

723
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,440
- Gosh.
- What?

724
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,490
Hello. Aloha.

725
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,520
(Hula dance teacher, Che Che)

726
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,150
- As soon as I walked in,
- Hello.

727
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,990
- I smelled the tanning lotion.
- I bet you went to a tanning shop.

728
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,420
It's the smell of a tanning shop.

729
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,030
Did you go there today?

730
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,760
- Did you get tanned today?
- Ma'am.

731
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,830
Yes.

732
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,360
- Hello.
- I can smell that.

733
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,740
It's the smell of tanning oil.

734
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,770
How many awards have you won?

735
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,740
It's from 2008 to 2019.

736
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,960
From 2008 to 2019?

737
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,200
- You have an impressive record.
- Thank you.

738
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,050
She's the best hula and Tahitian
dance teacher in Korea, Che Che.

739
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,750
We're meeting a legend.

740
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,640
- She's Che Che.
- Thank you.

741
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,590
I'm really curious.
Can we really do this?

742
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,590
Of course you can.

743
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,760
Because I'm teaching you.

744
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,330
To be honest, all of us
except one are horrible dancers.

745
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,420
- Who's the one?
- Because...

746
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,390
You can do this.
I will try my best to teach you.

747
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,960
We need to learn the basics.

748
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,540
Let me tell you about hula first.

749
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,430
Hula dance was considered
a religious and linguistic...

750
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,970
performance dedicated to ancestors.

751
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,440
Ancient Hawaiians had no letters.

752
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,710
- Instead of using letters...
- They used body language.

753
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,440
Right. They communicated
with gestures and songs.

754
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,290
About 250 years ago, they started
to adopt the Western culture.

755
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,360
You know about a ukulele, right?

756
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,360
- We know it.
- I love ukuleles.

757
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,160
They developed the hula dance
with the ukulele, guitar, and piano.

758
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,300
It's called Hula Auana.
Today, you will...

759
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,800
Excuse me, but you're out of breath.
Do you want some water?

760
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,340
- You're talking a lot.
- You need to breathe.

761
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,900
You can take your time.

762
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,010
I know you are a good speaker.

763
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,110
- She's speaking without resting.
- I know.

764
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,750
- I guess you do this a lot.
- She's like a machine.

765
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,610
I wanted to tell you
all this before I forget.

766
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,710
- Before you forget?
- I see.

767
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,820
- Drink some water.
- Please drink some water.

768
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,360
Okay. Thank you.

769
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,610
She sounds very polite.

770
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,060
- Well...
- Gosh.

771
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,760
Hang on.

772
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,420
She's a lot of work.

773
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,000
She just spilled
a lot of water here.

774
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,070
She just had a sip of water,

775
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,860
- I know.
- but she spilled almost half of it.

776
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,100
My gosh.

777
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,360
(Shy)

778
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,310
- Wipe it.
- I was nervous.

779
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,280
I like the look on her face.

780
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,780
Are you always like that?
Is it something you need for hula?

781
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,250
You can't deliver your message
only with hand motions.

782
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,050
For example, do you know
the word, "aloha"?

783
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,640
This is the hand motion for "aloha".

784
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,610
- It's like covering your heart.
- It's love.

785
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,360
And you can't do it
with a straight face.

786
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,290
- You look scary.
- It's scary, isn't it?

787
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,000
So you should do it
with a big smile on your face.

788
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,460
Think of your family or lover.

789
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,600
(Thanks to the hula class,
they greet each other with a smile.)

790
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,690
Good. That's nice.

791
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,690
By the way,

792
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,740
why does he look so scary?

793
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,010
- What's his problem?
- He seems nervous.

794
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,400
- I think he looks nice.
- What's with him?

795
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,810
- Will you dance looking like that?
- You look scary.

796
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,080
It's terrifying.

797
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,410
The guys should
wear a little makeup...

798
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,050
for hula dance.

799
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,250
- Really?
- Hula makeup?

800
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,410
She will put it on you.

801
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,260
You will be
performing hula later.

802
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,180
So I'll make you look
more like Hawaiians.

803
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,190
- To have a strong impression.
- Okay.

804
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,330
A strong impression.

805
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,720
I've never done this before,

806
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,800
- so I'm a little worried.
- Should they look scary?

807
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,100
Hang on. I just heard you mumble.

808
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,460
I heard you say you're worried
because this is your first time.

809
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,740
Did I mishear it?

810
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,780
Because most students in my class
are women...

811
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,630
- That's okay.
- Don't worry. Relax.

812
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,750
- It's okay.
- Okay.

813
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,370
- This is the most nerve-racking.
- Oh, my.

814
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,750
My, it seems so difficult.

815
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,440
You poked my eye about 30 times
in such a short moment.

816
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,490
I guess it really is her first time.

817
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,760
- I thought she has a lot of...
- The eyeliner?

818
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,180
experience as she talks so well.

819
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,290
- She hasn't put makeup on others.
- She poked my eye 30 times.

820
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,360
Suk Jin, please sit here.
I'll do it for you.

821
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,690
- Me?
- Yes.

822
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,830
I think you're applying eyeliner
too thick.

823
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,770
This is how you should
apply eyeliner.

824
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,660
- It's not bad.
- I'm done.

825
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,360
- Hey.
- Honestly, it's not bad at all.

826
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,840
- Suk Jin.
- Am I a beggar?

827
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,810
- It doesn't look bad.
- Darn.

828
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,310
Jong Kook doesn't need to look
any tougher than he does now.

829
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,580
Aren't his eyes too small
to put makeup on them?

830
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,050
That's not true.

831
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,780
- Really? It must be hard.
- Yes.

832
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,110
Your eyes look really wide.
It's no joke.

833
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,880
We thought you guys only have
a vague idea of hula dance,

834
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,030
so before the class,
she'll give a demonstration.

835
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,530
- She'll give a demonstration.
- Yes.

836
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,300
- Okay. It's a beautiful dance.
- I saw the dance only once...

837
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,890
when I went on a trip to Hawaii.

838
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,190
Right? We rarely get to see it.

839
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,360
(What song will Team Hawaii dance to
to compete against Team Brazil?)

840
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,600
- I even like the song too.
- It's a hula song.

841
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,300
("Ulupalakua")

842
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,010
(A song about Mount Ulupalakua
where a cowboy's house is)

843
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,810
(Her smile and gentle hand movements
bring Hawaii into the studio.)

844
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,340
This makes me feel so relaxed.

845
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,310
(Relaxed)

846
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,710
(Smooth movements
as if water is flowing...)

847
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,590
(and nonstop gentle steps are the
elements that make hula special.)

848
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,820
I've seen this dance move before.

849
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,380
(Hula, hula)

850
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,000
- Look at her smile. It's pretty.
- She's amazing.

851
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,360
She won't stop smiling.

852
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,770
We're going to have to smile
the whole time.

853
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,500
(Facial expressions to express
love and gratitude...)

854
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,190
(make hula charming.)

855
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,010
(They're trying to dance like her.)

856
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,010
Oh, I have to lift my leg up here.

857
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,670
(This is "Ulupalakua",
the song they'll dance to.)

858
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,440
- I've only seen it in a movie.
- Exactly.

859
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,280
If we pull this off...

860
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,110
- But it seems so difficult.
- I know.

861
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,320
- You use your whole body to dance.
- Right.

862
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,360
I think all of you are good at using
your bodies and will learn fast.

863
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,390
However, describing what lyrics say
with your face is important too.

864
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,800
- So we're going to practice...
- We have to smile.

865
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,920
- doing that first.
- I'm sorry,

866
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,190
but is he doing it right?

867
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,190
Gosh, what a sight.

868
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,110
- Gosh, seriously.
- What a sight.

869
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,570
- I think...
- That's a weird smile.

870
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,310
You look unusually ugly today.

871
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,280
- If you could...
- Your eyes are not visible.

872
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,400
- His eyes are almost closed.
- He looks so ugly.

873
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,010
That's funny.

874
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,580
That's how she looked earlier.

875
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,280
I think that's a good start.

876
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,410
I'll tell you
a few different emotions...

877
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,020
so you can practice to make
facial expressions to describe them.

878
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,180
- Understood.
- Okay.

879
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,720
First, describe
love, joy, and gratitude...

880
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,620
without using your body.

881
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,890
Try to describe it
only with your facial expression.

882
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,570
- Love.
- Right. Love.

883
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,630
(Love)

884
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,860
Joy.

885
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,170
(Joy)

886
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,200
Gratitude.

887
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,110
You can't use your body.

888
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,310
You shouldn't use your body.

889
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,010
She's pickier than expected.

890
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,490
It's to focus on your face.

891
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,790
- Shall I give it a try? Love.
- Yes.

892
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,610
Oh, that's how much
you love your wife.

893
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,620
- I express my love just this much.
- No wonder...

894
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,560
- you never get a call from her.
- Please try to express more.

895
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,360
Subtle expressions of love
help your relationship last longer.

896
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,220
- Express joy again.
- Joy?

897
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,770
Imagine your wife is away
to visit her parents.

898
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,000
(Imagine your wife is away
to visit her parents.)

899
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,930
(Exhilarated)

900
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,840
I knew it. You look so happy.

901
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,310
- That's how joy should look.
- I did it unintentionally.

902
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,900
It's hard to describe emotions.

903
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,640
Ji Hyo, it's your turn. Love.

904
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,310
What's that?

905
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,910
- What's that?
- That's love?

906
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,050
- That's not love.
- Why are you giving a signal?

907
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,750
- To whom...
- It's because it's all dried up.

908
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,380
But I think she did a good job
in making eye contact.

909
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,380
- I see.
- I got a compliment.

910
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,910
- Kwang Soo.
- Last but not least.

911
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,030
Love.

912
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,760
(Love)

913
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,360
- Joy.
- Joy.

914
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,830
(Joy)

915
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,920
Gratitude.

916
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,300
(Gratitude)

917
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,900
(He opened his eyes and mouth wide
to show his gratitude.)

918
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,310
- He looks so ugly.
- What's that?

919
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,930
- What's with the hunched shoulders?
- To show my gratitude.

920
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,640
- To show your gratitude?
- Look at the hunched shoulders.

921
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,810
Hey, you can't use your body.

922
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,670
- I didn't use my body.
- I mean...

923
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,290
- I didn't use my body.
- What has gotten into him?

924
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,110
You look like
you're buttering up someone.

925
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,110
- What's with him?
- I didn't use my body.

926
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,150
- I didn't change the pose.
- Love.

927
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,290
- Joy. Gratitude.
- Here he goes again.

928
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,920
(He's doing it all over again.)

929
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,330
You shouldn't watch this
when it airs.

930
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,000
- Seriously.
- Is there something in your eyes?

931
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,460
- I wanted to express gratitude.
- I see.

932
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,040
- I'm overwhelmingly touched.
- Some people do that.

933
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,610
Exactly. I'm overwhelmingly touched.

934
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,040
You're overwhelmingly grateful?

935
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,170
(Kwang Soo described gratitude
in a pitiful way.)

936
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,900
Could you show us how to
describe love, joy, and gratitude?

937
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,370
- Well...
- Love.

938
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,750
Joy.

939
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,110
Gratitude.

940
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,820
- Wait.
- What's the difference?

941
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,180
Gratitude.

942
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,910
(She repeated showing
the same facial expression.)

943
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,110
Wait.

944
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,020
Can we describe love together
just once?

945
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,290
- Just once, please.
- She's taken aback.

946
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,260
- Ready, go.
- Ready, go. Love.

947
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,300
(Love)

948
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,690
(His eyelids are shaking
as his heart is fluttering.)

949
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,000
- Joy.
- Joy.

950
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,840
Gratitude.

951
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,610
(Gratitude)

952
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,900
(The weird look
that has never been taught)

953
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,540
- Am I doing it right?
- Kwang Soo is...

954
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,370
on a roll today.

955
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,050
- Am I doing it right?
- Gosh, that's hilarious.

956
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,470
(Lee Kwang Soo,
the maverick of hula dance)

957
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,110
That's so funny.

958
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,370
We have to describe the emotions.

959
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,350
Sadness? Okay. Sadness.

960
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,020
I'm excited to see
Kwang Soo's facial expression.

961
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,110
It's Kwang Soo's turn.

962
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,680
I'm sad. I don't have to cry, right?

963
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,790
- Correct.
- Don't make any sound.

964
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,490
(How will Kwang Soo
describe sadness?)

965
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,270
What has gotten into him?

966
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,770
(I am sad.)

967
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,570
(Stunned)

968
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,240
- What's with his face?
- Joy.

969
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,400
(He changes his facial expression
right away.)

970
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,580
Sadness. Sadness.

971
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,700
(He's describing sadness again.)

972
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,740
Joy.

973
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,680
You're happy and sad
at the same time.

974
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,820
(I am happy and sad
at the same time.)

975
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,180
(He can describe any emotion
like a vending machine.)

976
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,760
- My gosh.
- Hey.

977
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,760
(The emotion is fading gradually.)

978
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,820
- Hey.
- Sadness is hard to describe.

979
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,860
- You're a genius actor.
- Hey.

980
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,590
I bet no other actors
can do it like he does.

981
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,890
My gosh. I'm impressed.

982
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,160
- The last one was the best.
- I mean, he is...

983
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,640
- I tried to show a mixed feeling.
- Your facial expressions...

984
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,760
have never been this funny.

985
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,640
- Really? Do I look funny?
- That was impressive.

986
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,780
- You look funny whatever you do.
- Exactly.

987
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,300
- Is it because of my makeup?
- He can describe a mixed emotion.

988
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,300
Your facial muscles are
warmed up enough, right?

989
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,910
- Yes, I laughed so much.
- Yes.

990
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:53,180
- That was hilarious.
- Then let's begin...

991
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,590
- with basic steps.
- Okay.

992
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,620
Basic steps.

993
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,760
Stand with your feet straight.

994
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,390
For men, it's okay if your feet
are turned slightly outward.

995
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,200
You move to the right side first
in every dance move.

996
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,390
To move to the right,
rest your weight on the left side.

997
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,390
Slide to the right side slowly,
moving your weight to the right.

998
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,700
To the right. To the left.

999
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:17,800
To the right. To the left. Okay.

1000
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,030
While shifting your weight
to the sides,

1001
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,300
move four steps to the right.
Start with your right foot.

1002
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,410
- Smile.
- Okay. Smile.

1003
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,680
- Smile. Try to look happy.
- Okay.

1004
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,010
(To the right.)

1005
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,180
(To the left.)

1006
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,780
(Kwang Soo is getting ahead.)

1007
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,890
Look at Kwang Soo's face.

1008
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,090
- His face looks like Hahoe mask.
- Exactly.

1009
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,260
My, look at his eyes.
He looks just like Hahoe mask.

1010
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,160
Open your eyes wide. Good.

1011
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,570
(He's opening his eyes wide.)

1012
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,660
- Okay. You're doing great.
- Thank you.

1013
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,530
- Next, we'll learn ha'a.
- Ha'a?

1014
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,890
This dance move...

1015
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,680
is to sway your hips 360 degrees
like when you hula hoop.

1016
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,050
Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4. 2, 2, 3, 4.
3, 2, 3, 4.

1017
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,010
Your hips should be pushed back
and swayed to the left at first.

1018
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,010
- 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

1019
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,180
1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1020
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,090
You're like a hula dancing machine.

1021
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,030
He's like a machine. He's amazing.

1022
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,860
- That's good.
- I think he's a natural.

1023
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,300
- It rarely happens.
- Gosh, seriously.

1024
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,120
I can't look at his face.

1025
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,430
- He's like a dancing machine.
- This is driving me insane.

1026
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,910
This is unbelievable.

1027
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,300
- Let's move on to the fifth step.
- Okay.

1028
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,110
- It's called ku'i.
- Ku'i.

1029
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,180
Step with your right foot
and kick with your left foot.

1030
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,700
- Good. Step and kick.
- Wait.

1031
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,280
- Step and kick.
- When you kick,

1032
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,050
make sure to keep your upper body
still and straight.

1033
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,410
- 1, 2.
- Just move the legs.

1034
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,180
1, 2. Kick it like this.

1035
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,760
Kwang Soo, your upper body
is not moving at all.

1036
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,360
Look at his upper body.
It's not moving at all.

1037
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,930
He's a hula dancing machine.

1038
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,720
His upper body is not moving at all.

1039
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,800
You should get a license.

1040
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,660
- Take some private lessons.
- He's discovered a new talent.

1041
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,760
(He's smiling happily
as he discovered a new talent.)

1042
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,430
Exactly. You're talented.

1043
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,110
This is so much fun.

1044
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,510
- I mean it.
- He's a natural.

1045
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,370
Imagine a vast grassy plain.

1046
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:04,180
1, 2, 3. To the other side.
2, 2, 3, 4.

1047
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,780
- Next, describe Mount Ulupalakua.
- Yes.

1048
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,780
- Imagine a tall mountain.
- A mountain.

1049
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,820
You know the gesture people make.
"Look at this view."

1050
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,680
Right. And they strike
this pose too.

1051
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,890
That's helpful.

1052
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,450
- It's so easy to understand.
- Good job.

1053
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
You look around
when you buy land.

1054
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,200
As if your skin is tingly.

1055
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,890
- To describe feeling cold?
- It means it's cold.

1056
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,990
It's cold after sunset.
It's cold in the evening.

1057
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,570
It's a fragrant flower. Move your
arms down with your palms down.

1058
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,260
Lift them up and make flowers
with your hands.

1059
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,740
We're going to leave in 10 minutes.

1060
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,370
- Gosh. We're in trouble.
- Oh, no.

1061
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,740
Okay. At first...

1062
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,550
I'm confused about the second move.

1063
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,820
- The second move?
- Move to the right and to the left.

1064
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,840
- Ji Hyo is good at memorizing.
- Oh, my.

1065
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,820
- She memorized the moves quickly.
- They're so confusing.

1066
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,120
(They're checking the moves
they're confused about.)

1067
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,260
What should I think while
performing? That I'm beautiful?

1068
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,680
Che Che, should I think
that I'm beautiful while dancing?

1069
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,280
"I am beautiful. I am attractive."

1070
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,800
Suk Jin, just focus on
memorizing the order.

1071
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,160
- Facial expressions are important.
- Don't think about anything else.

1072
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,760
We can offset our mistakes
with our facial expressions.

1073
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,490
- "I am beautiful."
- Try to enjoy it.

1074
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,610
Let's go.

1075
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,610
Their samba dance will be
lousy too anyway.

1076
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,410
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk, Se Chan,
So Min, and Haha chose Brazil.)

1077
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,010
(The scorching sun and blue ocean!)

1078
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,620
(Brazil, the country of passion
and cheerful energy!)

1079
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,820
(What kind of class awaits them?)

1080
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,780
- I'll go in and have a look.
- Hey.

1081
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,890
(The teachers are welcoming them
with a big laugh.)

1082
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,820
- It's been a long time.
- The real deals are here.

1083
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,390
- Oh, my.
- It's so good to see you again.

1084
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,390
How have you been?

1085
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,490
Have you been well?

1086
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,820
- Hi, Ji Woo. It's been a while.
- How have you been?

1087
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,470
- It's been a while.
- Hello.

1088
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,370
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

1089
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,740
- Hello.
- It's Ji Woo.

1090
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,180
- It's been so long.
- Ji Woo...

1091
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,370
Goodness.

1092
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,240
We met him for the first time...

1093
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,470
during a Latin dance special
on a variety show in 2007.

1094
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,840
Yes, on "Infinite Challenge".
I remember.

1095
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,510
Haven't I aged a lot?

1096
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,910
- No, you're the same.
- You look even better.

1097
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,280
- Do I?
- Yes.

1098
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,860
We all say that when growing old.

1099
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,200
- Among ourselves...
- Not to embarrass each other.

1100
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,990
- Among ourselves...
- "You're looking good!"

1101
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,700
- "You look even better."
- "You haven't changed."

1102
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,340
- Today, you'll learn the samba.
- The samba.

1103
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,370
Let me first introduce you...

1104
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,410
- to your teachers today.
- Of course.

1105
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,740
- It's good to see you.
- Hello.

1106
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,800
- They all look amazing.
- Kim Ung Gyeom and Um Hye Ri.

1107
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,640
Um Hye Ri, I see.

1108
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,240
This is Ryu Ji Won.

1109
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,510
Hello.

1110
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,120
- She's my wife.
- Oh, really?

1111
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,320
- I see.
- How fascinating.

1112
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,120
I used to be her teacher.

1113
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,260
That's how you got together.

1114
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,700
(Romantic stories
always intrigue Love Frog.)

1115
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,260
- It brought you together.
- Love was in the air.

1116
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,660
- First...
- Go ahead.

1117
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,840
- You'll be on your way to Brazil.
- Yes, Brazil.

1118
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,910
Before you dance the samba,

1119
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,700
you should see
how it's supposed to be.

1120
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,970
Yes, of course!

1121
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,200
- The two of you.
- I'd love to see it.

1122
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,140
The two over here...

1123
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,720
are the Korean champions.

1124
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,390
They'll show you what real samba is.

1125
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,510
- Shall we?
- Let's samba!

1126
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,510
(They can't wait.)

1127
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,680
This is going to be cool.

1128
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,360
- To this kind of music?
- No way.

1129
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,550
Nice!

1130
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,660
She looks like Kim Se Jeong.

1131
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,930
How cool.

1132
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,640
(Eyes open wide.)

1133
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,930
How cool.

1134
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,340
(The samba energy
leaves them gaping.)

1135
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,450
My gosh.

1136
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,050
My gosh.

1137
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,550
Keep an eye on their expressions.

1138
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,180
(Their expressions
are dynamic and alive.)

1139
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,320
This is so cool!

1140
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,160
(Cheering)

1141
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,120
(Stepping backwards)

1142
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,870
(However, his teeth
want to step forward.)

1143
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,930
(Wow!)

1144
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,240
Aren't they amazing?

1145
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,410
(Beware of imitations.)

1146
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,450
(This is samba.)

1147
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,950
Samba!

1148
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,510
Samba!

1149
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,050
- Nice.
- Samba!

1150
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,910
- I knew it.
- Aren't they amazing?

1151
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,530
- Latin dancing sure is cool.
- Unbelievable.

1152
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,360
Did you see
their lively expressions?

1153
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,760
Their expressions were incredible.

1154
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,050
That was so cool.

1155
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,660
Their gazes were like...

1156
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,260
(Glaring)

1157
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,300
That's right.

1158
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,930
(This is probably
what he's mimicking.)

1159
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,470
It's as if they were
going to eat you up.

1160
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,510
I can hold that gaze too.

1161
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,410
(On fire)

1162
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,840
The samba
you'll be learning today...

1163
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,340
- is an easier version.
- Of course.

1164
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,340
What you saw earlier
was for master dancers.

1165
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,970
- He made it just for us.
- Could we learn it?

1166
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,280
You should be glad...

1167
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,550
that you're with the skilled dancers
of Running Man.

1168
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,490
That's for me to decide.

1169
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,820
- Even the toughest choreography...
- 1, 2.

1170
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,760
Some can already do
the simple steps.

1171
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
(All four of them are confident
in their dancing skills.)

1172
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,430
So first, let the four of us
show you...

1173
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,870
- what you'll be learning today.
- Sure thing.

1174
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,590
Finally, this is it.

1175
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,740
You're married, right?

1176
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,590
- How beautiful.
- Amazing, right?

1177
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,340
- Yes.
- You can be just like them.

1178
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:57,140
- Se Chan and So Min...
- Exactly.

1179
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,030
They're married.

1180
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,840
Cue, music.

1181
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,300
How cool.

1182
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,550
(What will the members learn today?)

1183
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,840
Is this the samba?

1184
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,010
Check out their lines.

1185
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,390
- This is what we'll do?
- This?

1186
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,280
- It's too difficult.
- Hold on.

1187
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,660
That's unbelievably cool.

1188
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,260
Oh, no.

1189
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,740
- How can we do this?
- We can't possibly do this.

1190
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,990
How on earth can we do this?

1191
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,970
(This is what
they're supposed to do?)

1192
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,010
No way.

1193
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,450
How sexy!

1194
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,340
(The samba dance gains another fan.)

1195
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,550
Seriously?

1196
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,090
(Close distance)

1197
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,990
(How can one do this?)

1198
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:52,660
(It's all about the chemistry
between the partners.)

1199
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,220
- We can't do this.
- There's no way.

1200
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,490
We should get going.

1201
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,240
- Bye, everyone.
- Well done.

1202
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,910
I still have it, don't I?

1203
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,530
- You were gliding on the stage.
- The feel of it...

1204
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,470
- It was amazing.
- You still have it.

1205
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:05,700
- You're just the same.
- You're not like others.

1206
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,070
You were gliding just now.

1207
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,280
This is what we also say...

1208
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,470
- as we grow old together.
- Which is what?

1209
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,510
"You're still the same."

1210
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,840
(You're still the same.)

1211
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,490
- Exactly.
- "You've still got it."

1212
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,050
The years were good to you.

1213
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,360
"You haven't changed."

1214
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,820
- How can we dance that though?
- That was amazing.

1215
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,930
It's too difficult.

1216
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,450
Latin dancing...

1217
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,950
- is all about the partnership.
- How can we do this though?

1218
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,320
- This links couples together.
- Yes, that happens.

1219
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,160
- That's what happened to you.
- Right.

1220
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,200
While dancing...

1221
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,510
- While dancing?
- It's quite common.

1222
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:37,070
- Which moment exactly...
- They're sort of stuck, you see.

1223
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,740
You'll learn that
as you dance the samba today.

1224
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,840
- Couples...
- No one can actually tell you.

1225
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,140
Many couples end up together.

1226
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,970
(Love Frog is only interested
in romance.)

1227
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,120
- Then...
- I'm in big trouble.

1228
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,910
- There's an issue though.
- What is it?

1229
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,050
- How can we partner up?
- Beats me.

1230
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,140
One of you guys...

1231
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,680
needs to take on the woman's role.

1232
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,260
We know who we're
partnering up with.

1233
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,360
Exactly.

1234
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:57,090
It'll be the two of you
and those two over there.

1235
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,300
- His physique...
- It's feminine.

1236
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,660
- Right?
- Hold on.

1237
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,870
See? You're just as slender.

1238
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,030
- Wait.
- You have the same physique.

1239
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,870
- I can't.
- You can!

1240
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,370
- You do it then.
- No, you.

1241
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,800
- You do it!
- Anyone can tell...

1242
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,370
- Ji Woo, you tell him.
- No way.

1243
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,930
- Are we partners?
- We have no choice.

1244
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,840
(Mr. Gums and Ms. Frog
will dance together.)

1245
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,340
(Se Chan's thrilled about
not dressing up as a woman.)

1246
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,390
- Lead me well.
- Got it.

1247
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,990
It's not about the moves themselves.

1248
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,450
It's not about the moves themselves.
Only the feel of them counts.

1249
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,780
- The feel!
- That's all that matters.

1250
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,820
So to the music,

1251
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,930
show me how you each
feel it yourselves.

1252
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,260
- How we feel it?
- Alone?

1253
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,030
- Yes, alone.
- But it'll be embarrassing.

1254
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,090
Cue, music!

1255
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,140
Feel it!

1256
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,970
(The music plays,
but no one steps forward.)

1257
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:42,340
I can't believe we'll dance
the samba. Will you give it a go?

1258
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,760
Feel it! Get ready.

1259
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,970
(What are you three doing?)

1260
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,780
- Go ahead.
- 2, 3, 4.

1261
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,840
(Swaying)

1262
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,570
(The bold Jeon So Min)

1263
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,490
(Slip!)

1264
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,280
(Her boldness malfunctioned.)

1265
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,120
No, please keep going.

1266
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,320
(When boldness meets the samba)

1267
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,800
- Bravo.
- No, that's enough.

1268
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,370
Enough!

1269
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,030
(Tension overload)

1270
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,530
This is too much.

1271
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,930
- She...
- What on earth are you doing?

1272
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,070
Stop it.

1273
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,010
That's enough.

1274
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,870
- Please, stop.
- I can't do this.

1275
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,470
Why bother Chan Hee like that?

1276
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,910
I can't be partners with her.

1277
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,510
What's wrong with you?

1278
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,680
She always wants more.

1279
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,050
(She's as passionate as
the Master of Samba.)

1280
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,180
That was the best.

1281
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,990
I know what she's capable of now.

1282
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,260
- Play the music for them again.
- Haha.

1283
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,360
Show us.

1284
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,470
- He'll do well.
- He's a good dancer.

1285
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,720
(The arrogant Haha)

1286
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,570
- How cool is that!
- Conga!

1287
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,530
- Isn't he amazing?
- Conga!

1288
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,870
(He even throws off his cap.)

1289
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,640
(Full of arrogance)

1290
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,370
- He's really good.
- He should be the female dancer.

1291
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,390
Look how good he is.

1292
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,010
(He's taking the moves
from his Z-KIRI days.)

1293
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,680
Haha, wait.

1294
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:10,260
- Hold on.
- He's quite good.

1295
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,360
- You...
- How are you this good?

1296
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,820
You're trying not to be
the female dancer, right?

1297
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,720
It's why you're dancing
with so much force.

1298
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,090
(That was him rejecting
the role of a female dancer.)

1299
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,030
- That's why.
- Once more. Cue, music.

1300
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,140
- Show us.
- He's unbuttoning his shirt.

1301
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,610
(Mr. Gums, Yang Se Chan)

1302
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:25,800
Give me the same song, please.

1303
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,070
No, the one before that.

1304
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,140
- The earlier one?
- Yes, I like it more.

1305
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,410
Se Chan knows the feeling.

1306
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,370
Just a second. Wait.

1307
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:33,910
My gosh.

1308
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,410
I want to pat off my sweat!

1309
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,720
(Where do you think you're going?)

1310
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,010
My gosh.

1311
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,050
(He won't let his teacher
pat off his sweat.)

1312
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:50,620
Nicely done. Good job.

1313
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,660
(The samba battle suddenly begins.)

1314
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:57,700
(He flashes his pale complexion
and challenges his teacher.)

1315
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,910
Nice!

1316
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,340
(Yang Se Chan, tofu vendor)

1317
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,470
Go on.

1318
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,620
The mouth. Look at our mouths!

1319
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,090
(Please buy a block of tofu.)

1320
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:11,890
- Nice!
- Good one.

1321
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,820
(Here's some soft tofu.)

1322
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,090
He knows how to enjoy the music.

1323
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,160
(The body language of two geniuses)

1324
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,620
Nice. That was amazing.

1325
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,570
- You were great. What was this?
- Se Chan,

1326
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,140
why were you cursing though?

1327
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,800
No, I wasn't cursing.

1328
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,680
My emotions were bursting out.
It means I was having fun.

1329
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,280
- You were swearing.
- He was having fun!

1330
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,450
That was hilarious.

1331
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,740
Did you see his teeth?

1332
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,010
(This is him having fun.)

1333
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:38,970
- Se Chan's a good dancer too.
- That was exhausting.

1334
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,680
Our true colors come out.

1335
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,510
I'm curious as to
who'll play the female dancer.

1336
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:48,120
(Meanwhile, the whole nation
knows of Jae Suk's love for samba.)

1337
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,220
(Who will play the role
of the female dancer?)

1338
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,200
The picture has been
painted in my head.

1339
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,360
We'll do as you say.

1340
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,360
- I wonder who.
- Got it.

1341
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:55,490
It'll be Haha.

1342
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:57,700
- What?
- You were chosen.

1343
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,800
What? Me?

1344
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,160
- Good.
- I think you'll be great.

1345
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,200
- Also, Haha's a great dancer.
- He is.

1346
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,340
He's a talented one.

1347
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,680
That much I can probably do.

1348
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,240
We'll start with two feet together.

1349
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,070
Step out with your left foot
and come back.

1350
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,780
Step back with your right foot
and come back.

1351
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,870
Let me show you.

1352
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,740
1, 2, 3.

1353
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,220
(They begin with the basic steps.)

1354
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,320
Next, bend your knees as you do so.

1355
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,220
And bend.

1356
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,490
We get it.

1357
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:26,890
(It's all about the quick and slow.)

1358
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:27,970
Once more.

1359
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,620
Se Chan, ready, go!

1360
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,070
Your lips. Your beak.

1361
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,470
He said I have a beak.

1362
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,910
(Did you say beak?)

1363
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,640
(When he criticized his beak...)

1364
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,180
- Sir, I have lips.
- Not beak,

1365
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,240
- My lips.
- I meant lips. Get ready, start.

1366
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:43,870
Look at his lips.

1367
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,640
- You should relax your lips a bit.
- Does that look more natural?

1368
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,570
That's right. Okay.

1369
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:48,780
Ready. Start.

1370
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,620
(Mr. Gums is warming up.)

1371
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,050
- Look at his lips.
- Let's start with your left foot.

1372
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,260
Ready, start.

1373
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,720
1, 2, 3, 4.

1374
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,220
- 2, 2, 3, 4.
- They look like Namolla Family.

1375
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,990
They look like Namolla Family.

1376
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,800
(They call upon Namolla Family
in the middle of their lesson.)

1377
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:01,720
What?

1378
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,470
Our teacher is really funny.

1379
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,430
- We're making progress.
- We are.

1380
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,160
He's just going through it
because he doesn't have time.

1381
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,140
- Do you think we got it right?
- He's just going through it.

1382
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,410
Don't you know how scary he is?

1383
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,610
- This usually takes about a week.
- Right.

1384
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,010
- Okay. The second one.
- Okay.

1385
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:20,010
Partner up, and follow what we do.

1386
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,070
Come here.

1387
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,680
He said to partner up,
and I came here.

1388
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,620
The guys will cross their arms.

1389
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,890
Don't try to do well.

1390
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:27,930
(Clenching his teeth)

1391
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,280
- Is it annoying?
- It's annoying.

1392
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,950
Bring your outstretched hand
and cross it above your head.

1393
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,370
It's hard.

1394
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,160
- You look pretty.
- Put your arms behind your ears.

1395
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,030
- You look pretty.
- I can't do it.

1396
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:41,410
- Stick out your bottom a bit.
- It's not easy.

1397
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,240
- Stick your bottom out towards me.
- The line isn't pretty.

1398
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,680
You should look in the mirror.

1399
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,910
Lower your body a bit.

1400
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:48,970
(Dying)

1401
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,140
Straighten one leg.
Straighten this leg.

1402
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,280
- Straighten one leg.
- How?

1403
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,740
Straighten this leg. Right.

1404
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,550
I want to knock him over
with a flying side kick.

1405
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,510
Like this.

1406
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:00,760
He's wearing a skirt.

1407
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,050
(Sexy and seductive)

1408
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:03,090
Okay.

1409
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,890
- I can't look at him from behind.
- He's good.

1410
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:07,450
You look forward from here.
Hold onto your partner.

1411
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:08,490
- Okay.
- This?

1412
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,490
The guys will bend down, and
the girls will move their left foot.

1413
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:11,930
- Left foot.
- What came after this, So Min?

1414
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,390
What is this?

1415
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,740
- This is a handle.
- It's a handle?

1416
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,510
It's so easy to hold onto.

1417
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,510
- I can hold onto this part.
- Hold tight.

1418
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,800
- Right.
- These are handles.

1419
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,510
- I won't fall.
- Handles.

1420
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,570
You'll hold onto her waist.

1421
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,910
Se Chan, do you remember?
You have to twist her waist.

1422
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,220
Don't twist me too much.

1423
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,220
- Go easy on me.
- Okay.

1424
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,890
- If she's going left,
- I'm embarrassed.

1425
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,950
but you twist to the right,
you'll be in trouble.

1426
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,660
Okay. We'll start.

1427
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,160
(Se Chan's hands can't get close.)

1428
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,700
Ready, go.

1429
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,260
(So Min doesn't mind him at all,)

1430
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:45,140
(but he's dying of embarrassment.)

1431
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,260
Again.

1432
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,390
Gosh, So Min.

1433
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,410
Can you give me some sticks?

1434
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:50,570
- Hey.
- We'll start.

1435
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,470
- Ready.
- I'm embarrassed.

1436
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,970
Get ready. Hold onto her waist!

1437
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,510
I'll move. Just follow me.

1438
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,950
- I'll do that.
- Ready, go.

1439
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,320
- Slow, slow. Quick, quick, quick.
- That's right.

1440
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,950
(He exposes his gums widely
as he's embarrassed.)

1441
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,510
Start.

1442
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,510
(The part that was particularly
hard for Se Chan ends.)

1443
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,550
Okay.

1444
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,180
We'll start from the top until here.

1445
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,680
I can't hold onto her waist.

1446
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,700
Hold it. Hold onto it.

1447
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,720
- Hold onto my waist.
- I can't.

1448
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,570
- Just hold it like this.
- Oh, my.

1449
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,200
- Why can't you just hold it?
- Try it.

1450
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,300
Just hold it like this.

1451
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,300
- Why can't you just hold it?
- Go away.

1452
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,930
- Look over here.
- Okay.

1453
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,140
So Min, try it.

1454
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:28,470
(Ji Woo will take Se Chan's place.)

1455
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:30,140
Start with this leg first.

1456
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,200
- It's slippery.
- Ready, start.

1457
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,280
Slow, slow.
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

1458
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,990
(What?)

1459
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,010
Hey.

1460
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:40,590
(Vocalizing the rhythm)

1461
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,050
Is this dancing?

1462
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,530
- She's going to break.
- What was that?

1463
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,590
We aren't tap dancing.

1464
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,800
(Her face expressed the passion
of samba first.)

1465
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,030
The rhythm was too fast.

1466
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,090
Okay, then. From here,

1467
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,700
the girls will return to the guys.

1468
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,740
- Turn and hold.
- Turn and hold.

1469
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,740
(Turn and go into their arms.)

1470
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,410
(It's one hardship after another.)

1471
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,410
(He punishes Haha
for coming into his arms.)

1472
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,450
He got slapped in the face.

1473
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,820
(Coy)

1474
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,360
I'm sorry.

1475
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,620
Sorry, Haha. This is...

1476
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,720
- for Se Chan and So Min.
- Right.

1477
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,990
If this were a movie,
you and I are just extras here.

1478
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,990
- Right, we're extras.
- Right.

1479
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,700
- Hold my neck.
- Hold her neck with your left hand.

1480
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,990
You will spin her like this.

1481
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,030
Hold on.

1482
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,140
- Gosh.
- Spin me around.

1483
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,470
- Spin me around.
- Spin her.

1484
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,800
- Spin me.
- That's right.

1485
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,680
- Like this.
- Raise your heels.

1486
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,970
At this point,
the girls' right hands...

1487
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:40,240
- will go on the guys' shoulders.
- This isn't right.

1488
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,240
What's most important here is,

1489
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,660
you have to change your hands, and
the left hand will go on their neck.

1490
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,760
Something keeps touching me.

1491
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,030
(Unpleasant to the max)

1492
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:53,160
Let's not do this.

1493
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,620
What are we doing?

1494
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,070
I can't say anything. Gosh.

1495
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,840
(It's unpleasant,
but they can't talk about it.)

1496
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,340
- This is so unpleasant.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

1497
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,740
Jae Suk.

1498
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,970
(Dancing the samba with friends
could be unpleasant.)

1499
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,010
- This is so unpleasant.
- Face each other.

1500
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,340
- Face each other.
- Face each other.

1501
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,340
- You have to face each other.
- Okay.

1502
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,280
Okay. Pay attention.
The next movement is a body roll.

1503
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,050
You will do it together.

1504
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,090
(They do a body roll
as they face each other.)

1505
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:20,160
Ready, go.

1506
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,590
Ready, go.

1507
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,720
(Gosh)

1508
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,070
I've known him for a long time,

1509
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,720
- but I've never been this close...
- Me too.

1510
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,490
- for this long before.
- It's my first time too.

1511
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,470
- Hurry up. We need to do it.
- I've never been so close to him.

1512
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,470
We have to do it. Hurry up.

1513
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,410
- She's too aggressive.
- We have to do it.

1514
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:39,680
- Face each other.
- It's out of control over here.

1515
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,640
Se Chan became timid.

1516
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,470
- Hey.
- She's so aggressive,

1517
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:44,780
so I'm so embarrassed.

1518
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,050
My gosh, I seriously...

1519
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:49,140
Your left side will show soon.

1520
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,720
(Unlike its owner,
Se Chan's left side is aggressive.)

1521
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,860
- This is fitting for samba, right?
- Hey.

1522
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,160
- Let's button up a bit.
- No, it needs to be open.

1523
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,760
- Gosh, it's hot.
- Let's do it again.

1524
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,260
- You separated here.
- Okay.

1525
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,700
Three and shake it.
Girls turn around.

1526
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,160
(The samba class gets heated up.)

1527
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,890
(Doing his best)

1528
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:09,660
(What kind of samba performance
will they put on?)

1529
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,510
- Body roll.
- Separate.

1530
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,410
(After 1 hour)

1531
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,300
(Hula versus Samba)

1532
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,570
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1533
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,320
I'm sure the samba
will be a mess too.

1534
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:24,390
- I'll be sad if I mess up.
- I know. It'll be a waste.

1535
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,680
You could forget the steps
all of a sudden.

1536
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,860
Focus.

1537
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,530
I'm covered in sweat.

1538
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,090
- We only have one chance.
- We only do it once?

1539
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:35,070
- It's time for the second match.
- Right.

1540
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,930
Che Che is the teacher for the hula,

1541
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:40,840
and Park Ji Woo and Ryu Ji Won
taught the samba.

1542
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,610
- Park Ji Woo and Ryu Ji Won.
- Nice to meet you.

1543
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,510
I asked Director Kang,...

1544
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,410
what he wanted to see in advance.

1545
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:48,870
- Right.
- He wanted to see Hawaii first.

1546
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,340
They'll have a hard time because
they'll be discouraged.

1547
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,640
- Okay.
- I'm excited.

1548
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,140
I'm curious. Let's go over there.

1549
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,510
Why do you have such dark circles
under your eyes?

1550
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:58,180
- They did my makeup like this.
- Our teacher did it.

1551
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,510
- We need to take our shoes off.
- Goodness.

1552
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,320
(They go barefoot to make it
seem like the beaches of Hawaii.)

1553
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,180
Let's do it!

1554
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,090
- We can do this.
- I'm nervous.

1555
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:09,160
- Are we starting right away?
- We're starting.

1556
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,700
- Mind your facial expression.
- Let's do it.

1557
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,760
Are we starting right away?

1558
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,140
(Their toes show their nervousness.)

1559
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,340
Mind your facial expression.
Are we starting right away?

1560
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,410
- Your silhouette looks nice.
- Yes.

1561
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:16,840
Mind your facial expression.

1562
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,840
Music, cue.

1563
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,270
(We invite those who are restless
from being home to Hawaii's beach.)

1564
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:27,640
How cute.

1565
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,250
(We invite those who are restless
from being home to Hawaii's beach.)

1566
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,250
(The scent of Hawaii spreads
in Deungchon-dong Open Hall.)

1567
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,310
They're so cute.

1568
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,040
They're so cute.

1569
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:39,790
Aloha.

1570
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
Aloha.

1571
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,720
This is nice.
The hula is a cool dance.

1572
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,830
(You can feel the leisure of Hawai
from their fingertips.)

1573
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,660
(Kwang Soo's face
is filled with happiness.)

1574
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,600
They're so good.

1575
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,240
(They make mistakes, but
their expression is professional.)

1576
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,370
They're so cute.

1577
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:01,680
(The hula mister is off-beat.)

1578
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,700
(Come to Bugok Hawaii.)

1579
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,910
Their teacher is really cool.

1580
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:10,850
It's really cute.

1581
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,080
They look incredible.

1582
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,990
- Their smiles.
- It's so still.

1583
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:19,750
(The smile of the hula swindler
makes you zone out.)

1584
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:23,430
(The members are starting to give
off the smell of tanning lotion.)

1585
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,330
They dance well now.

1586
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:27,600
Isn't Suk Jin's smile awkward?

1587
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,600
(His smile isn't awkward.
He's expressing happiness.)

1588
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,240
(They are each
expressing happiness...)

1589
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,580
(in their own unique way.)

1590
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:42,350
They're good.

1591
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,140
(Hula)

1592
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:55,620
(They keep their perfect smile on
until the end.)

1593
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,020
(Clapping)

1594
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,430
It didn't seem like...

1595
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:04,770
- a couple's dance.
- It was a simple dance.

1596
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:08,180
(They used
their facial muscles the most.)

1597
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,140
We did well, right?

1598
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,500
- We did well, right?
- You know...

1599
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,870
We did a great job.

1600
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:15,410
It was the best we have done.

1601
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:17,890
- We didn't make a mistake.
- The song put us in a good mood.

1602
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,950
The dance was nice.

1603
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,490
- I know.
- We did a great job.

1604
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:22,560
- It's time for the next team.
- It's our turn.

1605
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,020
- My goodness.
- Will we able to do well?

1606
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,080
- Let's go.
- I am nervous.

1607
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,220
Then comes...

1608
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,700
(She makes a fuss from the start.)

1609
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,390
So Min is motivated.

1610
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,330
So Min is motivated to do well.

1611
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:40,870
So Min is motivated.

1612
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,640
So Min is motivated to do well.

1613
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,350
She is the main dancer.

1614
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:45,870
- Really?
- Just look at So Min.

1615
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:47,810
- Stop it. I will be too nervous.
- I wonder what kind of dance...

1616
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,220
So Min and Se Chan will show.

1617
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,410
- Se Chan, you look sexy.
- I unbuttoned my shirt.

1618
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:52,750
That style suits you.

1619
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:53,850
You should go around that way.

1620
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,160
- Should I go around this way?
- Yes.

1621
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,680
- It looks nice.
- It looks nice.

1622
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,930
(He has a pale chest
without a single strand of hair.)

1623
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,020
Get ready.

1624
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,600
(They get ready
for a samba performance.)

1625
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,720
Music,

1626
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:03,600
- cue.
- They look like proper dancers.

1627
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,290
Let's see it.

1628
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,540
Look at Se Chan's eyes.

1629
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,600
(Burning)

1630
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,700
(The passionate female dancers
come forward!)

1631
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,810
(However)

1632
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,990
Jae Suk, what are you doing
with your mouth?

1633
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,250
Stop sticking out your mouth!

1634
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:28,410
(Sticking out his mouth)

1635
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:30,430
(Smile.)

1636
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,930
(Se Chan and So Min look like
a couple from Brazil.)

1637
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,330
(It's the male dancers' turn!)

1638
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,000
(They let go of their shyness...)

1639
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,890
(and take the stage
with bulging eyes.)

1640
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,640
(And...)

1641
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,910
(the dancers get close.)

1642
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,700
(Her heart beats fast.)

1643
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,040
(The youngest members' samba
makes everyone smile like a mom.)

1644
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,620
(Haha steps up his game.)

1645
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,120
(They do a body roll
at the same time.)

1646
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,020
(It's my turn.)

1647
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,580
(Rolling)

1648
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:07,720
(Dream's dad and Ji Ho's dad
are completely absorbed.)

1649
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,000
- They are good.
- I know.

1650
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,220
(Explosive charisma)

1651
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,790
Yang Se Chan!

1652
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:13,790
(Laughing)

1653
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,910
(Their passion makes them continue
to do the body roll.)

1654
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:20,600
Look at Se Chan.

1655
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,180
(The 4 dancers break away
from their everyday lives.)

1656
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:30,580
(It's like Rio de Janeiro here.)

1657
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,640
What was that?

1658
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,330
(The perfect finale)

1659
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,220
It was cool.

1660
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:41,500
It was as good as our performance.

1661
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,500
(The passionate
samba performance...)

1662
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,020
(heated up the atmosphere.)

1663
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:47,970
It was cool.

1664
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:49,600
(The two dads did their parts
as main dancers.)

1665
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,000
When I saw So Min take the stage
with gritted teeth,

1666
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,600
- I knew that she was determined.
- "I will rip the stage apart."

1667
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,580
"This is my stage.
I will give the best performance."

1668
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,080
It was cool.

1669
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,270
- It was cool.
- She danced with gritted teeth.

1670
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,580
(I can give an encore performance.)

1671
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,680
- It's time to check who won.
- Okay.

1672
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,680
The legend of the variety shows,
Director Kang...

1673
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,310
Immortal Chan Hee.

1674
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:10,930
(Immortal Chan Hee time)

1675
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,120
Immortal Chan Hee.

1676
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,850
- He is moving the camera.
- Come on!

1677
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,220
- Oh, yes!
- Come on!

1678
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,520
- Come on!
- Se Chan and So Min are on fire!

1679
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,060
- Come on.
- Kang Chan Hee.

1680
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,000
- So Min...
- Where are you going?

1681
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,140
The camera will go up and zoom in
on the winning team.

1682
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,700
- It will come this way.
- Our performance had a story.

1683
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,810
- Come on.
- There he goes.

1684
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:29,700
(The passionate samba won.)

1685
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:33,640
(They give a ceremony.)

1686
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:35,020
(It's too bad.)

1687
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,850
- It's all right.
- My goodness.

1688
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,410
- Come on.
- So Min is ridiculous.

1689
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,950
Teachers, please pick...

1690
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:47,120
one top student.

1691
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,330
Meanwhile, the teams will pick
the best student...

1692
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:51,720
and worst student.

1693
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,540
One member stood out.

1694
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,640
- That's right.
- That's right.

1695
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,970
- It will be you, So Min.
- No, it will be someone else.

1696
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,180
I was named
the best student earlier.

1697
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,600
1, 2, 3.

1698
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,770
- So Min.
- So Min.

1699
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,970
(Is the best student So Min?)

1700
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,620
- Actually, Se Chan.
- Actually, Se Chan.

1701
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,270
Am I the best student? Okay!

1702
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:09,450
(Actually, Se Chan is
the best student.)

1703
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:12,620
So Min did well,
but she was an eyesore.

1704
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,580
- Thank you.
- She worked too hard.

1705
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,830
I hate that facial expression.

1706
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:18,990
So Min, please stop.

1707
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:20,160
(So Min, please stop.)

1708
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,160
Seriously.

1709
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,500
- It's our turn.
- Okay.

1710
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,500
2, 3.

1711
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,720
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin. It's you.

1712
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,370
- Why is it me?
- You were the worst.

1713
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:28,740
Why am I the worst student?
I did so well.

1714
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,370
He was the worst.

1715
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:34,410
Suk Jin, that's not right.
You do it on the outside.

1716
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,270
- How could you figure that out now?
- Seriously.

1717
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:38,080
You aren't checking your pulse.

1718
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,270
The dance is really hard.
You should try it.

1719
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:43,520
Suk Jin, give Se Chan
one of your lottery tickets later.

1720
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,410
- Okay.
- Now, please pick...

1721
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,620
- the top student from each team.
- The top student?

1722
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:51,250
Everyone did well,
but one student stood out.

1723
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,520
(Expectant)

1724
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,750
Despite being nervous,

1725
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,700
- she practiced hard until the end.
- Ji Hyo.

1726
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,930
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

1727
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,430
(He uses his entire face to show
that he is sullen.)

1728
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,040
Kwang Soo is sullen.

1729
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,330
Please pick the top student
from this team as well.

1730
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,140
Taking the lead
and expressing yourself matter,

1731
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,750
but creating a certain vibe
matters the most.

1732
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,180
Thus, I will pick So Min.

1733
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,370
- She is cool.
- She got chosen twice in a row.

1734
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,180
- I know.
- She is good.

1735
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,910
- What is up with her?
- Stop doing that in front of me.

1736
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:23,950
- Stop showing your armpits.
- Stop showing your armpits.

1737
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,680
Stop showing your armpits. Go.

1738
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,700
Why do you keep doing that
in front of me?

1739
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:29,700
- Seriously.
- Am I the top student again?

1740
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,770
I think I might be able
to win today.

1741
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,270
- Hey.
- So Min is the best...

1742
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,740
- today.
- Seriously.

1743
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,140
- So Min might win.
- At the very least,

1744
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,600
she will get the Korean beef.

1745
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,600
- I know.
- I know.

1746
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,770
She already got two numbers.

1747
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:41,770
(Ji Hyo picked 10,
and So Min picked 5.)

1748
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,640
(10 is the number
So Min picked in Round 1.)

1749
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,410
Let's give the three teachers
a round of applause.

1750
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:47,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1751
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,310
Thank you.

1752
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:50,580
It will be cool.

1753
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,620
(A cappella by EXIT)

1754
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:59,430
Are they making the sound?

1755
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,020
(That's incredible.)

1756
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,330
Their voices are like
musical instruments.

1757
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,930
I thought they were playing
musical instruments.

1758
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,160
Their voices are like
musical instruments.

1759
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,770
- Seriously.
- They are only using their mouths.

1760
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:14,240
(This performance
consists of voices only.)

1761
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,040
(That's insane.)

1762
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,120
They are building up a harmony.

1763
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:28,790
(It's a treat to the ears.)

1764
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,850
(The five voices brought
the cool breeze of fall.)

1765
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:37,520
(Here are the teachers
for the 3rd class.)

1766
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:39,870
- That was nice.
- That was so cool.

1767
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:41,160
Their mouths are like
musical instruments.

1768
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,350
(The voice band, EXIT)

1769
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:52,000
(They are a popular group...)

1770
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,640
(whose YouTube videos get
millions of views.)

1771
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,620
Listening to them
makes me want to go...

1772
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,220
- to a concert.
- It was so nice.

1773
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,410
- That will be therapeutic.
- Seriously.

1774
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:02,680
They exceeded my expectations.

1775
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,120
Please step back a little.

1776
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:07,620
I was saying something important
and impactful.

1777
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,120
- No, you weren't.
- I was saying something important.

1778
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,520
It didn't sound very important.

1779
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,720
For goodness' sake.

1780
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,500
- Their teamwork was incredible.
- Seriously.

1781
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,770
Will we be able to learn a cappella
in a short amount of time?

1782
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,330
You will only learn what you can.

1783
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,080
That's good.

1784
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,250
You will learn the OSTs
of "The Lion King".

1785
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,000
It's my absolute favorite.

1786
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,450
(The music reminds them
of the savanna.)

1787
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:31,140
- We will sing the songs first.
- Really?

1788
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,220
Then you will learn them.

1789
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:36,990
("Circle of Life",
OST of "The Lion King")

1790
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:47,700
(They get goosebumps
from the start.)

1791
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:52,140
(No musical instruments were used
for this performance.)

1792
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,140
(My goodness.)

1793
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:03,910
(The echo makes them feel like
they are at the savanna.)

1794
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:06,140
- I got goosebumps.
- They are incredible.

1795
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,410
(They get goosebumps as a group.)

1796
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:10,990
(Today, they will learn
"The Lion Sleeps Tonight".)

1797
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,680
- Yes!
- This is it!

1798
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:17,430
(The melody,)

1799
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,330
(bass, drum,)

1800
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,930
(and chorus are piled up
for this song.)

1801
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:28,930
(The song they will learn today
is familiar and upbeat.)

1802
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:37,220
(The sound of the savanna...)

1803
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:40,850
(makes this giraffe miss home.)

1804
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:46,330
(The animals are having
a festival here.)

1805
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:51,390
(Wimoweh)

1806
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:54,000
That was incredible.

1807
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,330
"Isn't She Lovely" is much easier.

1808
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,060
- This is too hard.
- I know. This is too hard.

1809
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,810
We heard so many animal sounds.

1810
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:01,040
This one is much harder.

1811
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,700
- What are the parts?
- What are the parts?

1812
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,350
- Solo, chorus,
- Solo, chorus,

1813
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:07,270
- bass, and drum are the four parts.
- bass.

1814
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:08,270
Drum.

1815
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:10,140
Is there a part you want?

1816
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,120
- Bass.
- You want to be the bass.

1817
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,620
Then we will test
your vocal range first.

1818
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:16,950
He was born to be the bass.

1819
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:17,990
It's his top choice.

1820
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,750
<i>- Do, ti
</i>- Here I go.

1821
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,330
Lower your voice like that. 3, 4.

1822
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:23,330
<i>Do, si</i>

1823
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:25,290
(His voice wavers.)

1824
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:26,390
<i>Fa, mi</i>

1825
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:29,970
(His voice stabilizes
as it goes lower.)

1826
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:31,100
<i>Re, do</i>

1827
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,430
(He is good.)

1828
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:35,000
- That was good.
- You should be the bass.

1829
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,040
He is good.

1830
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:39,640
Haha will be the bass.

1831
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,640
- Thank you.
- Let's pick the other parts.

1832
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,410
Who wanted to beatbox earlier?

1833
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:46,120
- The drum.
- Se Chan, you can do it.

1834
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,750
- Se Chan can do it.
- Please raise the volume.

1835
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,180
I can do the basic beats.

1836
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,990
- I bet he will do well.
- He got it.

1837
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:53,520
He got it.

1838
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,160
(The beats are basic,
but he is pretty good at it.)

1839
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,330
I can do this much.

1840
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,620
- That's more than enough.
- I pass, right?

1841
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,330
- Yes. That's more than enough.
- Okay!

1842
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:00,390
Can anyone in this team beatbox?

1843
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:02,600
(Haha attempts to beatbox.)

1844
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,640
That's good.

1845
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:05,040
- I am jealous.
- He is good.

1846
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,540
(He adds his whiny voice.)

1847
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:09,810
(A broken flat gong jumps in.)

1848
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:11,410
What is that?

1849
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:13,080
- What is that sound?
- What are you doing?

1850
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,720
(What is he doing
in front of the teachers?)

1851
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,140
(He shows off his old trick
in front of the teachers.)

1852
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,580
What are you doing?

1853
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,680
(Will So Min give it a try
this time?)

1854
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:23,890
(She is practically spitting.)

1855
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,850
- You are good.
- You are good.

1856
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,750
There she goes again.

1857
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,500
There she goes again.

1858
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,330
- We shouldn't let her do that.
- She is becoming ambitious again.

1859
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:33,890
Do the drum.

1860
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,870
(Drum roll)

1861
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:37,200
You are good.

1862
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,830
- That really sounded like a drum.
- Now,

1863
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,200
- who will sing the melody?
- Jong Kook.

1864
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,270
- Jong Kook?
- Jong Kook.

1865
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:43,910
- I will do it.
- Jong Kook can sing the melody.

1866
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:45,140
From our team,
Kwang Soo should sing the melody.

1867
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,640
- I will be the bass.
- Bass.

1868
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,680
Will you be the chorus?

1869
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,810
- Chorus.
- Okay.

1870
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:49,870
(Sh agrees without knowing
what it is.)

1871
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:50,890
How will you test my vocal range?

1872
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:54,060
I will check if you can do
do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do.

1873
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:56,950
<i>Do</i>

1874
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:58,250
<i>- Re
- Do</i>

1875
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:02,830
<i>Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti</i>

1876
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,270
<i>Do</i>

1877
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,890
(Humming)

1878
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:09,390
(He is taken aback
by the new vocal range.)

1879
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,600
- Ji Hyo, why don't you try it?
- Try it.

1880
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,700
You will be surprised.

1881
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,580
<i>Do, do, do, do</i>

1882
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,750
How many times...

1883
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,680
(She runs into a problem
from the first note.)

1884
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,950
What's the point of this?

1885
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:22,810
- This won't do.
- She was serious.

1886
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:24,750
- Why did you ask her to do it?
- Ji Hyo can't do it.

1887
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,350
- I can do the chorus.
- The chorus?

1888
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,490
Why don't you make a monkey sound?

1889
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,380
(Why don't you make a monkey sound?)

1890
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,630
- I can imitate a dolphin.
- She is good at it.

1891
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:33,460
A dolphin.

1892
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,630
Let's divide the teams that way.

1893
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,460
(Team Kwang Soo, Team Suk Jin)

1894
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:39,830
Let's start from "In the jungle".

1895
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,000
3, 4.

1896
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:43,670
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook
got the melody part.)

1897
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,880
(The lion sleeps tonight)

1898
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,010
Now comes...

1899
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:50,800
(Breathing hard)

1900
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,270
Am I supposed to feel dizzy?

1901
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,050
This song doesn't give you time
to catch your breath.

1902
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,250
You need to breathe
whenever you can.

1903
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,710
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook...)

1904
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:03,350
(hits the high notes
without any problems.)

1905
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:07,500
- You don't feel dizzy, do you?
- No.

1906
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,550
Let's keep going.

1907
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,850
(This person is
as bad as Kwang Soo.)

1908
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:11,200
That's do, right?

1909
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,170
<i>Do, re</i>

1910
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,240
<i>- Do
- Do, re</i>

1911
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,210
<i>- Do
- Do</i>

1912
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:18,340
(For 10 minutes, she has been trying
to get the 1st note.)

1913
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,410
Don't harmonize with me.

1914
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,130
You keep harmonizing with me.

1915
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:24,410
- I am trying to find the note.
- Okay.

1916
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,450
<i>Do</i>

1917
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:27,770
No.

1918
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,140
<i>Do, do</i>

1919
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:32,880
(Repeat after me.)

1920
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,050
I am becoming weird.

1921
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:36,620
(I am becoming weird.)

1922
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,920
(Ji Hyo makes even a musician
tone-deaf.)

1923
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:43,160
(Thanks to the teachers
who don't give up,)

1924
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,830
(So Min and Ji Hyo learn the chorus
little by little.)

1925
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:48,630
(People doing the drum and bass
are learning diligently as well.)

1926
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:51,130
- Where is my team?
- Shall we go?

1927
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:52,760
- Are you guys coming?
- Suk Jin.

1928
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:56,270
(In the jungle, the mighty jungle)

1929
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:59,050
(The lion sleeps tonight)

1930
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:00,270
Hold on.

1931
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,010
What?

1932
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:04,140
- You can't sing at all.
- Hold on.

1933
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,750
(He got found out
after singing a single line.)

1934
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:08,260
I just need to drink some water.

1935
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,010
I practiced too hard.

1936
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,050
- Really?
- Yes.

1937
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:12,420
(Kwang Soo needs to do well
to make the performance shine.)

1938
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,420
Let's try it.

1939
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:15,630
(Meanwhile, Team Suk Jin finishes
a successful practice.)

1940
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,000
(That was nicer than we thought.)

1941
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,960
That was nice.

1942
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,890
This has always been my dream.

1943
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,370
- Really?
- Haha is really excited.

1944
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:26,870
- He is really excited.
- I was like that when I danced.

1945
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:29,670
I must have been like him
when I danced earlier.

1946
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:32,270
(The atmosphere is serious
with this team.)

1947
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,380
Did something bad happen
in the savanna?

1948
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,720
Did something bad happen
in the savanna?

1949
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:46,350
- Was it too depressing?
- Don't do that.

1950
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,590
I wanted to build up emotions.

1951
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:49,390
Did everyone else die
in the savanna?

1952
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,060
Your emotions are nice,

1953
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:53,960
- but please pick up the speed.
- I need to sing faster.

1954
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,430
Let's begin.

1955
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,800
(However)

1956
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,040
- Hold on, Kwang Soo.
- Hey.

1957
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,950
The song doesn't sound fun
when he sings it.

1958
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,410
It's depressing.

1959
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,640
I am trying to save my voice.

1960
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:11,180
(Kwang Soo keeps saving his voice.)

1961
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:14,010
- Hold on.
- Hey. You are going too fast.

1962
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,180
Are you eating ice cream
or something?

1963
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,460
- I am sorry.
- What was that sound?

1964
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,630
I can't roll my tongue.

1965
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,630
- I can only do it shortly.
- We need to sing at the same speed.

1966
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,550
You have less than two minutes left.

1967
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:26,220
(Since 40g of gold depends
on the last match,)

1968
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:29,090
(the members practice hard.)

1969
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,710
(Which team will win
the a cappella match?)

1970
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,930
Please add more echo.

1971
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:37,950
(Team Jae Suk goes first.)

1972
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:39,510
Please increase the volume
for the bass.

1973
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,670
You sound like an expert.

1974
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,920
(They keep increasing
the volumes of their microphones.)

1975
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:47,790
(It's time to unleash his voice
for the real match.)

1976
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,210
It's like a concert.

1977
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,260
- Tell us when you are ready.
- We will begin.

1978
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:53,680
We will begin.

1979
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,720
(Their seriousness made the practice
go on for longer than expected.)

1980
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,020
- From the beginning.
- Yes.

1981
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,460
(They even prepared a dance routine
for the first a cappella stage.)

1982
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:01,740
- We will begin.
- Okay.

1983
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:05,560
(The teachers and the rivals
become nervous.)

1984
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:08,970
(Tuning)

1985
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,040
- Get your hands ready.
- Okay.

1986
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:12,800
("The Lion Sleeps Tonight"...)

1987
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,140
(by Jae Suk, Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo,
and Se Chan)

1988
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,250
Ji Hyo, move.

1989
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,840
I am sorry.
Please let us start over.

1990
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,850
(Ji Hyo just stands there.)

1991
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,010
I am sorry.
Please let us start over.

1992
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:24,590
- You were supposed to move.
- I forgot.

1993
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,300
(They don't disappoint.)

1994
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:28,550
I don't want to be the first one.

1995
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:30,390
- Start over.
- I don't want to be the first one.

1996
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,060
- Go to the front.
- When am I supposed to come out?

1997
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,370
- Should I go first?
- Yes.

1998
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:34,430
I will go first.

1999
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:36,630
(They resume after changing
the order.)

2000
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,760
- We are sorry.
- We will start over.

2001
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,960
Start after 2, 3.

2002
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,800
2, 3.

2003
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,300
("The Lion Sleeps Tonight",
the final version)

2004
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:50,880
(She stifles her laughter.)

2005
01:12:56,790 --> 01:13:00,550
(Ji Hyo and Jae Suk
finally open their mouths.)

2006
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:02,850
(Look at him.)

2007
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:07,000
(It sounds like
Kwang Soo will stop breathing soon.)

2008
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,390
(In the jungle)

2009
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:10,960
(The mighty jungle)

2010
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,210
(The lion sleeps tonight)

2011
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:18,170
(The teachers can't help
but hang their heads.)

2012
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:21,450
(Bursting into laughter)

2013
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:23,420
(Chuckling)

2014
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,490
Hold on.

2015
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:28,180
I practiced too hard.

2016
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:30,380
- Give us another chance.
- Listen.

2017
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:31,880
- Give us another chance.
- Hey.

2018
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,380
- Let me get a sip of water.
- Listen.

2019
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,460
I am so sorry.

2020
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:35,590
- Let me get a sip of water.
- Kwang Soo.

2021
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,130
- It's over if you do badly.
- It's over.

2022
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:38,260
I will do better.

2023
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,330
- Without the melody...
- I could hit high notes earlier.

2024
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,240
Say, "2, 3."

2025
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,430
We will do it for real.

2026
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,060
("The Lion Sleeps Tonight",
the real final version...)

2027
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:48,100
(by Jae Suk, Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo,
and Se Chan)

2028
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,910
It's worse than before.

2029
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:56,470
(Singing)

2030
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,120
(The melody is off,
but the other parts come in.)

2031
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,760
(He is singing very diligently.)

2032
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,090
(Let's stay calm.)

2033
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,000
(Singing)

2034
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:13,700
(Kwang Soo's vocal cord
stopped functioning properly.)

2035
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,540
(He begins the part
he has a problem with.)

2036
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:26,380
(His high notes moves
Immortal Chan Hee.)

2037
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:29,340
(Singing diligently)

2038
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,450
(Something must have happened
in the jungle.)

2039
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,120
(Other parts sound great
in comparison.)

2040
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,020
(It's the magical Kwang Soo effect.)

2041
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,660
(He is confident.)

2042
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,020
(Kwang Soo's high notes
make the rivals grin widely.)

2043
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,760
What is that?

2044
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:50,090
(Anyone would be afraid
of hearing this melody in a dream.)

2045
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:52,370
(Shocked)

2046
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:54,510
(Kwang Soo doesn't stop...)

2047
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:57,170
(summoning a ghost.)

2048
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:58,340
We are ruined.

2049
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,170
They made it funny.

2050
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:05,380
(There must be a drought
in the savanna.)

2051
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:09,290
(His teammates avert their eyes
as he summons a ghost.)

2052
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,020
(The first a cappella performance
ends.)

2053
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,720
(They clap hurriedly
so that he wouldn't sing more.)

2054
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:20,260
- Director Kang Chan Hee!
- Hey!

2055
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,960
- What are you doing?
- We love you.

2056
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,100
- For goodness' sake.
- I can't believe him.

2057
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,240
(Chan Hee smiles
now that the song is over.)

2058
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,470
How could you lose your voice
from practice?

2059
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:29,670
You did well.

2060
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:31,170
I could hit the notes earlier.

2061
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,210
We did our best.

2062
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,710
- I can't sing anymore.
- Thank you.

2063
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:36,140
Hey, hey.

2064
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,880
(Everyone is looking forward
to Team Suk Jin's performance.)

2065
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,510
(Unlike the other team,
they practice in a stable way.)

2066
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:42,710
Suk Jin, good luck.

2067
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:44,830
- I hope Suk Jin makes a mistake.
- Suk Jin.

2068
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:46,330
(Beatboxing)

2069
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:48,390
(Beatboxing)

2070
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:49,630
You are confusing me. Stop it.

2071
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,870
- Stop it.
- Add it to the performance.

2072
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:53,330
Suk Jin.

2073
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:55,040
(Adding weird beats)

2074
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:57,600
(The old beats stick
to Suk Jin's ears.)

2075
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,100
You are confusing me.

2076
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:00,970
- The mountain rabbit.
- That's right.

2077
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,970
Hold on, I am doing this wrong.

2078
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,340
- Are they allowed to do that?
- I got it.

2079
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,380
- Did you get it?
- I got it.

2080
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,080
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

2081
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,340
("The Lion Sleeps Tonight"...)

2082
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,350
(by Suk Jin, Jong Kook,
Haha, and So Min)

2083
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:22,090
- His voice doesn't waver.
- I added vibrations too.

2084
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,520
(Jong Kook leads with the melody...)

2085
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,670
(and the performance goes
without a problem.)

2086
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:31,130
(The birth of a 4-member
a cappella group)

2087
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,840
(Impressed)

2088
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,840
(Jong Kook shows
the importance of the melody...)

2089
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,970
(which leads the chorus,
drum, and bass.)

2090
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:43,140
For goodness' sake.

2091
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:54,850
(They're quite harmonious
considering they just learned it.)

2092
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,060
(She's excited.)

2093
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:03,090
(The teachers are enjoying it,
unlike earlier.)

2094
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,040
(Let's add a spoonful of
a sweet voice.)

2095
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:11,050
(Good for you!)

2096
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:14,420
(They even had the leisure
to add choreography.)

2097
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:18,810
(I wish we did that too.)

2098
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:19,840
(Wimoweh)

2099
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,850
(Howling)

2100
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:22,590
(Exclaiming)

2101
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:24,680
(Shouting)

2102
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,630
(They even succeed in
the hard part.)

2103
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:29,160
They're really good.

2104
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:30,590
They're really good.

2105
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:31,760
(The winner
has already been decided.)

2106
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,800
(Wimoweh)

2107
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:40,370
(Sighing)

2108
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:42,340
<i>Kang Chan Hee</i>

2109
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:44,710
(The a capella is complete.)

2110
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,450
(Unlike the previous team, they
didn't worry as they watched.)

2111
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:47,840
Wimoweh!

2112
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:48,920
Kang Chan Hee's the best.

2113
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,140
We did so well.

2114
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,450
(Bass Haha fulfilled his wish.)

2115
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:52,880
Gosh. It was so exciting.

2116
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,490
We did well. It wasn't bad.

2117
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:55,810
- You guys were so cool.
- I got excited.

2118
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:57,550
You were so cool.

2119
01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:00,020
Our main melody was a mess,
so how could we do well?

2120
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,850
- He can't sing, so how could we?
- Our main melody...

2121
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,420
- was a complete mess.
- The problem wasn't me.

2122
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,920
He said that he's not the problem.

2123
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,670
- He said he wasn't.
- Gosh.

2124
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:10,670
- With Jong Kook at the center...
- We did really well.

2125
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:12,870
With Jong Kook
setting everything up...

2126
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:15,470
We need to check who the winner is.

2127
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:18,640
The team that Director Kang
shoots is the winner.

2128
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:20,800
We don't know how Chan Hee feels.

2129
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,270
- We could be chosen out of pity.
<i>- Kang Chan Hee</i>

2130
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:25,050
It will be a controversy
if he chooses them.

2131
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,450
- That's right.
- A controversy?

2132
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:29,310
Director Kang's choice is...

2133
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:31,590
(Who will
Director Kang Chan Hee choose?)

2134
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:33,660
- Choose the team you like more.
- He's moving.

2135
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:34,800
- He's debating.
<i>- Kang Chan Hee</i>

2136
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,960
(All eyes are on him.)

2137
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,390
(Team Suk Jin's high quality...)

2138
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:40,760
(versus Team Jae Suk's
scratchy voice)

2139
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:43,670
(Where will Director Kang Chan Hee's
camera go?)

2140
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:45,370
Okay!

2141
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:47,130
(Team Suk Jin wins!)

2142
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:49,380
(Nice!)

2143
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:51,080
We got it.

2144
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,210
(Smacking their lips)

2145
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:54,010
Do we choose the best student?

2146
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:56,050
This team will choose
the best student first.

2147
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,270
The best student?

2148
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,680
- We have a person in mind.
- 1, 2, 3.

2149
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,810
- Jong Kook.
- Kim Jong Kook.

2150
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:01,460
Thank you.

2151
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:03,680
- Thank you.
- We acknowledge it.

2152
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,290
1, 2, 3.

2153
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:06,880
- Lee Kwang Soo.
- Lee Kwang Soo.

2154
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,020
(Worst student, Lee Kwang Soo)

2155
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:10,200
- The difference is in the melody.
- This couldn't be helped.

2156
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,500
This is the most important. The top
student chosen by the teacher.

2157
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,200
(Who is the top student
chosen by the teachers?)

2158
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,200
- They watched us carefully.
- Musically,

2159
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,300
- this part was really hard.
- Right.

2160
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,100
And it's hard to stay centered.

2161
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,970
But he did a great job. It's Haha.

2162
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,840
- I knew it.
- Thank you.

2163
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:25,880
All right!

2164
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,270
(Sulky)

2165
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:29,750
He could become
a professional bass vocalist.

2166
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,290
- He was so excited.
- I was really happy.

2167
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:34,050
- His dream came true. He likes it.
- Singing in a capella was my dream.

2168
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:37,010
- He has a great bass voice.
- Thank you.

2169
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:39,680
Honestly, we were worried and
wondered if the eight of you...

2170
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,700
would be able to divide up
into different parts.

2171
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,500
I can't say which team is which,

2172
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,260
but there was a team
who was good musically,

2173
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,090
and there was a team
that took the music...

2174
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:51,210
and changed it into
an artistic satire.

2175
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:53,010
I never did that.

2176
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:55,510
- Just stay quiet.
- He said we made it into satire.

2177
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,910
- My gosh.
- You ruined the mood.

2178
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:59,100
It was so much fun.

2179
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,380
- It was really fun.
- We enjoyed watching it.

2180
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,880
(The third class is over.)

2181
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,210
While you're doing that,
Haha will come up and pick a number.

2182
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:07,590
That's right.

2183
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:09,090
That could be.

2184
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:10,550
Right? Because there are 10.

2185
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:11,550
(Haha wrote 1
for his winning number.)

2186
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:14,090
Are you choosing the numbers
for the lottery randomly?

2187
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:15,550
- Yes, we are.
- It's random?

2188
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:16,960
Oh, okay then.

2189
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:20,020
Gosh, I don't know.
I'll just choose anything.

2190
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:21,590
I would love to come in first place
just once.

2191
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,540
- It's a miracle to get it all.
- I wish I could get it once.

2192
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:26,960
I'll tell you the winning numbers
that you all chose first.

2193
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,340
So Min chose two numbers.

2194
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,210
- One of them is five.
- Okay.

2195
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,640
(Number 5)

2196
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,340
- The other is 10.
- Is that what she chose?

2197
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,550
(5 and 10 are her winning numbers.)

2198
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,340
- The other is 10.
- Okay.

2199
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,340
I didn't choose 5 and 10 together.

2200
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,920
- Song Ji Hyo also chose 10.
- Really?

2201
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,720
I was so surprised
when you said that.

2202
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:48,020
Haha chose one.

2203
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:50,460
In other words, 1, 5, 10
are winning numbers.

2204
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:53,960
If you get all 6 of them right,
we prepared 40g of gold for you.

2205
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,500
- Gosh.
- If someone gets all six right...

2206
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,560
- Right. Take it.
- Who could it be?

2207
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,740
The first number is...

2208
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,740
(The lottery starts.)

2209
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:01,100

2210
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:03,080
Three.

2211
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,580
(The first number is 3.)

2212
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:06,710
(The current winning numbers are
1, 3, 5, 10.)

2213
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:09,950
I have 1, 3, 5.

2214
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:11,050
Really?

2215
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:12,250
We have two more numbers left.

2216
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,490
I have 3, 5, 10.

2217
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:14,880
If I get 1 more right,
I have a total of 4.

2218
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,180
Me too.

2219
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,720
I need one more as well.

2220
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,880
- Can I write on this?
- Yes, you can.

2221
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,830
- Six.
- I'll choose the next number.

01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:24,130
7, 8.

2223
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,630
The fifth number is...

2224
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,200
- 7, 8.
- 7.

2225
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,500
(The fifth number is 7.)

2226
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:29,630
I got it.

2227
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:32,600
(It's number 7.)

2228
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,240
- I got it.
- My legs are weak.

2229
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,300

2231
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,630
Me too.

2232
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:40,080
- I have 7 and 10. I just need 6.
- Look. I just need 8.

2233
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,770
- If I get one more, I win.
- I...

2234
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,770
If you chose 8,
I'd have won 1st place.

2235
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,140
I have the ball in my hand.

2236
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,880
(It's the last number in
the 6 number lucky lotto!)

2237
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,160
(If number 6 comes out,
Haha comes in 1st place.)

2238
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,990
(If number 8 comes out,
So Min comes in 1st place.)

2239
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:55,890
(The last number is...)

2240
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:56,920
Two.

2241
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,460
(The last number is 2.)

2242
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,560
(Nobody gets the 40g of gold.)

2243
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,240
(Disappointed)

2244
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,560
I got the first 4 numbers right.

2245
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,560
Really?

2246
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,010
I got the first 4 numbers right.

2247
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:10,270
- I got 5, so I get the Korean beef.
- Is that the prize?

2248
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:11,270
You're so lucky.

2249
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:14,170
Jae Suk came in third place once.

2250
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:15,840
That's too bad.

2251
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,250
Suk Jin came in
2nd place and 3rd place.

2252
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:20,640
Haha came in 2nd place 3 times.

2253
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,790
You came in 2nd place 3 times?

2254
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:23,380
Haha will take home
three Korean beef sets.

2255
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,460
- That's incredible.
- That's incredible.

2256
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:28,000
You own a pork restaurant, so why
are you taking home so much beef?

2257
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,260
Kwang Soo came in third place twice.

2258
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,260

01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:42,770
Okay.

2265
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:44,640
Today's winner is...

2266
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,410
Haha.

2267
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:48,340
He came in first place!

2268
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,050
Nobody got the 1st place prize.

2269
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:51,640
It's too bad, isn't it?

2270
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,490
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job, everyone.

2271
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:55,660
(A few days before the shoot
in Mok-dong SBS)

2272
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:56,790
(Hello?)

2273
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:58,880
(Jae Suk received
a mysterious phone call?)

2274
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,680
(Bring an outfit that...)

2275
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,850
(you would like to recommend
to another member.)

2276
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,220
(Haha, Gets teased for his fashion,
Byword of see-through looks)

2277
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:05,390
(It's finally time for me
to get my revenge.)

2278
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,130
(There's a fashion style
I've been pushing for.)

2279
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:08,870
(It's a pair of balloon pants
and no top.)

2280
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:09,890
(Ji Suk Jin, Mr. Origami)

2281
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:11,370
(They won't be able to
pull off my fashion style.)

2282
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:13,240
(I'm ahead of the times in fashion.)

2283
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:14,600
(A fashion show...)

2284
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,430
(where they wear each other's
clothes is coming soon.)

2285
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:18,250
(Fashion Choice Race,
All or nothing)
