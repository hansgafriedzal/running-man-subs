1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,630
(We are realizing the value
of things that we take for granted.)

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,170
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,550
We're shooting the opening
in the open air after a long time.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,520
- The weather is really nice.
- It's really good.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,910
Weather like this doesn't
last for long.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,480
It's a fine fall day.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
- The weather is really nice.
- Look at the sky.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,890
Se Chan broke my spirits...

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,050
- this morning.
- Why?

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,630
- He told me some bad news.
- Why? What is it?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,430
I promised her
to set her up with a guy.

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,660
- You mean So Min?
- Yes.

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,230
But it turns out
he has a girlfriend.

14
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,590
(It turns out
her date has a girlfriend.)

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,710
Hey, why would you set her up
with a guy who has a girlfriend?

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,140
- I didn't know that.
- He's strange.

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,370
So here's what I think.

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,350
I think Se Chan has a crush on me.

19
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,350
(I think Se Chan has a crush on me.)

20
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,280
Gosh, this is
what you wanted to say.

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,920
- My gosh.
- He's...

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,250
- She's scary.
- You just can't stop smiling.

23
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,680
Gosh, no.

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,490
- I should hide my gums.
- I think he likes me.

25
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,580
He keeps interrupting me.

26
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,860
I'm not interrupting you.
I just didn't know that.

27
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,530
- Why did you not check it first?
- Right.

28
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,890
- I was going to...
- Ji Hyo is here.

29
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,220
- Ji Hyo is coming.
- Hello.

30
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,000
- Ji Hyo.
- Hi, Ji Hyo.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
- Jong Kook is here too.
- He's wearing long pants.

32
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,100
- Hey.
- It looks like a thimble.

33
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,700
I was told to dress like this.
A white shirt and jeans.

34
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,480
- A white shirt and jeans.
- Jeans.

35
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,530
Right. I saw that.

36
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,070
What? Did you guys
compare your looks?

37
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,220
(Haha compared his looks
with Kwang Soo's while drunk.)

38
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,510
(- I look handsome.
- Me too. We looked good back then.)

39
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,420
(Haha versus Kwang Soo)

40
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,950
(That day, I just woke up
and went out without washing up.)

41
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,980
(Haha is good looking.)

42
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,150
(Kwang Soo is more handsome.)

43
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,310
(Haha is so cool.)

44
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,360
(I think Kwang Soo is better.)

45
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,760
- He asked who looked better.
- Haha posted it...

46
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,260
- on his social media.
- Why did you guys do that?

47
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,590
I didn't do it.

48
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,290
- I don't even care about him.
- We both think...

49
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,530
- Why did you two do such a thing?
- I didn't start it.

50
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,760
- I didn't even care.
- But he added a comment.

51
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,110
- It ended with my victory.
- Really?

52
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,430
Because you started it.

53
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,810
That's because it was your account.

54
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,110
He wrote comments
only to those who supported him.

55
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,670
(Haha is the most handsome and
fashionable member in Running Man.)

56
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,920
You're the worst.

57
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,720
- I mean...
- He's so sly.

58
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,280
(He manipulated the public opinion.)

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,890
He didn't say anything
to those who mentioned my name.

60
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,950
- I can see that.
- And...

61
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,290
I wasn't going to say this,

62
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,500
but you two can't make
a bet like that.

63
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,700
You guys can't even make the cut.

64
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,970
- Jae Suk.
- You mean their level.

65
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,090
You can't even be compared with us.

66
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,500
I have the rankings
of the members in mind.

67
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
This is frustrating.

68
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,430
Only those who are
high in ranks can do this.

69
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,710
- You're mistaken.
- It's not that you're ugly.

70
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,780
But you're just okay.

71
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,180
And you're ugly.

72
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,910
Gosh, no. I'm not ugly.

73
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,590
Actually, this is what
we've been curious about.

74
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,520
I wonder how the two female
members would rank their looks.

75
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,030
Gosh, that doesn't matter.

76
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,280
- Are you asking seriously?
- Objectively...

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,380
Are you being serious?

78
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,900
- I know. It can be subjective.
- This is hard for me.

79
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,660
I can't decide anything
before seeing them naked.

80
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,270
(I can't decide anything
before seeing them naked.)

81
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,190
- What is she talking about?
- My gosh.

82
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,710
- Hey.
- No, that's not what I mean.

83
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,430
- Just consider our looks.
- I mean...

84
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,030
You look different only with a hat.
Haha is wearing many items.

85
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,150
The rankings decided
by Ji Hyo and So Min...

86
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,410
mean nothing to me.

87
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,120
- That's true.
- Right?

88
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,780
At least I can pick
the worst member.

89
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,780
Who is it?

90
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,810
She's looking at Suk Jin.

91
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,650
Suk Jin.

92
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,460
- Come here.
- I think...

93
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,060
(She picks Suk Jin
with no hesitation.)

94
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,400
- I can't believe this. Hey!
- It's just her taste.

95
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,590
Hey, you're really...

96
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,430
- It's her taste.
- You are not objective at all.

97
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,810
Just admit it.

98
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,900
- So Suk Jin is the last.
- The fifth...

99
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,060
The fifth place is Jae Suk.

100
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,280
(Jae Suk is ranked 5th.)

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,500
Do I look worse than him?

102
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,250
I don't care whom she picks.

103
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,310
The two Petty Gang members are out.

104
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,870
The two members
of Petty Gang are out.

105
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,880
Continue. Who's next?

106
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,940
The fourth is Kwang Soo.

107
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,150
Come on.

108
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,250
Gosh, that can't be right.

109
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,680
This is getting more strange.

110
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,380
Gosh, thank you.

111
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,280
Are they the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd?

112
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,220
The third is Se Chan.

113
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,220
(He's ranked 3rd.)

114
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,590
The 2nd is Jong Kook,
and the 1st is Haha.

115
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,270
- You're the best.
- Okay.

116
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,900
- Third place isn't so bad.
- This is ridiculous.

117
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,970
- It's just absurd.
- It's not bad.

118
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,770
Are you guys standing
together on purpose?

119
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,210
(Are you guys standing
together on purpose?)

120
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,710
- What?
- The three ugly members.

121
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,000
- The three ugly members.
- I'm not part of this.

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,340
- I'm out of this.
- If you feel upset about it,

123
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,400
it means you admit
that So Min is right.

124
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,410
- Okay?
- No, I don't.

125
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,550
You three are
the ugly dolls of 2020.

126
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,590
- That's not it.
- We want to do it as well.

127
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,550
We will rank the female members.

128
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,350
Stop it. Don't do that.

129
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,620
Number one is Ji Hyo.

130
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,150
- Who's the last?
- The last is...

131
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,590
- Jeon So Min.
- Jeon So Min.

132
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,900
Song Ji Hyo is the best.
Jeon So Min is the worst.

133
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,270
- Song Ji Hyo!
- Song Ji Hyo!

134
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,400
We're being so childish.

135
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
Jeon So Min.

136
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,010
Did you see So Min blushing?
She's moving.

137
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,340
Those with bad looks
have bad characters.

138
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,100
(Those with bad looks
have bad characters.)

139
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,040
- You should stop.
- She's serious.

140
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,240
Today, after the shoot,

141
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,190
we will wait for you in the alley.

142
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,590
- I will block your car.
- We will attack you.

143
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,390
I will stop your car.

144
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,960
- The ugly ones will get you.
- You'll learn your lesson.

145
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,760
They are unsociable.

146
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,030
Because they're unsociable?

147
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,220
Today, your choice will
decide your fate.

148
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,860
It's called All or Nothing Race.

149
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,230
You will have to make a choice
in each mission.

150
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,880
According to your choice, you will
get or return yut candy bars.

151
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,140
- Candy bars?
- The member with most candy bars...

152
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,970
will get a prize, and the one
with least candy bars will...

153
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,320
get a cumbersome
and tiring penalty.

154
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,910
- It's something tiresome.
- I hate it.

155
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,840
- I hate tiresome things.
- It's going to be hard.

156
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,390
- But it can be annoying.
- This is...

157
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,590
I hate stuff like that.

158
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,850
The penalty is tiresome.

159
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,400
And you failed the mission
in the Thief Race.

160
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,260
- Haha and So Min.
- I've forgotten about it.

161
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,860
- Right.
- If one of you...

162
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,330
becomes the last,
you both will get the penalty.

163
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,590
And if you both don't
become the last,

164
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,210
the last and one of you
with fewer candy bars...

165
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,300
- will get the penalty together.
- I'm getting a penalty today.

166
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,340
If Haha and So Min
get the penalty together,

167
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,300
it will be best for us.

168
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,670
- I agree.
- It's a prize for us.

169
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,710
It's a party.

170
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,040
That's the best gift.

171
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,020
- It's a festival.
- Okay. Good.

172
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,740
So now you will make
your first choice.

173
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,890
Your choice will determine
your costume for today.

174
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,850
It's called Running Man
Haute Couture.

175
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,850
Before the shoot,
the production crew asked you...

176
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,130
to bring your clothes
for another member.

177
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,400
You told us.

178
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,990
(Announcing the mission)

179
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,770
(Please bring an outfit
of your fashion style...)

180
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,010
(that you want to recommend to
this member to the next shoot.)

181
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,530
(They're going to wear my outfit?)

182
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,880
(Yes.)

183
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,150
(My fashion style is topless.)

184
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,720
(Flustered)

185
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,970
(Can I bring leggings?)

186
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,720
(You can bring anything you want.)

187
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,110
- Did you bring your clothes?
- Yes.

188
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,190
- I'm serious about this.
- You guys will soon...

189
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,520
choose your outfit randomly...

190
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,090
between what the members brought
and what your stylist prepared.

191
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,900
And you will be wearing the outfit
until the end of the shoot.

192
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,070
All day?

193
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,830
I hate it.

194
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,270
We will bring in
the outfits for you then.

195
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,100
- Seriously, I...
- Who brought outfits for me?

196
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,640
I brought a pretty one.

197
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,030
- Mine is pretty too.
- I brought a decent one.

198
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,210
- Guys.
- Mine is just fine.

199
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,800
- I also brought a pretty one.
- Mine is not funny.

200
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,840
Kwang Soo, go ahead.

201
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,900
What's your outfit?

202
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,220
- What's that?
- How do you put it on?

203
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,720
- What?
- Darn it.

204
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,740
Actually, this is...

205
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,980
really good.

206
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,780
What's that? Is it for a beggar?

207
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,150
It looks horrible.

208
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,420
This is the oldest one I have.

209
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,050
Is this how it's supposed to look?

210
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,130
No. It's worn out.

211
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,260
Are these moth holes?

212
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,530
They are not moth holes though.

213
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,230
There's a story behind it.

214
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,900
And this is a zebra pattern.
I made them myself in my 20s.

215
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,010
- Really?
- Yes.

216
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,340
- Who would wear it?
- It's sleeveless.

217
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,780
- Who's wearing it?
- That's what Jong Kook likes.

218
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,380
- Gosh, no.
- It looks cool though.

219
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,100
Let's see who it is for.

220
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,080
No way. It's Se Chan.

221
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,340
(Who is the vintage outfit for?)

222
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,380
It's Jong Kook.

223
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,090
(Sleeveless shirt lover, Jong Kook)

224
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,690
See? It's for Jong Kook.

225
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,890
Jong Kook, you like
sleeveless shirts.

226
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,480
He knew this would happen.

227
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,760
But this is too much.

228
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,150
Jong Kook loves sleeveless shirts.

229
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,590
- You'd look good in them.
- I do love sleeveless shirts,

230
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,220
- but I have a standard.
- This is your style.

231
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,420
They look better
when you wear them.

232
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,770
(Kwang Soo's look from his 20s)

233
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,800
Compared to what Kwang Soo brought,

234
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,080
- this is really pretty. I like it.
- It's pretty.

235
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,950
- Cycling pants?
- You wear them very often.

236
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,150
- I really like these clothes.
- They really are Jae Suk's style.

237
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,880
- Jae Suk wears them all the time.
- That's right.

238
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,410
- Suk Jin.
- Gosh.

239
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,520
(It's for Suk Jin
who loves Jae Suk.)

240
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,390
- That style is not bad.
- It suits you. You'll look cute.

241
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,260
(Jae Suk's style)

242
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,920
(Want-To-Be-Like-Jae Suk Style)

243
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,890
These are limited edition clothes.

244
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,330
I brought the clothes I actually
wore when I went to the airport...

245
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,990
that I told you about before.

246
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,490
(Suk Jin prepared the clothes
he wore at the airport.)

247
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,090
(Suk Jin's travel style is
always unpredictable.)

248
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,660
- Oh, those ridiculous clothes?
- Right.

249
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,840
They're really nice.

250
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,140
I remember his clothes...

251
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,010
- Look. These are...
- That's the worst.

252
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,840
I saw him in these clothes
at the airport. He looked terrible.

253
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,040
- This is how I usually dress.
- On a plane?

254
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,540
Look at the back of the pants.

255
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,650
- Gosh, no.
- Se Chan will wear them.

256
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,740
- You'll look okay.
- This is too much.

257
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,950
If you wear them,

258
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,510
- you will look great.
- Really?

259
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,930
Suk Jin, what's with
this yellow stain?

260
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,590
What's with this stain?

261
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,700
Why? What is there?

262
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,350
Why?

263
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,390
Of course, I washed them.

264
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,970
- At least, they'll be comfortable.
- I'm jealous.

265
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,990
First of all...

266
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,410
- I prepared everything...
- What's that?

267
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,310
- What's that?
- What's that?

268
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,680
Gosh. Here she goes again.

269
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,840
She's being over the top again.

270
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,050
- This isn't included.
- Look at that.

271
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,240
That's ridiculous.

272
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,680
- No way.
- Are they for Ji Hyo?

273
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,320
- I'm sure they're for Ji Hyo.
- She's being over the top again.

274
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,880
- Look at this photo.
- I customized this shirt.

275
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,110
I think they're for Kwang Soo.

276
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,820
I think they're for Kwang Soo. Gosh.

277
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,960
- Is that a skirt?
- It's a skirt.

278
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,590
Wait. No. It might not be mind.

279
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,460
- Actually...
- They're definitely for Kwang Soo.

280
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,720
I'd like you all to know that I even
made this necklace by myself.

281
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,040
- But why did you have to do that?
- You didn't have to do that.

282
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,860
- I wanted to make him look pretty.
- It's definitely Kwang Soo's.

283
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,100
Why would she bring a skirt?

284
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,310
I wanted to make him look pretty.

285
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,840
(Kwang Soo looks great in a skirt.)

286
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
I think he'll look pretty.

287
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,710
- He'll look very pretty.
- I don't care.

288
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,550
- Why did you bring me a skirt?
- Because you have nice legs...

289
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,290
- But So Min, it's a skirt...
- She brought mesh stockings too.

290
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
(So Min's style, hand-made accessory
and customized shirt)

291
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,480
(Kwang Soo-Is-an-Entertainer Style)

292
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,720
- Next.
- I think it's Jae Suk's.

293
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,750
- I prepared these clothes.
- I'm pretty sure it's Jae Suk's.

294
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,490
- What's this?
- Or maybe...

295
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,390
- What's that?
- Haha.

296
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,670
- I prepared...
- There's a wig too.

297
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,990
- I like this style.
- I brought...

298
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,070
- a suit.
- It's nice.

299
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,470
- I wore these...
- They must...

300
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,410
- fit me perfectly.
- to impersonate Yim Jae Beom.

301
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,570
This is nice.

302
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,940
- On "Comedy Big League".
- Oh, right.

303
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,270
(Yim Jae Beom Style
or Comedy Skit Style)

304
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,910
This wig must be worn as well.

305
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,140
- It comes with the clothes.
- Of course.

306
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,770
- But it must be too hot.
- Did you pick Ji Hyo?

307
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,110
- Did you hold onto it?
- Yes.

308
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,240
(Who will transform into
Yim Jae Beom? Ji Hyo will.)

309
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,290
Ji Hyo? I knew it.

310
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,510
Ji Hyo will wear them?

311
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,590
- Ji Hyo, try them on, okay?
- Nice.

312
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,110
- Good choice.
- Try them on.

313
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,110
It's perfect for her.

314
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,200
(Se Chan's style,
What-Should-I-Do Style)

315
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,330
(Ji Hyo's clothes will be revealed.)

316
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,430
Ji Hyo, who will wear yours?

317
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,760
Ji Hyo dresses nicely in real life.

318
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,390
- They're nice.
- It's pretty.

319
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,630
- Awesome.
- I like them.

320
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,860
- That's nice.
- It's pretty.

321
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,230
This is the best style.

322
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,570
- This is the ace style.
- It's really pretty.

323
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,840
- That's what I wanted.
- I...

324
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,230
- I hope it's me.
- It's so pretty.

325
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,410
- Oh, it's me.
- It's So Min.

326
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,680
- I like it.
- It's cute.

327
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,950
- I might wear Jong Kook's clothes.
- So Min is lucky.

328
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,320
She brought me mesh stockings.
But she'll wear that?

329
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,220
- I really like Ji Hyo's style.
- You have nice legs.

330
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,690
I picked something that anyone can
wear regardless of age and gender.

331
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,160
- Well, I...
- Let's check out Jong Kook's.

332
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,190
Nothing unique.

333
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,350
Oh, my. Look at that.

334
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,830
- This is...
- He brought a sleeveless shirt too.

335
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,990
That's what I wear to bed.

336
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,300
- This shirt...
- It's Jong Kook's style.

337
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,750
- with shorts.
- Jong Kook.

338
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,430
- The arm holes are too low.
- Well...

339
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,620
- It's a good thing.
- It looks comfortable though.

340
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,730
Could it be Jae Suk's?

341
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,070
- It's Haha.
- Gosh.

342
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,600
- His clothes are...
- You like this kind of clothes.

343
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,040
- It's a tough guy style.
- It's a sleeveless shirt.

344
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,410
With shorts.

345
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,680
- His clothes must be the worst.
- I'm curious.

346
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,180
- You see, I...
- I really hate his clothes.

347
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,270
To be honest,

348
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,050
I always knew...

349
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,740
that he's envious of me.

350
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,320
(Dumbfounded)

351
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,880
- He acts like this...
- That's ridiculous.

352
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,590
- Because he's envious of you.
- You know how little boys...

353
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,220
- hit the girl they like...
- I know what you mean.

354
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,020
- for no reason.
- They'd make the girl cry.

355
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,350
- And they interrupt a game.
- Exactly.

356
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,520
I realized how that must feel.

357
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,830
I seriously hate his clothes.

358
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,930
You all have seen this shirt.

359
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,930
I wore this for the opening.

360
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,590
- Actually...
- He wore that not long ago.

361
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,840
Actually,

362
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,230
you don't wear anything
under this shirt.

363
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,440
Are you out of your mind?

364
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,500
- But I was considerate of him.
- Right.

365
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,680
You know he has a physical flaw.

366
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,640
(He let Jae Suk hide
his physical flaw.)

367
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,770
I was considerate of him...

368
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,450
and decided to bring a white shirt
to wear under it.

369
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,980
- What about the pants?
- I brought these wide-leg pants.

370
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,110
What's this?

371
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,340
- That's cool.
- Try it on.

372
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,250
(Haha's look,
Conservative Boy's Deviation Style)

373
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,250
Here are the normal clothes
that your stylists prepared.

374
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,020
(The normal clothes prepared by
the members' stylists)

375
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,330
The person who chooses
the clothes sit in the chair.

376
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,630
The others hang...

377
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,040
the tops and bottoms
of both styles...

378
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,910
under number 1 or 2 as you like.

379
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,500
Then we could mix
the different styles.

380
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,680
- That's possible.
- Really?

381
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,770
Both the top and bottom
So Min picked for me are weird.

382
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,140
Cheer up. You never know.

383
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,420
Okay.

384
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,770
- Choose anything.
- My clothes are not imposing.

385
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,190
Is it stretchy?

386
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,340
Yes, it's stretchy.

387
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,790
It can stretch a lot.

388
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,290
I think Jong Kook actually
likes my clothes.

389
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,220
- He checked the fabric...
- Hey, it wasn't like that.

390
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,390
- I want to know if it fits me.
- It'll fit you.

391
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,170
Of course, I considered
things like that.

392
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,570
I don't think it'll fit me.

393
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,760
Trust me. It's stretchy.

394
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,360
Se Chan's clothes are not
so different from each other.

395
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,040
- They're similar.
- As for the top,

396
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,310
I choose number two.

397
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,730
And as for the bottom...

398
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,230
(Walking toward the clothes)

399
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,870
Wait. Are they allowed to change it
after I pick the number?

400
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,220
Can't we just pick the clothes
for you?

401
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,590
- But all of them are nice.
- It'll be never-ending.

402
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,190
So you're not allowed to change it
after the choice is made.

403
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,550
- They're all nice.
- As for the top,

404
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,850
- I choose number two.
- Okay.

405
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,060
And number one for pants.

406
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,930
- Really? You made a good choice.
- He picked my pants.

407
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,160
- Is it a good choice?
- Indeed.

408
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,430
- He picked my traveling clothes.
- He picked the whole pair.

409
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,850
My traveling clothes.

410
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,930
- This and that?
- He picked both.

411
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,990
Okay. That's cool.

412
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,520
- A celebrity's traveling style.
- Exactly.

413
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,260
You picked a celebrity's
traveling style.

414
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,760
Suk Jin posed like this
in those clothes.

415
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,340
(He posed as other celebrities do
in those clothes.)

416
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,410
His pants were slipping down.

417
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,840
- That's the key point.
- I see.

418
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,910
That's confirmed. Who's next?

419
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,610
- I'll go next.
- Nice. This will be interesting.

420
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,050
- The zebra print pants.
- Finally.

421
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,380
- I chose the clothes carefully.
- I hope he'll choose these.

422
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,690
He's going to smile happily.

423
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,250
- I picked them very carefully.
- They look so weird.

424
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,090
- He's going to smile very happily.
- How can I wear them?

425
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,750
- Those pants...
- Those clothes have good memories.

426
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,980
The sleeveless shirt is not so bad.

427
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,200
I hope he'll choose the pants.

428
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,250
I don't care about the shirt.

429
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,590
I really hope...

430
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,620
- he'll wear the zebra print pants.
- Exactly.

431
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,720
It's made with thick fabric.

432
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,260
- He can show off his fit body.
- He'll look fashionable.

433
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,670
If the pants don't fit you,

434
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,760
- you don't have to wear them.
- You can see them, right?

435
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,260
- Exactly.
- Just draping them?

436
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,940
- Make your choice wisely.
- Just like Justin Bieber.

437
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,130
(His choice will decide...)

438
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,770
(whether or not he will
turn into a zebra.)

439
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,000
Let's go!

440
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,580
- I picked the wrong ones.
- Be quiet.

441
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,370
We're in the middle of a shoot.

442
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,510
(Please choose
at least one of them.)

443
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,660
I have a feeling that I should
choose number one...

444
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,880
for both top and bottom.

445
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,980
(He chose number one
for top and bottom.)

446
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,460
- What?
- Number one?

447
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,590
- Number one.
- Are you sure?

448
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,890
We're happy with your choice.

449
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,360
- Number 1.
- Number 1.

450
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,570
- Number one?
- Yes.

451
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,840
- That's nice.
- He'll look great.

452
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,860
I like them.

453
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,710
- He picked half wrong.
- That's right.

454
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,270
However, where should he
put his microphone?

455
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,600
- Right here.
- Where?

456
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,910
- On his back.
- Like this?

457
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,320
- On his forehead.
- On the back like this.

458
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,950
- He can put it on his back.
- Like a musical actor.

459
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,880
He can put it on his forehead
like a musical actor.

460
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,380
- Or give him a handheld microphone.
- Exactly.

461
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,250
I think it's inappropriate
for a TV show. Is it okay?

462
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,720
- Yes. Don't worry.
- I'll go next.

463
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,720
Look at that.

464
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,930
Gosh, this is...

465
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,390
Ji Hyo, to be honest,
Se Chan's clothes are nice.

466
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,590
- They're not bad.
- Really?

467
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,660
- Yes.
- They'll be too hot though.

468
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,700
They look sophisticated.

469
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,090
(He spoke without thinking much.)

470
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,040
I choose number two
from top to bottom.

471
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,390
- Okay.
- Okay.

472
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,260
That's perfect.

473
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,130
(Where are you?)

474
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,840
(Oh, you were all number two.)

475
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,580
<i>- What should I do?
- What should I do?</i>

476
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,110
- Ji Hyo, you made a good choice.
- She picked the whole set.

477
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,690
- That's perfect.
- Good choice.

478
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,790
Ji Hyo, good job.

479
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,160
(The other members also
chose the clothes to wear.)

480
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,020
(What clothes will they wear?)

481
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,120
(So they've finished
choosing their clothes.)

482
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,990
(Walking slowly)

483
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,260
Someone asked me if I had
changed my clothes.

484
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,470
I said, "These aren't my clothes."

485
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,310
"I'm wearing them for the show."

486
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,230
They suit me so well, right?

487
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,710
A celebrity's travel style.

488
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,720
(And someone is coming in.)

489
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,610
The pants are
a little too big for me, right?

490
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,220
(It was Kwang Soo wearing
the miniskirt prepared by So Min.)

491
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,190
(His long, skinny legs are
covered with red mesh stockings.)

492
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,250
I mean...

493
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,720
Why must she have gone this far?

494
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,930
- You look great, Kwang Soo.
- He does have nice legs.

495
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,560
- You have such pretty legs.
- You have nice legs.

496
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,860
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

497
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,830
So Min said she wishes
to have legs like yours.

498
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,230
It suits you well.

499
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,490
You should dress like this
more often.

500
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,130
(Upset)

501
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,940
Hey, Ji Hyo.

502
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,470
Sing a little bit of his song.

503
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,680
Look at her.

504
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
- She looks great.
- What should I do?

505
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,470
- Ji Hyo, you look great.
- Don't I...

506
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,050
Don't I look like Seong Mun?

507
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,880
- Ji Hyo, you look great.
- I like how she looks.

508
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,460
Ji Hyo, you should get a short cut
only in the front like this.

509
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,610
You look really great. I mean it.

510
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,720
You look perfect.

511
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,850
They look like a couple.

512
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,960
(The flashy fashion style reminds us
of Generation X...)

513
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,200
Can I trust you, staff members?

514
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
(from the end of the 20th century.)

515
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,300
Can I?

516
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,570
You're the worst dresser I've seen
so far this year.

517
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,040
- That's a terrible style.
- Why?

518
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,210
(They broke the worst fashion style
record of 2020.)

519
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,210
(Their poses and fashion styles
remind us of the late 1990s.)

520
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,370
Why?

521
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,410
(And then, a zebra entered.)

522
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,970
- Jae Suk.
- You look great.

523
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,920
He liked those pants.

524
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,110
I like these pants so much,
so I borrowed them.

525
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,510
- Look at the pants.
- He looks like a hair stylist.

526
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,690
- Exactly.
- They're just like my own clothes.

527
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,120
They really look like
your own clothes.

528
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,490
- Exactly.
- You should buy those pants...

529
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,260
- from Jae Suk.
- They feel like my own.

530
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,720
- He looks like a vice president.
- These are nice pants.

531
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,600
Who lives in Gimpo.

532
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,730
(He looks like the vice president
in the IT industry.)

533
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,500
Look at Jong Kook.

534
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,670
(Jong Kook is
the last one to enter.)

535
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,680
Look at Jong Kook.

536
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,610
- Why are you carrying it like that?
- What's that?

537
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,350
- Take the bag off.
- I'll carry it.

538
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,410
Put it down.

539
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,380
Are you going to a battlefield?

540
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,450
I thought it was a different type
of microphone.

541
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,350
No, it isn't.

542
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,510
I can't put it on anywhere else.

543
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,310
- I look the most stylish among us.
- That looks good.

544
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,920
- So Min looks cute.
- He's tall.

545
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,630
- She looks too pretty.
- So Min...

546
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,130
But if you look at her face...

547
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,550
and her head,
she looks like a baby octopus.

548
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,720
(She looks like a baby octopus.)

549
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,430
- Like the baby octopus alien?
- Exactly.

550
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,490
- Like the cartoon character.
- Doesn't she look like that alien?

551
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,200
She looks like
the baby octopus alien.

552
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,140
- Did I really wear them?
- I can't believe...

553
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,880
these are a celebrity's
traveling style.

554
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,000
- Suk Jin actually wore them.
- Isn't that Se Chan's?

555
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,150
My goodness.

556
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,300
- It looks like Se Chan's.
- It is shabby indeed.

557
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,380
(She's satisfied with
the fashion she recommended.)

558
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,450
It left marks on your forehead.

559
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,390
- I don't know how to wear it.
- Do you not wear beanies?

560
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,390
(They have a bonding moment
talking about their fashion.)

561
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,660
Suk Jin, you can
sit in the middle now.

562
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,480
The rest of you will
sit on the red chairs.

563
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,780
Why is he sitting in the middle?

564
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,100
- Ji Hyo, come here.
- Sit modestly.

565
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,160
My gosh.

566
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,260
(The thimble guy covers
Kwang Soo's legs in an onion net.)

567
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,290
It's a pantskirt.

568
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,030
It looks like
he's the head of a department.

569
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,670
I don't know which company this is,
but we're having a talent show.

570
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
Exactly.

571
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,940
(They are the top talents
for the talent show.)

572
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,740
All right. This is
your first choice.

573
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,970
You know the balance game
that's been popular these days?

574
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,120
One of you will come on up
and answer...

575
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,740
a question prepared for you.

576
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,010
The rest of you will...

577
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,690
guess the answer
that the member chooses.

578
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,960
(The rest of the members
will guess the answer chosen.)

579
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,690
If you get it right, you get candy
bars. If you don't, you return them.

580
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,220
You will pick an answer
all at the same time.

581
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,460
- As you count to three?
- I should pick what he'd choose.

582
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,130
- I will pick answers as I feel.
- Okay.

583
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,170
Just the way I feel.

584
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,290
I should read his mind.

585
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,170
- I think I can get it right.
- Sure.

586
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,060
- We know each other very well.
- That's true.

587
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,170
All right. Please show the question.

588
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,800
Okay.

589
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,570
- "If I were born again?"
- "A senior respected by Jae Suk".

590
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,470
(A senior respected by Jae Suk)

591
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,380
(An older brother
that Jong Kook is afraid of)

592
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,680
My gosh.

593
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,350
- It's so hard.
- Good.

594
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,620
"An older brother
that Jong Kook is afraid of"?

595
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,980
Gosh, this is too hard.

596
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,160
- This is tough.
- It's hard to choose.

597
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,080
- It's hard for me too.
- This is too hard.

598
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,390
You gave him this question
because he's none of them.

599
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,100
"A senior respected by Jae Suk"?

600
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,630
- Gosh, this is hard.
- A senior that Jae Suk respects...

601
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,790
or my older brother
whom I'm afraid of.

602
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,900
This is tough.

603
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,170
So let's say
he's having an interview.

604
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,260
They'd ask whom he respects
the most.

605
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,380
Then he'd say, "It's Ji Suk Jin."

606
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,680
I get to hear that.

607
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,950
Or I tell Jong Kook to come
to see me tomorrow by 2 p.m.

608
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,040
And Jong Kook is so worried.

609
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,950
"Why does he want to see me?"

610
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,970
(It can happen
only in his imagination.)

611
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,980
Then...

612
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,120
he calls Haha.

613
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,390
"Why do you think
Suk Jin wants to see me?"

614
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,980
He's so terrified that he peed
in front of your house.

615
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,480
- Trembling in fear.
- Gosh, it's confusing.

616
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,560
This is really hard.
It's interesting.

617
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,290
In fact, he respects me.

618
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,990
No. I like you,
but I don't respect you.

619
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,060
You fool...

620
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,370
He's just a friend.

621
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,730
- He's a good funny friend.
- A close friend.

622
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,800
- Right.
- I've never respected him...

623
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,270
not even a single time.

624
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,650
- Darn it.
- Seriously.

625
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,680
- Not even once?
- There was a time...

626
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,240
when I realized
that I can't respect him.

627
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,420
When we were younger,

628
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,390
we went through hard times together.

629
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,280
- That's what's real.
- We went around...

630
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,320
three used-car markets in Seoul.

631
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,720
- Why?
- And on our way home,

632
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,930
he bought a new car.

633
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,600
And you were there the whole time?

634
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,400
I did it for three days.

635
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,970
- It took him three days.
- Really?

636
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,830
This is what happened
only 30 minutes ago.

637
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,300
Before the opening,

638
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,880
I was sitting under a parasol.

639
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,830
- Oh, that one.
- And Hyeong Gu walked past him.

640
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,270
"Hyeong Gu, come here
and have a seat."

641
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,450
Then he stood up.

642
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,240
- He rarely leaves his seat.
- Right.

643
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,480
It turns out he picked up his chair
like this and moved to a shade.

644
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,690
(He picked up his chair
and moved to a shade.)

645
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,190
(Coincidentally, he moved to a shade
with his chair.)

646
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,750
He moved into the shade like that.

647
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,460
Hyeong Gu had no chair.

648
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,660
I thought he was giving
his chair to Hyeong Gu.

649
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,930
He brought his chair with him,
so Hyeong Gu...

650
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,170
had to stand there like this.

651
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,470
(He was standing under
the scorching sun for a long time.)

652
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,720
It's not like he can sit
on a transparent chair.

653
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,700
He was standing like this.

654
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,140
- Hyeong Gu, I'm sorry.
- He's the worst.

655
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,230
What do you think, Ji Hyo?

656
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,300
(What does Ji Hyo think?)

657
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,710
I think, if I were Suk Jin,

658
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,680
I would want to be someone...

659
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,040
- whom Jong Kook is afraid of.
- You relate to him.

660
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,620
- Right.
- You empathize with him.

661
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,890
- I will beat up Jong Kook someday.
- He didn't ask about your opinion.

662
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,010
That's her answer.

663
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,930
- What about you, Se Chan?
- I'll definitely choose Jong Kook.

664
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,960
(There's one more person
who'd pick option B.)

665
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,460
"Come here. How dare you."

666
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,930
"Relax your muscles."

667
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,260
(Se Chan, you seem excited.)

668
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,100
It's just my imagination.

669
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,640
- What about you, Haha? Is it B?
- Of course.

670
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,140
"Pick it up."

671
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,560
(They all let
their imagination run wild.)

672
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,970
"Yes, Haha. Here."

673
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,610
That's right. It sounds so good.

674
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,270
(Enjoy the moment.)

675
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,010
- I've made up my mind.
- I know his choice.

676
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,980
- I've made up my mind.
- 1, 2, and 3.

677
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,190
- B.
- B.

678
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,310
That's right.

679
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,920
So Min picked A.

680
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,780
(So Min is the only one
who got it wrong.)

681
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,750
Even if he respects me,
it's just useless.

682
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,430
But bossing him around
can be very useful.

683
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,700
- Exactly.
- It will be very fun.

684
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,490
He can be very useful.

685
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,490
- Let's move on.
- There's a lot to talk about this.

686
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,870
- What if you get to pick only one?
- "I get 100,000 dollars,"

687
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,500
"and Jae Suk gets 10 million
dollars without thanking me."

688
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,110
"None of us gets any money."

689
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,910
B sounds like throwing a tantrum.

690
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,850
B is just like throwing a tantrum.

691
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,450
- "I get 100,000 dollars..."
- B is just like throwing a tantrum.

692
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,950
(He feels excited already.)

693
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,270
So I get 100,000 dollars.

694
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,720
You will make
100,000 dollars anyway.

695
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,150
And Jae Suk gets
10 million dollars.

696
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,810
- I don't thank him at all.
- But he's not grateful to me.

697
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,690
- He gets the money because of you.
- Let's answer it right away.

698
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,820
Let's put it this way.

699
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,100
Suk Jin got me some information.

700
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,020
"Jae Suk, I heard
this one is good."

701
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,900
And he invested little money.

702
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,600
- And I invested huge money.
- So you made 10 million dollars.

703
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,670
That's how
you made 10 million dollars...

704
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,560
Suk Jin invested 10,000 dollars...

705
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,610
- while I invested one million.
- It increased tenfold.

706
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,540
That's how it feels. You talk to me.

707
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,680
I made 10 million dollars,
but I didn't even thank you.

708
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,040
I heard you invested
one million dollars.

709
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,540
You gave me the information.

710
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,120
I know. You should
at least buy me a meal.

711
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,720
- Or give me 30 percent...
- I invested my own money.

712
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,420
- It's your money, but...
- You didn't give me the money.

713
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,930
But I gave you the information.

714
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,390
It was my choice
that I made the investment.

715
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,600
(They just started
the skit for fun.)

716
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,470
(He's upset for real.)

717
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,790
- that I made the investment.
- Exactly.

718
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,170
- Your choice.
- Let's do it right away.

719
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,760
(Let's do it right away.)

720
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,610
- I can't stand this anymore.
- Count to three.

721
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,140
It's really upsetting to watch it.

722
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,530
- Please count to three.
- Did it help?

723
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,680
- A lot. That's enough.
- Did it help?

724
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,240
1, 2, and 3.

725
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,680
Darn it! I'm so furious.

726
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,350
- Did it help?
- I'd rather not get the money.

727
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,810
They both shouldn't get money.

728
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,420
- I don't want to be jealous.
- I understand.

729
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,080
- I don't want to be jealous.
- That's worse.

730
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,960
- I would hate him.
- Right. We would starve together.

731
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,580
- Right.
- I'd end up hating him.

732
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,360
- It's Se Chan's turn.
- Is it me? Okay.

733
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,430
- This is fun.
- That was a good one.

734
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,520
Yang Se Chan.

735
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
- This is fun.
- You have to imagine it.

736
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,370
- Balance game.
- This is the first question.

737
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,640
This one is tough.

738
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,170
I know what he'd choose.

739
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,370
Gosh, this is too hard.

740
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,300
- What if you date one of them?
- Hang on.

741
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,240
This is hard
because it's so serious.

742
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,680
No, I'm just doing this for fun.

743
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,310
- This is a sensitive issue.
- By the way...

744
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,150
- It's only for dating.
- It's only for dating.

745
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,220
Only for dating. Okay.

746
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,350
- Hang on.
- This is hard.

747
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,620
Gosh.

748
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,480
This is such a happy problem.

749
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,160
- You're right.
- I know. Thank you.

750
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,580
- You're so lucky.
- Wait. But...

751
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,820
This is too hard.

752
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,860
(Laughing)

753
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,050
It's only for dating.

754
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Ji Hyo just made a cute face.

755
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,490
I guess she forgot
that she's wearing a wig.

756
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,900
It's just dating.

757
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,400
- You date one of them.
- I just tell my friends...

758
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,060
- that I'm dating her.
- Right.

759
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,410
I know whom you will pick.

760
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:37,040
- All right. 1, 2, and 3.
- I will support you.

761
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,680
I wonder which one
would make me happier.

762
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,740
Three.

763
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,040
- A.
- That's right.

764
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,310
- My gosh.
- Se Chan!

765
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,220
Thank you, Se Chan.

766
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,220
Why?

767
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,050
Look at her. So Min seems happy.

768
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,750
- Do you like it?
- If I date her,

769
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,160
I think it will be more fun.

770
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,250
- Of course.
- What about Ji Hyo?

771
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,970
If I dated Ji Hyo,

772
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,490
she wouldn't
even be interested in me.

773
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,760
She'd just go her way.

774
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,610
- She doesn't even answer calls.
- I know. We should play games.

775
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,730
How do you break up
with your boyfriend, Ji Hyo?

776
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,610
I just tell him that
we should stop seeing each other.

777
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,710
What if you say that...

778
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,770
and your boyfriend...

779
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,220
What if he asks you
to give him another chance?

780
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,810
I will give him a chance.

781
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,420
- Just once?
- Yes. Just once.

782
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,080
What about you, So Min?

783
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,460
- She is...
- I...

784
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,250
I give countless chances.

785
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,520
(She gives unlimited chances.)

786
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,360
- I...
- She wants to see the end of it.

787
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
I break up with someone
only after I get sick of him.

788
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,490
- After you get sick of him.
- Right.

789
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,260
- And do you take your revenge?
- I take my revenge.

790
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,060
- I knew it.
- To the bitter end.

791
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,370
That's how she dates a guy.

792
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,970
She takes her revenge? That's funny.

793
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,170
Let's move on to the next question.

794
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,440
- This is so fun.
- This one is really tough.

795
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,470
"Which situation do you hate more?"

796
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,650
"My girlfriend goes on an
overnight trip with a male friend."

797
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,040
Gosh, this is a popular question.

798
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,350
Which situation do I hate more?

799
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,350
- Both of them sound horrible.
- It's a difficult question.

800
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,510
I really hate it.

801
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,510
Going on an overnight trip?

802
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,310
Only two of them? That's crazy.

803
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,960
Hey, A is a male friend
and B is an ex-boyfriend.

804
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,990
How could she go on an
overnight trip with a male friend?

805
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,400
With an ex-boyfriend,
if something goes wrong...

806
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,260
An overnight trip is just as bad.

807
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,200
But it's her ex-boyfriend.

808
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,700
- But it happens...
- It's her ex-boyfriend.

809
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,260
- It still happens...
- Look at them.

810
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,180
- If her ex-boyfriend...
- Jong Kook isn't explaining it.

811
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,230
He's forcing him
to choose one answer.

812
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,380
Then you should sit there
and give your answer.

813
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,010
That's not it. A male friend is...

814
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,380
I just can't pick what I want.

815
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,390
Nothing might happen
with a male friend, but...

816
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,780
But the thing is they drink
together all night.

817
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,690
And the other is
going on an overnight trip.

818
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,020
What happens after drinking?

819
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,290
It doesn't say what happens next!

820
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,720
I know. But you can imagine.

821
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,020
That doesn't say
what happens afterward.

822
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,330
(The hairdresser explodes
with anger.)

823
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,900
- All night...
- Does it say that?

824
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,060
It just says they drink together.

825
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,530
But why would they drink together?

826
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,710
Why are you being like that
in a sleeveless shirt?

827
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,800
You should think about it.

828
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,350
We should keep the possibility open.

829
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,120
- 1, 2, and 3.
- A male friend doesn't sound right.

830
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,310
- I hate both.
- I choose A.

831
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,720
- My answer is A.
- A is worse.

832
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,810
- Really?
- Because it's an overnight trip.

833
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,630
I should choose what I hate more.
I was mistaken.

834
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,320
Now I understand why Ji Hyo...

835
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,820
Ji Hyo... Now I know why
Ji Hyo doesn't hear what we say.

836
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,490
I can't hear with the beanie on.

837
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,170
(I can't hear with the beanie on.)

838
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,640
- Are you okay?
- I can't hear very well.

839
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,500
I just can't hear you.

840
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,530
- Did you feel the same?
- It's hard to hear, right?

841
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,710
Yes. I can't hear well.

842
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,800
Now I understand
why she was being like that.

843
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,380
This is the last question.

844
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,500
(What if a thug spits
on your girlfriend's face?)

845
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,920
You need to imagine the scene.

846
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,970
I know this one.

847
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,510
This is obvious.
He will definitely come at the thug.

848
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,310
(A, let it slide,
B, come at the thug.)

849
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,690
- One...
- Hang on.

850
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,480
Why are all the questions
for me like that?

851
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,050
All my questions are so lame.

852
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,990
- Because you're single.
- Because I'm single?

853
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,720
- Hey, just enjoy it.
- It's just a game.

854
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,970
It's just a game.

855
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,700
- Spit on her girlfriend's face?
- I'd let it slide if it's my face.

856
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,900
- But it's my girlfriend's.
- You're lying.

857
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,140
It's not going to happen
to you anyway.

858
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,880
So you're pretending to be tough.

859
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,030
(Spitting)

860
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,180
- Why did you do that?
- Stop it.

861
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,300
(Jae Suk hit him right away.)

862
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,070
Why did you hit me?
You said you would hold it back.

863
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,070
(Why did you hit me?
You said you'd hold it back.)

864
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,220
You said you would hold it back.

865
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,890
You said you'd let it slide
if someone spits in your face.

866
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,040
How dare you spit at me?

867
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,190
(Yelling)

868
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,890
He didn't do as he said he would.

869
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,980
If someone
who is dressed like that...

870
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,860
If someone who is dressed like that
spits at me,

871
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,020
- I would let it slide.
- Me too.

872
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,100
- I would be so scared.
- I would let it slide too.

873
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,130
Things like that scare me.

874
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,870
Se Chan, what if the thug is
as big and muscular as Jong Kook?

875
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,330
You should say something
before throwing a punch.

876
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,970
I bet he has no experience.

877
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,800
- It's obvious.
- You should say something first.

878
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,350
- Say what?
- "Hey, you punks!"

879
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,240
(Hey, you punks!)

880
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,350
(It didn't sound
intimidating at all.)

881
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,450
- Don't come near me.
- You would get beaten up.

882
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,780
You should say something
like that first.

883
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,950
His mouth would dry out right away
if he were in such a situation.

884
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,580
Because he's too nervous. "Why..."

885
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,820
"Hey, you punks."

886
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,190
(His mouth is dry.)

887
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,200
- That's funny.
- I bet Se Chan would let it slide.

888
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,790
- It's scary.
- He would let it slide.

889
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,220
Even if you end up getting
beaten up... If you let it slide,

890
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,670
- your relationship would be over.
- Absolutely.

891
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,060
- Right? You should do something.
- But...

892
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,770
maybe your girlfriend did something
to deserve being spat at.

893
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,070
(Maybe your girlfriend did something
to deserve being spat at.)

894
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,040
Suk Jin, it's not...

895
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,450
- For example...
- I mean...

896
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,950
What are you talking about?

897
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,180
What could she have done
to deserve it?

898
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,890
Let's say she said to the thug,
"Hey, you jerk!"

899
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,280
- My gosh.
- "What is wrong with you?"

900
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,420
Or she spat at the thug first.

901
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,050
Sometimes, when she's drunk,

902
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,700
- she does unusual things.
- That's possible.

903
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,760
- That's nonsense.
- "Hey, you scumbag!"

904
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,560
- Maybe she said that.
- "Stop it."

905
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,060
- The situation might be...
- I think he would let it slide.

906
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,210
Let's say So Min...
I mean, your girlfriend...

907
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,800
said to the thug,
"Hey, you pig with a tattoo."

908
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,410
- She provoked him first.
- Okay.

909
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,710
- I would try to stop her.
- So...

910
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,680
- the thug spat at her.
- "What? Did I say something wrong?"

911
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,010
So the thug spat at her.

912
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,890
Then I would spit at her too.

913
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,980
Hey.

914
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,540
(Then I would spit at her too.)

915
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,810
(How could you?)

916
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,920
Gosh.

917
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,690
To survive. I want to live.

918
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,080
- "Sir, didn't I do well?"
- "What is wrong with you?"

919
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,250
"Come to your senses."

920
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,360
(He would spit at her too.)

921
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,670
- One more time.
- "Take this."

922
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,060
"Get it together. Sir, I'll be off."

923
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
(He would save his own life
and go home.)

924
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,560
- Gosh.
- I can imagine that.

925
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,260
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

926
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,940
- Okay. 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

927
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,030
I knew it.

928
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,770
I wouldn't let it slide.

929
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,880
- This one is easy.
- Even if I get beaten up...

930
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,450
- What?
- Did you pick A?

931
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,880
I think he would let it slide.

932
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,950
- Nonsense.
- He wouldn't.

933
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,510
I would throw a fit.

934
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,780
- Me?
- It's Jae Suk's turn.

935
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,920
- I know everything about him.
- Okay.

936
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,960
My head itches because of the hat.

937
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,160
- Put it back on.
- The forehead too.

938
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,820
- That's why Ji Hyo scratches often.
- Right?

939
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,820
Ji Hyo.

940
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,490
She must be used to wearing a wig.
She seems comfortable.

941
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,470
It's so comfortable.

942
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,520
Let's begin.

943
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,230
- "Which one do you regret more?"
- "Not scolding Suk Jin."

944
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,330
"B, not taming Jong Kook
when starring on 'X-Man'".

945
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,870
- That's an interesting question.
- It's difficult.

946
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,570
(A, not scolding Suk Jin
when he was a newcomer)

947
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,880
(B, not taming Jong Kook
when starring on "X-Man")

948
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,300
- My gosh. Hang on.
- Which one of them...

949
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,380
"Not scolding Suk Jin
when he was a newcomer".

950
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,680
- Let me think.
- I already made my choice.

951
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,890
- You did?
- I made my choice.

952
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,420
- It's difficult.
- This is a hard one.

953
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,010
- How harshly would he scold him?
- How would he scold him?

954
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,580
Actually, I had a few chances.

955
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,050
- You lost your chances.
- He's your junior comedian, right?

956
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,160
- Yes, he is.
- That one is also funny.

957
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,130
- "Not taming Jong Kook".
- "Not taming Jong Kook".

958
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,970
He used to walk on eggshells
around you.

959
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,700
Honestly, both are right,

960
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,370
but if I must choose one,
I would choose this.

961
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,560
- Okay.
- As soon as I read it,

962
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,500
- I thought...
- I know his answer.

963
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,300
- I've been looking at the answer.
- Don't say that now.

964
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,470
All right.

965
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,470
I see which one he's looking at.

966
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,970
I know his answer. I'm sure of it.

967
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,180
- Start counting, please.
- 1, 2, 3.

968
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,190
- Then answer is B.
- It's A.

969
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,510
- It's A.
- Of course, it's A.

970
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,690
Of course, it's A.

971
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,080
A? No, it must be B.

972
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,250
Since "X-Man", Jong Kook has
always been...

973
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,890
- behaving well.
- I'm always polite.

974
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,490
Did Suk Jin address you
as his senior comedian at first?

975
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,860
- Or did he talk casually to you?
- No, I didn't.

976
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,870
At first, when we were
alone together,

977
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,170
- he called me by my name.
- I see.

978
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,490
But when our senior comedians were
with us, he said, "Hello, Mr. Yu."

979
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,370
- Really?
- I can't believe it.

980
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,530
- It's hard to believe.
- Really?

981
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,880
I didn't know he used to do that.

982
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,880
- You should've scolded him then.
- When everyone gathered.

983
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,150
- "Hello, Mr. Yu."
- But he didn't bow deeply.

984
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,540
"Hello, Mr. Yu."

985
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,620
Let's move on to the next question.

986
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,240
"How would you be born
in your next life?"

987
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,780
(A, an ugly but popular show host,
B, a handsome but ordinary man)

988
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,310
"An ugly but popular..."
That's who he is now.

989
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,480
- Okay.
- I think I know the answer.

990
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,190
- This is...
- "A handsome but ordinary man".

991
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,020
- "In your next life".
- I don't...

992
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,430
I don't like this question.

993
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,600
- A describes his current life.
- That's a weird question.

994
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,170
Hey. A is my current life?

995
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,560
- You're living as the A type.
- But A...

996
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,140
- That's my current life?
- Yes, correct.

997
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,440
Would you live as Yoo Jae Suk again
in your next life or...

998
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,140
- Hey.
- It's either your current life...

999
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,040
- or a different life.
- What are you talking about?

1000
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,720
Think about it. You want to live
as an ugly man again?

1001
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,950
You little...

1002
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,420
- Jae Suk, that'd be boring.
- Gosh.

1003
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,480
When we went to a club
before he became popular,

1004
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,550
ladies hated him so much.

1005
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,460
They didn't hate me.

1006
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,860
- Like those losers at a club.
- They weren't interested in me.

1007
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,170
I know how sad that feels.

1008
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,760
- They weren't interested in me.
- I know how that feels too.

1009
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,140
- I wasn't...
- All right.

1010
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,560
- Okay.
- If I could choose...

1011
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,680
- I can relate to that.
- If I choose B,

1012
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,270
I need some guarantee.

1013
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,270
- Zo In Sung...
- Absolutely.

1014
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,070
Park Bo Gum or Zo In Sung...

1015
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,950
- If I'm as handsome as they are...
- He looks happy.

1016
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,470
- Or Gang Dong Won.
- What?

1017
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,080
And let's say the ugly man
in A is like...

1018
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,480
- Kwang Soo or Suk Jin...
- No, it's you.

1019
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,280
- Jae Suk, come on.
- It's you.

1020
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,280
- It's you.
- It's not me.

1021
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,430
Would you be Yoo Jae Suk
or Zo In Sung in your next life?

1022
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,700
- All right.
- Okay.

1023
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,900
- You don't even need...
- 1, 2,

1024
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,130
- Three.
- Of course, it's B.

1025
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,560
(Jae Suk chose B.)

1026
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,870
- He picked B?
- Of course, he picked B.

1027
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,440
- Of course, I picked B.
- He must want that life too.

1028
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,940
I want to live as In Sung
or Bo Gum in my next life.

1029
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,940
- Of course, he wants that.
- I want that kind of life.

1030
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,270
Of course. How can he
live like this again?

1031
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,570
- What did you just say?
- I'm sorry, Jae Suk.

1032
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,310
- Please don't be mad.
- All right.

1033
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,350
Here's the next question.

1034
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,350
(A, the intelligent-looking face,
B, the perfect body for a suit)

1035
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,480
"What makes you popular?"

1036
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,890
- "A, the intelligent-looking face".
- What's that?

1037
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,250
None of those is true.

1038
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,250
- This isn't true.
- None of them is true.

1039
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,250
Pick the one that you think
had even a little influence.

1040
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,400
- But...
- "Intelligent-looking"?

1041
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,020
- I mean...
- "Intelligent-looking"?

1042
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,170
That bothers me.

1043
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,790
That word itself makes me cringe.

1044
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,490
- "Intelligent-looking"?
- My gosh.

1045
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,490
(It makes everyone cringe.)

1046
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,610
The questions should be made
based on facts.

1047
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,800
- Don't you think so?
- There's no fact in there.

1048
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,940
Do you mean that he's good-looking?

1049
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,180
You can say it's true
because some people...

1050
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,710
- say that on the internet.
- That's not true.

1051
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,610
Did you make the question
based on those silly comments?

1052
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,350
(Did you make the question
based on those silly comments?)

1053
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,970
Why would you call them
silly comments?

1054
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,150
People call that kind of comment
silly comments.

1055
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,980
Let's make it simple.
My face or my body?

1056
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,250
- Okay.
- It's simple.

1057
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,890
- So we can accept it.
- My...

1058
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,980
- My face or my body?
- Or your body.

1059
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,160
- 1...
- 1, 2, 3.

1060
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,500
- My face. Why?
- Gosh.

1061
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,770
(He chose his face
with confidence.)

1062
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,660
- That's not true.
- That's total nonsense.

1063
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,500
- You know that's not true.
- Gosh, seriously.

1064
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,560
- Jae Suk, you can't do that.
- You must've lost your mind.

1065
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,000
- Jae Suk. Come on.
- How could you?

1066
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,310
- This is not right.
- Darn it.

1067
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,870
- Have you...
- The answer should be B.

1068
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,450
- Have you lost your mind?
- Wait.

1069
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,180
I knew he thought that way.

1070
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,350
- I can't believe this.
- What's the problem?

1071
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,890
- You agreed to tell the truth.
- What's wrong with my answer?

1072
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,980
My gosh. It turns out he was
satisfied with his face.

1073
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,290
- What's wrong with my answer?
- I'm shocked.

1074
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,980
- Why?
- I'm shocked too.

1075
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,660
Wait. Se Chan, why is your chair
attached to your pants?

1076
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,750
What?

1077
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,230
- I've been looking for the chair.
- It's perfect for traveling.

1078
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,040
- What happened?
- Gosh.

1079
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,470
(The strange encounter
between the chair and his hips)

1080
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,810
(The chair has been hanging there
like a fruit on a tree.)

1081
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,140
(What? Where did my chair go?)

1082
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,330
What's wrong with my answer?

1083
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,600
(After looking for his chair
for a long while,)

1084
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,410
(he found his chair
suffocated by his hips.)

1085
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,410
Here goes the final question.

1086
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,890
- It's a difficult one.
- That's easy.

1087
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,410
(Which body part would you cover
if a public bath is on fire?)

1088
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,290
(A, the face, B, the private part)

1089
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,180
- He doesn't need to cover it.
- I'm sure...

1090
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,790
My goodness.
Have you lost your mind?

1091
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,950
- It's so cute.
- What kind of question is that?

1092
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,160
Seriously, what kind of
question is that?

1093
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,160
Honestly, if he comes out
covering his face,

1094
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,910
people would think
he's a little boy...

1095
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,660
I mean, people would know
he's an adult...

1096
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,580
- Are you insane?
- So they would help him...

1097
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,410
Have you lost your mind?

1098
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,580
- I'm telling you,
- Gosh.

1099
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,140
it wouldn't be visible
if he runs fast.

1100
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,180
(It wouldn't be visible
if he runs fast.)

1101
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,680
(I have a lot to say,
but I won't say anything.)

1102
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,890
Trust me.

1103
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,180
(The visibility would change
depending on his running speed.)

1104
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,410
Gosh. All of you are insane.

1105
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,930
Gosh, seriously.

1106
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,390
Imagine that situation.

1107
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,060
- Okay.
- 1, 2, 3.

1108
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,430
- He would cover his face.
- It must be A.

1109
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,430
- Of course, he'd cover his face.
- Of course.

1110
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,790
- I thought about it.
- Why...

1111
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,560
I would be so embarrassed
if I come out like this.

1112
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,080
- Of course.
- Right?

1113
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,770
- It's better to cover your face.
- Next up is Kwang Soo.

1114
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,250
- That was ridiculous.
- Okay.

1115
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,870
- Kwang Soo...
- I think it'll be difficult.

1116
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,980
Be honest with us, okay?

1117
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,480
- I'll be honest.
- Be yourself.

1118
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,790
- I promise.
- Don't lie.

1119
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,620
- I won't.
- Don't lie.

1120
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,810
(A, having Jong Kook bathe me
thoroughly, B, bathing Suk Jin)

1121
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,080
- "Which situation would you avoid?"
- "Having Jong Kook..."

1122
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,830
- "bathe me".
- My gosh.

1123
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,660
(Which situation would you avoid?)

1124
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,560
(A, having Jong Kook bathe me
thoroughly, B, bathing Suk Jin)

1125
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,950
(Everyone is exclaiming
as they read the question.)

1126
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,290
Why would Jong Kook...

1127
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,770
bathe me thoroughly?

1128
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,790
- That's so funny.
- What kind of question is that?

1129
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,160
- Why must I choose any of those?
- That's hilarious.

1130
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,410
I bathe Suk Jin?

1131
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,370
Do I wash his entire body?

1132
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,080
Not just his face?
Do I give him a bath?

1133
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,220
- Don't you think that's too much?
- Can I wear rubber gloves?

1134
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,540
- I can take a bath by myself.
- My gosh.

1135
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,620
I just pictured it for a moment.

1136
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,950
Wait. Excuse me.

1137
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,180
- No.
- Just a second.

1138
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,580
- No. Don't touch me.
- Just a second.

1139
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,790
- I said no.
- Let me just imagine it.

1140
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,830
Gosh, no. Go away.

1141
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,500
(Go away!)

1142
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,970
- Oh, man. That's disgusting.
- Which would be worse?

1143
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,770
- I pictured it for a moment too.
- Both are disgusting.

1144
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,060
- Exactly. Which one should I pick?
- How disgusting.

1145
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,560
Hey, you don't know my hands...

1146
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,230
At least,
doing B would be fulfilling.

1147
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,640
- I imagined the B situation.
- Yes.

1148
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,950
I thought it could happen
in the near future.

1149
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,980
- You're right. It'll be sad.
- Hey. That will never happen.

1150
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,350
I can do it for him.

1151
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,410
- That won't happen.
- It'll be sad.

1152
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,040
- I'll be happy to do it for you.
- It will never happen.

1153
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,390
I pick what's worse, right?

1154
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,560
- Did you make your choice?
- Okay. Yes, I made my choice.

1155
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,060
1, 2, 3.

1156
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,520
- I think that would be worse.
- Of course, he picked A.

1157
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,730
(Suk Jin feels bitter
but accepts it.)

1158
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,100
- If I were...
- Let's move on.

1159
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,370
- Goodness, you brat.
- Stop it!

1160
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,430
(Scrubbing his body roughly)

1161
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,700
This is unbearable.

1162
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,370
- You brat.
- Stop it.

1163
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,810
Here's the last question.

1164
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,370
- "Which would be worse?"
- "A, playing games with So Min".

1165
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,080
"B, listening to Jae Suk's
dating advice all night over tea".

1166
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
(Which is worse?)

1167
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,910
- Dating advice?
- A is better.

1168
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,410
- Of course, A is better.
- This is a tough choice.

1169
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,410
Haven't you had drinks
with her before?

1170
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,520
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm fun to be around!

1171
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,910
- Both will be painful.
- Kwang Soo.

1172
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,980
- I think I know his choice.
- My dating advice helped, right?

1173
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,730
I'm fun to be around.

1174
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,520
I know because I often
have drinks with her.

1175
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,620
I'm good company.

1176
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,850
Both situations are painful.

1177
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,290
- Did you wash your face?
- Hold on.

1178
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,700
Kwang Soo, I always give you
good dating advice.

1179
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,930
Keep your head on straight.

1180
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,540
What a tough choice.

1181
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,060
You must endure it all night.

1182
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,730
I'm fun to be around!

1183
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,330
I can shake up the choice of teas.

1184
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,580
Chamomile and so on and so forth.

1185
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,910
- It's the worst!
- I can shake things up.

1186
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,020
- The tea can be swapped.
- Still...

1187
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,540
1, 2, 3.

1188
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,580
- This must be it.
- A.

1189
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,620
- What?
- It's B.

1190
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,480
- Unbelievable.
- Seriously?

1191
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,720
- It's disappointing.
- How can this be better?

1192
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,430
- Why?
- I'm choosing the worse one.

1193
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,480
- He chose you over Jae Suk.
- He chose you.

1194
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,020
(It took her a second
to understand.)

1195
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,200
- Right. Yes, of course.
- Drinking with her all night?

1196
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,970
I give out great dating advice.

1197
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,790
I haven't given you any lately...

1198
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,200
- because you're seeing someone.
- You see,

1199
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,330
I've actually tried both.

1200
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,500
Personally though,

1201
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,910
Jae Suk's advice
ruined things for me.

1202
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,480
(Jae Suk's advice
ruined things for him.)

1203
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,770
Just the result alone, I mean.

1204
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,480
Kwang Soo.

1205
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,720
Things wouldn't have gone
very far with her anyway.

1206
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,980
Stop it!

1207
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,310
- Ji Hyo's next.
- Right, Ji Hyo.

1208
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,450
It'll be fun.

1209
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,850
- She's tough to read.
- I'm clueless when it comes to her.

1210
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,680
- She could be easier to read.
- She's hard to understand.

1211
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,560
Ji Hyo's hard to read.

1212
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,160
But she's also quite simple.

1213
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,750
- Right.
- Yes, I don't think too much.

1214
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,330
What's worse?

1215
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,700
"A, being in a room filled
with cockroaches for an hour".

1216
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,660
I know the answer to this. I know!

1217
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,970
- Choosing B would be weird.
- I know!

1218
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,000
What Ji Hyo thinks
about cockroaches...

1219
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,830
It'd be weird if Kwang Soo
guessed B.

1220
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,160
We don't even need time to think.

1221
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,580
How can you compare
Kwang Soo to cockroaches?

1222
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,430
- I mean...
- It's fine.

1223
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,750
- You and cockroaches...
- This...

1224
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,350
is a mistake on their part.

1225
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,640
- Okay.
- All right.

1226
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,750
Is it one cockroach or...

1227
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,980
- A room full of them.
- Multiple cockroaches.

1228
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,290
You've got this, Kwang Soo.

1229
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,580
Ji Hyo loathes cockroaches.

1230
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,890
- It's not like you must kiss one.
- Hold on.

1231
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,660
Why did you ask
how many cockroaches there were?

1232
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,160
(Why did you ask
how many cockroaches there were?)

1233
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,330
I know for a fact
that you hate cockroaches.

1234
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,700
You're not dating one, okay?

1235
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,270
Wait, hold on.

1236
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,730
Ji Hyo...

1237
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,270
- I keep going back and forth.
- Ji Hyo, look at him.

1238
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,970
I thought for a second
that she had to date one.

1239
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,870
- It's Kwang Soo you're dating.
- It's only for an hour.

1240
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,930
An hour with cockroaches
or with Kwang Soo forever.

1241
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,770
You have to be
in that room for an hour.

1242
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,580
You crouch and cry
when any bug approaches you.

1243
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,250
- It's just for an hour.
- She knows.

1244
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,270
1, 2, 3.

1245
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,750
- Cockroaches, of course.
- She chose B?

1246
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,640
(In a twist of events,
she chooses B.)

1247
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,950
(Dating Kwang Soo is worse?)

1248
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,120
She chose B?

1249
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,450
(You hate me more
than you hate cockroaches?)

1250
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,890
- A.
- A, of course.

1251
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,000
Of course, she'd choose A.

1252
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,520
Kwang Soo was extremely shocked
just now.

1253
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,390
- I...
- I thought she really chose B.

1254
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,500
Of course not.

1255
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
- I absolutely loathe cockroaches.
- Exactly.

1256
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,430
Here.

1257
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,930
(Who would you marry?)

1258
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,700
- This is a tough one.
- Who would you marry?

1259
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,480
- It's not easy.
- Don't you hate both?

1260
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,500
- Me too.
- They're both awful.

1261
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,080
- Mama's boy is the worst.
- Tell me about it.

1262
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,500
Would it be like this?

1263
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,680
When out on a date,

1264
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,220
- this man would call his mom.
- Right.

1265
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,520
"Mom, I'm on a date with So Min."

1266
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,290
"A movie or coffee?
A movie? Okay, thanks."

1267
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,180
- For instance...
- That's how he makes up his mind.

1268
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,850
He must go on a date
that his mom planned for him.

1269
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,890
(That's awful.)

1270
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,620
- But a womanizer...
- At least it means he's charming.

1271
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,120
A womanizer is charming...

1272
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,930
but he's seeing
about five other women.

1273
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:05,930
Would that be all right?

1274
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,270
- Suk Jin, which would you choose?
- What?

1275
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,140
- Out of the two...
- Me?

1276
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,930
Well, I used to be
a womanizer briefly.

1277
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,200
That's not what I meant.

1278
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,910
I...

1279
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,230
When were you a womanizer exactly?

1280
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,410
Why were you one?

1281
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,500
- Why do you lie all the time?
- Why were you one?

1282
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,770
It's a lie.

1283
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,810
- Well...
- He's never been young enough.

1284
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,020
He always looked like
a middle-aged man.

1285
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,910
- It's true.
- You see,

1286
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,180
it's like this.

1287
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,250
Being popular among women...

1288
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,350
turns you briefly into a womanizer.

1289
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,930
I apologize to Suk Jin's wife.

1290
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,160
I set you two up, didn't I?
I'm sorry.

1291
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,020
I'm so sorry.

1292
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,330
- So Min?
- Well...

1293
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,560
It's too hard of a choice.

1294
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
(What does the dating expert think?)

1295
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,100
The womanizer is probably handsomer.

1296
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,080
She...

1297
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,680
Don't consider those variables.

1298
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,410
- Not the looks.
- Why would you consider that?

1299
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,480
You're not just dating this person.

1300
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,220
- You're marrying him.
- Mama's boy is the worst.

1301
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,980
- It's not so bad.
- This is a tough choice.

1302
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,180
A mama's boy for life?

1303
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,640
- One...
- You can't handle a mama's boy.

1304
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,060
- 2, 3.
- Tell me about it.

1305
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,890
(She chooses a mama's boy instead.)

1306
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,020
A mama's boy is the worst though.

1307
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,180
I hate both.

1308
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,600
It's So Min.

1309
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,620
Here we go.

1310
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,120
Here's your first choice.

1311
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,370
Who would you date?

1312
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,620
(A, Se Chan who loves me,
B, Dong Jun whom I love)

1313
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,700
This...

1314
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,790
The answer is obvious.

1315
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,700
- The answer is obvious.
- Of course, it is.

1316
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,870
This will be easy for anyone...

1317
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,270
- who knows me.
- Exactly.

1318
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,600
- Come on.
- This?

1319
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,250
I see I'm up against Dong Jun...

1320
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:25,980
when someone was
up against cockroaches.

1321
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,770
Someone had to compete
with cockroaches,

1322
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,410
but I'm up against Dong Jun.

1323
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,410
- Gosh, thank you so much.
- Lucky you.

1324
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,350
Someone had to compete
with cockroaches.

1325
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,580
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

1326
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,750
I was up against
an hour with cockroaches.

1327
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,450
- Okay, good.
- All right.

1328
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,230
1, 2, 3.

1329
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,560
(Who will So Min choose?)

1330
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,230
1, 2, 3.

1331
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,810
- Of course, it's A.
- It was too easy.

1332
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,100
So Min likes those
who only have eyes for her.

1333
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,580
- Of course, it's A.
- The guy loving me...

1334
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,680
is more important.

1335
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:56,870
Ji Hyo...

1336
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,350
She doesn't know So Min at all.

1337
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,680
Ji Hyo?

1338
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,810
- Did she choose Dong Jun?
- She doesn't know So Min at all.

1339
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,140
That wig is hilarious.

1340
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,810
I thought about what
So Min would like.

1341
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,350
The wig and that answer
go so well together.

1342
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,410
She looks like a thug, right?

1343
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:11,560
Would you choose B?

1344
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,080
- You'd choose A too, right?
- That's right.

1345
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,520
Rather than the guy I like,

1346
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,430
I'd like to date someone
who loves me.

1347
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,160
- That's how it should be.
- Right.

1348
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,330
Let's move on.

1349
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,770
Which is worse?

1350
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,270
(A, Jong Kook suspecting you
when you're the spy)

1351
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,000
(B, Jong Kook suspecting you
when you're not the spy)

1352
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,200
I know the feeling!

1353
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,180
It's the worst.

1354
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,200
I know the feeling!
I know it so well.

1355
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,680
- My gosh.
- This...

1356
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,810
- is the worst.
- It's hilarious though.

1357
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,640
- It's the worst.
- It sure is.

1358
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,410
In situation A,

1359
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,540
- He stresses you out.
- you'd rather just die.

1360
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,390
Remember last time?

1361
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,160
Can't you look over this way
at least once?

1362
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,480
Just get it over with.

1363
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,250
We won't know until we take a look.

1364
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,520
This...

1365
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,560
(Just thinking about it
gives her a headache.)

1366
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,600
1, 2, 3.

1367
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,930
- A.
- My gosh.

1368
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,890
Still, it's nice because
he shows interest in you.

1369
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,330
You have no idea how angry I get...

1370
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,390
when situation A happens.

1371
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,470
- Recently, you and Haha...
- I...

1372
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,640
That situation. Yes, I know it too.

1373
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,810
- I mean it.
- Me too.

1374
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,200
- I never let it go.
- It makes you so angry.

1375
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,980
I wanted to claw at him.

1376
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,080
- I never let it go.
- He checks your hands too.

1377
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,040
Situation B only happens on camera.

1378
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,290
Meanwhile, situation A
happens off camera too.

1379
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,810
He keeps smirking at you.

1380
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:14,810
(Smirking)

1381
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,480
(Grinning)

1382
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,680
It's the worst.

1383
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,830
(Even Jong Kook admits it.)

1384
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,850
Here's the next one.

1385
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,790
- That was hilarious.
- What would you like...

1386
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,950
your boyfriend to say tonight?

1387
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,660
"A, something sexy
in a sweet voice".

1388
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,730
"B, something sweet
in a sexy voice".

1389
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,500
- Something sexy in a sweet voice.
- I think I know.

1390
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,060
Something sweet in a sexy voice.

1391
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,410
What kind of voice
do you find sexy though?

1392
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,970
- Something sweet in a sexy voice.
- The voice...

1393
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,200
Who has a voice...

1394
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,640
that isn't pleasant?

1395
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,140
- Him saying something sweet.
- There's Cho Sae Ho.

1396
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,310
- "Hello."
- Him saying something sweet.

1397
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,870
"Did you sleep well? I love you."

1398
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:43,980
On the other hand, Lee Sun Kyun...

1399
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,080
- will say something sweet.
- "I said I love you."

1400
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,790
"Come on."

1401
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,680
"I love you, darn it."

1402
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,080
"I said I love you."

1403
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,060
- Then we have our answer.
- Let's do it.

1404
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,430
- Do you want an example?
- Sure.

1405
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,870
Say "Hello" is a sweet voice
and then in a sexy voice.

1406
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,060
- In a sweet voice?
- That's right.

1407
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,890
- "Hello."
- Now, it a sexy voice.

1408
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,290
(Suk Jin's sexy voice)

1409
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,370
"Hello."

1410
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,600
(It's overly corny!)

1411
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,000
No, that's not it!

1412
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,410
One would end the call immediately.

1413
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,870
You seemed sick to me.

1414
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,200
What's a sexy voice though?

1415
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,950
- Jae Suk, what about you?
- What's a sweet voice?

1416
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,220
- A sweet voice.
- My sweet voice?

1417
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,480
- "Hello."
- He can be very sweet.

1418
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,580
- What about your sexy voice?
- I've never tried that before.

1419
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,580
(Exhaling)

1420
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,620
No, that's not it.

1421
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,560
- I'll pass.
- What's with the breathing?

1422
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,250
That sounded disgusting.

1423
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,290
(His unappealing heavy breathing)

1424
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,770
Aren't I allowed to breathe?

1425
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,470
Even his breathing sounded ugly.

1426
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:36,040
- What?
- Even his breathing sounded ugly.

1427
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,470
- You...
- From what I could hear,

1428
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,330
- his breathing sounded ugly.
- It sounded ugly?

1429
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,000
- That's how it sounded.
- Gosh.

1430
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,080
Let's hear from Se Chan next.

1431
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,310
Cover your face.

1432
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,750
(Se Chan's sweet voice)

1433
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,950
Your sweet voice.

1434
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,140
"Hello."

1435
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,250
And your sexy voice.

1436
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:52,020
- Stop it!
- "Hello."

1437
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,350
- Why are you breathing like that?
- But...

1438
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,480
"Hello."

1439
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,290
(Panting)

1440
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,350
Are you awake?

1441
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,700
- What on earth is that?
- Gosh.

1442
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,000
- Jong Kook's sweet voice.
- "Hello."

1443
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,330
- And your sexy voice.
- "Hello."

1444
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,770
- Put more thought into it.
- Actually, this...

1445
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,230
- You shouldn't try so hard.
- I agree.

1446
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,410
Kwang Soo, you go ahead.

1447
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,000
- "Hello."
- Next.

1448
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,580
Did he get it wrong or something?

1449
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,680
(Another incident where Jae Suk...)

1450
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,040
(comes onto Running Man
just to tease Kwang Soo)

1451
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,450
What do you mean?

1452
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,720
Weren't you done?

1453
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,450
- Of course not.
- The sexy one.

1454
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,790
- "Hello."
- And the sexy voice.

1455
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:26,850
The sexy voice.

1456
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,310
"Hello."

1457
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,060
(In a low voice)

1458
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,450
(Emotional)

1459
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:32,730
You forgot you're in a skirt again.

1460
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,850
- Must I wear this all day?
- Cover yourself up!

1461
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,560
Must I wear this all day?

1462
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,660
- Just put on some pants.
- But...

1463
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,640
Wear the pants
you brought with you today.

1464
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,290
- What about Haha?
- He has a nice voice.

1465
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,540
Be sweet first.

1466
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:46,970
"Hello."

1467
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,980
- Was that your sweet voice?
- Yes.

1468
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,180
- The sexy one.
- Your sexy voice.

1469
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,250
- "Hello."
- Oh, that was sexy!

1470
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,850
(A sexy low tone)

1471
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,770
- What a great voice.
- The tone must be lower.

1472
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:00,350
The sweetest voice was Jae Suk's...

1473
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:01,850
while the sexiest voice
was Haha's.

1474
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,060
(So Min's choice)

1475
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,180
I made up my mind.

1476
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,680
One...

1477
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,560
The keyword is "tonight".

1478
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,060
- Yes, tonight.
- Tonight?

1479
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,970
- 1, 2, 3.
<i>- The man of the night</i>

1480
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:12,970
- B.
- B.

1481
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,700
(A, something sexy in a sweet voice,
B, something sweet in a sexy voice)

1482
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,140
- Nice!
- I choose B.

1483
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,660
(They all choose B.)

1484
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,500
Since it's "tonight".

1485
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,980
I think I'll get a full score
with Jong Kook's choices.

1486
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,850
I'm going to keep it real...

1487
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,270
and choose whatever I want.

1488
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,810
What if you had to
give up just one thing?

1489
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:29,980
(A, losing muscle mass,
B, staying single forever)

1490
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,520
Gosh, this is a tricky one.

1491
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,640
For Jong Kook, it'll be B.

1492
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,720
- Gosh, this is a tricky one.
- Goodness.

1493
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,910
For Jong Kook, it'll be B.

1494
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:37,120
You must be honest.

1495
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,350
The keyword is "forever".

1496
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,020
"Losing muscle mass"
is just a funny way to put it.

1497
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,750
- Jong Kook, look.
- How is this a hard choice?

1498
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,870
Look at how I am.

1499
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,600
You'll end up with my body.

1500
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,200
(You'll end up with my body.)

1501
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,310
No, don't show him that.

1502
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,830
- His body...
- Your body will become like mine.

1503
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,680
I'll think about it right now.

1504
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,350
- If you're as muscular...
- Right away.

1505
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,370
- as Jong Kook,
- You can't exercise forever.

1506
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:01,370
- he has to continue exercising.
- I can't exercise forever.

1507
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,540
- Isn't it better to...
- This is a good question.

1508
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,950
Isn't it better
to have flabby arms...

1509
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,950
- than to never date?
- This is so funny.

1510
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,450
- You really don't know me.
- It's A.

1511
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,450
You're contemplating it, aren't you?

1512
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,230
You don't know how big of a deal
it is to us.

1513
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,560
- It's really...
- Losing muscles...

1514
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,870
This is really...
You must not understand.

1515
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:22,140
If I lose that,
I'm losing everything.

1516
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,560
This is just a game.

1517
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,410
You don't have to get this angry.

1518
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,100
- This is... I imagined it,
- Just imagining it upsets you?

1519
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,580
- and it's really horrific.
- Is it?

1520
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,410
All right, let's just do it.

1521
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,770
- 1.
- 1, 2, 3.

1522
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,680
- It's B.
- It's A.

1523
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,270
- It's B.
- No, it's A.

1524
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,850
- No, he said it's B.
- I have to change it.

1525
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,140
- It's B. He doesn't understand.
- Right.

1526
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,560
Are you giving up on love, you punk?

1527
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,250
- Is that what you'd do?
- I'll give up on love.

1528
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,930
- You're choosing muscles?
- I'm sorry, but this isn't...

1529
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,060
- something I need to think about.
- Why not?

1530
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,290
It's not logical for us.

1531
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,890
- It's like love to Jong Kook.
- What's wrong with losing muscle?

1532
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,230
A doesn't make sense.

1533
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:54,370
- Let's move on to the next one.
- Exercising.

1534
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,230
"A lover who uses up an entire box
of tissues when she blows her nose".

1535
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,770
"A lover who sucks it in because
she doesn't want to waste tissues".

1536
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,040
She sucks in her snot?

1537
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,060
(Which lover is better?)

1538
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,770
Hold on. This is too extreme.

1539
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,370
- I think I know what you'll choose.
- She uses an entire box?

1540
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,250
- Gosh, this is...
- She sucks in her snot like this.

1541
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:08,950
- Like this.
- No.

1542
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,180
Her nose is running,
but she does this.

1543
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:12,810
- Or she does this.
- This?

1544
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,250
(A snot eating show)

1545
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,810
Seriously?

1546
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,910
I don't want a sister-in-law
like that.

1547
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,660
I don't like either one.

1548
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,430
- I'll choose.
- 1, 2, 3.

1549
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,700
- The better one?
- Gosh. It's better to use tissues.

1550
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,930
- Seriously?
- It's B?

1551
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:25,730
(Which lover is better?)

1552
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,520
(A lover who sucks it in because
she doesn't want to waste tissues.)

1553
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,540
- B is better?
- Isn't that cuter?

1554
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,430
If she uses a lot of tissues,
you can recycle them.

1555
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,560
No.

1556
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,370
- How is that cute?
- She might have a cold.

1557
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,100
- There's cold season.
- That's for the rest of her life.

1558
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,850
He's not even dating anyone,

1559
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,350
so why are you all getting
so worked up?

1560
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,910
Was this game supposed to be
so serious?

1561
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:46,250
The next person is the last person.
Haha, you're last.

1562
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,720
I can choose really quickly.

1563
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,060
Haha, this is your first question.

1564
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,660
(If you had to choose one.)

1565
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,180
"If you had to choose one, Jong Kook
will be your business partner,"

1566
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,200
- "but it won't go well."
- This is hard.

1567
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,730
"Don't see Jong Kook forever but
have a successful business."

1568
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,750
Gosh.

1569
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,830
Haha has big dreams when it comes to
running a business.

1570
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,270
Right. He's very ambitious.

1571
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,200
- He's ambitious.
- He is.

1572
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,930
So he has to choose between
Jong Kook and business.

1573
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,060
- Right.
- Right.

1574
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,140
- This is...
- It's easy.

1575
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,500
- Is it Jong Kook or business?
- It's not hard.

1576
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,040
- You lose Jong Kook.
- You won't see him again.

1577
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,230
- You'll lose him as a friend.
- Will he choose money or me?

1578
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:13,450
Will he choose money or me?

1579
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,750
- He said it's money or him.
- Will he choose money or me?

1580
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,350
He has a lot of people connected
to his business.

1581
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,140
- Right.
- A lot of people are involved.

1582
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,350
I'm connected to that too.

1583
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,060
You said
you'll make your decisions quickly.

1584
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,480
How can you do this
in your first question?

1585
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,020
This is just the beginning.

1586
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,230
- How big is the business?
- I'll give you two candy bars.

1587
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,930
Pass.

1588
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,040
- This is...
- Darn it.

1589
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:39,060
- Hold on.
- Think about it realistically.

1590
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,040
- Hold on.
- 1, 2, 3.

1591
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,270
(Choose one.)

1592
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,580
(Regardless of how business goes,
will he partner with Jong Kook?)

1593
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,350
(Or will he consider his family and
coworkers and choose business?)

1594
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,790
- 3.
- 3. Isn't it B?

1595
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,020
- 3. B.
- 3. Isn't it B?

1596
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,250
- I choose A.
- Why?

1597
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,810
- Everyone chose B.
- Why?

1598
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,680
He's trying to have
an easy day today.

1599
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,290
- Why?
- I'm being serious.

1600
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,500
- He wants an easy day.
- I'm being honest.

1601
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,620
- I thought about his family.
- I can make money in other ways.

1602
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,540
I can't imagine
not being friends with him.

1603
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,660
While you were thinking about it,
Jong Kook crushed this.

1604
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,730
You must've been nervous.

1605
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:13,770
(Crushed)

1606
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,430
(While Haha was thinking
about it...)

1607
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,810
(Think about it realistically.)

1608
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,080
(Jong Kook was the only one
who couldn't be realistic about it.)

1609
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,370
- You must've been nervous.
- I was.

1610
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:25,410
It's the next question.

1611
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,850
(If Yang Se Chan and Jeon So Min
get married...)

1612
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,790
"If Yang Se Chan and Jeon So Min
get married..."

1613
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,850
Who will you attend for?

1614
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,660
- For the congratulatory money...
- Who will you attend for?

1615
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,080
and where you will sit.

1616
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,200
- He can't do half and half, right?
- Right.

1617
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,500
- This one is hard.
- I think I know.

1618
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,560
This is for real, right?

1619
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,160
- He must choose one no matter what.
- I'll be sincere.

1620
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,970
Hold on. Give us a moment.

1621
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,290
- This is a hard one.
- How can he choose one?

1622
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:44,330
I think it's easy.

1623
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,910
Who will you choose?

1624
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,370
- This one is easy for me.
- Who will you choose?

1625
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,700
- Suk Jin, who will you choose?
- Pardon?

1626
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,200
- Who will you choose?
- It's not your question anyway.

1627
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,180
- I would choose B.
- But I'm so close with him too.

1628
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,040
I think he'd be understanding.

1629
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,980
I'm touched.
But I am understanding too.

1630
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,140
My gosh.

1631
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,890
- I don't think you will be.
- I would be.

1632
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,020
- Se Chan would be understanding.
- Me too.

1633
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,660
I think I should choose B too.

1634
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,810
She won't be understanding.

1635
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:06,950
- Se Chan would be understanding.
- He would be.

1636
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,730
- I'm understanding too.
- She wouldn't.

1637
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,120
- She will write down their names,
- She'd get revenge.

1638
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,700
and be like,
"So you didn't come, right?

1639
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,100
- Se Chan would be understanding.
- He'd be understanding.

1640
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,100
Right.

1641
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,330
Okay, then. 1, 2, 3.

1642
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:19,700
- B.
- It's B.

1643
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:21,600
- This is the correct answer.
- Right.

1644
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,480
Se Chan would be grateful...

1645
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,040
- that I considered his wife.
- I would be.

1646
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,680
He'd be very grateful.

1647
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,270
- She's...
- It's not because you're stingy.

1648
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,540
- I would sit on So Min's side...
- But I...

1649
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,390
What's scary to me is...

1650
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,750
So Min put up A.

1651
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,060
(Getting chills)

1652
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,890
Gosh, my image is a mess, isn't it?

1653
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,180
No, that's not what we mean.

1654
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,520
So Min doesn't have a lot of friends
in the entertainment industry.

1655
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,600
Right. I really don't.

1656
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,560
- Right.
- If I had to choose one,

1657
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,100
- I must give So Min more support.
- You need to support her.

1658
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,600
- I need to support her.
- Right.

1659
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,540
- I need to...
- How nice of you.

1660
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,910
What about Ji Hyo?
Where would you go?

1661
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,750
- Right. Where would you go?
- I'd go for So Min.

1662
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,180
Right. Ji Hyo would do that.

1663
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,950
If this situation applied
to you guys,

1664
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,520
would anyone choose Se Chan?

1665
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,180
I think I would choose Se Chan.

1666
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,290
Jong Kook.

1667
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,660
- It's because of this.
- No.

1668
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,290
(This is why everyone chose B.)

1669
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,450
The groom's side...

1670
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,000
Why don't you guys start by dating?

1671
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,470
We'll sit in the middle.

1672
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:21,470
The first mission is over.

1673
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:22,600
I got a lot wrong.

1674
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,230
I got all of Haha's wrong.
I had a good run before then.

1675
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,560
- You don't know Haha well.
- Right.

1676
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,830
- What is this?
- Aren't we doing a race today?

1677
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:30,870
(It's time to do the final race
in the clear weather.)

1678
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,350
- What is this?
- Why are we in the woods?

1679
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,680
Hold on. Isn't this the
Reserve Forces Training Center?

1680
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,980
1, 2.

1681
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,480
- What is this?
- This place is for survival games.

1682
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,520
You're right, it is.

1683
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,680
I think we came here once
on Running Man.

1684
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,120
- What? It's like a training center.
- It's like guerrilla training.

1685
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,620
- Director.
- Yes?

1686
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,000
Someone stole all of my candy bars.

1687
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,200
That's life.

1688
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,620
But they won't tell me who did it.

1689
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,270
You must take care of your things.

1690
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,000
It's either Se Chan, Haha,
or Kwang Soo.

1691
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,470
- I told you. It isn't me.
- It's not me either.

1692
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,910
It's not me. I never touched yours.

1693
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,760
(Actually, between the three
of them, the real criminal is...)

1694
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,280
(30 minutes earlier, during lunch,
Haha filmed this video.)

1695
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,300
(He takes the candy bar
out of So Min's bag.)

1696
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,010
(He's blinded by the desire to win,
so he filmed himself...)

1697
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,780
(adding to his candy bars.)

1698
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,820
(She found out later and was angry.)

1699
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,760
Give it back.

1700
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,420
Stop playing around
and give it back to me.

1701
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,690
Next.

1702
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,920
(Then he casually begins to film
someone who looks suspicious.)

1703
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,190
I swar. It's not me.

1704
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,000
- Did you film it?
- Yes, I did.

1705
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,300
(He doesn't know what's going on
and gets framed.)

1706
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,360
It's him.

1707
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,340
(I never touched yours.)

1708
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,210
- Don't cry and stand in your spot.
- Gosh.

1709
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:51,780
It's time for the final race.

1710
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:54,300
Before we start the race,
I'll give you a chance...

1711
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,340
to get yut candy bar,
which you need for the game,

1712
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,440
and bullets, which you will use
in the game.

1713
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,440
- Bullets?
- Bullets?

1714
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,340
- We need to shoot something.
- It's a survival game.

1715
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:04,480
There are chance cards
hidden around this place.

1716
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,190
The cards state how many
yut candy bars and bullets...

1717
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:08,760
- you got.
- Okay.

1718
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,030
There are minus cards as well.
What's important here is that...

1719
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,550
if you touch it, you must take it.

1720
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,260
You can give it to someone else
without their knowledge.

1721
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,260
- The minus cards?
- Yes.

1722
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,500
- Without their knowledge?
- Whether it's their clothes or bag,

1723
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,030
you have to give it to them
without their realization.

1724
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,440
- You can't hold onto it.
- If you find it,

1725
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,460
you can't throw it away.

1726
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,070
You have to pass it on
to another person or hold onto it.

1727
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:26,840
- Okay.
- You can find it easily.

1728
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,170
(He suddenly laughs.)

1729
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,320
Why do you keep laughing?

1730
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,780
What? It's not that.

1731
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,150
I can't stop thinking about
the people who just tuned in.

1732
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,780
I feel like I need to stand next
to someone dressed like this.

1733
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,860
You can see everything.

1734
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,550
(There's a reason
we're dressed like this.)

1735
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,730
Ready, set, go.

1736
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,550
I don't think I can go up high.

1737
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,420
(Get the good chance cards
and give the bad ones to others.)

1738
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,570
Where are they?

1739
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:50,570
(Get the good chance cards
and give the bad ones to others.)

1740
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,900
I feel like it's somewhere here.

1741
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,070
There's one here.

1742
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,480
This is amazing.

1743
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,070
"Plus one yut candy bar".

1744
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:01,380
(He gets a candy bar.)

1745
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,300
There's one here. I found one.

1746
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,820
- Can we go up this way?
- Okay.

1747
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:08,320
"Minus three bullets".

1748
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,440
(Why did she have to
pick this chance card?)

1749
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,190
Where did they hide it?

1750
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,820
(She needs to give this minus
chance card to another person.)

1751
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,320
Jeon So Min.

1752
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,230
So Min, what happened?

1753
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:18,400
Jae Suk.

1754
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,230
- I can't see it.
- It's upsetting.

1755
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,530
- Jae Suk.
- What, So Min?

1756
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,400
- Gosh, there it is.
- Where is it?

1757
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
(Gosh, there it is.)

1758
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,710
(Interested)

1759
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,170
(I see.)

1760
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,340
(He figured out her trick.)

1761
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,610
- Jae Suk.
- You have been waiting for me.

1762
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,940
Forget it.

1763
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,010
Why can't I find a single one?

1764
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,420
There it is. I found one.

1765
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:43,590
This is...

1766
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,320
(Minus 3 bullets?)

1767
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,880
I can give it to someone else.

1768
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:52,030
There it is.

1769
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,030
(There it is.)

1770
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,530
(He hasn't learned much
during his 10 years on Running Man.)

1771
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,860
He is a fool. Suk Jin is a fool.

1772
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,500
It's a bad one, right?

1773
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,760
We can't throw it away, right?

1774
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,610
- You can't throw it away.
- You can't throw it away.

1775
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:03,710
(At that moment)

1776
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:05,880
(Mesh Boy with a chance card
appears.)

1777
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,900
What? Hey, don't do that.

1778
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:11,210
Hey.

1779
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,210
(He tries to subdue Suk Jin.)

1780
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:16,710
You can't do that. Hey!

1781
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,920
You can't shove it in like that.
Hey!

1782
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,150
(Mesh Boy leaves
after giving him a big gift.)

1783
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:26,030
- There is one here.
- Where?

1784
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:29,630
(His satisfied facial expression
makes the hyenas gather.)

1785
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,260
- I can't show you.
- Let's see it.

1786
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,530
I can't show you.

1787
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:33,530
(He steals the chance card.)

1788
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:42,510
(Laughing)

1789
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,980
Come here.

1790
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,110
(Men with the average age of 52
play tag.)

1791
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,880
(He is happy to run around
with Jae Suk.)

1792
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,650
My goodness.

1793
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,780
(Tag ends on a happy note.)

1794
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,880
It looks like they are playing
a game on their own.

1795
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,320
There are no chance cards.
Did you find one?

1796
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,230
(Every viewer knows
what this look in his eyes means.)

1797
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,800
(He must have a minus chance card.)

1798
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,030
Let's catch him.
Let's put one together.

1799
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:06,590
Hey, what are you doing?

1800
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,070
Hey.

1801
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,630
This is a chance to lose
your minus chance cards!

1802
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,610
Give it to him!

1803
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:16,340
(See-through Boy
gives one to Kwang Soo.)

1804
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,710
What is up with him?
What is up with him?

1805
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:20,610
- A chance card dropped.
- Can I put two on him?

1806
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:25,150
Run from Suk Jin.
Run from Suk Jin.

1807
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,820
(Suk Jin's one and only rival)

1808
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:30,150
Suk Jin, don't be like that.
Don't be like that.

1809
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:33,400
Don't be like that. I am serious.

1810
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,500
- Please.
- Get him.

1811
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,590
Please. Please.

1812
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:39,800
(He bursts out in laughter
for the 3rd time.)

1813
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,440
(In a critical situation,)

1814
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,730
(he bursts out in laughter again.)

1815
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,400
My goodness.

1816
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,340
(The great men laugh
in times of struggle.)

1817
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:50,670
- It dropped.
- It dropped.

1818
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,780
- Time's up.
- Kwang Soo, you dropped this.

1819
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,210
- Time's up.
- Why would you give that to me?

1820
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:56,940
Why would you give that to me?
You dropped it.

1821
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,320
Starting from Jae Suk,
show us the chance cards you have.

1822
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,090
- I got 3.
- 3 of what?

1823
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,650
Three bullets. Keep it.

1824
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,030
Next, So Min.

1825
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:07,900
Steal five yut candy bars
from the member of your choice.

1826
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,630
- Kwang Soo.
- Why me?

1827
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:10,960
You stole my candy bars.

1828
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,400
I really didn't.

1829
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,030
- Five candy bars.
- Do I give them to her now?

1830
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,860
(So Min gets 5 yut candy bars
from Kwang Soo.)

1831
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,610
Minus three yut candy bars.

1832
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:19,630
How about the card for the bullets?

1833
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:20,800
Minus 12 in total.

1834
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,980
(Minus 3 yut candy bars
and minus 9 bullets)

1835
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,300
- He failed to give one to me.
- Really?

1836
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,710
It's over for him.

1837
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,670
- Minus nine bullets.
- The card for the bullets.

1838
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:27,880
- It's over for him.
- I know.

1839
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,940
(The result
of the preliminary mission)

1840
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,050
(Ji Hyo, Jae Suk, Se Chan,
Kwang Soo,)

1841
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,150
(So Min, Haha, Jong Kook, Suk Jin)

1842
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:34,820
You can only attack the color
of your choosing...

1843
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,650
in the Selective Survival Game.

1844
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:40,670
Choose a color
from red, blue, yellow, and black...

1845
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,170
and wear a hat
in the beginning of the race.

1846
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:43,820
Then spin the roulette...

1847
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,460
to choose the target color.

1848
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,730
(Spin the roulette
to choose the target color.)

1849
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,130
You can only attack
the color you got on the roulette.

1850
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:52,710
You are out
if all 10 of your balloons pop.

1851
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,900
The colors will get taken out 1 by 1
after 20 minutes.

1852
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,210
10 balloons?

1853
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:59,250
We will give you the candy bars
in accordance with the rankings...

1854
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,650
and decide
who gets a prize or a penalty.

1855
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:03,150
- It sounds hard.
- So there are targets.

1856
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:04,710
There are targets.

1857
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,760
There is another thing.
If you want to change...

1858
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,480
your color or the target color,

1859
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,500
pay with a candy bar
at the voting booths...

1860
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,900
and receive a chance to change it.

1861
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,820
You only get 10 bullets
in the beginning,

1862
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,760
but you can purchase more
with a candy bar.

1863
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,440
- How many for a candy bar?
- Three bullets for a candy bar.

1864
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,800
- Three bullets for a candy bar.
- Yes.

1865
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,300
You can also pick up
other members' bullets.

1866
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,880
I have minus candy bars.

1867
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,980
- We get 10 bullets.
- 10 bullets.

1868
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,050
It's best to save up on the bullets.

1869
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,400
We need to save up on the bullets.

1870
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,820
This is complicated.
I am conflicted.

1871
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,610
- Please go to your respective spot.
- Okay.

1872
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:39,110
(Current Number of Candy Bars)

1873
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,630
(Jong Kook, Haha, Se Chan, Jae Suk,
Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, Suk Jin, So Min)

1874
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:43,380
How many bullets
do you currently have?

1875
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,130
Minus nine bullets.

1876
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,960
Then you will start with one bullet.

1877
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,630
That's so annoying.

1878
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,800
You can simply take them out.

1879
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:56,130
(9 bullets get removed.)

1880
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,380
Why... You can simply take them out.

1881
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,280
Here you go.

1882
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,880
Hold on.
Can I buy the bullets right away?

1883
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,340
- The game needs to start first.
- Then I can buy the bullets.

1884
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:10,280
You will first select
the color of your hat.

1885
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,320
From red, blue, yellow, and black,
select a color.

1886
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,590
(Select the color of your hat.)

1887
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,280
- Red, blue, yellow, and black?
- Yes.

1888
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,030
I choose black. I bet a lot of them
will choose black.

1889
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:23,920
(The members who get black
as the target color can attack him.)

1890
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,940
All right.

1891
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,500
I bet people won't choose
this color.

1892
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,030
(Haha and Jae Suk
wear a black hat as well.)

1893
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,230
I will select blue.

1894
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,250
This wig is so funny.

1895
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,670
(She wears a blue hat over the wig.)

1896
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,380
It's the color of passion.

1897
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,480
Red.

1898
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,840
I see why I selected red.

1899
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:45,590
I had my eyes on the red hat
for some reason.

1900
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,480
Okay.

1901
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:49,590
Kwang Soo.

1902
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,760
- We are on the same boat.
- That's right.

1903
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,630
Now, please spin the roulette
and choose your target color.

1904
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,730
Okay, I got it.

1905
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:58,760
(The target color is decided
by spinning the roulette.)

1906
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:02,230
(Jong Kook's target color is...)

1907
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:03,230
(black!)

1908
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,980
- It's black.
- Okay.

1909
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,750
Gosh, I should have gotten red.

1910
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,510
(Thankfully, Kwang Soo
won't be attacked by Jong Kook.)

1911
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:14,750
It's red.

1912
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,010
(Kwang Soo's target color is red.)

1913
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,210
(Jong Kook?)

1914
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:23,380
(Will Kwang Soo be able
to attack Jong Kook?)

1915
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,420
(Everyone spins a roulette
and gets a target color.)

1916
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,500
The race starts.

1917
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,840
Here comes a gunman!

1918
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,110
My target color is black.

1919
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,030
I need to find a black hat.

1920
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:40,170
If I am at the bottom,
I will use up my candy bars...

1921
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,510
and go out with a bang.

1922
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,110
(Suk Jin carefully enters
the battlefield.)

1923
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:49,710
Where are they?

1924
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:50,960
(Let's see.)

1925
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,650
Suk Jin is wearing a black hat.

1926
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:53,650
(He is my target.)

1927
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,420
My first target is Suk Jin.

1928
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,900
(My first target is Suk Jin.)

1929
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,230
Suk Jin.

1930
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,260
(They keep their target color
a secret.)

1931
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,840
(While looking for a red hat,
Jae Suk finds Jong Kook.)

1932
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,400
Jong Kook,
is your target color black?

1933
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,480
What?

1934
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,900
You kept looking this way.

1935
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,940
I looked since your target color
could be red.

1936
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:19,710
No. I am not attacking you.

1937
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:20,710
(Kwang Soo
hurriedly purchases bullets.)

1938
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,920
Then why...

1939
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,940
(They are each other's target.)

1940
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,260
I want to pass through.

1941
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,380
Where are you going?

1942
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:27,530
What? Can't I pass through?

1943
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,630
Where are you going?

1944
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:31,500
Even if I am wearing a black hat,
you shouldn't shoot me now.

1945
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,050
Excuse me?

1946
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,130
Is there such a rule?

1947
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:35,260
Are you going to shoot?

1948
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,530
Since when did we have such a rule?

1949
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:39,500
- Are you going to shoot?
- A black hat...

1950
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,940
You aren't going to shoot, are you?

1951
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,860
- What?
- I mean...

1952
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,900
I guess red isn't your target color.

1953
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:47,230
You shot at me!

1954
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:48,250
(Jae Suk attempts to attack.)

1955
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,710
(He can't help but go backward
since Jong Kook's guards are up.)

1956
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,920
Hey.

1957
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:56,780
Hey.

1958
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,780
(Kwang Soo finished loading up
the bullets!)

1959
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,380
Why does it keep coming off?

1960
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,150
This... Hey.

1961
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:07,030
(He approaches quickly...)

1962
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:09,800
(and shoots Jong Kook
without hesitation.)

1963
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,670
(He takes out 3 of his balloons.)

1964
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:16,070
(This is good.)

1965
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,530
(Jae Suk uses this chance
to run away.)

1966
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,440
(That's too bad.)

1967
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,800
- Haha.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

1968
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,670
Haha's color is black too.

1969
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:29,880
I will take out Haha.
I will take out Haha.

1970
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,050
(I will take out Haha.)

1971
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:32,780
(Haha appeared
as an easy target...)

1972
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:34,230
My goodness.

1973
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,230
(just when Jong Kook was motivated.)

1974
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:37,130
(Screaming)

1975
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,590
(He chases after him mercilessly.)

1976
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,920
- Come on!
- Suk Jin's hat is black too.

1977
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,670
(He hits 2 targets with 1 bullet.)

1978
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,630
(Haha and Suk Jin quickly lose
their balloons because of him.)

1979
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:48,630
Okay.

1980
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,960
I should change my hat.

1981
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,030
- I would like to change my hat.
- Turn in one candy bar.

1982
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:55,150
I will change it...

1983
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:56,610
to yellow.

1984
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:57,920
(He changes to a yellow hat.)

1985
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:00,420
- I will change the color of my hat.
- Okay, to which color?

1986
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,150
- A yellow hat, please.
- I will change my hat.

1987
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,210
I will change my hat.

1988
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:04,280
Yellow.

1989
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,480
(Yellow.)

1990
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,320
(The symbol of the weakest members,
yellow hat)

1991
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,630
No one is wearing a yellow hat.

1992
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:14,300
- Let's be allies.
- Why are there so many yellow hats?

1993
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,420
What?

1994
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,530
(Why are there so many yellow hats?)

1995
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:18,300
Why are there so many yellow hats?

1996
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,670
There are so many yellow hats.

1997
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:22,800
Then yellow will be
the target color.

1998
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,130
(The lack of communication
made them all wear a yellow hat.)

1999
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,610
All of them changed to a yellow hat.

2000
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:29,300
Shall I change my target color?
How much is it?

2001
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,750
I will change my target color.
I will take my chances.

2002
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:32,780
(Jong Kook wants to change
the target color to yellow.)

2003
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:36,420
I will take my chances.
1, 2... Please let it be yellow.

2004
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,210
Yellow, yellow, yellow. Yellow.

2005
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,380
Gosh.

2006
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,320
(He gets red instead.)

2007
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:46,730
- Did I get red?
- Your target color is red.

2008
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:47,960
I can spin it again, right?

2009
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,030
(I can spin it again, right?)

2010
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,440
I will spin it again.

2011
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
All right.

2012
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,510
Hold on. Blue?
I don't see any blue hats.

2013
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:00,510
I will spin it once more.

2014
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,750
I see how people lose their fortune
by gambling.

2015
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:08,480
This will be the last time.

2016
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,320
(He keeps getting different colors.)

2017
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,920
It won't be entertaining
unless I get the color.

2018
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:15,420
It's black again.
This is driving me crazy.

2019
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,530
I will spin it again.

2020
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:19,090
(He lost 7 candy bars
to the roulette.)

2021
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,670
I got yellow this time, right?

2022
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,340
Okay. How many candy bars
did I use?

2023
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,710
8 candy bars? 7 candy bars?

2024
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:30,260
- Seven candy bars.
- For goodness' sake.

2025
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,900
(He used 7 candy bars for a right
to attack the yellow hats.)

2026
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:36,900
I should change to a blue hat.

2027
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,440
Is he coming toward me?

2028
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,980
Haha.

2029
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:42,820
I should take out Haha.

2030
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,360
(He charges toward Haha.)

2031
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:48,880
He is coming this way!
I need to change my color!

2032
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,960
Stop, Jong Kook.
Let me go this once.

2033
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,320
Let me go this once.
I will give you bullets.

2034
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,800
- I will give you a candy bar.
- How many will you give me?

2035
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,900
- Give me candy bars.
- Two candy bars.

2036
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:55,960
- I need at least 3.
- I can't give you 3.

2037
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,400
- I used 7.
- Jong Kook.

2038
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:58,960
- I used 7.
- Let's go with 2.

2039
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:01,170
- Jong Kook, I...
- Otherwise, I will take you out.

2040
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:02,230
Hold on.

2041
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:03,530
- 2.
- Give me 3.

2042
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:05,440
Give me 3.
I will leave if you give me 3.

2043
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,900
- Jong Kook.
- Hurry up.

2044
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,110
- Jong Kook.
- Give me three.

2045
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:09,840
- I used seven.
- We run a restaurant together.

2046
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,150
- Give me 3.
- 2 bullets and 1 candy bar.

2047
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,320
Give me three.

2048
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,690
You will find more yellow hats
down there.

2049
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,010
- I know.
- Please, Jong Kook.

2050
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:17,420
- Please, Jong Kook.
- Should I finish you off?

2051
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:19,610
All right, all right.

2052
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,190
(He loses 1 balloon by stalling.)

2053
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,820
All right, all right.
Two candy bars.

2054
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:23,960
One.

2055
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,530
- Give me 2. Hurry up and give me 2.
- What?

2056
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:26,800
- Give me 2.
- 2?

2057
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,090
- Hurry up.
- Will you give them back?

2058
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,190
Give them to me.

2059
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,130
- You seem like a bully.
- Give them to me.

2060
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,070
- Then...
- I could take you out.

2061
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:35,170
- All right, all right.
- Hurry up and give them to me.

2062
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:37,110
- Go now.
- All right. You can go ahead.

2063
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:38,730
I will be smiling.

2064
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:40,030
(I will be smiling.)

2065
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:42,210
It's the first time
I got candy bars stolen.

2066
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,940
- I got two candy bars.
- This is so annoying.

2067
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:47,280
Hey, I used seven candy bars.

2068
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,380
I swear.

2069
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:49,880
It was so hard to get yellow.

2070
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,610
(He moves quickly to find
the next target.)

2071
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:54,550
I didn't know you could attack
the same color.

2072
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:56,630
(Ji Hyo lost 7 balloons
to Se Chan's attack.)

2073
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:57,900
Ji Hyo.

2074
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:00,900
I only have a few candy bars.

2075
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,900
(It's so sad.)

2076
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,130
(At that moment)

2077
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,940
(Kwang Soo ambushes her.)

2078
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:10,210
(He takes out
the rest of the balloons.)

2079
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:14,900
(He takes Ji Hyo out instantly
and runs away.)

2080
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,300
Who was it? Who was it?

2081
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,250
Jong Kook?

2082
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,050
Gosh.

2083
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:24,460
(Ji Hyo is out
8 minutes into the race.)

2084
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,190
I will spin the roulette.

2085
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:31,190
Please.

2086
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,460
(Kwang Soo's target color is...)

2087
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:33,520
- Red.
- Red.

2088
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,560
(Popping)

2089
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,520
- Red.
- Red.

2090
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:39,730
(Why did his balloon pop?)

2091
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,840
(His balloon got caught
on the tape.)

2092
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,970
Why did it pop? Why?

2093
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,750
(He becomes confused
after attacking himself.)

2094
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,770
(While Kwang Soo is in a daze
from losing a balloon,)

2095
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,110
Stop it.

2096
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:54,140
(the two youngest members
are having a love quarrel.)

2097
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,350
(As a result,
So Min has 1 balloon left.)

2098
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:57,640
I have one balloon left.

2099
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,520
I have one balloon left.

2100
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,680
(She accepts her fate.)

2101
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,590
So Min is out.

2102
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,000
(So Min is out.)

2103
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,220
(Devastated)

2104
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:07,320
So Min is out.

2105
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:10,720
Look at So Min who is knocked out.

2106
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,530
(Shooting)

2107
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:16,340
(I am so annoyed.)

2108
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:18,470
What should I do? I am so angry.

2109
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:19,840
You lasted for a while.

2110
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,470
(She is too upset to leave.)

2111
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:24,250
(Kwang Soo approaches her.)

2112
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,380
(He collects her bullets.)

2113
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,420
- Stop it.
- You don't need them.

2114
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:33,150
(Haha was picking up bullets
like Kwang Soo.)

2115
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:34,150
Hey.

2116
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:35,280
Give them to me.

2117
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,960
Give them to me. They are mine!

2118
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,820
How are they yours?

2119
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:42,820
What is going on?
Everyone is stealing things from me.

2120
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,360
I am sorry. I am sorry.

2121
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,170
(20 minutes have passed.)

2122
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:49,030
Now, black will disappear.

2123
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:51,210
Black will disappear
among the hats and target colors.

2124
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:53,140
(Black disappears
among the hats and target colors.)

2125
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,810
(The members whose hat color
or target color is black...)

2126
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:57,810
(select a different color.)

2127
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,940
I will change my hat color too.

2128
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:03,480
Was your hat color blue?

2129
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,920
(Jae Suk, Suk Jin, and Se Chan
unite with a red hat.)

2130
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,980
Let's go.

2131
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,350
What's your target color?

2132
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:08,430
- What's your target color?
- Yellow.

2133
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,650
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

2134
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:10,930
- Is it yellow?
- Yes, I changed it.

2135
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,100
We should take out Jong Kook first.

2136
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,000
- But Jong Kook...
- We shouldn't fight.

2137
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,500
- Jong Kook is on his first vest.
- Really?

2138
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:17,860
- You are on your first vest, right?
- Yes.

2139
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,060
(Suk Jin's target color
is actually red.)

2140
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,270
I tried to pick it up earlier,
but...

2141
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:22,360
Gosh, you startled me.

2142
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:24,770
All right.
Change into your second vest.

2143
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:26,570
Gosh, you startled me.

2144
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:29,180
All right.
Change into your second vest.

2145
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,750
Is his target color red?

2146
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,070
Change into your second vest.

2147
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,270
Give me a vest.

2148
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,350
(He talked about
taking out Jong Kook together.)

2149
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:36,390
How...

2150
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:38,350
- Change into your second vest.
- That was too low.

2151
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,920
Jae Suk, I won't shoot you.

2152
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,720
- Se Chan.
- My target color is yellow.

2153
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,890
- I can't shoot you anyway.
- It's yellow, right?

2154
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,720
It isn't red, right?

2155
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,850
It isn't red.
My target color is yellow.

2156
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:46,850
(Happy)

2157
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,670
- Okay.
- What?

2158
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:52,600
- Okay.
- What?

2159
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:55,210
(Startled)

2160
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,400
- Suk Jin.
- Be careful not to show your back.

2161
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,930
Suk Jin is out.

2162
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:00,930
For goodness' sake.

2163
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,310
Suk Jin is out.

2164
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:03,470
Is your target color red?

2165
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,680
(After taking out Suk Jin)

2166
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,850
I will change my hat color
to yellow.

2167
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,480
I put in one candy bar.

2168
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,460
(One man watches Se Chan
as he takes his chances.)

2169
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:13,610
Suk Jin is out.

2170
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,630
What?

2171
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:17,650
(This man in a sleeveless top
dreams of turning the tables.)

2172
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:22,020
(Haha's location)

2173
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,800
Hold on. I will take Jae Suk out.

2174
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,890
(5 people remain.)

2175
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:28,970
All right.

2176
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:33,030
(Jae Suk catches a breath.)

2177
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:36,010
(One man aims his gun at him.)

2178
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:38,440
(Haha's camera)

2179
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:41,220
(The sniper in a sleeveless top)

2180
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,050
(He shoots.)

2181
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,110
We need to join forces.

2182
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,090
- What?
- Is someone there?

2183
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:49,390
Haha is there. Haha is there.

2184
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:51,060
- Haha's hat is yellow.
- Haha's hat is yellow.

2185
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:52,600
Shall we go and take him out?

2186
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,350
- I will enter.
- Okay.

2187
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:56,820
(I totally scared them.)

2188
01:11:57,770 --> 01:11:59,500
(Meanwhile)

2189
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,360
So Haha is still alive.

2190
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,400
We need to figure out the color
of Haha and Kwang Soo's hats.

2191
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:07,510
If their target color is yellow...
I mean, blue... No.

2192
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:10,470
Would you go and look at the drone?

2193
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,680
Go and look at the drone?

2194
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:13,520
- I mean...
- Drone.

2195
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,640
I mean,

2196
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,310
find the person
who is flying the drone...

2197
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:18,680
and figure out
the color of their hats.

2198
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,650
- I see. Where is the operator?
- It's a good idea, right?

2199
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:24,150
Hold on. It's coming this way.

2200
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,100
Operator.

2201
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,670
Where are you?

2202
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:31,530
Where are you flying the drone?

2203
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:34,770
He is here. The operator is here.

2204
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:36,360
Sir.

2205
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,880
Please go to the battlefield...

2206
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,680
and see their hat colors.

2207
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:44,880
This way.

2208
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,750
(A drone gets dispatched
for the children's shooting game.)

2209
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,180
It's like a war movie.

2210
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:52,020
I just need to see their heads.

2211
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,180
(Se Chan is the commander
who leads the drone.)

2212
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,390
Go up higher.

2213
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,150
There we go.

2214
01:12:58,150 --> 01:12:59,500
Please go closer.

2215
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:02,600
I see one yellow hat.
If we go diagonally...

2216
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:04,970
One blue hat.
How about the other one?

2217
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,560
Kwang Soo still has a blue hat.

2218
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:09,770
This is really good.

2219
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:11,810
This must be how
they use a drone for a war.

2220
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:13,340
(He observes everything
with a drone.)

2221
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,810
Red will disappear.

2222
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:16,970
- Will red disappear?
- Yes.

2223
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:19,470
Red disappeared, right?

2224
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,610
Blue still exists.

2225
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,920
(They need to pick
between yellow and blue.)

2226
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,610
(Now, blue and yellow
are the only colors remaining.)

2227
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:29,680
(It's time to make a decisive move.)

2228
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:31,520
(The ones who usually hit and run
have a face-off.)

2229
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,650
- Okay.
- Haha.

2230
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:34,130
It would be our loss
if we go against each other.

2231
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:35,360
That's right.
Let's not shoot at each other.

2232
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,360
(They pretend to have a ceasefire.)

2233
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,600
Give me one bullet.

2234
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:40,770
- Gosh!
- Okay!

2235
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:44,600
(Jong Kook appears.)

2236
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,810
(Jong Kook figured out the situation
through drone.)

2237
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,680
(Haha is out.)

2238
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,850
Haha is out.

2239
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:53,920
Okay. Kwang Soo remains.

2240
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:56,520
(His next target is Kwang Soo.)

2241
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,350
(He tries to corner him.)

2242
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:01,630
What? I have no one to shoot.

2243
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,350
- I have no one to shoot.
- Why?

2244
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:04,520
No one else has a blue hat.

2245
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:06,190
Your target color is blue.

2246
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,130
- What's your target color?
- Blue.

2247
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:09,270
Are you sure?

2248
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,670
Se Chan, take the right.

2249
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:14,230
(The Drone Squad works together
one more time.)

2250
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,670
- Okay. Go.
- Go.

2251
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:18,100
- Jong Kook.
- Move out of the way.

2252
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,230
- Move out of the way.
- Let's go together.

2253
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,050
(He approaches Kwang Soo
and shoots mercilessly.)

2254
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,140
(But Jong Kook's balloons pop.)

2255
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,270
Hey, you punk.

2256
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:28,420
(Popping)

2257
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,520
Hey, you punk.

2258
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,850
(Se Chan pretended to go
after Kwang Soo.)

2259
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:34,110
(His real target was Jong Kook.)

2260
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:35,980
(He easily takes out two balloons.)

2261
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,690
(When he spun the roulette
for the target color earlier,)

2262
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:40,630
(he got yellow.)

2263
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:41,690
Yellow?

2264
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:44,560
- What's your target color?
- Blue.

2265
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,560
Are you sure?

2266
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,930
(He fooled Jong Kook...)

2267
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,140
(and shot at his back.)

2268
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:49,770
I popped
two of Jong Kook's balloons.

2269
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:50,930
Run!

2270
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:51,930
(Jong Kook's first vest is over.)

2271
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,180
- Se Chan, okay.
- Kwang Soo.

2272
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:57,400
Okay, Se Chan.

2273
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:00,050
- Kwang Soo, run.
- Okay, I got it.

2274
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,720
I can't believe him.

2275
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,780
I can't trust Se Chan anymore.

2276
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,720
My love for Se Chan is over.

2277
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,590
(Jong Kook becomes furious.)

2278
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,680
(Without a care for his balloons,)

2279
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,800
(he succeeds to take out Se Chan.)

2280
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,130
Am I out?

2281
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,690
Take him out.

2282
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:17,890
(He takes out Kwang Soo mercilessly
when he falls down.)

2283
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:18,970
Take him out.

2284
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:20,100
Se Chan is out.

2285
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,270
(Two people remain.)

2286
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:22,470
Now...

2287
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,710
Look at Jae Suk.

2288
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,840
- Double guns.
- Double guns.

2289
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,070
He has double guns.

2290
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,140
(Double muscles versus Double guns)

2291
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,570
Let's shoot from a long distance.

2292
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:31,720
- Shall we do that? Okay.
- Okay.

2293
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,220
- I will load up on the bullets.
- Okay.

2294
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,750
(There is a reason why Jae Suk
suggested a long-distance match.)

2295
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:38,520
(Long-distance shooting
is Jae Suk's forte.)

2296
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,820
(He takes out a balloon
with his double guns.)

2297
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:43,850
Jae Suk's hit rate is no joke.

2298
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,350
(He's flustered.)

2299
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,860
(Jae Suk sometimes becomes cool
when he has guns in his hands.)

2300
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:52,300
Gosh, Jae Suk. Hold on.

2301
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:55,170
(Jong Kook gains energy
when he wears a sleeveless top.)

2302
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,310
(They are neck-and-neck.)

2303
01:15:58,310 --> 01:16:00,010
Why are you using double guns?

2304
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,250
(Jae Suk with 3 balloons...)

2305
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,600
(versus Jong Kook wth 1 balloon)

2306
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:07,180
(At that moment,)

2307
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,810
(Jae Suk's balloon pops.)

2308
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:12,420
(Now, it's
2 balloons versus 1 balloon.)

2309
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,520
Okay.

2310
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:16,720
(He used one of his balloons
as bait...)

2311
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,890
(and targeted Jong Kook's
last balloon.)

2312
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,100
(Yoo Jae Suk wins.)

2313
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,220
Yoo Jae Suk wins, and
Kim Jong Kook is in second place.

2314
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,600
(Jae seok, who won, and Jong Kook,
who fought from a long distance,)

2315
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,140
(both put up a strong fight.)

2316
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,270
- This was good.
- It was at a long distance.

2317
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,470
(It was a fair fight which is
hard to see on Running Man.)

2318
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:33,430
- It wasn't a cheap fight.
- Right. It was good.

2319
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,750
The zebra pants I'm wearing today...

2320
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:38,470
(The zebra pants were perfect
for the mission.)

2321
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:41,380
I was like a zebra running around
in an open field.

2322
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,480
I know.

2323
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:46,680
(It was a clean fight
that made them proud of themselves.)

2324
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,890
This is the final result.

2325
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:50,760
Jae Suk came in 1st place,
and Jong Kook came in 2nd.

2326
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:51,850
Really?

2327
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:56,270
1st place gets 20 candy bars.

2328
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,020
(The number of candy bars given)

2329
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,500
2nd place gets 15,
and 3rd place gets 10.

2330
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,060
- The others will get 8, 6, 4, 2, 0.
- We used a lot.

2331
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,310
- I'll announce the results.
- Okay.

2332
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:07,210
- With 32 candy bars...
- Someone got that many?

2333
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:09,900
(Will the winner be among
the 1st and 2nd place winners...)

2334
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,400
(who got 20 and 15 candy bars?)

2335
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,610
- It's Kim Jong Kook.
- Me?

2336
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:15,680
- I came in first place?
- He got a lot.

2337
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,020
- It's Kim Jong Kook.
- Me? I came in first place?

2338
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:18,050
He got a lot.

2339
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,180
- I used a lot.
- You didn't exchange them.

2340
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:23,060
- I exchanged 10.
- With 31, Jae Suk is in 2nd place.

2341
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,150
How disappointing.

2342
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,630
That last one.

2343
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,670
In 3rd place... The person
in 3rd place can choose 1.

2344
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:31,730
Is it me?

2345
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,860
It's Haha, who has 26.

2346
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:34,930
What?

2347
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,510
- Really? He has that many?
- He has 20 on him.

2348
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:39,230
- He didn't exchange a lot.
- Why does he have so many?

2349
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:41,230
In 4th place is Se Chan with 22.

2350
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:42,310
That's too bad.

2351
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:44,210
In 5th place is Ji Hyo with 11.

2352
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,850
- In 6th place, Suk Jin with 9.
- I have 11?

2353
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:46,880
- Gosh.
- What?

2354
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,250
In 7th place is Kwang Soo with 8.

2355
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,750
In 8th place is So Min with 3.

2356
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,520
- Hold on.
- So...

2357
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:54,890
since So Min came in last place,

2358
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:57,480
Haha loses his spot in 3rd place
and will get the penalty too.

2359
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,300
- So who's in 3rd place?
- Se Chan is in 3rd place.

2360
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,960
(1. If So Min or Haha comes in last
place, they both get the penalty.)

2361
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,430
(2. If they don't, the one with the
lowest score will get the penalty.)

2362
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:04,130
- So I don't get the penalty, right?
- You don't.

2363
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:05,190
Okay!

2364
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:08,030
- See? You can't steal mine.
- It's a difference of one.

2365
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,930
Weren't we competing
against each other?

2366
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:12,310
- You had to take care of her.
- You're right.

2367
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,840
We could've avoided it
if I gave her three.

2368
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,310
First, we'll have...

2369
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:17,440
the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners
roll their balls first.

2370
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,850
The tablet.

2371
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:20,270
Where's the tablet?

2372
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:21,810
I would like to get
the massage gun.

2373
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,110
(Clothing care machine, tablet PC,
turntable, photo of staff, and more)

2374
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:24,940
Is Kwang Soo's life-sized
cardboard cutout still here?

2375
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,480
The photo of the staff
is much better...

2376
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,390
than a life-sized
cardboard cutout of Kwang Soo.

2377
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:31,180
I want to cheer for you guys.

2378
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:33,100
I'll start now. In 1, 2, 3.

2379
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,100
How will it go?

2380
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,360
- Let's go.
- Go to the right.

2381
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,530
(What will Se Chan, who came in
3rd place instead of Haha, get?)

2382
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:42,600
- Go to the right. What is it?
- A dud.

2383
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:45,030
(Dud)

2384
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:46,470
- A dud.
- Serves you right.

2385
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:47,770
(There are only 2 among 20,
but he got it.)

2386
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:49,070
I feel better now.

2387
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:50,850
- It's possible to get a dud.
- I feel better too.

2388
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:51,920
I got a dud?

2389
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,880
A dud came out among
all of these.

2390
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:55,980
Ji Hyo, I'll drop one here.

2391
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,180
What if you go more that way?

2392
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,760
- This way.
- Drop them both at once.

2393
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,280
Should we go for the tablet PC?

2394
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,390
(He let go of the ball.)

2395
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:05,850
- What is it?
- It's going this way.

2396
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:08,000
It's coming this way.

2397
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,390
(What will happen this time?)

2398
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,390
Did it come this way?

2399
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:13,470
It's the tablet PC.

2400
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:15,060
(Did he get the tablet PC?)

2401
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:17,010
- It's the tablet PC.
- What?

2402
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:19,570
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2403
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:22,770
- Gosh!
- Oh, my.

2404
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:24,900
I must be going crazy.

2405
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,770
- This is crazy.
- That's incredible.

2406
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:28,610
- What's with you?
- You're lucky.

2407
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:29,610
How did you get the tablet PC?

2408
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:31,610
Why would you use your luck here?

2409
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:34,110
How can someone unlucky get this?

2410
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,130
This is insane.

2411
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,220
This won't do.

2412
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,960
- Should I go for the tablet PC?
- Of course.

2413
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,560
- Should I go?
- Yes.

2414
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:42,630
- It's heading for it.
- It's the tablet pc.

2415
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:44,100
It's going to end up
at the tablet PC.

2416
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:47,030
(He dropped his ball in the same
place Jae Suk did.)

2417
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:48,230
- It's the tablet PC.
- It won't go there.

2418
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,270
It's going to end up
at the tablet PC.

2419
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:50,270
- It's going.
- Tablet PC.

2420
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:51,340
It's the group photo.

2421
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:53,730
(It's the photo of the crew...)

2422
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:55,770
(which is next to the tablet PC.)

2423
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:58,810
It's meaningful.

2424
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:00,550
Our writers came out so nicely.

2425
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,640
- They came out nicely.
- How does it look? Let me see.

2426
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,750
You should've added your names.

2427
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:07,110
Min Hee is sitting in the front.

2428
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:09,260
We're grateful that
you care so much about us.

2429
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,320
- That's too bad.
- This is...

2430
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,300
- I'm going again.
- It's so funny.

2431
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,260
- It's going in that direction.
- Right.

2432
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:16,600
- Oh, no. Where are you going?
- Goodness.

2433
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:18,170
- No.
- It's going far.

2434
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:20,530
(It's headed toward the right.)

2435
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:22,100
No.

2436
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,510
- Dud or clothing care machine.
- Or Kwang Soo's cardboard cutout.

2437
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:25,640
No.

2438
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:27,840
- Dud or clothing care machine.
- Or Kwang Soo's cardboard cutout.

2439
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,250
(What?)

2440
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:32,750
(The ball is between the photo
and the clothing care machine.)

2441
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,440
(Where will the ball go?)

2442
01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:37,590
- The clothing care machine.
- Really?

2443
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:41,180
(His eyes open wide
just like Jae Suk.)

2444
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:42,590
- Really?
- What is this?

2445
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:44,820
- What will you do?
- Bo Pil is crying.

2446
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,520
SBS will go broke.

2447
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,760
- He's crying.
- Bo Pil is crying.

2448
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,270
- It costs 1,500 dollars.
- Really?

2449
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:51,060
What will Bo Pil do?

2450
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,270
I'll go easy on you
and just get the massage gun.

2451
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:55,060
- The massage gun is nice.
- Really?

2452
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:56,710
I didn't tell you the penalty.

2453
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:58,010
- What is it?
- You're right. Haha and So Min.

2454
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:59,600
The penalty we've prepared
for you is...

2455
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,570
I told you already that the penalty
is inconvenient and exhausting.

2456
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:06,180
You must make mask straps
out of beads for the members.

2457
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,270
(Make mask straps for the members
out of beads.)

2458
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:09,140
- Goodness.
- Out of beads.

2459
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:10,180
(It's the worst penalty of making
gifts they won't want to give.)

2460
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:13,280
It really is an annoying penalty.

2461
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,150
This is going to be hard.

2462
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:17,060
Okay, then. Goodbye.

2463
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:18,650
Goodbye.

2464
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,630
- Good job everyone.
- Good job everyone.

2465
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:22,720
No, you don't have to give it to me.

2466
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:23,770
- Take it with you.
- Right.

2467
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:25,230
- Do you want the massage gun?
- Sure.

2468
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:27,890
- I don't need the machine.
- It's fine.

2469
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:31,810
You just need to put it in
after you design it.

2470
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:34,470
You can design it
with the ones you want.

2471
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:36,880
Who will you guys give it to?

2472
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,900
I'll make it for...

2473
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:39,640
I'll make it for...

2474
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,310
(The process of making it and
the people they will give it to...)

2475
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:43,780
I should make it with the big ones.

2476
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:45,920
This is nice. I like it.

2477
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,020
(will be revealed next week
during the gift giving ceremony.)
