1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,700
To the eighth floor? I see.

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,770
The eighth floor?

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,770
(Suk Jin shows up
in a neat outfit.)

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,060
It's the top floor.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,900
(I look cool today.)

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,640
(He arrives at the opening venue
showing off.)

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,700
The captain...

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,110
- What am I?
- Suk Jin.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,720
- What am I?
- Hang on.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,450
What are you? Are you a spy?

11
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,750
No. The other guys already saw me.

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,790
Am I a pilot?

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,430
- A pilot?
- I look like a pilot.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,130
He looks like a guy in a costume
who works at an amusement park.

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,730
(From the parade of Big Nose Land)

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,350
My gosh.

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,460
- Hello.
- What?

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,770
- What's that?
- What?

19
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,560
- I came with him.
- He's dressed the same.

20
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,560
- What's going on?
- What's with your pants?

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,870
I thought he was an elevator
attendant or something.

22
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,440
I was surprised.

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,700
Are we pilots or what?

24
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,450
- I guess so.
- And what are you?

25
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,810
What about me?

26
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,120
These are just my clothes.

27
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,340
You should get a hair cut.

28
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,590
He's right. You should look neat.

29
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,020
What's with your hair?

30
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,590
What's that? Is it
because of your new movie?

31
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,450
- Yes.
- Are you the only actor there?

32
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,190
(Are you the only actor there?)

33
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,920
Why are you showing it off?

34
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,380
- I'm not showing it off.
- You don't have to show it.

35
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,650
You seem so condescending.

36
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,460
It's not like that. My hair...

37
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,370
- It's not like he's the only actor.
- I know.

38
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,120
Why aren't the other members coming?

39
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,510
And why do you keep your hair long
every time you shoot a movie?

40
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,870
That's because
the director told me to.

41
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,130
Do you let your hair grow long
like that because of the director?

42
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,950
Why are you two
hitting it off today?

43
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,010
- This is crazy.
- That's not true.

44
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,850
I'm really stressed out today.

45
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,240
- Why?
- We just like each other.

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,380
Today, we are having
Trade King Race.

47
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,820
- Trade King?
- Trade King?

48
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,960
It's called Trade King.

49
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,150
LA Lover Jong Kook will be
the captain of American traders.

50
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,960
And Asian Prince Kwang Soo will be
the captain of Asian traders.

51
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,200
- I see.
- He and I are captains?

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Am I a captain?

53
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,870
And Jae Suk and Suk Jin will be...

54
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,870
customs agents and two MCs.

55
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,870
Customs agents?

56
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,900
What is a customs agent?

57
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,980
A person who takes
care of customs issues.

58
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,950
When I make a purchase abroad...

59
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,070
Stay quiet.

60
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,450
I'm trying to explain.

61
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,450
I should tell viewers
what a customs agent is.

62
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,740
Bo Pil is talking.

63
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,450
- I'm a fan of these clips.
- You only listen to...

64
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,090
movie directors.

65
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,380
- That's not true.
- Won't you listen to Bo Pil?

66
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,560
He's right. You should
listen to Bo Pil.

67
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,280
- Listen to Bo Pil.
- My gosh.

68
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,690
- I'm disappointed.
- What are you talking about?

69
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,990
- You disappointed him.
- Do you want me to disappoint you?

70
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,670
Jae Suk and Suk Jin will
handle the overall race...

71
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,740
and broker trade deals
to collect taxes.

72
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,960
(They will handle the race
and collect taxes from traders.)

73
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,460
You're good
at collecting money, right?

74
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,710
- I'm an expert in this.
- I'm not good at it though.

75
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,050
I'm good at collecting money.

76
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,900
- So Suk Jin is...
- It's Petty Gang again.

77
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,180
my subordinate, right?

78
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,340
- Your underling.
- No. You're my subordinate.

79
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,710
You're a member of Petty Gang.

80
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,710
You're my subordinate.

81
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,490
- You're obviously his subordinate.
- Right.

82
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,060
Now the members will
split up into two teams.

83
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,250
They will see the captains' names
on each door.

84
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,860
They will see the names
and pick a team.

85
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,720
But you two will be
in each other's room.

86
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,300
So those who pick Jong Kook...

87
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,530
will be joining Team Kwang Soo.

88
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,370
Okay, okay.

89
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,270
- It sounds fun.
- Okay.

90
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,740
So the members who get
into your room didn't pick you.

91
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,840
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

92
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,150
I see.

93
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,710
I will be a little disappointed.

94
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,240
They will try hard
to hide their feelings.

95
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,050
They didn't pick you,
but they will be your team.

96
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,590
- Right.
- Okay.

97
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,020
If I get a lot of members,
I'll be disappointed.

98
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,180
If no one comes in,
Jong Kook will be disappointed.

99
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,490
I know.

100
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,690
Jong Kook will be upset
until tomorrow.

101
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,870
- This isn't a good time.
- Right.

102
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,220
We are having
another shoot tomorrow.

103
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,370
Haha should definitely come.

104
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,000
- Right.
- Haha has to be there.

105
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,170
Right. Haha must pick me.

106
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,870
The last episode was quite touching.

107
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,340
(Last week's episode)

108
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,440
(Which one comes first?
Jong Kook or his business?)

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,920
(He chose Jong Kook.)

110
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
(Jong Kook was deeply moved
by Haha's choice.)

111
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,810
It was touching.

112
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,590
Today, I'll be able to see
if he was serious.

113
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,860
I know. Today...

114
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,780
If Haha comes in here...

115
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,750
It means he made fun of you.

116
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,190
We're in the pyebaek room.
Do you have some jujubes?

117
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,590
I'll throw them at him.

118
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,560
(Jong Kook is determined
to teach him a lesson.)

119
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,770
(Se Chan shows up humming
without knowing anything.)

120
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
(Jong Kook's favorite member no. 2)

121
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,500
Hello.

122
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,080
For today's race, it's important
to pick a good captain.

123
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,080
So we will let the members
pick their captain themselves.

124
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,420
If Se Chan comes in here...
Gosh, what should I do?

125
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,180
You know what I'm like
when I trust someone.

126
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,250
Right. He just gives his everything.

127
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,250
- I give my everything.
- Once he trusts someone.

128
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,990
Right. I'm not calculating at all.

129
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,190
Haha and Se Chan
might not come here.

130
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,060
(He's expecting to see them.)

131
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,100
Right.

132
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,870
(Humming)

133
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,870
Come on.

134
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,930
(Se Chan shows up.)

135
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,570
(It's been a long time.)

136
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,110
- I knew he'd come.
- My gosh.

137
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,350
(He feels betrayed.)

138
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,280
- I knew he'd come.
- Kwang Soo, wait.

139
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,490
- I'm sorry.
- Just keep singing.

140
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,050
Gosh, this is...

141
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,580
- Did you not even hesitate?
- No.

142
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,660
Listen to me.
The reason I came in here...

143
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,660
Did you not hesitate?

144
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,860
It's not that I didn't hesitate.

145
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,950
If I don't pick Jong Kook...

146
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,560
- The thing is...
- What?

147
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,930
(It's been a long time.)

148
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,760
I can't believe this.
I was going to slap you in the face.

149
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,760
I want to be in his favor.
So he's in the other room.

150
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,930
Right.

151
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,830
(It's So Min's turn.)

152
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,330
Let me choose a room.

153
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,310
(What's So Min's choice?)

154
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,850
Don't you think So Min will come?

155
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,110
- I'm sure So Min will come.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

156
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,280
- I'm 100 percent sure too.
- Me too.

157
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,310
What if So Min picks the other team?
You'll be moved, right?

158
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,990
- Sure. I'll be moved.
- I know.

159
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,660
Actually, we had some talk
in the parking lot earlier.

160
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,620
Right. I saw you two having a talk.

161
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,390
It might affect her choice.

162
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,870
I know. She's... What?

163
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,300
See?

164
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,330
(So Min shows up,
letting Jong Kook down.)

165
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,930
(Flustered)

166
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,470
(See?)

167
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,370
This isn't the room.
What's going on?

168
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,740
(I know. What's going on, So Min?)

169
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,850
So Min.

170
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,110
- Yes?
- Come on in.

171
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,120
(Her eyes are wide open.)

172
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,720
- How could you...
- I told you so.

173
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,140
- This is just as expected.
- Come here!

174
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,560
You never go beyond my expectations.

175
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,290
I was 100 percent sure
that you'd pick this room.

176
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,120
- Just come here.
- Let me explain.

177
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,360
- Go ahead.
- Have a seat.

178
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,230
I was told we wouldn't be
using our physical strength today.

179
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,750
- So I picked the sly one.
- Just come and have a seat.

180
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,030
- You're not sly at all.
- Just sit.

181
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,560
This is just as we expected.

182
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
Do you think I like Kwang Soo?
I bad-mouth Kwang Soo a lot.

183
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,780
Why are you sitting on your knees?

184
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,830
(Her hands and knees have become
polite before she knew it.)

185
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,980
I don't know.

186
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,310
So Se Chan went to the other room.

187
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,570
- Gosh, Se Chan.
- Gosh.

188
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,310
I can't help but like him.

189
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,240
He got your back.

190
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,950
Se Chan has a face
that I can't hate.

191
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,580
- I know.
- His face is...

192
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,450
What are you doing?

193
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,230
I just can't hate his face.

194
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,990
- She's...
- Gosh.

195
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,490
You're such a troublemaker.

196
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,240
Just go sit there.

197
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,930
I'm in trouble. What do I do?
Our team is at a disadvantage.

198
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,500
(Next up is Ji Hyo.)

199
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,680
I already have my answer.

200
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,430
I'm sure about this.

201
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,610
Ji Hyo will go there,
and So Min will come here.

202
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,850
(I believe you, Ji Hyo.)

203
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,480
(Ji Hyo shows up.)

204
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,850
Ji Hyo is here.

205
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
Kwang Soo, what are you doing here?

206
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,720
Ji Hyo, why did you come?

207
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,450
I didn't know you would come.

208
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,360
I thought Ji Hyo would
pick the other team.

209
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,450
Isn't this Jong Kook's room?

210
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,030
Right. This is Jong Kook's room.

211
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,190
Then what is he doing here?

212
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,100
- They switched rooms.
- You can't say that to me.

213
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,190
You're supposed
to feel sorry for me.

214
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,130
I'm just flustered now.

215
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,970
- It's Haha.
- Honestly...

216
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,110
- If Haha...
- If Haha comes in here...

217
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,980
He is going to have a hard time.

218
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,180
Was Haha supposed to come in
after you?

219
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,910
If Haha comes in, I'll ask for
my money back right away.

220
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,310
My goodness.

221
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,550
(Haha comes in.)

222
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,940
Jong Kook. I knew it.

223
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,550
(Haha is about to return
the investment money.)

224
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,920
(I knew it.)

225
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,560
(Haha, how could you
do this to me?)

226
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,120
I knew it.

227
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,660
I really knew it. I swear.

228
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,300
- I came here because I knew it.
- Stop it.

229
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,600
Jong Kook, I really knew
you would be here.

230
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,530
- Stop lying.
- Listen. I really knew it.

231
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,430
- This is shocking.
- I knew it.

232
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,800
- I knew it.
- I didn't think he'd come in.

233
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,610
- I knew it.
- He acted like Jong Kook's brother.

234
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,870
- Hey.
- I really knew he'd be here.

235
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,610
- They were so close. My goodness.
- I knew it.

236
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,540
Jong Kook, see how relaxed I am.

237
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,000
Why are you sitting on your knees?

238
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,010
I don't know.
I'm comfortable in this pose.

239
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,070
Exactly. She's been sitting
like that.

240
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,980
(He threw his cap on the floor.)

241
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,120
(He's punishing himself
to reflect on himself.)

242
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,580
You lied to Jong Kook.

243
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,450
After all these years... Gosh.

244
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,450
- Come on. That's not why I'm here.
- How could you do this to me?

245
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,060
You see, I knew they switched
the rooms before I made my choice.

246
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,060
- I meant what I said.
- You're lying.

247
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,760
- Haha, I'm so disappointed...
- I'm in shock.

248
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,490
- You look pale.
- It itches. Darned mosquito.

249
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,430
(What? "Darned mosquito"?)

250
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,170
Gosh, I didn't refer to you.
I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

251
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,830
- It wasn't like that.
- "Darned mosquito"?

252
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,380
- It was itchy. That's why.
- Come here.

253
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,680
- Are you making fun of him?
- No. I have a mosquito bite.

254
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,750
You know how much Jong Kook
hates that nickname.

255
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,550
You want a really big mosquito bite?

256
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,810
(Scared)

257
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,920
That was unbelievable.

258
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,450
Let's go for now. Let's get out.

259
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,520
Can we leave now?

260
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,430
Jong Kook.

261
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,590
<i>- It has been a long time</i>
- How could this happen?

262
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,660
Jong Kook.

263
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,430
(He's finally singing the song
to the one he wanted to sing to.)

264
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,820
Se Chan, you won
a lot of brownie points.

265
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,730
<i>- It feels natural
- It feels natural</i>

266
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,230
<i>- Just by the look on your face
- Just by the look on your face</i>

267
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,780
- Ji Hyo.
<i>- I can tell how you feel</i>

268
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,780
<i>- Like a close friend
- Like a close friend</i>

269
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,550
- I knew Haha would betray him.
- Hello.

270
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,290
So, he smiles happily at me
only when I have a picture taken...

271
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,650
- at his restaurant.
- Exactly.

272
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,560
- He said he'll withdraw investment.
- He used me.

273
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
He meant it.

274
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,720
Only when we discuss
about his restaurant business.

275
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,530
I can't trust Haha.

276
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,760
Haha.

277
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,930
(He's going to lose an investor
because of his misjudgment.)

278
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm not feeling well.

279
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,270
- Just as I told you earlier,
- Yes.

280
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,930
today's theme is Trade King Race.

281
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,560
- Jong Kook's team is Team America.
- Team America?

282
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,700
(Haha and So Min are cheering.)

283
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,810
(Jong Kook won't respond.)

284
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,200
I mean, this is...

285
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,440
- Jong Kook, come on.
- This is a variety show.

286
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,610
- Show some reaction.
- Stop being upset.

287
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,780
Are you on the robot mode?

288
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,150
He's just standing there.

289
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,250
I'll cheer up a little
when our guests arrive.

290
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,760
(It will be a long day.)

291
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,210
- Look at his face.
- The other team is Team Asia.

292
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,290
Team Asia!

293
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,630
Jae Suk and Suk Jin are
Team Customs...

294
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,720
- and today's MCs.
- Okay.

295
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,800
Team Customs will be given
100 dollars of fund.

296
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,130
Wait. Give it to me.

297
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,730
Why? Hey, why?

298
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,670
Suk Jin, I heard Jae Suk is
your superior.

299
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,230
- Of course, he is.
- And...

300
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,910
each of Team America and Team Asia
will be given...

301
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,510
- 200 dollars.
- We receive money too.

302
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,140
Is it for the captain?

303
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,280
- 200 dollars?
- It's for the team.

304
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,610
Also, as you might know
if you watched the show,

305
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,380
So Min and Haha made necklaces.

306
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,420
Yes, we did.

307
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,980
- Oh, right.
- I remember that.

308
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,650
I'll give it to Ji Hyo.

309
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,680
- I'll give it to Suk Jin.
- Okay.

310
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,580
Haha, you should make it pretty.

311
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,060
I'm making this for Suk Jin.
That's pointless.

312
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,220
All right. I'm done.

313
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,060
- That was quick. Haha...
- I'm off. Bye.

314
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,590
Haha.

315
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,900
- Oh, right.
- Yes, it was their penalty.

316
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,590
So Min and Haha, give them
what you made for them.

317
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,270
(Here you go, Jong Kook.)

318
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,280
For whom did they make those?

319
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,010
- We chose the same person.
- They already made their choices?

320
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,840
They already made their choices.

321
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,570
(She's giving it to Ji Hyo
as she planned.)

322
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,050
Oh, she picked Ji Hyo.

323
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,390
- I chose him...
- Your role model.

324
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,440
hoping he'll live young.

325
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,020
- Suk Jin.
- Me?

326
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,710
(He gave it to Suk Jin
hoping he'll feel younger.)

327
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,790
Thank you.

328
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,680
Since you received a gift,

329
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,930
it looks as if today is
your last day at work.

330
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,820
- We should give him some flowers.
- It's like his retirement ceremony.

331
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,690
- His retirement ceremony?
- Yes, his retirement ceremony.

332
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,090
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

333
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,560
- Try it on.
- Now?

334
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,600
- You should...
- Try it on.

335
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,960
- try it on.
- You should try it on.

336
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,200
I can try it on later.

337
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,280
- I know you won't.
- I don't think I should...

338
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,880
He'll probably give it
to his stylist and say,

339
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,180
"Hey, you can have this."

340
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,790
- Pull it.
- Like this.

341
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,580
- It's pretty.
- It's nice.

342
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,210
- He looks great.
- Thank you for your hard work.

343
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,310
- Thank you for this.
- You did a great job.

344
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,430
- Indeed.
- You did...

345
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,660
- Thank you, Haha.
- It's nice.

346
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,300
He's lying.

347
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,950
He didn't mean that.

348
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,130
(He thanked Haha halfheartedly.)

349
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,900
He must be thinking,
"When can I take this off?"

350
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,900
- He thinks it's a hassle.
- He's waiting for the right moment.

351
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,060
Thank you, So Min.
This is so pretty.

352
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,410
- Today, we have guests.
- I see.

353
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,100
We'll meet them downstairs.

354
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,340
- All right.
- Okay.

355
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
- Let's go.
- Let's go, everybody.

356
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,610
- He's taking it off right away.
- He's taking it off.

357
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,750
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

358
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,050
Put it on at least until you get
to the elevator.

359
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,260
- Haha looks so disappointed.
- You're the worst.

360
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,680
I'll cherish it.

361
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,820
"Let's go, everybody."
What was that?

362
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,950
Ha Na.

363
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,950
(They all moved to meet the guests
after Big Nose thanked Haha.)

364
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,220
For our today's theme,
Trade King Race,

365
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,360
two guests will join...

366
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,060
each of Team America and Team Asia.

367
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,360
- Yes.
- Okay.

368
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,070
Let's meet the guests who will join
Team America first.

369
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,280
Team America.

370
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,070
- Please come in.
- What's up?

371
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,970
(The 2 guests with American swag)

372
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,210
(Joon Park, Wassup Man, from god)

373
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,250
What's up, brother?

374
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,210
(Joon, what's up?)

375
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,180
Look. Ailee is here.

376
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,260
(Ailee, the Beyonce of Korea)

377
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,850
(It's nice to meet you.)

378
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,030
(They're greeting excitedly
as if they're in America.)

379
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,130
What's up?

380
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,960
- They really are Team America.
- No wonder.

381
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,830
- They really are Team America.
- We got both coasts covered.

382
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,270
We got both
East Coast and West Coast covered.

383
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,310
- By the way, Joon.
- Yes?

384
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,680
Isn't it a little bit chilly
to wear a sleeveless shirt?

385
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,840
To be honest, if I had known
it would be this cold...

386
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,880
You know what I mean, right?

387
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,680
(This is Joon's signature phrase.)

388
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,980
- I haven't heard that in a while.
- "You know what I mean, right?"

389
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,020
- I'm freezing.
- Even I'm wearing long sleeves.

390
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,820
- Gosh. Look at you.
- Even I'm wearing long sleeves.

391
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,560
Now, let's meet the guests
who will join Team Asia.

392
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,350
I bet they're related to Asia.

393
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,170
(Screaming)

394
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,670
(Kangnam, the romanticist
who dotes on Lee Sang Hwa)

395
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,090
Oh, Kangnam is here.

396
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,060
- Welcome.
- Hey.

397
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,960
Yiren of EVERGLOW is here too.

398
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,830
- Hello.
- He's overacting.

399
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,330
He's forcing himself
to act more energetic.

400
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,510
- Come over here.
- He was too intense.

401
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,250
- He's overacting.
- Come over here.

402
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,880
- You don't have to do that.
- You're on this team.

403
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,890
- You're on that team.
- Oh, over there?

404
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,980
- Where should I stand?
- Your name tag is there.

405
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,060
- Where should I stand?
- Kangnam...

406
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,660
When Kangnam just made his debut,

407
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,060
- he was so charismatic.
- My gosh.

408
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,450
- You gained some weight.
- Right?

409
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,900
- Yes.
- Why did you gain so much weight?

410
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,720
- Since I got married,
- Really?

411
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,770
- I've been eating a lot.
- You look great.

412
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,640
We have another guest.
A member of EVERGLOW,

413
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,960
- Yiren!
- Yiren!

414
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,730
- She came on the show before.
- Yes, I did.

415
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,540
She came on the show before.

416
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,100
That's right. I appeared
for a short while.

417
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,180
Whenever she's on a TV show,
she draws attention.

418
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,200
- Really?
- Because she's pretty.

419
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,050
(Yiren's pretty face draws attention
whenever she's on a TV show.)

420
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,050
Ailee, did you release a new song?

421
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,920
- Yes, I released a new song.
- Really?

422
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,210
- What's the title of the song?
- Let's hear it.

423
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,950
It's "While We Were in Love".

424
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,260
- Let's hear her sing.
- Let's do that.

425
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,800
("While We Were in Love" by Ailee)

426
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,430
(Why didn't you tell me
while we were in love?)

427
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,140
(I can't imagine
how hard it must have been)

428
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,600
(Her beautiful heart-wrenching voice
makes everyone sentimental.)

429
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,150
(While we were in love)

430
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,480
(I did everything as I wanted)

431
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,580
(The sad melody reminds him
of his past love.)

432
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,930
She can sing like that
so early in the morning?

433
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,300
- That was awesome.
- It's so early in the morning.

434
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,010
But why does So Min look like
she's about to cry?

435
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,330
What's with your face? Gosh.

436
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,330
- What's wrong with you?
- That's enough.

437
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,470
- So Min.
- She ruined the mood.

438
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,810
- These days, So Min...
- Yes?

439
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,440
starts crying when she just
hears a love story.

440
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,150
- She's been single for two years.
- Thank you.

441
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,680
I think it's time for you
to publish another book.

442
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,850
"I Called Him Drunk".

443
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,020
("I Called Him Drunk",
Jeon So Min's 2nd book of essays)

444
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,260
I heard...

445
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,820
that EVERGLOW also
released a new song.

446
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,300
- Yes, that's right.
- Please show us a bit.

447
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,000
- Please show us a bit.
- Okay.

448
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,090
- The title track is "LA DI DA".
- I guess she'll dance.

449
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,300
("LA DI DA" by EVERGLOW)

450
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,310
(Awesome groove)

451
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,910
(Smiling excitedly)

452
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,940
(Her powerful dance moves
make her look charismatic.)

453
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,680
That was Yiren.

454
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,660
(Everyone is applauding
her beautiful dance.)

455
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,590
- She looked so different.
- That's a great song.

456
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,900
Indeed.

457
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,000
Today, we're having Trade King Race.

458
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,170
Three teams will compete,
and the last place team...

459
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,300
will receive a scary penalty.

460
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,510
Penalties these days
are not very intense,

461
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,330
- but they're annoying.
- It was...

462
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,070
- boring, and it took a long time.
- It's annoying, right?

463
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,150
- I know.
- Yes.

464
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,200
Each member of the winning team...

465
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,250
- will receive 20 dollars.
- 20 dollars?

466
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,570
After you complete a mission,

467
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,790
you will have time
to declare at customs.

468
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,950
You can gain additional mission fund
while doing that.

469
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,110
When we declare at customs?

470
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,180
Then we'll move to
another place to begin the mission.

471
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

472
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,670
(They're gathering at the place
where they'll complete the mission.)

473
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,820
(There are seats reserved
for the MCs.)

474
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,500
You two really are a duo?

475
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,690
Where should I sit?

476
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
- I'm looking forward to this.
- We're not a duo.

477
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,200
Please be gentle on us.

478
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,540
You know how powerful we are, right?

479
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,680
- Please be gentle on us.
- We make the decision.

480
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,070
Jae Suk, please be gentle on us.

481
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,280
Your smile looks so pretentious.

482
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,710
- Why don't you bring some snacks?
- I hope...

483
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,890
That's not how you ask a favor.

484
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,190
Do we have some chocolates?

485
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,260
So I can feed them.

486
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,190
(She gave up on competing fairly
a long time ago.)

487
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,620
I think I need to give the MCs
some food.

488
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,660
- First of all, we're going to...
- Yes?

489
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,940
Jong Kook, listen. There will be
punctuality score.

490
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,200
"Punctuality score"?

491
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,810
- Some of you are not here yet.
- Those punks are not here yet.

492
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,770
Only the guests are here
from this team.

493
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,540
- Exactly.
- It's a disaster.

494
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,280
Running Man
is a popular show though.

495
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,900
- What is taking them so long?
- Kwang Soo and I don't get along.

496
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,110
Hey!

497
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,290
- Don't...
- Come quickly.

498
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,380
Don't yell.

499
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,310
Let me yell at them
since I have power over them.

500
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,350
Listen. You must be punctual.

501
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,460
Jong Kook, one of your members
is missing.

502
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,060
Guys. About the punctuality score...

503
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,650
You were winning,
but they turned the tables.

504
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,000
- I know.
- They won.

505
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,390
But you yelled at us a lot.

506
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,740
- What?
- You yelled at us too much.

507
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,800
- Hey.
- Almost all of our members...

508
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,060
- are here.
- This is crazy.

509
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,540
Do you know what power I have?

510
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,940
- What is it?
- Do you have power?

511
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,670
Jae Suk and I get to decide.

512
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,840
We will decide the winner.

513
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,050
So you will have to
listen to Jae Suk.

514
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,370
- What?
- You can't decide it yourself.

515
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,840
Jae Suk and I have
our own opinions.

516
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
So can you make a decision
by yourself or not?

517
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,290
We will go 50-50.

518
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,910
So can you make a decision
by yourself or not?

519
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,260
This is a democratic society.
I can't decide anything alone.

520
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,790
We won't listen to you then.

521
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,080
What did you say?

522
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,820
We just need to get
on Jae Suk's side.

523
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,700
Jae Suk.

524
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,470
Se Chan just ignored me.

525
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,620
I'm the director here.

526
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,660
(He draws a line.)

527
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,270
If you're a director, what is he?

528
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,510
- What's his title?
- He's an intern.

529
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,970
- He's a section chief.
- A section chief?

530
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,310
Are you talking
about marinated crab?

531
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,010
Marinated crab?
That sounds about right.

532
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,510
- Chief Ji.
- It sounds good.

533
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,900
- I'm the director.
- Director?

534
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,050
Director Yoo and Chief Ji.

535
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,720
- Chief Ji.
- It sounds like a carrier.

536
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,570
Chief Ji.

537
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,290
By the way, Team Jong Kook
isn't still here.

538
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,410
Haha is getting makeup now.

539
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,150
- Why would he get makeup?
- Why?

540
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,560
- He even wears cologne.
- Everyone.

541
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
He started talking.

542
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,590
- It's started.
- We have 9 people out of 10.

543
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,530
- It's 90 percent attendance.
- Sure.

544
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,620
I agree.

545
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,770
He's very wise.

546
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,940
- You're so cool.
- Director Yu, you're very wise.

547
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,830
Hey, why are you
treating him differently?

548
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,130
- And...
- That's because...

549
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,510
- Chief Ji.
- you have no power.

550
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,210
You should be
respectful towards them.

551
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,510
- Right.
- I agree.

552
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,670
- The thing is...
- Now I have my power.

553
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,550
It's not like that.
This is a public office.

554
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,720
- A public office?
- We're here for the civil service.

555
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,290
- He's different.
- Sure.

556
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,490
- In the old days...
- You'll see.

557
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,410
I also have my vote.
You guys should remember that.

558
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,380
So your team has
a director and a parrot.

559
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,260
He's not a parrot.
He's a section chief.

560
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,230
- Chief Ji.
- Director Yoo and an old geezer.

561
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,500
Look at him.

562
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,030
- That punk.
- Look.

563
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,320
You can walk past.

564
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,470
Excuse me.

565
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,270
- We just...
- How did it go?

566
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,630
lost our points.

567
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,160
Let me tell you about today's race.

568
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,010
We are going to tell you
about three controversial stories...

569
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,280
being discussed online.

570
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,670
That's good. I like it.

571
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,750
We will hear your opinions
on the issues...

572
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,810
and decide if it's okay or not.

573
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,460
- We will make a decision.
- Let me see.

574
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,610
Excuse me, but...

575
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,060
(I want to see it.)

576
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,580
Will you stay still?

577
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,730
Just sit still.

578
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,300
I'm sorry, but you haven't been
an MC since "Six Heroines".

579
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,660
- Director Yu.
- I'm sorry,

580
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,590
but you haven't been
an MC since "Six Heroines".

581
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,270
- "Six Heroines"?
- Just stay quiet.

582
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,300
Keep your mouth shut.

583
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,940
You haven't done this
since "Six Heroines".

584
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,810
You need to watch your language
for the civil service.

585
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,010
I just want to see it.

586
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,340
So the captains will pick
one of these two.

587
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,140
Each team will pick
"Okay" and "Not Okay"...

588
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,610
and convince us accordingly.

589
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,840
- I see.
- I've done this before.

590
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,110
If we pick "Not Okay",

591
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,220
we should go against the idea.

592
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,620
It's not about our real opinion.

593
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,760
- Exactly.
- It's about what we pick.

594
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,350
I will tell you a story...

595
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,770
that's under great controversy...

596
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,320
on the Internet.

597
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,700
Who told you to drink water?

598
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,210
- I knew you'd get scolded.
- This is important.

599
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,130
- You're our captain.
- I'm telling you...

600
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,870
- about something important.
- You need to win his favor.

601
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,570
- How dare you...
- I'm sorry.

602
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,280
How dare you drink water?

603
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
I'm really sorry.

604
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,480
I just saw water here.

605
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,670
We have strong power here.

606
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,570
- I'm sorry, but...
- We have strong power.

607
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,580
Ailee was about to drink water.

608
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,290
- Go ahead and drink it, Ailee.
- Go ahead.

609
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,610
I will tell you a story...

610
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,610
Who told you to drink water?

611
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,350
(Startled)

612
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,320
I was thirsty. That was close.

613
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,760
(Ailee decided to suppress thirst
as the MCs yell.)

614
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,770
Ailee, you can drink.

615
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,800
What are you doing?

616
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,160
- Let her drink water.
- She was thirsty.

617
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,770
She's our guest.

618
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,240
- She says she was thirsty.
- It's okay. Go ahead and drink.

619
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,900
You are okay.

620
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,040
Ailee, I like your song, "I'll Go
to You Like the First Snow".

621
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,130
Stop it.

622
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,670
About the cue cards
Suk Jin is holding...

623
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,310
This one? It's fake.

624
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,370
This is real.

625
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,080
- It's real.
- It's nothing.

626
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,140
- This is real.
- No, it's fake.

627
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,310
I'll read a story.

628
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,580
This is like
"Men Who Top the Charts".

629
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,060
It has some words,

630
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,460
but it's different from mine.

631
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,650
It's just for a show.

632
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,460
It doesn't have the important part.

633
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,770
Suk Jin, switch seats with him.

634
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,740
- So there's fierce controversy...
- It's not fierce.

635
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,310
over these stories online.

636
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,160
Here's the first story.

637
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,360
- This is good.
- I'm excited.

638
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,400
We can make a coherent argument.

639
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
- We have So Min too.
- Sure.

640
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,710
- We're good at this.
- This...

641
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,140
has been under controversy...

642
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,570
for a long time
since we got cell phones.

643
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,990
- It applies to all of us?
- It's about...

644
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,310
(Sharing the phone password)

645
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,260
sharing the phone password.

646
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,220
Who do we share it with?

647
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,820
My girlfriend or parents?

648
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,580
- Your girlfriend.
- My girlfriend?

649
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,030
- Not my parents?
- No.

650
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,150
- Let me read...
- I'll...

651
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,970
read a story.

652
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,060
Stay quiet.

653
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,360
I've been waiting to read this.

654
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,130
(Chief Ji has been waiting
a long time for his part.)

655
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,240
Suk Jin. Just sit here.

656
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,160
- Stay quiet!
- Suk Jin, come have a seat.

657
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,400
I feel bad for Suk Jin.

658
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,540
My gosh.

659
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,570
Let me read a story for you.

660
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,980
- We will talk about this story.
- All right then.

661
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,570
- Chief Ji will read you a story.
- Right.

662
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,640
Please listen.

663
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,690
"We're a couple in our early 20s,
and we've been dating for 6 months."

664
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,560
- In their early 20s.
- Think carefully about it.

665
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,150
"We were watching a movie
together at home a few days ago."

666
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:51,060
"Then my girlfriend asked me
to unlock my phone."

667
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,060
All of a sudden?

668
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,320
"I thought she wanted to see
some photos, so I unlocked it."

669
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,630
"Then she asked me about
my messaging app password."

670
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,940
She asked about
his messaging app password.

671
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,360
She crossed the line.

672
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,740
"My girlfriend said..."

673
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,900
- Just stay still.
- Hurry.

674
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
This isn't important.
Just hurry and get it over with.

675
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,950
"My girlfriend said there should be
no secret between lovers."

676
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,520
(Yawning)

677
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,410
"She asked me to share
my phone password..."

678
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,110
"and messaging app password."

679
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,560
"I think even couples..."
Think carefully about this.

680
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,200
"She asked me to share
my phone password..."

681
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,620
"and messaging app password."

682
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,060
(He reads all the unnecessary
sentences of the story.)

683
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,160
(They all fall asleep together.)

684
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,270
- "We should have some secrets."
- Director Yu, please read it again.

685
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,360
Gosh, I'm startled.

686
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,040
- What happened?
- "After a long squabble..."

687
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,450
- Hey.
- Hello?

688
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,810
- Hi.
- Wake up.

689
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,450
(They can't continue.)

690
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,220
- How are you?
- Wake up, everyone.

691
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,990
Wake up.

692
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,260
(Chief Ji wakes everyone up
with the sign.)

693
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,190
- What?
- Why? What's wrong, Kwang Soo?

694
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,230
I just had a paralyzing nightmare.

695
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,650
(The story is like a nightmare.)

696
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,200
Everyone. This is
exciting, isn't it?

697
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,730
"We squabbled for a while, but
we failed to reach an agreement."

698
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,560
"So we decided to talk
about it again later."

699
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,270
"Is it okay to share
the passwords of phones..."

700
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,770
"and messaging apps
with my girlfriend?"

701
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,040
All right. Before we start
talking about it,

702
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,450
I wonder what you think.

703
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,870
I think we should never...

704
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,550
share passwords in any case.

705
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,750
- Why not?
- Why do you think so?

706
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,220
It's uncomfortable. I share
my passwords with my wife.

707
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,650
- I see.
- So whenever I get a message,

708
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,850
my heart beats fast.

709
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,620
- Why?
- I don't know.

710
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,380
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Then why?

711
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,620
- Why?
- I don't know.

712
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,760
My wife might get the wrong idea.

713
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,500
- What?
- She might take it the wrong way.

714
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,300
Now I get it. One day, Suk Jin...

715
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,830
kept leaving the chat room
we were in together.

716
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,710
So I wondered
why he was being like that.

717
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,830
Why did you leave
the chat room with So Min?

718
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,240
The problem is,

719
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,870
you act cute with your messages.

720
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,100
When did I do that?

721
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,220
- That's not true.
- Suk Jin.

722
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,950
You send too many emojis.

723
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,580
- What's wrong about using emojis?
- That's not true.

724
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,380
Guys. I want you
to give your opinions now.

725
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,720
Is it okay to share your passwords
with your lover?

726
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,730
- Gosh, this is...
- Se Chan, go ahead.

727
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,590
I once broke up with my girlfriend
because of this issue.

728
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,560
- I knew it.
- We broke up.

729
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,890
So the thing is,

730
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,060
you can exchange some jokes...

731
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,130
with your friends on messaging apps.

732
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,710
Sometimes I send some jokes
to make my friends laugh.

733
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,240
I also send some pictures.

734
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,330
But my girlfriend
took it the wrong way.

735
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,900
- She thought I was being strange.
- I understand.

736
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,550
Are you talking
about the flight attendant?

737
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,050
- Hey!
- Okay. I get it.

738
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,380
- Why would you say that?
- Okay.

739
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,720
- He's mad for real.
- All right.

740
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,960
- I'm giving you a warning.
- I'm sorry.

741
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,790
- I'm really sorry.
- Can I talk about her as well?

742
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,060
- I apologize.
- I'll talk about her too.

743
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,760
Hey.

744
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,320
Don't mention flight attendants.
It also applies to Jae Suk.

745
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,470
Are you crazy?

746
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,890
- Don't say that.
- Keep quiet.

747
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,830
- His wife is watching.
- We all have a past.

748
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,740
- Really?
- Why would he talk about my past?

749
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,060
(What did you just say?)

750
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,510
Do you want me to talk about you?

751
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,600
- Do you want to start it?
- All right.

752
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,070
- Look at you.
- I get it.

753
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,670
- I have a lot to talk about.
- Okay, okay.

754
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,100
(The revelation of their past
happens one after another.)

755
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,720
What about you, Kangnam?

756
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,080
My wife and I share passwords.

757
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,490
We know each other's passwords,

758
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,490
but we don't check
each other's phone.

759
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,520
- You don't?
- No.

760
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,460
- But you know her passwords?
- I do, but I don't check her phone.

761
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,460
This is different.

762
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,380
Do you really think
your wife didn't check your phone?

763
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,620
- Yes.
- I'm sure she did.

764
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,060
Yes.

765
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,200
(He ends
the conversation right away.)

766
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,770
I think Kangnam doesn't
even want to talk to you.

767
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,130
He's the section chief.

768
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,830
- He's ignoring you.
- He still holds a high position.

769
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,830
- He is the section chief.
- He has his own title.

770
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,170
- I still have a 50-percent share.
- He has a vote.

771
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,400
You can't ignore him.

772
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,750
- Does he hold a high position?
- He has a vote.

773
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,750
We should respect
each other's opinion.

774
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,980
- You shouldn't ignore others.
- I agree.

775
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,220
And you can't make fun of others.

776
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,950
- Make sure not to do those things.
- Okay.

777
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,990
- I have my power.
- "Yes."

778
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,420
I think it's better
not to share passwords.

779
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,460
I've never shared
my password with my ex-boyfriend.

780
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,060
- But he figured it out himself.
- How?

781
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,800
- How did he figure it out?
- He looked over my shoulder.

782
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,540
That's dangerous.

783
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,940
Then he looked at my phone
and got me wrong.

784
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,040
"Why are you being
so kind to other guys?"

785
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,570
But her messages can be misleading.

786
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,640
- She's too kind.
- All right.

787
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,480
I'd like you to talk less.

788
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,410
What you said is like 80 percent!

789
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,670
You're the one who talked a lot.

790
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,950
Is he a bully or something?

791
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,640
- He sounds like a bully.
- He rarely talked.

792
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,910
- You did most of the talking.
- Talk less.

793
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,060
It feels like I'm listening
to a radio show.

794
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,920
If you don't want to get hit,
just stay quiet.

795
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,960
- All right. Continue.
- Let's say I told my boyfriend...

796
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,920
my password,
and he checked my phone once.

797
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,060
It should end there,
but he keeps thinking about it.

798
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,560
"Oh, right. I should check..."

799
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,700
"the friends she blocked
on the messaging app."

800
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,160
- He even checks those?
- He does.

801
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,210
- I didn't know that.
- And...

802
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,870
- That sounds scary.
- They even check things like that?

803
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,600
That's why I don't want to know
the password in the first place.

804
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,510
- I don't even start.
- It's better not to see it.

805
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,100
- It's distressing.
- Captain Jong Kook, you're up.

806
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,170
Here's what I think. It's...

807
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,190
Hang on. Don't get worked up
even before you start talking.

808
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,580
He's right.

809
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,290
Your shoulders are too broad.

810
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,020
The thing is...

811
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,920
If my girlfriend...

812
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,960
- She must have male friends, right?
- Of course.

813
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,030
I wouldn't want to see her texts
to them with my own eyes.

814
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,390
- You wouldn't?
- I would just trust my girlfriend.

815
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,060
- Exactly.
- Right.

816
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,560
It seems that most of you,
Suk Jin, and I...

817
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,330
- believe...
- Many are against it.

818
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,040
that it's right for a couple
to not share...

819
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,900
- each other's password.
- That's better.

820
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,100
- If you know the password...
- That's the prevailing opinion.

821
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,570
You'd want to look through the phone
if you know the password.

822
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,370
But 1 of the 2 teams here will
defend the opposite opinion.

823
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,450
- The captain of each team...
- I'm worried.

824
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,720
- will pick the side.
- You will pick the side.

825
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,290
- And according to the result,
- This is so important.

826
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,720
you may have to argue...

827
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,580
what is against your point of view
in front of us.

828
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,700
You have to convince us.

829
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,470
- Kwang Soo, pick the good one.
- You should pick the good one.

830
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,320
- I should pick Not Okay, right?
- Don't pick Okay.

831
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,500
(Not Okay seems easier
to convince the MCs.)

832
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,860
(Which one will
the unlucky Kwang Soo pick?)

833
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,360
- Right. Please pick Not Okay.
- You should pick Not Okay.

834
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,740
(Team Asia)

835
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,330
- You should pick Not Okay.
- It's Not Okay.

836
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,440
- Okay!
- Now...

837
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,210
(Team Asia picked Not Okay.)

838
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,640
- I made it.
- Good.

839
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,280
- We'll be okay.
- Let's win the first round.

840
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,910
- We'll be okay. It'll be easy.
- You never know.

841
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,750
- We can do this.
- You just have to...

842
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,080
- convince us.
- We can do this.

843
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,960
- Your team is Not Okay.
- Yes.

844
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,350
- This team is Okay.
- Yes.

845
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,820
You can just convince us.

846
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,790
Just as we said earlier,
if a couple shares the password,

847
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,560
it leads to a misunderstanding
and they end up breaking up.

848
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,200
- Don't cause a misunderstanding.
- You shouldn't do anything...

849
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,300
- that can cause a misunderstanding.
- What if you didn't?

850
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,590
Even if they did nothing suspicious,
it can lead to a fight,

851
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,740
- and they grow apart eventually.
- Even if nothing happened...

852
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,540
For example, I came back
from the restroom.

853
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,370
- Can you lower your voice, please?
- Exactly.

854
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,710
- I was...
- You're too loud.

855
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,340
I was the quietest among all of us.

856
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,550
You're too loud.

857
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,280
- I was the quietest.
- You're sitting close to me.

858
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,110
- You don't have to be that loud.
- Should I whisper to you?

859
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,490
- Calm down.
- Gosh, seriously.

860
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,910
- Calm down.
- We're all wearing a microphone.

861
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,110
He's right. We need to stay calm.

862
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,620
Are we shooting an ASMR video?

863
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,560
- We need to stay cool.
- Speak quietly.

864
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,590
- What I'm saying is...
- In my opinion, in a case of...

865
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,820
- What I'm saying is...
- In my opinion...

866
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,390
(Turning their heads around)

867
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,440
- In a case of emergency...
- Poor Kwang Soo.

868
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,590
- Even Ailee cut him off too.
- She jumped in.

869
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,010
- She's really something.
- Let's hear her out.

870
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,940
- She's not an easy fight.
- I want to hear her out.

871
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,570
- In a case of emergency...
- I want to hear her out too.

872
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,550
Let's say I'm meeting my boyfriend,

873
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,780
and we got into an accident.

874
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,280
And my boyfriend is unconscious.

875
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,910
- I have to call his parents,
- Of course.

876
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,190
but I don't have their numbers.

877
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,190
I need to know the password
to unlock his phone...

878
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,960
- and call his parents.
- Exactly.

879
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,730
- That can't be an excuse.
- That's...

880
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,490
- an extreme case.
- Wouldn't you call his parents?

881
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,890
- You should call the rescue center.
- Exactly.

882
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,770
Listen to me.
People have their own ways...

883
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,130
of interpreting when they read
text messages.

884
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,390
- That's right.
- Therefore,

885
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,130
- even some meaningless texts...
- Exactly.

886
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,860
- can cause a misunderstanding.
- It can cause a misunderstanding.

887
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,810
- Such misunderstandings...
- You don't have to read them.

888
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
But what if you read some texts
unintentionally?

889
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,280
- Let's say your girlfriend...
- Yes?

890
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,450
or your boyfriend wants you two
to share each other's password.

891
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,880
- If my girlfriend wants that? No.
- Yes.

892
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,640
Then would you break up with her
even though you love her?

893
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,880
- He wouldn't break up with her.
- I would convince her...

894
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,110
and ask why she wants to
look through my phone.

895
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,190
Just tell me your password, Se Chan.

896
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,820
Once you unlock my phone,
we're over.

897
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,800
- All right. Just tell me.
- If you trust her...

898
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,090
If you look through my phone,
we're over.

899
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,120
Sure. I'll let you go.
Just tell me your password.

900
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,740
- You said you'll let me go.
- Yes.

901
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,890
I said I won't
look through your phone.

902
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,900
("We're over if you go through it"
versus "Just tell me your password")

903
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,780
(It's as if they are the only people
that exist in this place.)

904
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,370
(They won't stop arguing
as if they're a real couple.)

905
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,710
(Se Chan is
running out of patience.)

906
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,220
- Just tell me your password.
- Then why do you need it?

907
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,110
- You said you won't see it.
- Look at him. He's getting upset.

908
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,220
- You said you won't see it.
- He's getting upset.

909
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,880
(He's getting extremely upset.)

910
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,350
- He's getting upset.
- I won't.

911
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,850
Se Chan. Gosh.

912
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,820
- Sit down.
- You said you won't see it.

913
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,730
- You just said you won't see it.
- Calm him down.

914
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,300
- I mean, you said you won't see it.
- Calm down.

915
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,500
(Se Chan took off his shoes
as he got angry.)

916
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,200
(I won't look through your phone,
but give me your password.)

917
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,000
- Calm down. Stop him.
- You said you won't see it.

918
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,310
- Then why do you need it?
- I mean...

919
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,040
- I know.
- He said he won't see it.

920
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,940
I just want to know
your password. That's all.

921
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,330
- Gosh. What else should I do?
- I just want to know the password.

922
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,900
- Sit down and drink some water.
- He won't look through your phone.

923
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,310
- He won't look through it.
- Gosh, I can't believe this.

924
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,020
I know. Just drink some water.

925
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,490
I won't, I promise. I want to set
my password the same as yours.

926
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,720
- In fact, this debate...
- Yes.

927
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,850
should be based on the premise...

928
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,150
that the couple will look through
each other's phone.

929
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,290
- It's only reasonable.
- No.

930
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,850
- There's no way you don't see it.
- That's not true.

931
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,000
- That's not possible.
- Why would you even ask for it?

932
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,230
I'm confident that I won't
look through the phone.

933
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,000
Based on the premise that they look
through each other's phone...

934
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,390
- I wouldn't look through the phone.
- That's not possible.

935
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,970
- How would that be possible?
- I wouldn't look through it.

936
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,160
You would become curious
if you know the password.

937
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,280
- That can start a fight.
- I can hold myself back.

938
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,540
(Arguing loudly)

939
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,840
- Listen to me.
- No way.

940
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,280
- Everyone, listen to me!
- You see...

941
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,550
(They stood up suddenly.)

942
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,480
- I mean...
- Calm down.

943
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,490
- See? Look at us.
- I wouldn't do that.

944
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,580
Talking about it alone
made us fight.

945
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,580
- Exactly.
- You should never share it.

946
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,990
There's nothing to fight over
if you don't know the password.

947
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,380
- If you share it...
- You can share the password...

948
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,760
without looking through the phone.

949
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,200
What we're saying is that it's okay
to share my password...

950
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,500
with the person I love...

951
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,240
- as a token of love.
- That's right.

952
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,400
It's okay.

953
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,010
- All right. Time is up.
- Oh, no.

954
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:34,600
The team that Chief Ji and I
have chosen as the winner...

955
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
of the first topic...

956
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
- You made the decision alone?
- about sharing passwords...

957
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,980
to a cell phone and
a messaging app...

958
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,070
They didn't even have a discussion.

959
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,690
- We should discuss first.
- Oh, right.

960
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,080
Didn't you two have a discussion?

961
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,460
I thought they agreed...

962
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,760
- Okay?
- Yes, I agree with you,

963
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,120
but this is very unpleasant.

964
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,230
I mean, I agree with you, but...

965
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,560
- That's all that matters.
- I agree, but...

966
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,000
- I knew that.
- I admit...

967
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,090
- I agree with him.
- We have the same opinion.

968
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,800
- They have a better chance to win.
- The first topic...

969
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,510
about sharing passwords.
1, 2, 3.

970
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,740
- Not Okay.
- Oh, yes.

971
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,740
(The MCs picked Not Okay.)

972
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,810
- Nice.
- Good job.

973
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,370
(Team Asia won the 1st round.)

974
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,370
- I admit they were right.
- Good job.

975
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,370
This is great.

976
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:11,480
- You see...
- It was a difficult topic.

977
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,050
- It was so difficult.
- That's true.

978
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,220
We won.

979
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,080
Kwang Soo's team won
the first round.

980
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,290
- I'm glad he picked Not Okay.
- This is fun.

981
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,080
- Next topic.
- This is also a sensitive issue.

982
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,230
- Good job.
- This is fun.

983
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,920
Actually,

984
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,030
when we first read this topic,
we thought the same thing again.

985
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,120
We're leaning toward one side.

986
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,360
"Giving your jacket
to your girlfriend's friend..."

987
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,360
- "on a cold day."
- Just get to the point.

988
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,390
That's difficult.

989
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,830
Okay or Not Okay?

990
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,510
Not Okay!

991
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,510
(Not Okay!)

992
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,370
- It's not okay.
- What was the topic?

993
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,780
- It can never be okay.
- "Not long ago, I was..."

994
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,950
"drinking beer with my girlfriend
and her friend in the terrace."

995
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,720
"It became quite chilly
in the evening,"

996
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,490
"and my girlfriend's friend said
she was cold."

997
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,580
"I was wearing a jacket,"

998
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,080
"and I wasn't cold,
so I gave my jacket to her."

999
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,790
- He made a mistake.
- "While taking my girlfriend home,"

1000
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,990
"we started arguing."

1001
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,300
"My girlfriend got mad at me
saying she didn't understand..."

1002
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,320
"why I gave my jacket
to her friend."

1003
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,200
"I did it only because her friend
was cold."

1004
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,360
"Is it not okay to give my jacket
to my girlfriend's friend?"

1005
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,900
- Do you think it's not okay?
- That's excessive kindness.

1006
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,570
- He was being too kind.
- Many men don't know this.

1007
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,710
- Let's hear So Min's story.
- So Min looks angry already.

1008
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,770
- She's upset.
- She looks very angry.

1009
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,540
First of all,
I have a similar experience.

1010
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,170
If we just consider the situation
in this story,

1011
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,380
it depends on what kind of girl
the girlfriend's friend is...

1012
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,480
and her taste in men.

1013
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,090
If her friend is popular among guys,

1014
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,090
- she would be angry. However...
- I see.

1015
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,500
- However...
- That makes sense.

1016
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,590
- I see what she means.
- She has a point.

1017
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,960
- You see...
- It's very important.

1018
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,460
- Actually,
- That's a good point.

1019
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,130
I have a pretty friend. One day,
the three of us went to a karaoke.

1020
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,360
- I see what she means.
- But...

1021
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,230
my boyfriend sang the songs
my friend wanted to hear.

1022
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,380
- Of course, you'd get angry.
- He shouldn't have done that.

1023
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,940
We had a big fight
while he was walking me home.

1024
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,040
I see why you got angry.

1025
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,750
But my friend is really pretty
and popular.

1026
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,540
- That's what any men would do.
- She can attract a man...

1027
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,590
just by talking to him.

1028
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,980
It's so hard to figure out
what women want.

1029
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,190
When you give a girl flowers,
sometimes she's happy,

1030
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,560
but sometimes she gets mad at you.

1031
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,090
- What must I do to make her happy?
- Exactly.

1032
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,500
That's exactly my point.

1033
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,360
- You know what I mean, right?
- Whatever I do, she gets mad.

1034
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,690
I hope there will be a book
on this topic.

1035
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,230
Since we're talking about it,
can anyone share a story...

1036
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,210
about the worst person
you've ever dated?

1037
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,710
- Yiren, what about you?
- No.

1038
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,650
(She answered right away.)

1039
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,940
- Hold on. He wasn't even finished.
- That was quick.

1040
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,670
- She's an idol singer, you know.
- Yiren...

1041
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,110
She seemed like she was
ready to say no.

1042
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,560
- All idol singers react like that.
- Okay.

1043
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,960
- I accept your answer.
- Okay.

1044
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,790
Everyone, imagine a situation
where their roles are reversed.

1045
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,820
Let's say your friend joins you
when you're with your girlfriend.

1046
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,820
Your friend says he's cold.

1047
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,570
And your girlfriend takes off
her jacket...

1048
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,000
- The girl gives her jacket?
- and gives it to your friend.

1049
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,360
- The girl gives her jacket to him?
- Yes.

1050
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,960
- The girl...
- Imagine that situation.

1051
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,500
- If you consider...
- If you imagine that situation...

1052
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,540
Just as So Min explained,

1053
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,340
I wouldn't mind if it's Kwang Soo,
but I'd be mad if it's Jong Kook.

1054
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,170
(I wouldn't mind if it's Kwang Soo,
but I'd be mad if it's Jong Kook.)

1055
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,590
- Gosh. Why?
- I was looking at you two.

1056
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,880
- I thought I'd be okay with you,
- Exactly.

1057
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,290
but if it's Jong Kook,
it would bother me.

1058
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,290
That makes you upset.

1059
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,690
- That thought crossed my mind.
- Exactly.

1060
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,480
For example,

1061
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,090
you let Se Chan or Suk Jin
tag along on a date.

1062
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,400
And when he says he's cold, your
girlfriend gives him her jacket.

1063
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,230
You would think,
"My girlfriend is so kind."

1064
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,090
(My girlfriend is so kind.)

1065
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,400
- Exactly. You'd feel that way too.
- I see.

1066
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,840
- The same goes for you.
- Jae Suk.

1067
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,940
- The same goes for you.
- It's the same for him.

1068
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,710
- Yes.
- That would make you...

1069
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,340
love your girlfriend even more.

1070
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,110
In a situation like that...

1071
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,940
- If it's Suk Jin,
- "I'll be with her forever."

1072
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,610
I wouldn't mind
even if she wipes his mouth.

1073
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,090
That wouldn't bother me at all.

1074
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,480
- Whatever she does,
- But...

1075
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,650
I would only think she's kind.

1076
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,110
- Honestly,
- I agree.

1077
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,860
- I would love her even more.
- That makes sense.

1078
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,690
But I think I'd react differently.

1079
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,230
Let's say I'm with my girlfriend
and her friend.

1080
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,060
If her friend says she's cold,

1081
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,770
I would ask my girlfriend
if she's okay first.

1082
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,090
- That's so sweet.
- You should start dating!

1083
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,790
- I'm just saying...
- All he does is imagine...

1084
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,790
- dating a girl.
- Wouldn't anyone do that?

1085
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,500
- He knows everything about dating.
- Of course.

1086
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,000
- He's like a dating expert.
- Yes.

1087
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,900
You need to choose the side.
Ailee, pick one.

1088
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,380
- I'm nervous.
- It doesn't matter.

1089
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,940
- But the girl...
- It doesn't matter.

1090
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,940
- Okay.
- She picked Okay.

1091
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,110
- The other team is Not Okay.
- It's okay.

1092
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,690
- We got Not Okay.
- It's okay.

1093
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,360
- It's not okay.
- It's okay.

1094
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,460
I'm sure So Min will still
say it's not okay.

1095
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,590
He can give his girlfriend
his phone password after that.

1096
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,730
- That's right. It's okay.
- His phone password?

1097
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,290
- It's okay.
- This is crazy.

1098
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,460
(It's okay.)

1099
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,360
(She went back on her conviction
to win.)

1100
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,090
- It's okay.
- Why do you think so?

1101
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,360
- Is it okay?
- It's okay.

1102
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,810
- Please explain.
- I'll explain to you.

1103
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,210
When a man acts like that,

1104
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,840
he does it only to make
his girlfriend stand out.

1105
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,480
- He's right.
- To make her look good.

1106
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,820
- That's a good point.
- It shows that he has good manners.

1107
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,110
However, some girls...

1108
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,940
would think that he does it because
he likes her like So Min did.

1109
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,380
But there are many women
who hate it.

1110
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,730
- Yes, there are many.
- Kwang Soo.

1111
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,730
- You're polite and considerate.
- Right.

1112
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,730
- So that's what you do.
- It's an act of kindness.

1113
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,000
- I bet people misunderstood you.
- Right.

1114
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,130
- That's why you're against it.
- Of course.

1115
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,840
- If that's the case...
- With Kwang Soo...

1116
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,190
But this is what you do...

1117
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,770
out of the kindness of your heart.

1118
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,630
But this is her best friend.

1119
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,960
If...

1120
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,340
Darn. Truth be told,
I'm okay with it.

1121
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,270
(Darn. Truth be told,
I'm okay with it.)

1122
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,900
- What?
- It's okay.

1123
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,270
You need to be more persuasive.

1124
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,770
- I'm leaning toward them.
- You're not winning me over.

1125
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,190
You're fine with it too, right?

1126
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,750
Ji Hyo's okay with it too.

1127
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,560
- Let us make a decision then.
- We'll make our decision.

1128
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,380
Offering your jacket to
your girlfriend's best friend.

1129
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,520
Is it okay or not?

1130
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,320
- It's not.
- We've come to a verdict.

1131
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,190
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1132
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,670
You weren't able to persuade us.

1133
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,690
You weren't convincing enough.

1134
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,070
You weren't able to persuade us.

1135
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,070
- Well...
- We couldn't understand it either.

1136
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,210
- You're okay with it?
- You're only being polite.

1137
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,340
The girlfriend should be proud.

1138
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,570
(After the conclusion
of the following debate)

1139
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,170
Of course, it is.

1140
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,070
Team America who won
with a score of 2 to 1...

1141
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,940
will receive 20 dollars.

1142
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,650
(Team America wins!)

1143
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,750
So that's how it goes.

1144
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,150
Don't we get anything?

1145
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,650
What about us?

1146
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,190
You'll be rewarded too.

1147
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,060
This is your first
customs declaration process.

1148
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,420
Each team will take turns
entering that room.

1149
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,730
While in there,
you will choose one box.

1150
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,860
There are 10 boxes in total,
and 2 boxes each contain...

1151
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,110
20, 40, 60, 80, 100 dollars
respectively.

1152
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,900
Once you check the amount,
you'll bring it out...

1153
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,310
and pay up half of that money...

1154
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,170
- as tax.
- To us, right?

1155
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,110
You are allowed to write down...

1156
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,520
a smaller amount
than you should pay.

1157
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,820
Let's say you chose a box
with 100 dollars.

1158
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,320
You can lie...

1159
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,790
and only hand over 10 or 20 dollars.

1160
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,820
If you're caught in a lie,

1161
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,020
the customs agents
will take everything.

1162
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,650
- What if you're not caught?
- Then...

1163
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,020
the agents will pay
your tax for you,

1164
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,460
- and you'll take the full amount.
- If we don't catch them?

1165
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,360
If they choose to check...

1166
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,500
- even though I'm not lying...
- That's right.

1167
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,110
- Right.
- The agents...

1168
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,770
- will receive a penalty?
- They'll pay the tax instead.

1169
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,770
Got it.

1170
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,900
(The customs agents
must be cautious.)

1171
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,070
The team that lost will go first.

1172
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,270
These guys...

1173
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,250
- This isn't easy, you know.
- They could...

1174
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,040
try to trick us.

1175
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,980
- Okay.
- They'll think that we'll lie.

1176
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,590
- If we take the chance...
- It won't help us win.

1177
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,960
- This is driving me crazy.
- But we need to take a chance.

1178
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,060
What's best...

1179
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,560
is for us to pick 100 dollars...

1180
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,650
and pay up 10 dollars...

1181
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,460
- without them suspecting us.
- Right.

1182
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,820
Why won't they though?

1183
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,590
They would.

1184
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,840
Kangnam, pick one.

1185
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,790
- Should I just choose?
- A smaller amount is better.

1186
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,270
- Maybe 50 dollars.
- Just choose.

1187
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,540
Anything? Then I'll...

1188
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,810
- This one?
- Number four.

1189
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,880
Four...

1190
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,170
The choice is
20, 40, 60, 80, 100 dollars.

1191
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,480
Please...

1192
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,710
It's not too bad.

1193
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,340
(How much money did they get?)

1194
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,340
It's not too bad.

1195
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,840
They'll doubt us for sure especially
since Kwang Soo's the captain.

1196
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,650
(What will be Team Asia's strategy?)

1197
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:33,750
It's all about how much money
was in the box they chose.

1198
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,190
- Here they come.
- We're ready.

1199
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,320
(Confident)

1200
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,960
Ji Hyo, what's the amount?

1201
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,230
- Well...
- Look at their expressions.

1202
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,590
We picked our box.

1203
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,730
- Hand it over.
- Pay your tax.

1204
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,130
The box we chose had 40 dollars.

1205
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:51,940
- 40 dollars?
- Yes.

1206
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,610
- So you'll pay 20 dollars?
- Yes.

1207
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,750
(So you'll pay 20 dollars?)

1208
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,920
- There was a heated discussion.
- That's right.

1209
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,040
- Hold on.
- He's not the kind of person...

1210
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,090
to pay up 20 dollars
when all he has is 40 dollars.

1211
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,590
What?

1212
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,460
He'd only give up 20 dollars
if he had chosen 60.

1213
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,630
That's right.

1214
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,630
The rules say
he must cough up half.

1215
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,090
- But he wouldn't.
- Right.

1216
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,670
Yiren's too innocent...

1217
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,900
to bluff in any way.

1218
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,000
- How much was in the box?
- 30 dollars.

1219
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,340
- 30 dollars?
- 30 dollars?

1220
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,880
- Yet you're paying 20 dollars?
- No, 40 dollars!

1221
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,380
- Hold on.
- No, 40 dollars!

1222
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,570
(Flustered)

1223
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,520
(Scoffing)

1224
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,920
- We chose 40 dollars.
- Hold on.

1225
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,710
- No, 40 dollars.
- Wait a second.

1226
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,860
- 30 dollars?
- You chose 30 dollars,

1227
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,980
but you're paying up 20 dollars?

1228
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,480
I meant 40 dollars.

1229
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,750
She got confused
because of the Chinese word.

1230
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,250
He'd never pay up half.

1231
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,320
- Right?
- Of course not.

1232
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,500
Also, Kangnam's shaking.
Look at his fingers.

1233
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,570
- Let me be honest with you.
- Sure.

1234
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,770
You're absolutely right.

1235
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,130
(Jae Suk, you're absolutely right.)

1236
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,980
- 60 dollars was in our box.
- Right?

1237
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,040
But?

1238
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,320
We chose 60 dollars...

1239
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,320
- But you're only paying 20?
- Yes.

1240
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,440
- So you're lying to us.
- Yes.

1241
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,820
(Did Kwang Soo confess
to tax evasion?)

1242
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,060
- Hold on...
- Shouldn't you pay up half?

1243
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,380
He's playing mind games.

1244
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,560
He's trying to get us to confirm
what was in the box.

1245
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,820
(If Kwang Soo is wrongfully
suspected, he won't have to pay.)

1246
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,290
I think we should check.

1247
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,320
Can you give me your hand?

1248
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:22,900
This is Jong Kook's trick.

1249
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,920
Your palm is wet.

1250
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,190
(He can't hide
how sweaty his palm is.)

1251
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,570
My gosh.

1252
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,460
Don't do that.

1253
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,840
Don't you do that.

1254
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,840
(Jong Kook's lie detector test
is quite accurate.)

1255
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
- Don't.
- His palm is sweaty.

1256
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,650
It can't be wetter.

1257
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,040
But his expression...

1258
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,480
- Exactly.
- This is intriguing.

1259
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,650
- Maybe we shouldn't check.
- It's getting interesting.

1260
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,090
- We won't get much anyway.
- Exactly.

1261
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,560
So we won't check.

1262
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,690
(They've been cleared.)

1263
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,400
- We won't get much anyway.
- That's the right choice.

1264
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,750
There's not much to take anyway.

1265
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,290
20 dollars is more than enough.

1266
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,090
Okay, we won't check.

1267
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,000
I have a feeling that
So Min will choose well.

1268
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,940
- Really?
- Right, of course.

1269
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,770
- She's not the luckiest type but...
- Really?

1270
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,810
- Still. Just go ahead.
- Really? Let's get it.

1271
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,570
- Not that one.
- This is the number I like.

1272
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,940
- Really?
- I like this number.

1273
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,670
- What?
- Go ahead.

1274
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,610
It's all about
how much they pay up.

1275
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,170
- We...
- Yes?

1276
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,880
(We...)

1277
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,250
We chose 80 dollars.

1278
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,150
Let's get it!

1279
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,190
(Jong Kook claims that
his team chose 80 dollars.)

1280
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:21,480
So we'll cough up 40 dollars.

1281
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,320
- That much...
- Hold on.

1282
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,060
Why would we bother to check?

1283
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,290
I mean...

1284
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,400
If they're lying,
it means they chose 100 dollars.

1285
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,400
The highest amount
they can get is 100 dollars.

1286
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,860
Instead of 50, they paid up 40,
so that's a 10 dollar difference.

1287
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,940
They're only pocketing
10 more dollars.

1288
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,710
You'll go this far
for just 10 dollars?

1289
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,270
- So 40 dollars.
- 40 dollars?

1290
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,440
They must be telling the truth.

1291
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,210
- Right.
- That's what I think.

1292
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,610
We'll clear their team too.

1293
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,170
- Then...
- Did they fool us?

1294
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,920
Both captains will reveal
how much was in the box.

1295
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,610
In our case...

1296
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,040
(Team Asia already admitted
to tax evasion.)

1297
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,420
(So how much was
actually in the box?)

1298
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,880
Jae Suk was right on point.

1299
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,250
- Right.
- He saw right through us.

1300
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,960
(Jae Suk was right on point.)

1301
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,250
(What?)

1302
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,360
- How so?
- We chose 60 dollars,

1303
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,630
and I insisted
that we only pay up...

1304
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,730
20 dollars.

1305
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,190
(Kwang Soo insisted
that they pay 20 dollars less.)

1306
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,310
I knew it.

1307
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,570
- Right off the bat...
- Right from the start...

1308
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,540
- Jae Suk said...
- He said I was going to lie.

1309
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,210
Still, I asked my team
to believe in me this once.

1310
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,940
When Yiren said "30 dollars",

1311
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,310
it was the amount
you originally had to pay up.

1312
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,110
- That's right.
- I should've realized.

1313
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,980
- Goodness.
- You're good at deducting though.

1314
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,250
- I called it.
- What he said at first...

1315
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,610
- I told you his palms were sweaty.
- My palms...

1316
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,380
No one should be allowed
to check palms anymore!

1317
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,860
- Anyway, good job.
- Nice.

1318
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,730
- It went as planned.
- We won 20 dollars though.

1319
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,190
How much did you choose?
Was it 100 dollars?

1320
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,770
(Did Team America lie too?)

1321
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,900
(We...)

1322
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,070
- You told the truth, right?
- It was 80 dollars.

1323
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,130
Of course.

1324
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,270
(They made the right choice
not to check.)

1325
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,440
That's right.

1326
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,840
We played it safe.

1327
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,540
- We had enough.
- Team Asia...

1328
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,980
will receive four dollars...

1329
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,610
which brings its total
to 240 dollars.

1330
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,710
(After the first
customs declaration process)

1331
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,420
Team Customs won 60 dollars
which brings its total...

1332
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,090
- to 160 dollars.
- 160 dollars.

1333
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:56,520
Team America has 260 dollars.

1334
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,610
- Let's move on to the next mission.
- Sure!

1335
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,460
It wasn't enough
for us to take a chance.

1336
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,590
(They pay their taxes
and head to the second mission.)

1337
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,880
Are we supposed to untie these?

1338
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,460
(What are all these
tangled ropes for?)

1339
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,020
- I'm intrigued.
- This is the second mission.

1340
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,230
Why don't you explain the rules?

1341
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,770
Sorry?

1342
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:14,270
Chief Ji will take command
for once.

1343
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,670
- But I'm clueless.
- Finally.

1344
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:16,730
- Chief Ji?
- Chief Ji?

1345
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,130
Chief Ji doesn't know the rules.

1346
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,770
- He doesn't know the rules.
- Let me see.

1347
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,880
Two from each team will compete.

1348
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,420
- Two?
- Yes.

1349
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,420
After fastening your hands tight,

1350
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,190
you'll be looking for
the rope with the R sticker.

1351
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,460
The rope you choose...

1352
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,380
That's the sound of him giving up.

1353
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,790
No one told me the rules.

1354
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,420
That's the sound of him giving up.

1355
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,650
No one told me the rules.

1356
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,130
- Got it.
- This is new to him.

1357
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:41,790
Can you explain the rules instead?

1358
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,770
Do you see these?

1359
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,360
You will put these on your wrists.

1360
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,130
- On both wrists?
- Yes.

1361
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,960
There will be a space between them.

1362
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,230
You will then choose one rope...

1363
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,980
and keep pulling
until you reach the end.

1364
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,210
- Gosh.
- Because they're all tangled.

1365
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,500
No way.

1366
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,840
He sure is different, isn't he?

1367
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,190
- It's easy to understand.
- It sure is.

1368
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,040
That's because Suk Jin
is too much of an oldie.

1369
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,820
Suk Jin's still in the process
of learning.

1370
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,960
(His training never ends.)

1371
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,230
Shouldn't it be over by now?

1372
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,690
- It's taking too long.
- He's still an intern.

1373
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,560
He dreams of being
a show host one day.

1374
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,730
You can learn something
from this moment.

1375
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,400
This is why you must always listen.

1376
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,190
I wasn't able to
because of my trip to the restroom.

1377
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,900
I see.

1378
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,230
Will two from each team
please step forward?

1379
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:24,630
Ailee, who do people say
you resemble?

1380
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,980
- Actress Kim Min Sun.
- Right.

1381
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,070
And Madam Hwang.

1382
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,340
(While talking about
Ailee's lookalikes...)

1383
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,440
Yes, I know who that is.

1384
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,270
(Gently)

1385
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,290
Thank you in advance.

1386
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,340
(Secretly)

1387
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,440
Was that a dollar?

1388
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,210
Thank you in advance.

1389
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,880
What...

1390
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,360
(Money is given discreetly.)

1391
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,480
Our team would appreciate the win.

1392
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,090
- How much did she give you?
- A dollar.

1393
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:49,730
(It's to get on your good side.)

1394
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,130
(Of course.)

1395
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:52,360
- Seriously.
- Got it.

1396
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,610
- It's our money, right?
- Right.

1397
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,630
(Mr. Ji makes sure
he's a part of the cut.)

1398
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,040
The other team...

1399
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,400
- We were given a dollar.
- They gave us a dollar.

1400
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,670
I don't know. It just came our way.

1401
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,920
- Kwang Soo...
- Kwang Soo,

1402
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,090
is it okay with the other team
giving us some money?

1403
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,520
What don't you come over here?

1404
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,590
- What? Who gave you what?
- Come over here.

1405
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:12,750
We're just telling you
what happened.

1406
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,480
- A dollar...
- We were given a dollar.

1407
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,820
- What...
- The other team gave them a dollar.

1408
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,650
- What?
- It was to bribe them...

1409
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,000
- Why bother though?
- The customs agents...

1410
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,770
We'll reconsider
if you give us two dollars.

1411
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,840
- If you think about it...
- The yellow one seems better.

1412
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,630
- There's no use.
- Okay, let's play the game then.

1413
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,860
Fine, go ahead.

1414
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,500
(Embarrassed)

1415
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,210
(Would the lobbying
have made a difference?)

1416
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,480
The yellow one seems better
since it stands out.

1417
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,170
- All right.
- The ladies will go first.

1418
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,750
Good luck!

1419
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:39,820
- Get ready.
- You've got this.

1420
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,210
- You can do this!
- So Min took off her shoes.

1421
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,440
But I'll still probably
be the worst.

1422
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,920
- They could get stomped on.
- Ready, get set...

1423
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,090
(Start.)

1424
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,630
Good job.

1425
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,480
- Ailee is fast.
- You have to go into the knot.

1426
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:53,150
- You don't have to be in a rush.
- You can move slowly here.

1427
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,190
You have to untangle it.

1428
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,400
- Do it slowly.
- Go inside. Go in between it.

1429
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,340
Go slowly.

1430
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,400
- It's so tangled.
- So Min, that's not right.

1431
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,340
- That's right.
- You have to go inside.

1432
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,400
- Go in. That's right.
- Hey!

1433
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,860
You have to go inside the knot.

1434
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,110
- Go in. That's right.
- Hey!

1435
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,880
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo
goes into the knot.)

1436
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,980
This is so heavy.

1437
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,610
Ji Hyo, show us your skills.

1438
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,150
She's calm. Ji Hyo's calm.

1439
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,610
- Look at Ailee.
- You have to push.

1440
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,750
Ji Hyo isn't even making a sound.

1441
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,610
Ailee, you need to go inside.

1442
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,150
- You have to go inside.
- Look at So Min.

1443
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,060
- You have to go inside.
- Where is So Min going?

1444
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,480
- Where are you going, So Min?
- Hey, So Min!

1445
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,090
- I can't go in for mine.
- Look at So Min.

1446
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,730
You have to go inside.

1447
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,190
- Where are you going, So Min?
- Hey, So Min!

1448
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,820
So Min.

1449
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,570
Why are you putting her
on your shoulders?

1450
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,690
I have to go in.

1451
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:33,090
Move. I have to go in.

1452
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,170
(I have to go in.)

1453
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,310
Hey, So Min...

1454
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,610
What is she doing?

1455
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,070
What's wrong with her?

1456
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,170
(They're shocked at the tiger moth
bulldozer who only moves forward.)

1457
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,570
- What's wrong with her?
- Hey.

1458
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:43,900
- So Min.
- I have to go in.

1459
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,320
I have to go in this way.

1460
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,980
We have to go in together.

1461
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,210
Please!

1462
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,920
Ailee is strong.

1463
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,980
- Ailee...
- Look at Ailee.

1464
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,730
- Ailee is strong.
- She's really strong.

1465
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:55,860
Ji Hyo is also...

1466
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,250
- Hold on!
- Ji Hyo is also...

1467
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,560
(Pushing)

1468
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,360
Good job, Ailee!

1469
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,090
- Look at Ailee.
- You have to push.

1470
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,130
You guys are so mean!

1471
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:08,130
- Ailee is good.
- Keep going, Ailee!

1472
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:09,710
- The blue one.
- Where?

1473
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,340
(Ailee moves forward
with her Korean-American power.)

1474
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,110
Ailee is done!

1475
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,170
I'm okay.

1476
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,500
I don't care. I just need to get in.

1477
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,150
- What are you saying, So Min?
- Are you doing okay?

1478
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,940
I thought she was done!

1479
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,270
Why are you just going in?

1480
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,790
- What is she doing?
- What are you doing?

1481
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,020
- What is she doing?
- You can't go in like that.

1482
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,060
- I have to go in.
- What is she doing?

1483
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,250
Why do you keep locking
yourself in?

1484
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,820
Ji Hyo, tie So Min up.

1485
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,860
- I have to go in.
- What?

1486
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,860
So Min acts like she's good,
but she's really bad at it.

1487
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,000
She acts like she's good,

1488
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
- but she's really bad.
- Hold on!

1489
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,360
- Ailee is good.
- What's the point if she's good?

1490
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,190
- So Min needs to come out to win.
- Ailee.

1491
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:40,840
Ji Hyo, this is a game that
we can't lose.

1492
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,540
She's pretty much
at the starting point still.

1493
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,840
- Where...
- We can't lose even if we want to.

1494
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:49,500
You can go slowly.

1495
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:50,980
You just need to go in and come out.

1496
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,110
Ailee is almost out.

1497
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,210
(Keep going, Ailee!)

1498
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:55,790
- She's finally out.
- Look at Ailee.

1499
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,090
(Ailee squeezes out
the last of her energy.)

1500
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:58,190
You need to move faster!

1501
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,290
(Yiren is almost out too.)

1502
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,880
- She's finally out.
- Look at Ailee.

1503
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:03,630
You need to move faster!

1504
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,860
(Rolling)

1505
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,090
Ailee.

1506
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,250
You have to keep going.

1507
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,460
Look at Ailee.

1508
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,900
Why did you roll all of a sudden?

1509
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,040
Take your leg out.

1510
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,190
(She rolled forward out of nowhere
while trying to avoid Ailee.)

1511
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,460
Gosh, I'm so tired.

1512
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,540
This is...

1513
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,610
Just take it out like this.

1514
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:18,710
Take this part out.

1515
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,670
- Hold on.
- She's on your team, So Min.

1516
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:21,880
Ailee is on your team.

1517
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,150
Go in now.

1518
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,940
- No!
- You're there!

1519
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,070
- No!
- Yes!

1520
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,070
- Ailee's out.
- She's done.

1521
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,690
Ailee's done.

1522
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,250
Ailee's in first place.

1523
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,090
Ailee is amazing.

1524
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:34,610
- You guys just need to come out.
- I'm so tired!

1525
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,250
- This is incredible!
- She's out.

1526
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,400
(Yiren from Team Asia arrives next.)

1527
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,420
- Hey!
- Come on!

1528
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,000
Even though Ailee got out,
we can't lose.

1529
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,090
What's going on?

1530
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:44,520
Yiren can't go in.

1531
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,670
So Min, what are you doing?

1532
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:46,840
Hey, So Min!

1533
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,610
It's So Min versus Ji Hyo.

1534
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,070
- What is she doing?
- So Min!

1535
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,480
Don't let her go.

1536
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,480
You got it. Just go forward.

1537
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,310
- So Min. You got it.
- Stop!

1538
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,150
You just need to go under the gray.
Then you're done.

1539
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,270
You're done.

1540
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:59,520
(She does her best to crawl out.)

1541
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,980
Don't worry about her.

1542
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,440
- Hey!
- Come on!

1543
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,610
You're so cool!

1544
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,420
(Ji Hyo has one last knot.)

1545
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,730
(So Min arrives.)

1546
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,590
This was exhausting.

1547
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:12,750
You were almost to the end.

1548
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:13,750
You are able to escape it.

1549
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,690
You guys were great.

1550
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:16,790
(The customs agents
are happy for them.)

1551
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,090
Let's give them a round of applause.

1552
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:20,860
What kind of game is this?

1553
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,440
This is a great cardio exercise.

1554
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,400
(In Round 2, Team Asia just enjoyed
the cardio and lost.)

1555
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,500
Kwang Soo, I'm sorry.

1556
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,610
(Team America takes the final win!)

1557
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:32,710
Kwang Soo, that wasn't right.

1558
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,340
It wasn't going to work.
It all tangled here.

1559
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,440
(Covered in sweat)

1560
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
We lost.

1561
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,860
This was funny.

1562
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,380
Team America has won this round too.

1563
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,480
- Team America.
- We lost everything.

1564
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,060
- Captain America.
- Team Asia keeps losing.

1565
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,290
- I know.
- What's going on?

1566
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,090
This fight was... Gosh.

1567
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:48,150
(The 2nd customs declaration
process is coming.)

1568
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:49,920
(Team Asia will start off...)

1569
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,070
(the 2nd customs declaration process
because they lost.)

1570
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,170
I think they're going to
check ours this time.

1571
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:57,270
- I agree. They'll check ours.
- Right?

1572
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,310
They will.

1573
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,980
Did 60 and 80 dollars get
taken out? Or...

1574
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,400
One of each was taken out,

1575
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,880
- but there's one of each left.
- One of each is left?

1576
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,320
Chief Ji,
we have to be organized.

1577
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,020
We have to go with our gut,
not be organized.

1578
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,690
- We have to be organized.
- It's not our first day on the job.

1579
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,290
We have to go with how we feel,
our gut.

1580
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,130
They're here.

1581
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,590
(Will they be able to catch them?)

1582
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,150
- How much did you make?
- How much did you make?

1583
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,170
We picked 80 dollars.

1584
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,270
- 80 dollars?
- Yes.

1585
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,940
Then they're telling the truth.

1586
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,690
- They must be telling the truth.
- They could be.

1587
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,790
We really got 80 dollars.

1588
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,130
We got 80,
so we need to give them 40.

1589
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,670
- Right.
- It's better not to check..

1590
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:34,710
- Yiren.
- Yes?

1591
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:35,980
How much did you get?

1592
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,150
80 dollars.

1593
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,520
(Stiff)

1594
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,540
- She practiced this time.
- Her smile...

1595
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,710
Her smile is awkward.

1596
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,480
- I always smile like this.
- Her smile was always awkward.

1597
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,340
She can't smile widely.

1598
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,420
Yiren got some training in there.

1599
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,960
- That's right.
- Mental training.

1600
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,520
Why are you all standing
with your hands together?

1601
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,520
"Mental training".

1602
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,730
Did you commit a crime?

1603
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:52,960
- You're right.
- Hey.

1604
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,400
Hold on. Let's calculate.

1605
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,190
- You're calculating something?
- Hold on.

1606
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,590
- You're calculating?
- What's going on?

1607
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,810
Please take a step to the side.

1608
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,860
We analyze charts here.

1609
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,480
You haven't gotten
anything right until now.

1610
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,500
He majored in Statistics.

1611
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,670
- Look. We have to consider this.
- Okay.

1612
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,670
That is...

1613
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,500
- Explain it to me.
- They gave us 40 and 20 dollars.

1614
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,250
I'm the director.
You should take your hand off me.

1615
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,480
My gosh. Just do it, you punk.
You're a junior...

1616
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,980
- from my neighborhood.
- This is a bit...

1617
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,980
Before you became my director,
you were my junior.

1618
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,820
You guys are at work.
You're working right now.

1619
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,090
You can't do this at work.

1620
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,290
I can rest my arm
if it feels heavy.

1621
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:24,360
- Even still.
- Continue.

1622
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,400
You shouldn't do this.

1623
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,150
Take a look.

1624
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,960
When it's 50-50,

1625
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,020
they wouldn't give us 40 dollars...

1626
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,730
if they got 40 or 20 dollars.

1627
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,270
- Right.
- Do you understand?

1628
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,440
We have to be realistic and think
that they got 80 or 100 dollars.

1629
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,000
- Right.
- Right.

1630
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,810
(They paid 40 dollars in tax.)

1631
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,250
- Isn't that obvious?
- That's obvious.

1632
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,400
Why are you saying the obvious?

1633
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,250
Why bother analyzing
the charts then?

1634
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,040
- Why bother? That's obvious.
- My gosh.

1635
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,420
- Those are the rules.
- That's... It could be 100.

1636
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,150
I'm telling you the probability
because of this.

1637
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,420
He's saying the same thing again.

1638
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,150
- Why are you repeating yourself?
- Why are you doing that?

1639
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,250
You said the same thing four times.

1640
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,290
At least change your tone of voice.

1641
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,320
Did you major in Statistics?

1642
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,360
No.

1643
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,320
If you didn't, why are you speaking?

1644
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,090
- Did you major in Statistics?
- If not, why are you speaking?

1645
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:06,170
He didn't either.

1646
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,290
Okay.

1647
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,440
Ji Hyo is smiling so comfortably.

1648
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,860
I'll ask you once again.
How much did you bring?

1649
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,250
- 80 dollars.
- Stop lying!

1650
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,400
(Stop lying!)

1651
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,320
- What are you doing?
- How dare you...

1652
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,710
- How dare you lie to me?
- How can...

1653
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,420
What's wrong with
this customs agent?

1654
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,920
How dare you lie to me?

1655
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,460
- Should we open it?
- Should we open it or not?

1656
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,710
Should we open it? Are you smiling?

1657
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:28,860
- Are you smiling?
- Are you smiling?

1658
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,130
- Are you smiling?
- Do we look funny to you?

1659
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,130
- Are you smiling?
- Should we open it or not?

1660
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,590
Don't be like this
and just ask Jong Kook.

1661
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,290
Jong Kook will tell you what to do.

1662
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:37,690
Come here.

1663
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,500
- Let's just go with our gut.
- Okay.

1664
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,090
(Let's go with our gut.)

1665
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,730
- Let's do this.
- Even if they lied...

1666
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:44,270
- Let's mark it,
- Right.

1667
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:46,130
- If it falls.
- and if it falls this way...

1668
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,540
- Let's do it.
- If it falls, you can pass.

1669
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,840
If you were going to do this,
why did you talk about statistics?

1670
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,270
We did this often back in the day.

1671
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,270
- Back in the day.
- It was "Go clubbing or go home."

1672
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,770
We did this to decide
whether or not to go clubbing.

1673
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:55,820
This is it.

1674
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:57,380
If this side comes up we'll check,

1675
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,480
and if this side comes up,
they can pass.

1676
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,090
Ready, start.

1677
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,630
(The last method chosen by
the two customs agents)

1678
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:05,150
Ready, start.

1679
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:07,730
(Will they inspect Team Asia,
or will they let them go?)

1680
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,130
- We have to let them pass.
- It's best 2 out of 3.

1681
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,840
(It's best 2 out of 3.)

1682
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,500
- In the end...
- What was the point of this then?

1683
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,500
Just decide.

1684
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,230
- We should do it again.
- What are you doing?

1685
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:19,230
- Hey.
- We did this back then too.

1686
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,610
- They've already decided.
- One more time.

1687
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:21,980
- They've already decided.
- They've already decided.

1688
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,110
They're both curious.

1689
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,110
I'm so curious.

1690
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:25,170
(The results of the second time
is also pass.)

1691
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,750
- One more time.
- One more time.

1692
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,170
- You said 2 out of three.
- It's until it's what they want.

1693
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:30,040
We did this when
we wanted to go clubbing.

1694
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:31,590
Hold on.

1695
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,980
- The same answer keeps coming out.
- This is weird.

1696
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,750
Just open it then!

1697
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,190
Open it!

1698
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,690
If you're going to open it
anyway, why are you doing this?

1699
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:39,960
- Okay.
- Did you...

1700
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,230
see their faces?

1701
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,400
You should've studied their faces.

1702
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,070
When you said you would open it,

1703
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,360
Ji Hyo smiled.

1704
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,730
- Really?
- Yes, she did.

1705
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:49,070
- Then let's not open it.
- Let's not open it.

1706
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,070
- We're not opening it.
- I can't...

1707
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:51,770
stand to see them smile.

1708
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,070
(Thanks to Ji Hyo's smile, Team Asia
passes through Customs.)

1709
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,900
- They're not opening it, right?
- They decided against it.

1710
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,170
They decided not to open it,
and the other team can go now.

1711
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,040
(Did Team Asia win with
a psychological strategy?)

1712
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,480
- Goodness.
- There was a low probability.

1713
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,250
- You're right.
- There was a low probability.

1714
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,820
- We have to consider probability.
- Right.

1715
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,820
It wasn't likely.

1716
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,380
What are they doing?

1717
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:13,420
(We're so excited!)

1718
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,090
Did you do all of that
to get 10 dollars?

1719
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,130
(Is this a ceremony for
successfully evading taxes?)

1720
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,170
Okay.

1721
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,500
Did you do all of that
to get 10 dollars?

1722
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,170
- We kept a good poker face.
- You're right.

1723
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,170
They're coming out.

1724
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:28,500
You have to check their faces.

1725
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,710
(It's Team America's turn for
the customs declaration process.)

1726
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,150
Their aura is...

1727
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,420
Did you choose well?

1728
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,190
We picked 80 dollars,

1729
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,610
so we will give you 40.

1730
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:37,690
We picked 80 dollars,

1731
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,610
(Did they pick 80 dollars too?)

1732
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:40,650
This is the most confusing number.

1733
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,150
The most confusing number...

1734
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,480
is 40 dollars.
80 dollars and 40 dollars.

1735
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,000
- This is...
- This declaration...

1736
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,750
- Hold on.
- This is for real.

1737
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,920
- 80 dollars is...
- No.

1738
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,920
- No, it's...
- You each chose this?

1739
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,590
Didn't you choose 80 dollars before
and give us 40?

1740
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:52,630
- No.
- One of us is lying.

1741
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:53,790
They chose the last remaining
80 dollars?

1742
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:54,840
In the previous round.

1743
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,110
- We're telling you the truth.
- We are.

1744
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,500
Was there another 80 dollars left?

1745
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,670
There were 2 boxes each
for 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 dollars.

1746
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,400
- There are 2 of each.
- There are 2 of each.

1747
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,900
- There were 10.
- If they're telling the truth,

1748
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,980
that means we had 100 dollars.

1749
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:06,480
- Or...
- What?

1750
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:09,320
Or maybe they're trying to trick us
because they have...

1751
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,750
- plenty of money.
- No.

1752
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:13,420
He's so funny.

1753
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,920
If they got a small amount of money,
would they...

1754
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,230
Is there a problem
if we paid a lot...

1755
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,420
- when we chose a small amount?
- Out of the 10...

1756
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,190
- What if we win like that?
- What?

1757
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,790
- What if we pay a lot of taxes...
- It's the same thing.

1758
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,520
even though we chose
a small amount?

1759
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:24,400
We only know about our duties
as customs agents.

1760
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,570
Right. That's why I'm asking.

1761
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,500
(We only know about our duties
as customs agents.)

1762
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,770
- It's not that.
- Stay quiet.

1763
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:31,130
- Don't say anything.
- What's wrong with that?

1764
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,900
- What will happen?
- Would we pay 40...

1765
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,500
- when we chose 40?
- What if we chose a small amount...

1766
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,940
- I'm the one in charge, so...
- Okay.

1767
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,040
You said we paid a lot
despite choosing a small amount.

1768
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,750
Look. We chose 40 dollars,

1769
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,340
but we paid 40 dollars.
How would that benefit us?

1770
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,590
We have to catch someone.

1771
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:44,320
We haven't caught anyone
in 30 years.

1772
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,210
(We haven't caught anyone
in 30 years.)

1773
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,590
They are too timid.

1774
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,650
Let's go.
Let's decide by this method.

1775
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:51,290
- Let's go.
- There they go again.

1776
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,790
- There they go again.
- What was the point of analysis?

1777
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,770
- We will decide by this method.
- They are too unprofessional.

1778
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,020
Bring it here.

1779
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,360
I want to check the boxes.

1780
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,900
- If we check...
- It's the result we wanted.

1781
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,110
(The slip finally allows them
to check the boxes.)

1782
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:04,500
- We will open the boxes.
- Okay.

1783
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,000
Both captains will open the boxes.

1784
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,400
- Kwang Soo, go first.
- Okay.

1785
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,400
Say it out loud in a cool way.

1786
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,380
We paid up 40 dollars.
The amount we had gotten was...

1787
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,540
We paid up 40 dollars.

1788
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,610
The amount we had gotten was...

1789
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,310
(The customs agents didn't check
their box.)

1790
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,620
- 100 dollars.
- Come on!

1791
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,450
(Team Asia got
a box containing 100 dollars.)

1792
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,020
For goodness' sake.

1793
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,520
I said we should check.

1794
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,540
Let's spin.

1795
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,620
(They won 10 dollars
by paying 40 dollars in tax!)

1796
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,980
- Yes!
- Yes!

1797
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,080
- Okay.
- We did it.

1798
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,520
- There is one more box to check.
- Okay.

1799
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,750
Jong Kook, open the box.

1800
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,890
As for us,

1801
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,500
- we got 80 dollars twice in a row.
- Really?

1802
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,640
Stop it!

1803
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,770
(Team America
gets their box checked.)

1804
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,140
Did you really get 80 dollars?

1805
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,500
- Stop it.
- We actually didn't get 80 dollars.

1806
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,980
- What?
- Did they get 100 dollars?

1807
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,710
(They finally succeed to catch
the tax evaders.)

1808
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:01,250
- So what's the result?
- We are leading.

1809
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,640
- Are we leading?
- We did it after 30 years.

1810
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:06,140
- We finally caught them.
- We caught them.

1811
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,020
- We did it to be funny.
- That's right.

1812
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,410
- We knew this would happen.
- We did it to be funny.

1813
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:10,830
We did it to be funny.

1814
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,290
- We caught the tax evaders.
- They suddenly moved up.

1815
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,390
Now, the teams are neck-and-neck.

1816
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,700
They did a good job.

1817
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,600
- Team Customs has 310 dollars.
- Really?

1818
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,960
(Team Customs has 310 dollars.)

1819
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,100
Kwang Soo's Team Asia has
300 dollars.

1820
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,100
(Team Asia has 300 dollars.)

1821
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,810
Team America has 270 dollars.

1822
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,310
- My goodness.
- It's okay.

1823
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,710
- We are at number one.
- It's not too bad.

1824
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,270
- We are at number 1.
- It's a difference of 10 dollars.

1825
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:33,270
We can do it.

1826
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,210
Let's move for the final mission.

1827
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,370
- Yes.
- Okay!

1828
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,410
(What will be the result
of the final race?)

1829
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,350
This place is incredible.

1830
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:43,350
- Is it an amusement park?
- This is incredible.

1831
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,930
When else
would we visit a place like this?

1832
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,250
This is what Running Man is about.

1833
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:49,850
What... What is that?

1834
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,790
- What? What is that?
- What is that?

1835
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,290
- What is that?
- What is that?

1836
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,290
It's Kwang Soo.

1837
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:57,430
(The strange-looking thing is
Kwang Soo.)

1838
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:58,460
Hey.

1839
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,910
I was so startled.

1840
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,210
- There are so many strange things.
- Right?

1841
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:02,910
- How fascinating!
- What is that?

1842
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,350
Is that his back hair?

1843
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,640
- Hold on.
- What is that?

1844
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,210
- Is that his back hair?
- What is that?

1845
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,410
Wasn't he wearing a wig?

1846
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,710
- It's his real hair.
- Really?

1847
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,450
- It's his real hair.
- I don't know what to do with them.

1848
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:13,980
- They are so annoying.
- There are so many strange things.

1849
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,460
If we go on, he will hit us.
We need to stop.

1850
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,930
- Everyone.
- Yes?

1851
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,930
It's time for the final race.

1852
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:24,770
The final race is called
the Fiery Trade War.

1853
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:25,960
(The Fiery Trade War)

1854
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,600
All three teams
including Team Customs...

1855
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,200
will participate
in this Name Tag Elimination.

1856
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,560
Each team will wait
at their respective headquarters.

1857
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:36,040
Two people from each team
will enter the race...

1858
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,250
and participate
in Name Tag Elimination.

1859
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,350
Thus, it will be 2-on-2-on-2.

1860
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:43,180
When one member gets eliminated,
another one will enter the race.

1861
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,810
(The rankings will be determined
by the order of total elimination.)

1862
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:47,250
Since Team Customs doesn't have
enough members,

1863
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,890
Jae Suk and Suk Jin will have
two lives each.

1864
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:49,890
(The members of Team Customs
can be resurrected once.)

1865
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,790
Throughout the set,

1866
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:54,890
you will find slips that are
the size of your palm.

1867
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,850
They are the trade blockade cards.

1868
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,200
You can cover one-fourth
of a certain member's name tag...

1869
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,290
if you find one.

1870
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,700
That's important.

1871
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:07,100
That means up to three fourth
of the adhesive can be covered.

1872
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,910
That would be helpful.

1873
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:10,540
In accordance with the rankings,

1874
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:13,210
the teams will get
50, 30, or 10 dollars respectively.

1875
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:16,910
We will also give you 10 dollars
for every name tag you remove.

1876
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:19,210
(10 dollars will be given
for every name tag removed.)

1877
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,410
- The name tags you remove.
- So it's an individual game.

1878
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,060
- No, no. It's a team game.
- I see.

1879
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:25,520
Don't be like that.

1880
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,350
He wants to betray us.

1881
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,700
- Seriously.
- No, no. I am sorry.

1882
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,700
- He wants to be on his own.
- No, no.

1883
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,370
- I am sorry. It's not like that.
- He always has that wish.

1884
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,370
Please move to your headquarters.

1885
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:37,770
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1886
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,000
Let's discuss things
once we get there.

1887
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:42,770
- We are at a disadvantage.
- Strangely, I think we will win.

1888
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,540
We are at a disadvantage.

1889
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,100
Life is all about overcoming
the disadvantages.

1890
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,870
We can't win against five people.

1891
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,180
Why can't we do that?

1892
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,640
There will only be two people
from each team.

1893
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:53,710
There will only be two people
from each team.

1894
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,810
- That's right.
- But other members are in the race.

1895
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,410
We are in the race too.

1896
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,430
For goodness' sake.

1897
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:01,330
Why would you be so timid
when we are in the race too?

1898
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,370
I will rip off
the female members' name tags.

1899
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,270
(He makes up his mind
to attack the younger women.)

1900
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:08,890
Three teams are entering, right?

1901
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,640
It would be best...

1902
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,870
to keep the other teams wondering...

1903
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,910
if they should form an alliance.

1904
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:18,210
If I enter the race first,
the other two teams will team up.

1905
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,710
- That's right.
- Let's not focus on...

1906
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,620
- placing first.
- Okay.

1907
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,910
- Let's just avoid placing last.
- That's good.

1908
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:24,910
The penalty involves staying behind
for an additional shoot.

1909
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,810
- It's the worst.
- Really?

1910
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:28,810
"Let's place second."

1911
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:29,810
- All right.
- Okay.

1912
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,520
- Let's place 2nd.
- Let's place 2nd.

1913
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,520
Okay.

1914
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,160
(The order of participation
for each team)

1915
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,460
The race starts.

1916
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,700
(Team Customs, Team Asia,
Team America)

1917
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,200
(Team Customs begins to move.)

1918
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,160
There must be a card here.

1919
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,960
(They look
for the trade blockade cards.)

1920
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,230
(They find a trade blockade card
on the wall.)

1921
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,180
It's on the wall.

1922
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,230
Suk Jin, go get it.

1923
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,600
(Chief Ji
attempts to get the card.)

1924
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,600
- How do I do this?
- Give it a try.

1925
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:55,680
My goodness.

1926
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,810
- My goodness.
- I can't believe him.

1927
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,640
Hey.

1928
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,710
- What is up with this?
- Are you kidding me?

1929
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,160
Are you kidding me?

1930
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:05,350
(Jumping)

1931
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,460
Why... Why can't you do it?

1932
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,660
- It's working.
- Give it a try.

1933
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,370
Give it a try.

1934
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,000
(He makes a fuss
as if someone is hindering him.)

1935
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,960
(Chief Ji continues
to fight against himself.)

1936
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,000
My goodness.

1937
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,270
What was that?

1938
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:21,000
Move. Hold tight. I will do it.

1939
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,770
- Hey.
- Move out of the way.

1940
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,270
(Chief Ji is panting
when he hasn't done anything.)

1941
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:26,080
- Do you think you can do it?
- Of course.

1942
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,020
- Hey.
- You shouldn't jump there!

1943
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,540
Do you think you can do it?

1944
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,910
(He disrupts the rhythm.)

1945
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,350
- I jumped because you did.
- Wait over there.

1946
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,180
Can you do it?

1947
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,290
(After shooing away Suk Jin,
he resumes jumping.)

1948
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,000
(He catches it.)

1949
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,700
(They finally get
the first trade blockade card.)

1950
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,370
Jong Kook. Kim Jong Kook.

1951
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:54,770
(One-fourth of Jong Kook's name tag
gets covered.)

1952
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,100
I wish someone would do that to me.

1953
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,980
I wish someone would think
that I am formidable.

1954
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,310
It's okay. I will make sure
people don't touch my name tag.

1955
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,620
- It should be here somewhere.
- It must be on the wall.

1956
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:05,620
Do you see it?

1957
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,890
It's over there.

1958
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,350
(They find
another trade blockade card.)

1959
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,080
Go up there.
I will be on the lookout.

1960
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,960
For goodness' sake.

1961
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,160
Go up there.

1962
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,290
The lookout duty is important.

1963
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,500
It's quite hard
to go up the climbing wall.

1964
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,890
I can't do it.
Ji Jin Hee is good at it.

1965
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:20,370
Why are you talking about
Ji Jin Hee so suddenly?

1966
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,390
Ji Jin Hee is an expert.

1967
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,160
(Jae Suk begins to climb up.)

1968
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,960
I will support you.

1969
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,640
Let go.

1970
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,640
(There are two team members,)

1971
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,450
(but Jae Suk seems to be doing
all the hard work.)

1972
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:35,520
You got it. You are good.

1973
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,540
(Suk Jin cheers him on soullessly.)

1974
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,020
- That's good.
- Okay.

1975
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:40,210
All right. Let's use it
on Kwang Soo.

1976
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,560
Kwang Soo.

1977
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,710
(They cover
a portion of Kwang Soo's name tag.)

1978
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:44,790
Kwang Soo, someone used
a trade blockade card on you.

1979
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:48,060
- Me?
- Okay, okay.

1980
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,890
Why did they use it on me
instead of Jong Kook?

1981
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,770
You should go in there
and rip off their name tags.

1982
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,640
You should do it.

1983
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,140
I have never gotten
my name tag ripped off.

1984
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,100
I don't know the taste of it.

1985
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,330
- The taste.
- I don't know it.

1986
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,710
- Thus, you should do it.
- It's a bit sweet.

1987
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:03,870
It's tasty.

1988
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,080
Listen.

1989
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,600
Kwang Soo.

1990
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,870
Okay, okay.

1991
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,520
Two more trade blockade cards
have been used on you.

1992
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,620
- Two?
- It's over.

1993
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,790
It's over.
You should go in there last.

1994
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,020
It's over.

1995
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:15,020
(Three parts of his name tag
get covered.)

1996
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:17,620
- It will come off so easily.
- This is just wrong.

1997
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,830
Do you know what's fascinating?

1998
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,890
For the first time,
I can see the name tag on my back.

1999
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:22,100
(For the first time,
I can see the name tag on my back.)

2000
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:24,350
I can see the name tag on my back.

2001
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,370
It's the 1st time in 10 years.

2002
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,000
- Hold on.
- Jae Suk.

2003
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,890
- Who used another card on me?
- Again?

2004
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,210
What is going on?

2005
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,710
Three cards have been used
on Jae Suk.

2006
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:33,870
Finish him off.

2007
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:35,370
Eliminate Jae Suk first.

2008
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,100
What should I do?
Why is everyone attacking me?

2009
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:41,210
It will come off if I flick it.

2010
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:44,120
Suk Jin, come here.
We should look for more cards.

2011
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:45,450
This is bad.

2012
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,480
(They hurriedly try to find
more trade blockade cards.)

2013
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:48,910
- Where is Suk Jin?
- He is here.

2014
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:52,180
Word on the street is that
your name tag is about to come off.

2015
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:54,930
(Team America's target is Jae Suk
with the flimsy name tag.)

2016
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,960
(Seizing each other up)

2017
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,390
- Let's go.
- Go on your way.

2018
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,870
- We will go on our way too.
- Go ahead.

2019
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:00,960
(At that moment)

2020
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,700
(I will rip off
the female members' name tags.)

2021
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,210
(Chief Ji gets to work.)

2022
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:06,910
I will rip off
the female members' name tags.

2023
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:08,540
Hold on.

2024
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,310
(Team Customs makes
a sudden attack.)

2025
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,680
Hold on.

2026
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,950
Go, go! That's right!

2027
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,080
Haha! Haha got caught!

2028
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,080
- Who caught them?
- Both of them got caught.

2029
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,310
- Suk Jin and Jae Suk.
- He is out. Oh, he isn't out yet.

2030
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,160
This is good.

2031
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:24,460
Go downstairs.

2032
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,230
Ji Hyo and Yiren, go downstairs.

2033
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:29,460
(Ji Hyo and Yiren try
to attack them from behind.)

2034
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,960
Suk Jin, Ji Hyo is coming!

2035
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,270
Ji Hyo.

2036
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:34,500
(It suddenly becomes a 3-way match.)

2037
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,700
Hold on.

2038
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:37,330
- Rip it off!
- Rip it off!

2039
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:40,040
- Rip it off!
- Rip it off!

2040
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,810
(At that moment,)

2041
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:44,770
(Ji Hyo reaches
for Jae Suk's flimsy name tag.)

2042
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,640
Be careful.

2043
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,250
Be careful!

2044
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,270
- Rip it off!
- No!

2045
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,520
(At that moment,)

2046
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,080
(Haha spots a chance.)

2047
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:57,250
(Ji Hyo is out.)

2048
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:59,180
(Haha ripped off her name tag
while she was attacking Jae Suk.)

2049
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,580
Ji Hyo is out.

2050
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,560
(My goodness.)

2051
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,000
Let's go. Kangnam, get ready.

2052
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:07,270
- Another member will enter.
- Kangnam, go.

2053
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:09,290
- Kangnam, hang in there.
- Get Jae Suk.

2054
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:10,770
Be careful
because Haha could backstab you.

2055
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,040
Where is Yiren?

2056
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,710
- That's good.
- Our team is doing well.

2057
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:15,930
Haha got one.

2058
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,080
Haha.

2059
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,810
Hold on.

2060
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:21,270
(Everyone is confused
by the change of members.)

2061
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,350
(Suk Jin attacks Ailee
for the 2nd time.)

2062
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:23,540
What? Jae Suk!

2063
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,210
(It's time for Suk Jin
to do his job!)

2064
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,410
- What?
- Jae Suk!

2065
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,710
All right, all right. Stop.

2066
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:30,980
(Is she grabbing him by his collar?)

2067
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,180
- All right, all right. Stop.
- Haha.

2068
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,830
(Ailee takes on Suk Jin
with one hand.)

2069
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:37,790
- All right, all right. Stop.
- Haha.

2070
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:39,100
(While Suk Jin is restricting
Ailee,)

2071
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,660
(Team Customs takes on Haha.)

2072
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:44,060
- Hold on.
- Rip off his name tag!

2073
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,560
- Rip off his name tag!
- Hey, hey.

2074
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,830
- Get Jae Suk.
- Rip off his name tag.

2075
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,310
- Get Jae Suk.
- We got Haha.

2076
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:51,810
(While they're holding
each other...)

2077
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:54,140
- Get Jae Suk.
- We got Haha.

2078
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,710
(Yiren attacks from behind.)

2079
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,180
(Ripping)

2080
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,250
(What? Did Yiren get Suk Jin?)

2081
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,120
- What was that?
- Okay!

2082
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:06,930
(Yiren's quick and well-aimed attack
was successful.)

2083
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,200
(Yiren beat a member
with 10 years of experience.)

2084
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,750
Yiren, rip it off! Nice!

2085
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,790
- Rip it off!
- Good job, Yiren.

2086
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:14,160
Good job, Yiren.

2087
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,460
(Team Asia gets 10 dollars,
and Suk Jin loses 1 life.)

2088
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:17,000
Yiren.

2089
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,830
Suk Jin, you need to enter
the headquarters for a second.

2090
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:20,140
I can't believe him.

2091
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,270
I just...

2092
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,980
Why did you do something so useless?

2093
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:24,430
(He tried to take on Ailee
and failed.)

2094
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,550
- Let's get Jae Suk.
- I am sorry.

2095
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:27,800
Let's get Jae Suk. I am serious.

2096
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,310
- Let's get Jae Suk.
- I promise.

2097
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,340
- I am serious. I promise.
- Okay, okay.

2098
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,510
I promise.

2099
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,950
(However,)

2100
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,010
(he pretended to shake her hand
and attacked her!)

2101
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:37,310
Haha, you are a piece of trash!

2102
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:39,680
Seriously.

2103
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:41,660
That little...

2104
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:43,390
I can't believe him!

2105
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:44,550
(The bitter taste of betrayal)

2106
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:46,590
Haha! I can't believe you!

2107
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,930
- You bully!
- This is...

2108
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,040
This is how it is.

2109
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,890
This is just ridiculous.

2110
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,230
He ripped off Yiren's name tag.
Yiren is out.

2111
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:54,370
- All right.
- Okay.

2112
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:56,430
- That's good.
- Hold on.

2113
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:57,770
What are they doing?

2114
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:59,840
- They need to take out Kangnam.
- Right this instant,

2115
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,080
- they need to take out Kangnam.
- That's right.

2116
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,310
I am disappointed.

2117
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:04,580
"I am disappointed."

2118
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,180
They need to get him no matter what.

2119
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,810
Let's go. Let's rip off
Kangnam's name tag.

2120
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:10,790
- Kangnam. He is alone.
- Let's get him while he is alone.

2121
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:11,980
I need to run away.

2122
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:13,260
(He runs away.)

2123
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,800
(They begin to chase after him.)

2124
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,700
(Kangnam runs as far as he can.)

2125
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,370
It's a dead-end.

2126
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:23,540
Kangnam, don't overexert yourself.

2127
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,300
(Kangnam is cornered.)

2128
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,710
(What should I do now?)

2129
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,470
- You can push me and run away.
- What?

2130
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,840
- Gosh.
- I have a suggestion.

2131
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,710
Let's rip off Jae Suk's name tag.

2132
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,620
Let's team up...

2133
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:38,290
- and rip off Jae Suk's name tag.
- Do you mean it?

2134
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:40,250
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

2135
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,850
- Copy. Okay.
- Do you mean it?

2136
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:42,920
- It's done.
- He's over there.

2137
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,420
- Do you promise?
- We put a stamp.

2138
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,520
- It's real.
- So it's real.

2139
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,130
What? What?

2140
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:51,090
(Se Chan attempts
to make a surprise attack.)

2141
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,000
Come here! We need to be together.

2142
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,000
Rip off Ailee's name tag.

2143
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:58,510
Come on up.

2144
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,870
Come on up. Hurry.

2145
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:04,430
Go, go, go. There you go. Haha!

2146
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,800
(He is super excited.)

2147
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,600
Hold on. I got her.

2148
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,770
I got him!

2149
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:09,810
(Ailee uses her super Saiyan mode.)

2150
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:10,970
Ailee is too strong!

2151
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:12,920
Ailee is too strong!

2152
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,620
(Haha and Kangnam
has a 1-on-1 match.)

2153
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:16,790
Haha!

2154
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,330
(They grab each other's name tag
at the same time.)

2155
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,550
(Who will rip off
the name tag first?)

2156
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:25,130
(Haha ripped it off first!)

2157
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,420
I ripped it off!

2158
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,890
I ripped it off first!

2159
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,130
(After Ji Hyo and Yiren,
Kangnam is out!)

2160
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:31,090
Haha, my name tag is
about to come off!

2161
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,670
(Ailee is subduing Se Chan.)

2162
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:36,270
(I am sorry
that I couldn't save you.)

2163
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,710
(Trapping)

2164
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,170
(A seatbelt to elimination)

2165
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,880
It's too dangerous.
It's too dangerous. Hold on.

2166
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:48,260
(Let's just go. It will be hard
to place 2nd.)

2167
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,090
His name tag is barely hanging on.

2168
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,520
Leave, you punk.

2169
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,720
(Se Chan is out.)

2170
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,000
Good work.

2171
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,590
(Haha and Ailee are invincible.)

2172
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:58,170
Ailee is doing all the work today.

2173
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:00,170
She is so strong.

2174
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,370
(Kangnam and Se Chan are out.)

2175
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:05,170
- Kwang Soo, I am sorry.
- Did he get eliminated?

2176
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:06,470
(Oh, my goodness.)

2177
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,170
- Did he get eliminated already?
- He did.

2178
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,100
Kwang Soo,
you are the only one left.

2179
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:13,250
- They should have waited.
- But...

2180
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,600
(His name tag is about to come off.)

2181
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,810
Am I the only one left?

2182
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:20,010
(They walk proudly.)

2183
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,120
Ailee, look at the camera.

2184
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:24,920
(Full of confidence)

2185
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,460
Haha took out Se Chan as well.

2186
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,920
(Haha took out Se Chan as well.)

2187
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,200
- What is up with Haha today?
- Today,

2188
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,920
we might just win.

2189
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,090
Ailee!

2190
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,670
(The invincible duo's ceremony)

2191
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,470
- Team America!
- Yes!

2192
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:39,760
(Team America is leading
by a landslide.)

2193
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:42,540
- Se Chan and Kangnam are out.
- Are both of them out?

2194
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,140
- In this situation,
- What should we do?

2195
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:47,050
we need to take out the weak team.
You know what I mean, right?

2196
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,720
- That way, we will place second.
- That's right.

2197
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,770
We have no choice.

2198
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,480
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes.

2199
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,840
We don't need to team up
with the weak team.

2200
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,420
When I am with Ailee,
I have no fear.

2201
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,660
She isn't the type to get scared.

2202
01:11:57,790 --> 01:11:59,590
Ailee is too scary.

2203
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,260
(Kwang Soo heads over
to the teams.)

2204
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,960
Where are they? Where are they?

2205
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:07,520
- Hold on.
- How is it going to be?

2206
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,170
Shall we get rid of him?

2207
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,430
Firstly...

2208
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,760
You will attack us, right?

2209
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,060
- We will attack Kwang Soo.
- Me?

2210
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,230
I want to have
another member enter the race.

2211
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:17,410
- Kwang Soo.
- Hurry up.

2212
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,080
- Let's hurry up and take him out.
- All right. Let's go.

2213
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:20,710
Hey, hey!

2214
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:21,880
(They attack Suk Jin instead.)

2215
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,950
(The invincible duo
goes after Suk Jin.)

2216
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,920
- Hey!
- Jae Suk!

2217
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,920
(He quickly comes back.)

2218
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,920
My goodness.

2219
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,330
(If he gets eliminated again,
he will be out for good.)

2220
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,660
My goodness.

2221
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:37,330
(Ailee ripped off
Suk Jin's name tag.)

2222
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:38,970
- For goodness' sake.
- Suk Jin is out.

2223
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:41,130
Why did you run off like that?

2224
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,370
(They have earned 50 dollars
so far.)

2225
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:44,470
For goodness' sake.

2226
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:47,370
He doesn't help me in any way.

2227
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,470
- For goodness' sake.
- He doesn't help me in any way.

2228
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,100
Didn't you know
that they would backstab us?

2229
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,250
- Ailee is so funny.
- Why did you run off?

2230
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,170
- You should have taken cover.
- I am exhausted.

2231
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,550
I am exhausted.

2232
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:00,810
This is not fun, you guys.

2233
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:01,850
(The viewer at the VIP seat
becomes excited.)

2234
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,260
- What is it?
- What is it?

2235
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:05,630
- They got Suk Jin!
- What?

2236
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:07,330
Our team is the best.

2237
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,390
Haha is really good.

2238
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,800
He is good at betraying.

2239
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,020
(Haha is good at betraying.)

2240
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,020
Kwang Soo, let's place second.

2241
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,840
(Kwang Soo runs away diligently.)

2242
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,800
I am exhausted. I am exhausted.

2243
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,080
This is not fun, you guys.

2244
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,170
(Careful)

2245
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:27,250
(Kwang Soo aims to make
a surprise attack.)

2246
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:30,470
(The members don't know
what's going on.)

2247
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:33,550
(Will Kwang Soo's surprise attack
be successful??)

2248
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,920
(Attacking)

2249
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,500
(He tries to figure out
what's going on.)

2250
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:45,720
For goodness' sake.

2251
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,830
(It was the next door.)

2252
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,200
(Reality hits him hard.)

2253
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,540
I almost messed it up.

2254
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,430
My heart is beating so fast.

2255
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:58,340
(My goodness.)

2256
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,770
I just lost my fighting spirit.

2257
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:04,920
(He carefully opens the door
and goes outside.)

2258
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,090
(They are gone already.)

2259
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,790
How many name tags did we remove?

2260
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,310
Ailee, take me out.

2261
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:12,920
It will give us 10 dollars.

2262
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,330
There are too many members
who haven't gone yet.

2263
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,800
(Team America hasn't replaced
a single member.)

2264
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,960
Take me out.

2265
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,520
- Okay.
- 10 dollars.

2266
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:21,420
Let's switch.

2267
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,500
Take them on with Ailee.

2268
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:25,560
(Joon goes in and Haha goes out.)

2269
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,510
Is Haha out? Is Haha out?

2270
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:30,300
I should have ripped off
someone's name tag earlier.

2271
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,510
Joon is waiting. Joon.

2272
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:35,310
(Haha goes back to the headquarters,
and Ailee is left alone.)

2273
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:38,550
(Kwang Soo appears before Ailee.)

2274
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,550
(Upon seeing that Ailee was alone,)

2275
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:43,590
(he charged toward her.)

2276
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,220
- Hey! Hey!
- You need to go now.

2277
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,830
- You need to go now.
- Do I need to go now?

2278
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:51,090
Where is the exit?
Which way do I go?

2279
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,260
(Kwang Soo takes on Ailee.)

2280
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,090
(Laughing)

2281
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,170
(Kwang Soo attacks
with desperation,)

2282
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,430
(but Ailee just laughs.)

2283
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,430
(Struggling)

2284
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:06,580
(I give up.)

2285
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:10,120
(He runs away without looking back.)

2286
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,550
- He is running away.
- He is running away.

2287
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,590
Ailee is laughing at him.

2288
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:14,680
(I feel bad for Kwang Soo.)

2289
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:18,120
(He realizes that he is no match
and runs away at full speed.)

2290
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,050
Ailee is alone now.

2291
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,020
Her arms didn't come off.

2292
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,260
(How could she be so strong?)

2293
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,420
(He renews his resolution
and tries for the 2nd time.)

2294
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,700
Joon, you need to hurry up.
Kwang Soo is coming again.

2295
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:31,470
(Joon just got into the elevator.)

2296
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:34,760
(It's a golden opportunity
for Kwang Soo.)

2297
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:39,010
(Kwang Soo does his best
to remove the name tag.)

2298
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,710
The elevator is too slow.

2299
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:44,920
(Ailee is losing strength.)

2300
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,810
(At that moment,)

2301
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,120
(Jae Suk surprises him...)

2302
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,880
(and rips off the name tag.)

2303
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,520
(While he was focused
on Ailee's name tag,)

2304
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,700
Kwang Soo's name tag came off!

2305
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,560
(Jae Suk quickly removed
his name tag.)

2306
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,090
(But the fight has just begun!)

2307
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:04,130
Hey!

2308
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:05,600
(Joon finally arrives and joins in.)

2309
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,970
(Jae Suk lies on the ground
and holds them off.)

2310
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,230
Joon. Pull him up.

2311
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,470
- Is Kwang Soo's name tag removed?
- Yes, it is.

2312
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:13,670
(It seems too hard to hold off
a 2-on-1 attack.)

2313
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:14,670
Rip it off.

2314
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,720
(Jae Suk rips off her name tag
when she lets her guard down.)

2315
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:18,750
- Your name tag has been removed.
- Is Ailee out?

2316
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:20,140
It's okay. It is.

2317
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,220
Ailee is out.

2318
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,660
(Ailee did a great job,
and she's finally out.)

2319
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,850
(Until the next member comes out,
they can hold out 1-on-1.)

2320
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:25,920
Okay.

2321
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,830
(Jae Suk has 3 trade blockade cards
on his back.)

2322
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,060
(He secured 2nd place,)

2323
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,260
(but he must rip off the name tag
and get the money to win.)

2324
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:36,970
They're coming!

2325
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:38,040
I'm alone, so...

2326
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,670
They're coming! Behind you!

2327
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,430
(Team America's next player is...)

2328
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,210
- It's Jong Kook!
- What?

2329
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:44,970
Hey. Get him!

2330
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:46,170
Why did you tell him?

2331
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:48,010
Why did you...

2332
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:50,450
(Jae Suk's name tag is hanging
by a thread as he waits his chance.)

2333
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:51,950
Hold on. Okay.

2334
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,120
I got him.

2335
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,290
I got him. Joon.

2336
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,790
(When Jong Kook has him and Joon
is about to rip his name tag off...)

2337
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:58,160
- Let go.
- Rip it off.

2338
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,180
(He avoided him.)

2339
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,350
Rip it off.

2340
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,890
You have to rip it off.

2341
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:05,420
Grab it and rip it off.

2342
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,390
(His name tag gets ripped off.)

2343
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,340
- Grab it and rip it off.
- This is...

2344
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,540
Look at this.
Who put it on like this?

2345
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,600
This is...

2346
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,670
One more.
Jae Suk has another name tag.

2347
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:16,730
Okay.

2348
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,300
(Jae Suk put on
his second name tag.)

2349
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:23,770
(He holds onto a bit of hope as
he rubs his name tag on the wall.)

2350
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:25,790
I need Suk Jin to be here.

2351
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:26,880
He's over there.

2352
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,120
Just come over here.

2353
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:33,790
It's not going to be better
if you think about it.

2354
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,590
Just come here.

2355
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:38,350
(I have to die after I make
at least 10 dollars.)

2356
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:40,300
- I'll tell you one thing.
- What is it?

2357
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:42,260
Give up hope.

2358
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:43,840
Give up hope.

2359
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,170
(Destruction of hope)

2360
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:46,340
I'm sorry, but...

2361
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:48,600
- Wanting a dramatic ending is fine.
- But...

2362
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,170
Give up hope.

2363
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:51,670
(Booing)

2364
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,380
- Be careful.
- What do you mean?

2365
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,670
My gosh. I got you.

2366
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,720
I got you.

2367
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,450
(They've played this game
hundreds of times before,)

2368
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:58,680
(but he looks quite pathetic today.)

2369
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,290
Just come towards the back.

2370
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:01,310
(However)

2371
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,350
(Jae Suk isn't the type
to end things easily.)

2372
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,220
(The risk taker, Jae Suk,
grabs onto Joon's name tag.)

2373
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,850
(Whose name tag
will be ripped off first?)

2374
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:12,060
That's right. We got it.

2375
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:14,020
- We got it.
- Just come towards the back.

2376
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,300
(There wasn't an unexpected twist.)

2377
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,060
Jae Suk, you're out.

2378
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,210
I ripped it off first.

2379
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:20,370
We won by a hair.

2380
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:22,100
(Team America won the race.)

2381
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,130
Jae Suk.

2382
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:24,130
(You lost, but you fought well.)

2383
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,750
He ripped off Joon's name tag too.

2384
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,410
What is this? What about me?

2385
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:30,170
What about me?

2386
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:31,840
You're the princess.

2387
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:33,550
What is this?

2388
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:35,980
- Princess.
- I'm feeling good today too.

2389
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:38,980
I would've been able to just
rip everyone's name tags.

2390
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:41,760
That's too bad.

2391
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:44,090
I was so determined
I even changed my pants.

2392
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:49,260
First off, Yiren left first...

2393
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,560
- for her comeback showcase.
- Right.

2394
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:54,300
After we gave you 10 dollars
for every name tag you ripped off...

2395
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,040
and 50, 30, and 10 dollars
for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place,

2396
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:01,050
Team Customs,
who was in 1st place earlier,

2397
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:02,920
has a total of 360 dollars.

2398
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,550
- You have 360 dollars.
- We have 360 dollars?

2399
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:06,140
- Yes, you do.
- Okay.

2400
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,250
And Team Asia, who was in 2nd place,

2401
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:09,920
has a total of 320 dollars.

2402
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,620
- So we...
- We still...

2403
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,720
- It's a 40 dollar difference.
- Right, 40 dollars.

2404
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,980
Right. And Team America,
who was in last place...

2405
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:16,520
- We got this.
- We won.

2406
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,550
They have a total of 400 dollars.

2407
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:19,520
(Team America has a total of
400 dollars.)

2408
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,720
(Team America wins.)

2409
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,300
Nobody was eliminated.

2410
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,470
That's too bad.

2411
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:26,370
- So we...
- Two people will get the penalty.

2412
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:27,430
The penalty is...

2413
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,380
Do you see the rail above us?

2414
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:30,470
- Yes.
- Yes.

2415
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,550
- Yes.
- It's a zip coaster.

2416
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,880
You have to hang there
and fly down.

2417
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,920
(Today's punishment
is a zip coaster...)

2418
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,590
(which runs at a high speed
at a scary height.)

2419
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:42,460
- I can't. I'm afraid of heights.
- There's no bottom. You hang there.

2420
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,380
- It has no bottom?
- It doesn't. You just hang there.

2421
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,220
- I tried it, and it's scary.
- What about a rope?

2422
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,260
We'll draw lots for this one.

2423
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:49,460
Please choose one.

2424
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,550
It's two of us.

2425
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:52,060
Choose whichever one you want.

2426
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:53,970
- I'm nervous.
- I...

2427
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,260
Is this for real?

2428
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:57,560
Please show us what you chose
at the same time.

2429
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,630
- One.
- Do you want to trade?

2430
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,970
Two.

2431
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,370
Three.

2432
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:04,730
- Good luck.
- Okay.

2433
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:05,800
Good luck.

2434
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:07,770
It's all the way there?

2435
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,450
Kids these days are intense.

2436
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,050
It's really high.

2437
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:12,880
Go up.

2438
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,950
(Se Chan gets the penalty first.)

2439
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:15,010
What is this?

2440
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,010
(Completely nervous)

2441
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,380
It's so high up.

2442
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:19,760
This isn't right.

2443
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,290
If you fall while you go down,

2444
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:22,550
won't you break your butt?

2445
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,800
(We filmed with safety equipment and
the instruction of a safety guard.)

2446
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,170
Just sit back.

2447
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,730
(Taking a deep breath)

2448
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:33,600
(It's at a height where people feel
the most fear.)

2449
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,210
Hold on. When will you push me?
Hold on.

2450
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:37,510
Departing in 3, 2, 1.

2451
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:39,970
Hold on!

2452
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:43,220
Hold on!

2453
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:47,420
Hold on!

2454
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:49,850
(He exposes his ugliness.)

2455
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,090
(It's faster than he expected.)

2456
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,800
(Shaking)

2457
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:00,020
It's shaking so much!

2458
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:04,670
(Kangnam proceeds with
the penalty.)

2459
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,410
It's so fast!

2460
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:08,510
(Kangnam who was laughing
has disappeared.)

2461
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:10,580
This is so fast.

2462
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:16,510
(Thank you Joon Park, Kangnam,
Ailee, and Yiren for joining us.)

2463
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:17,880
(Suk Jin!)

2464
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,920
(Everyone in the Yoo family
has gathered in one place.)

2465
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,010
(The eldest, Jae Suk's family)

2466
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,090
(Kwang Soo, youngest son,
Jae Suk, eldest uncle)

2467
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:24,090
(Haha, eldest son)

2468
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:25,680
(The youngest, Jong Kook's family)

2469
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,760
(Ji Hyo, eldest daughter-in-law,
Suk Jin, eldest son)

2470
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,880
(Jong Kook, youngest Uncle)

2471
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,830
(The youngest, Jong Kook's family)

2472
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:32,260
(So Min, youngest daughter-in-law,
Se Chan, youngest son)

2473
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,090
(The Yoo family...)

2474
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:37,000
(has gathered together
for the holidays.)

2475
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:40,040
(At the shocking and
rebellious setting,)

2476
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:43,630
(the family has fallen apart.)

2477
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:46,210
(At that moment, they receive
a message from their late grandpa.)

2478
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:50,380
(Protect my eggs, but steal
one another's to make jeon.)

2479
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:52,250
(A war for the inheritance...)

2480
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,180
(between the two families regarding
Grandpa's memorial meal will start.)

2481
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:56,590
(The war of nerves between
the two families get fiercer.)

2482
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,550
(Which family will complete the meal
and get Grandpa's inheritance?)

2483
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:02,050
(Chuseok Family Race,
The Yoo Family's Inheritance War)
