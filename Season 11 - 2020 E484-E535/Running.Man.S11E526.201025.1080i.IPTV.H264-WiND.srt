1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,010
The leaves are turning red.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,850
(It's fall, the season of
fall men and women.)

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,920
You look like
you can never be a thief.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,980
It was my day off.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,460
It's not easy to work
with stupid guys.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,650
I'm his right-hand man?

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,090
How do you think we'll do today?

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,390
We all look great.

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,130
He's a human weapon.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,160
I'm a thief.

11
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,860
Why am I the right-hand man
of Petty Gang?

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,540
Of course,
you're the right-hand man.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,810
- Am I wrong?
- I'm a petty thief.

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,040
Hello.

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

16
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,000
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,680
- Who are you greeting?
- Pardon?

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,840
Are you saying hi to the air?

19
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,980
- Gosh, seriously.
- I think...

20
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,280
- he's immersed in his character.
- I think so too.

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,150
- There's no one here.
- What is he talking about?

22
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,560
This is role play
where there's no one else here.

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,230
What do you mean by that?

24
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,280
Even thieves must be polite.

25
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,700
- Hello, Chan Hee.
- Hello.

26
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,900
What are you doing?

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,160
Hello, sir.

28
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,160
- Hello.
- What's with his outfit?

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,230
I got confused about today's theme.

30
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,630
- You look great in this suit.
- And I dressed too casually.

31
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,410
I had to change my clothes
before the shoot.

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,310
He's wearing his stylist's jacket.

33
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,710
You look like one of those
hipsters at Hongdae.

34
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,680
- You think you're one of them?
- I dressed like a thief.

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,380
Suk Jin, are you going to
attend a funeral?

36
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,590
Hey.

37
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,680
- You look like...
- Suk Jin.

38
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,820
Can you give them
my condolence money for me?

39
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,760
- Are you going to attend a funeral?
- I'm...

40
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,730
- I'm a hero in black.
- What?

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,060
- Are you dressed as Tae Jin Ah?
- No, I'm a magician.

42
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,760
He pulled a dove out of his hat.

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,990
(Kwang Soo is his assistant.)

44
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,760
- Look.
- He can pull out a rabbit.

45
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,130
- What was that?
- You saw that, right?

46
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,460
I thought you were dressed
as Tae Jin Ah.

47
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,900
- The boss and the right-hand man?
- By the way...

48
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,650
Why am I the right-hand man
of Petty Gang?

49
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,400
- Are you the left-hand man?
- I mean, I'm powerful enough...

50
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,570
- to merge his gang into mine.
- That's ridiculous.

51
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,010
There are a lot of people
in my gang.

52
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,410
- Jae Suk is his senior comedian.
- Exactly.

53
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,010
Okay. Let's say...

54
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,880
that I'm the real power
of Petty Gang,

55
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,230
- and he's the boss with no power.
- No.

56
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,350
The person who looks best...

57
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,700
Jong Kook, are you
going somewhere...

58
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,870
to punish someone?

59
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,160
He looks so scary when he's just
wearing a black shirt.

60
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,840
- Are you going to beat someone up?
- Today...

61
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,400
I have some work to do.

62
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
- He looks so scary.
- Indeed.

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,310
- He looks really scary.
- He does look like a human weapon.

64
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,430
I have some work to do later.

65
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,940
- "Invader"? You dressed boring.
- He looks scary.

66
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,120
(Suk Jin is nitpicking
at everyone.)

67
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,920
- She doesn't look boring. You do.
- I don't look boring.

68
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,420
- You look most boring among us.
- She looks boring.

69
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,060
- She looks flashy.
- You're in no position to say that.

70
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,520
She doesn't look charismatic at all.

71
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,430
If you see the back, it's like
killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

72
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,090
- She's like a chameleon.
- Is this real leather?

73
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,390
2 birds with 1 stone?

74
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,560
(2 birds with 1 stone?)

75
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,430
She used a four-character idiom.

76
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,590
- Ji Hyo, have you been studying?
- No.

77
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,770
- Then how do you know that idiom?
- Of course, I know that.

78
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,370
I think she learned the idiom
while playing cards.

79
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,060
That's possible.

80
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,240
You mean, the online card game?

81
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,310
- So Min.
- Yes?

82
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,430
Isn't she too dressed up?

83
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,840
Your outfit is gorgeous,
but isn't it too much?

84
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,050
I stole this necklace.

85
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,110
- Really?
- You stole it?

86
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,150
It's stuck on my neck
because I'm a human magnet.

87
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,420
- It's a metal necklace.
- She actually stole it.

88
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,940
(He's trying to set her up.)

89
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,420
Today, you are...

90
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,750
criminals who committed crimes
in different areas of the country.

91
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,680
- I see.
- That's cool.

92
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,400
You were invited by the chairperson
of the Tomb Robbery Association.

93
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,520
- Because we're good at what we do.
- Exactly.

94
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,590
- The chairperson invited us?
- We have great abilities.

95
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,460
I rarely accept an invitation
like this.

96
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,640
To be exact, I'm amazing,
and Suk Jin is just okay.

97
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,240
No, it's the opposite.

98
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,560
- I'm much better than him.
- Mr. Amazing and Mr. Okay.

99
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,470
- Ji-kay and Yu-mazing.
- "Ji-kay"?

100
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,740
- I like that. Ji-kay sounds cool.
- Ji-kay.

101
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,650
- Ji-kay's so cool.
- Ji-kay's so cool.

102
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,920
- "Ji-kay's so cool."
- Cool.

103
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,180
- I like that.
- That suits him.

104
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,490
That's so cool.

105
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,650
- He likes it.
- He looks happy.

106
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,520
- Suk Jin likes it.
- He's happy with it.

107
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,750
- "Ji-kay's cool."
- He's even blushing.

108
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,060
- He'll mention it on his broadcast.
- "Ji-kay's cool."

109
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,990
- "Ji-kay's cool."
- "Ji-kay's cool."

110
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,930
The major crime that the chairperson
planned for today is...

111
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,430
- robbing a tomb.
- A tomb robbery?

112
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,460
- We have two guests to join you.
- Oh, we have guests.

113
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,900
- We have guests today.
- Let's meet our guests.

114
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,400
- Please come out.
- Who could they be?

115
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,500
I think they're over there.

116
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,240
- They're coming to rob a tomb.
- Who are they?

117
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,580
It's a motorcycle.

118
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,050
- They're on a motorcycle.
- Where?

119
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,310
No, it's an ATV.

120
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,340
- What's going on?
- Who is he?

121
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,590
- Oh, my.
- It's an ATV.

122
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,650
(This man is riding across the lawn
showing off his masculinity.)

123
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,920
- Who is he?
- What's going on?

124
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,150
- That's Lee Je Hoon.
- Oh, my.

125
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,490
- Hey, Je Hoon!
- Je Hoon.

126
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,120
- Wait. Oh, he's Je Hoon?
- Je Hoon.

127
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,430
That's Lee Je Hoon.

128
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,900
Hey, Je Hoon.

129
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,020
- That ATV...
- Did he steal that ATV as well?

130
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,190
(Who is he?)

131
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,170
Lee Je Hoon.

132
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,560
(Surprised)

133
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,810
She looks excited.

134
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,830
- You didn't know?
- Hi, Won Hee.

135
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,310
Didn't you know, So Min?

136
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,610
- So Min is surprised.
- Why?

137
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,570
So Min is so excited
that Je Hoon is here.

138
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,310
- Hello.
- It's been a long time.

139
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,780
(She gives a thumbs up only when
her favorite celebrity comes.)

140
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,810
So Min, look at him.

141
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,850
- He's glowing.
- Hi.

142
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,510
My, he's handsome.

143
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,320
(The next guest is showing up
amid raised expectations.)

144
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,360
That's Im Won Hee.

145
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,620
- Won Hee.
- Oh, my. Won Hee.

146
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,430
- Hi, Won Hee.
- It's been a while.

147
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,990
(Im Won Hee
with great screen presence)

148
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,060
We didn't order delivery food.

149
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,170
(We didn't order delivery food.)

150
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,330
His ATV looks...

151
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,060
- His ATV...
- Did he steal that ATV?

152
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,480
It's a type that you see
at tourist attractions.

153
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,240
He's acting so cool on it.

154
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,940
(Taken aback)

155
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,310
- Oh, no.
- I should've gone that way.

156
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,050
(He went the wrong way.)

157
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,220
Turn around.

158
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,880
(Won Hee turned his head
instead of the handle.)

159
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,180
(I'm going the wrong way.)

160
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,620
(He barely made his entrance
showing off his pitiful presence.)

161
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,290
- Won Hee.
- Won Hee.

162
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,230
Welcome, my dear Won Hee!

163
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,300
He's acquainted with Jong Kook.

164
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,560
(Jong Kook will help him
adapt to Running Man.)

165
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,690
- You're here, Won Hee.
- Hello.

166
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,600
Won Hee is here.

167
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,830
Hello.

168
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,760
- The star from "Dachimawa Lee".
- Won Hee.

169
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,570
- "You punks."
- You know...

170
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,830
I believe he doesn't need
any introduction.

171
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,000
I believe so too.

172
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,010
Gosh. These petty thieves
smelled the money.

173
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,480
- He has the vibe.
- Indeed.

174
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,580
- He's so handsome.
- He's glowing.

175
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,750
- As if he has a lamp inside of him.
- He's glowing. What did you say?

176
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,510
It's as if he has a lamp
inside his body.

177
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,030
So Min once said...

178
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,750
that Je Hoon who has plump lips...

179
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,320
- is her ideal type.
- Really?

180
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,120
- You...
- Who? Je Hoon?

181
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,990
(Her legs are wobbly.)

182
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,730
- You...
- Who? Je Hoon?

183
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,540
Why are your legs wobbly?

184
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
- I bet the information leaked.
- So Min said that.

185
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,910
I see why she...

186
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,670
That's not true.

187
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,370
- No wonder why she dressed up.
- I didn't realize...

188
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,850
- You knew he would be here, right?
- I bet she knew.

189
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,050
I really didn't know. I swear.

190
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,850
- I was really surprised.
- She's lying.

191
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,810
I always wanted to come back
on the show at least once...

192
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,220
- to redeem myself.
- You lost last time you were here.

193
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,060
- You must've been disappointed.
- Last time I was here,

194
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,750
I was covered in mud.

195
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,950
(Surprisingly, this is Je Hoon.)

196
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,390
Being covered in mud,
I felt so humiliated.

197
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,730
- I see.
- So...

198
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,530
- Right. I remember that.
- When he came on the show,

199
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,320
he gave me bad advice on stock
investment while hiding with me.

200
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,690
- Really?
- The stock price plunged.

201
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,500
- That's right.
- Really?

202
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,540
- I lost 30 percent.
- That's right. I heard that.

203
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,180
By the way, Won Hee,
how did the blind date go?

204
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,410
Oh, right. He went on a blind date.

205
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,440
- She seemed so cool.
- Do you keep in touch with her?

206
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,870
- They looked great together.
- I went on a blind date.

207
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,550
I'm not sure.
I haven't met her again since then.

208
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,850
- But maybe...
- So you two are staying in touch.

209
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,180
We'll see how things turn out.

210
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,380
I see. That's great.

211
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,950
- It's still going on.
- It's still going on.

212
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,360
Great. It's still going on.

213
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,120
- I don't know how it'll turn out.
- It's still going on.

214
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,320
He's still keeping in touch
with her.

215
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,950
Well, I haven't talked to her...
It'll work out somehow.

216
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,930
If he's not staying in touch
with her, it's not going on.

217
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,100
(Suk Jin has a point.)

218
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,870
- I mean, if he hasn't...
- Don't be like that, Suk Jin.

219
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,300
- You know I'm right.
- Still, he can have hope.

220
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,610
- Suk Jin, come on.
- You never know...

221
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,110
- what could happen between them.
- He should keep in touch with her.

222
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,670
- Suk Jin, don't say that.
- Exactly.

223
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,500
Won Hee thought he had a chance.

224
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Won Hee, I'm sorry.
But you should call her...

225
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,870
If you think about it
from a common-sense perspective...

226
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,720
- Won Hee, it's still going on.
- Won Hee...

227
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,550
Won Hee is covered
with gold accessories.

228
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,290
- I'm showing off my accessories.
- He's wearing so many rings.

229
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,580
- Look at his watches.
- Gold.

230
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,750
That's amazing.

231
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,420
Won Hee,
you might get metal poisoning.

232
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,430
Be careful not to get
metal poisoning.

233
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,880
By the way, Won Hee,

234
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,620
do you appear only
on SBS' variety shows?

235
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,430
I've been appearing
only on "My Little Old Boy".

236
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,760
Would you refuse any offers
from other networks?

237
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,890
- Yes, for now.
- Why?

238
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,740
I have to act in dramas and movies.

239
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,830
- He's just like Kwang Soo.
- I'm only on "My Little Old Boy".

240
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,930
- Only on "My Little Old Boy"?
- Yes.

241
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,500
- Kwang Soo appears only here.
- Exactly.

242
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,740
- I heard that.
- He didn't get any other offers.

243
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,870
- We're actors...
- Come on.

244
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,070
Why would you say such a thing?

245
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,870
(That's why we can see him
only on Running Man.)

246
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,940
Anyway, Won Hee and Je Hoon
are here.

247
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,850
Je Hoon came back on the show
after four years.

248
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,750
Let me ask about your roles
in your new movie.

249
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,730
Je Hoon, could you please
tell us about your role?

250
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,930
The role I played
in the movie "Collectors" is...

251
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,430
a genius tomb robber.

252
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,300
- You played a tomb robber.
- A genius robber.

253
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,870
My character is
the master of digging.

254
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,560
He's good at shoveling
and operating an excavator.

255
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,310
- He's also...
- Like Drill Man?

256
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,240
Today, it's...

257
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,870
Robber versus Robber:
Faceless King of Tomb Robbery.

258
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,370
You are criminals from different
areas in the country,

259
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,370
and you've been invited by
the chairperson...

260
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,140
of Tomb Robbery Association
who's planning to rob a tomb.

261
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,290
One of you is the chairperson
of the Tomb Robbery Association,

262
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,750
and there are two undercover
police officers among you.

263
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,390
- Police officers?
- Yes.

264
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,560
- Oh, wow.
- It'll be difficult.

265
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,320
There are 1 chairperson
and 2 police officers.

266
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Kwang Soo is suspicious.

267
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,320
(Is it me again?)

268
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,500
Kwang Soo...

269
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,360
Kwang Soo won't show any reaction.

270
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,830
Kwang Soo...

271
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,460
Kwang Soo, did you take up
one of the positions?

272
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,510
(Shuddering)

273
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,650
Is it you?

274
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,840
You must be a police officer.
Or the chairperson?

275
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,920
If Jong Kook suspects him now,
it's over.

276
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,780
- He's shaking.
- He won't be able to do anything.

277
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,180
(He'll be suspected
until the shoot ends.)

278
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,750
- It'll be stressful.
- If Jong Kook keeps an eye on him,

279
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,680
- he'll struggle to the last minute.
- Until the shoot ends.

280
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,060
The look on his face...

281
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,080
The 10 of you gathered
as the chairperson invited you,

282
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,800
but two of you don't
share the same goal.

283
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,930
You will be divided into two teams
to carry out the missions.

284
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,000
Also, you will rob a tomb
by yourselves.

285
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,230
You will receive different benefits
depending on the result of the game.

286
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,510
- What's "tomb"?
- I don't know either.

287
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,200
I'm sorry to interrupt.

288
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,230
Kwang Soo just asked me
what "tomb" is.

289
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,280
And he said, "I don't know either."

290
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,310
Do you mean we should be obedient?
What do you mean by that?

291
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,650
It means an old grave.

292
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,390
Oh, an old grave?

293
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,480
A grave?

294
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,710
So it means an old grave. I see.

295
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,950
(So it means an old grave. I see.)

296
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,850
(He didn't say anything
although he didn't know either.)

297
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,660
Don't say anything. That's better.

298
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,300
- It's best not to say anything.
- Absolutely.

299
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,270
- Don't say anything like he does.
- Just don't say anything.

300
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,630
No wonder why Se Chan
didn't show any reactions.

301
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,060
Each item you may find
in the tomb has its own price.

302
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,640
The price will be revealed
only to the individual.

303
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,830
(Only the total amount
will be revealed.)

304
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,100
The chairperson
and the police officers...

305
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,280
already know the prices
of the items.

306
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,920
- His pronunciation isn't so good.
- When you go in there,

307
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,710
- they will probably choose...
- Oh, my.

308
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,750
Bo Pil, do you know
what Won Hee just said?

309
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,050
He said,
"His pronunciation isn't so good."

310
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,560
(He tells him about his comment
right away!)

311
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,080
- I'm sorry.
- Don't talk like that about the PD.

312
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,310
"His pronunciation isn't so good."

313
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,130
How can you laugh
at his pronunciation?

314
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,850
His face turned red.

315
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,090
He practiced hard to say that.

316
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,320
I'm really sorry.

317
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,170
I guess it's because
you're wearing a mask.

318
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,670
Mask? It's because
he's wearing a mask?

319
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,540
- I'm sorry.
- You just say what you want.

320
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,910
He says anything he wants to.

321
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,100
Your face turned all red.

322
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,070
So the chairperson and the police...

323
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,780
- He's nervous.
- know the information.

324
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,110
So you should take a good look
at what everyone's bringing.

325
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,570
- What they're bringing?
- Yes.

326
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,050
- So...
- He's pretending he's listening.

327
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,980
He's already hurt by your comment.

328
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,980
- He's pretending he's listening.
- You shouldn't pretend.

329
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,760
You're pretending.

330
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,320
- I am listening.
- My goodness.

331
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,350
(Really listening)

332
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,690
Now we need to see how well
you can rob a tomb.

333
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,630
So we're going to test you
to see how good you are.

334
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,930
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

335
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,430
Please show it to them.

336
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,560
So they're testing us?

337
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,270
I'm sure I can do this
just by looking at it.

338
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,140
- You're right.
- A real robber...

339
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,730
- It's a piece of cake.
- just know what to steal.

340
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,930
Yes, it only takes a look.

341
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,550
- What is it?
- Oh, it's sand.

342
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,550
Okay!

343
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,250
This is an excavation site
of a historical site.

344
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,520
Among 15 potteries
buried under the sand,

345
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,520
there are 5 genuine ones
and 10 imitations.

346
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,580
Members who find the genuine ones...

347
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,350
will be given 1,000 dollars
for their mission.

348
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,930
- 1,000 dollars?
- Yes, 1,000 dollars.

349
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,450
- If we find genuine potteries?
- Yes.

350
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,090
After we decide
who goes in what order,

351
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,760
two members will do it at once.

352
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,170
- Each will get a brush.
- All right.

353
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,090
You have one minute to
find the potteries.

354
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,930
And if you find genuine potteries,
you'll get the money.

355
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,640
All right, I understand.
I can tell which ones are genuine.

356
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,730
Of course.

357
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,510
Robbers just know when they see it.

358
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,910
- They can tell.
- Sure.

359
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,340
You'll know if you just tap on it.

360
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,780
One more hint. The genuine potteries
don't have any patterns on them.

361
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,110
And the imitation ones
have Kwang Soo's face on them.

362
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,340
- Kwang Soo's face?
- My face?

363
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,180
Well, it's worth nothing.

364
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,260
- Why me?
- I should take it off.

365
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,350
On the imitation ones?

366
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,920
So they're imitations
of Lee Kwang Soo.

367
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,350
Maybe he has a role.

368
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,260
- Why else would his face be on it?
- Right. Lee Kwang Soo.

369
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,500
Now let's divide into groups of two.

370
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,130
I'll go with the thug.

371
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,030
- Okay.
- I'm going with the thug.

372
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,060
All right.

373
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,800
Then Je Hoon and Suk Jin
should team up.

374
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,360
- All right.
- You two are so different though.

375
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,540
(They're so different
but they will team up.)

376
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,930
He will make Je Hoon look good.

377
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,730
- I'm the only idiot.
- All right.

378
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,510
(I'm the only idiot?)

379
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,470
- What is he saying?
- Idiot? Who?

380
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,210
"I'm the only idiot"?

381
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,280
He wanted to say "Follow me".
But said it wrong.

382
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,420
- "I'm the only idiot".
- Really?

383
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,610
"I'm the only idiot"!

384
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,180
I wasn't sure
what he was talking about.

385
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,480
Well, I don't want to.

386
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,160
I guess he just said
what he was thinking.

387
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,180
He thought, "I'm the only idiot".

388
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,560
- He should've said, "Follow me."
- Yes.

389
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,630
"I'm the only idiot".

390
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,300
- So I'm teaming up with Won Hee.
- All right.

391
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,960
- And I'm with the petty thief.
- I'm going with Won Hee.

392
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,640
As a very smart robber, I think...

393
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,600
- Right.
- we should taste the sand.

394
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,470
- Yes.
- Taste the sand?

395
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,910
You really have to do that?

396
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,010
(Is he really
going to taste the sand?)

397
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,780
- Seriously?
- He's tasting it?

398
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,310
He's really going to play
the role like that?

399
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,810
My goodness.

400
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,110
There's a similar scene
in the movie.

401
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,420
Oh, there's a scene like that?

402
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,560
- Yes.
- Does he really taste it?

403
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,790
Yes, that way you know it.

404
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
This isn't it.

405
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,000
- He's really tasting it?
- That's so old school.

406
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,220
(Now let's take a closer look.)

407
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,800
(He used one finger to touch it.)

408
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,360
(Then he used
another finger to taste it.)

409
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,010
My goodness.

410
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,330
(Shamelessly using
an old-fashioned comedy.)

411
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,070
- Shameless.
- Gosh.

412
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,040
- Now taste it.
- You're shameless.

413
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,910
- Everyone, try tasting it.
- Je Hoon, try this one too.

414
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,440
Okay. Let me see.

415
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,750
(Doing the shameless comedy again.)

416
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,080
He doesn't know when to stop.

417
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,750
- This isn't it.
- He keeps doing it.

418
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,020
Well, he kind of looks cool.

419
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,760
- He's imitating him.
- Lee Je Hoon, you look good.

420
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,350
He's like a detective
in the old days.

421
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,950
Okay, everyone, try tasting it.

422
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,850
(The right hand doesn't know
what the left arm is tasting.)

423
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,430
This is endless.

424
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,640
Gosh, the hands are connected
to each other.

425
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,060
(Tasting the sand
with Bluetooth hands?)

426
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,970
(Good at old-fashioned comedy
since he was originally a comedian)

427
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,810
Why is the camera here?

428
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,940
Yes, he's smart.

429
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,920
- That one looks promising.
- No, no. That's mine.

430
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,050
I called shotgun on it.

431
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,050
(They found a camera
next to the pottery)

432
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,810
No, no. That's mine.
I called shotgun on it.

433
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,710
Isn't he the one
you called shotgun on?

434
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,980
(Is Je Hoon the one
she called shotgun on?)

435
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,930
(Love Frog wants to call shotgun
on Je Hoon and the pottery.)

436
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,500
Gosh, you're amazing.

437
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
- You called shotgun on him.
- No, I mean the pottery.

438
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,960
This is why she's Love Frog.

439
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
Love Frog?

440
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,900
(Love Frogs mainly inhabit
near Love.)

441
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,360
(So embarrassing)

442
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,060
Can't you let me have it?

443
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,100
Can't you let me have it?

444
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,970
No way. That's mine.

445
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,470
All right. You can have it.

446
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,940
(No way. That's mine.
You can have it.)

447
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,610
- Hey, what was that?
- Hey!

448
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,680
I can't believe it.

449
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,710
- Then I will dig this one out.
- Suk Jin is alone there.

450
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,080
(Suk Jin's alone.)

451
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,160
Me too.

452
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,030
(Everyone was having
a great time with Je Hoon.)

453
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,530
(Suk Jin couldn't fit in.)

454
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,360
(He just played his role
alone as a robber.)

455
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,860
- No one cares about him.
- It's okay.

456
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,430
- He just wandered around.
- I'm fine.

457
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,330
Je Hoon was
filming a movie over here.

458
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,280
- Did you choose one?
- Yes.

459
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,570
- This is the one.
- Get ready.

460
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,700
(Test robbery starts!)

461
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,940
The spout of the pottery
seems genuine.

462
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,110
- The spout?
- Yes, it's genuine.

463
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,340
- You have to dig it out quickly.
- I'm sure of it.

464
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,810
You have to hurry.

465
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,180
(The genuine ones are patternless.
Imitations have Kwang Soo's face)

466
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,160
It's patternless.

467
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,290
(Suk Jin took out his pottery.)

468
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,190
(Peekaboo)

469
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,450
It's a fake!

470
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
Kwang Soo's face is on it.

471
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
(Suk Jin picked the fake one!)

472
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,800
(Je Hoon is digging up
the one So Min wanted.)

473
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,910
(Will this smart robber
find genuine pottery?)

474
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,830
It's up to you two.

475
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,640
It's patternless.

476
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,570
(Peekaboo again!)

477
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,520
- Gosh.
- It's on it too?

478
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,150
It's a fake again!

479
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,680
Kwang Soo!

480
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,210
That's nice.

481
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,680
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

482
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,020
I knew I should have
tasted the sand.

483
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,260
My goodness.

484
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,320
It's like he's filming a commercial.

485
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,220
It's our turn.

486
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,530
Our turn?

487
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,220
It might be in the center.

488
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,860
- The real one will be there.
- What is wrong with your shoulders?

489
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,270
- The center.
- What's wrong with his shoulders?

490
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,810
- You're right.
- He looks bigger today.

491
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,910
Jong Kook is like...

492
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,180
an owner of a fitness center
who doesn't go out much.

493
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,050
Yes, he's been out in a long time
so he wore something nice today.

494
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,750
He's an owner of a fitness center.

495
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,290
- So he only has gym clothes.
- Right.

496
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,350
But he needs something to wear
to people's weddings.

497
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,450
- That sounds like me.
- Right.

498
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,450
Fitness center owners
dress up like you.

499
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,160
- Get ready.
- Okay.

500
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,450
(Second test robbery starts!)

501
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,000
- Se Chan's is a fake.
- Okay!

502
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,400
(Se Chan picked an imitation!)

503
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,460
(But the fitness center owner
picked a genuine one!)

504
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,170
He found one. Amazing.

505
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,560
(The rest of the members
went through the test.)

506
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,410
(Haha, Jae Suk, Won Hee, and
So Min found genuine potteries.)

507
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,430
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo
found imitation potteries.)

508
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,830
So the first test mission is over.

509
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,470
- Now here is the prize money.
- Okay.

510
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,810
- Okay.
- It's not real money?

511
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,440
- Se Chan, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

512
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,180
I'm so sorry.

513
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
(Going somewhere?)

514
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,150
It's okay. We don't need it anyway.

515
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,290
It's a great start.

516
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,340
Where's my money?

517
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,080
Did you find a genuine one?
You didn't.

518
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,260
Right.

519
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,480
- I didn't find one.
- What's wrong with Je Hoon.

520
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,530
What's wrong, Je Hoon?

521
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,450
He claims he found a genuine one
so he wants the money.

522
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,720
(Did he think it'll work?)

523
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,000
He's really weird.

524
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,460
What happened
for the last four years?

525
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,800
What's gotten into him?

526
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,230
- Now we'll move on...
- We should've won that.

527
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,560
to the main mission.

528
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,130
(Jae Suk, Won Hee, Jong Kook, Haha,
So Min have 1,000 dollars each.)

529
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,240
(Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, Je Hoon,
Kwang Soo, Se Chan have nothing.)

530
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,710
- This place is nice.
- Yes.

531
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,210
They built a place like this?

532
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,140
This is a hideout for
the Tomb Robbery Association.

533
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,400
- I see.
- This is a hideout?

534
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,670
It sure looks like it.

535
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,340
It's the first mission which you can
get benefits for your robbery.

536
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,410
Okay.

537
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,290
You have to rob other members'
romantic feelings.

538
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,310
It's called,
Love Signal, Heartthrob Quiz.

539
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,580
(Rob their romantic feelings!
Love Signal, Heartthrob Quiz)

540
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,150
- So Min loves it.
- She's excited.

541
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,260
(Her heart is pounding
to hear the word "love".)

542
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,000
- So Min loves it.
- She's excited.

543
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,300
So Min is so excited.

544
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,500
- Don't do this kind of mission.
- She looks pleased.

545
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,560
Can't you stop
giving us such missions?

546
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,360
I have nothing to offer.

547
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,870
We conducted a survey
on love affairs.

548
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,400
We surveyed 102 unmarried men
in their 20s and 30s.

549
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,670
- Only men?
- Yes.

550
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,840
We will give you four answers
with each question given.

551
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,250
And you just have to guess
the top answer.

552
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,550
(Choose the answer
people answered the most)

553
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,690
- All right.
- It's easy.

554
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,020
Discuss it with your team members
and choose two representatives...

555
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,820
so they can pick two seats
to sit in them for a minute.

556
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,260
You have to choose the right
answer after the minute is over.

557
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,300
The one who sits on the right answer
will get points.

558
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,800
Okay.

559
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,940
- What?
- What does he mean?

560
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,360
There are four answers.

561
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,810
If you think number one
is the right answer,

562
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,970
- You just sit there.
- Yes.

563
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,400
I got it.

564
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,210
- On a washbowl.
- I didn't understand it.

565
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,900
Gosh, this is so hard.

566
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,550
- I should keep up my spirit.
- Now we'll divide you in two teams.

567
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,910
Lee Jae Hoon and Im Won Hee
are team leaders.

568
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,910
- All right.
- We are?

569
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,610
Members' names are written
on the sticks.

570
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,690
- I see.
- Yes.

571
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,520
You can pick one by one.

572
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,850
But So Min and Ji Hyo's sticks are
with colors.

573
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,650
So each can pick only one.

574
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,030
- So...
- Shall I?

575
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,460
Is there any member
you want as your team member?

576
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,500
The one I want?
Are the names written on them?

577
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,660
You have to pick.

578
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,740
It will be written inside of it.

579
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,390
- You will know who it is.
- Wait a minute.

580
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,470
Say which member you want.

581
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,360
You said the producer
has bad pronunciation.

582
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,740
- I'm sorry.
- But you don't understand so well.

583
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,370
- Well, I...
- He keeps talking to himself.

584
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,670
- My goodness.
- I'm sorry.

585
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,310
It happens when I'm acting too.
If the director says something,

586
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,140
someone else
explains it to me again.

587
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,480
- I see.
- I'm sorry.

588
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,750
So say the member I want
then I should pick, right?

589
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,020
- Yes.
- Just pick one.

590
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,220
- It was an interview.
- Just pick one.

591
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,530
So is there a member you want?

592
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,580
Among us?

593
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,260
Well, I don't know.

594
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,820
Who do you want to be teamed with?

595
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,030
Who do you want?

596
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,800
- Yoo Jae Suk?
- All right.

597
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,920
(Yoo Jae Suk)

598
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,660
Why are you looking there
when you're talking about me?

599
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,940
I thought he was going to pick me.

600
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,540
Yes, he was looking there
and picked him.

601
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,040
- I thought you were picking me.
- Just let him be.

602
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,340
And he looked at me too.

603
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,340
I think he's just shy.

604
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,910
Now I'm good. I'm good.

605
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,520
So what should I do now?

606
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,220
- He's good now.
- What's next?

607
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,790
His face turned red.

608
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,850
- His face turned really red.
- We should listen to Je Hoon too.

609
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,790
The one I want
as my team member is...

610
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,190
Jong Kook.

611
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,030
(Je Hoon picked Jong Kook.)

612
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,960
I'm sitting right here
and you picked him?

613
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,000
Did you have to
pick someone far away?

614
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,160
But why did he have to
look at me when he said it?

615
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,130
Okay, then which do you want,
So Min or Ji Hyo?

616
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,900
(If he has to pick one, who will he
pick? So Min or Ji Hyo?)

617
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,970
Well, I...

618
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,100
- I'm really good at this.
- Really?

619
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,280
- What?
- Quiet down.

620
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,750
Don't say anything.

621
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,250
- Come on.
- So Min, don't say anything.

622
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,280
You can't do that.

623
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,140
- I want him to pick me.
- What are you doing?

624
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,140
You're confusing him.

625
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,080
I was just anxious. That's all.

626
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,220
(She tried to make him pick her.)

627
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,530
- Then I'll make a choice now.
- Okay.

628
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,420
(Then I'll make a choice now.)

629
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,420
(Je Hoon is looking at So Min.)

630
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,730
- He made up his mind.
- So Min.

631
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,090
I'm sorry.

632
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,090
(I'm sorry.)

633
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,240
(He refused to recruit So Min.)

634
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,310
So Min has been rejected.

635
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,980
You see...

636
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,480
Actually, I prefer Tak Jae Hoon.

637
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,070
(She rejected him
to get back at him.)

638
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,870
I prefer Tak Jae Hoon to him.

639
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,140
- So Min is the worst.
- I thought Tak Jae Hoon would come.

640
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,790
- She's getting upset.
- I didn't it was Lee Je Hoon.

641
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,410
You can start choosing
your team members.

642
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,350
(Starting with Won Hee,
they'll pick spoons in turns.)

643
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,310
- Won Hee, go to the center...
- Who is it?

644
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,150
(Team Won Hee's first member
is So Min.)

645
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,350
(She's not happy about it.)

646
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,920
Who is it?

647
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,530
- It's So Min.
- Is it So Min?

648
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,120
- She's not happy about it.
- Why did you sigh like that?

649
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,540
- That hurts my feelings.
- Why did you do that?

650
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,800
- Won Hee reacted too late.
- You could've faked it.

651
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,540
- She sighed so loudly. My gosh.
- So Min seemed disappointed.

652
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,480
- Ji Hyo.
- All right.

653
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,130
- He picked Suk Jin.
- I'm the only idiot.

654
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,710
Everyone on my team except for me
knows nothing about dating.

655
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,600
- Kwang Soo can sit here.
- Please sit with your team.

656
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,070
- Can you move to the side?
- No.

657
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,110
- Sit next to him.
- No.

658
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,450
- Come on.
- No. You sit there.

659
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,060
- Hey, come on.
- Come on. Just sit there.

660
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,580
- Why are you doing this?
- Sit there while you have a chance.

661
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,060
Just sit down.

662
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,850
- Come on. Sit here.
- No. I said, no.

663
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,730
- I'm giving you a chance.
- No.

664
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,800
Stay there.

665
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,360
Se Chan, don't do that.
I know you don't want it.

666
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,270
That's not true.

667
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,360
- It's like a sad movie, right?
- I almost cried.

668
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,010
Se Chan had a tear
while telling her to move.

669
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,370
He was crying from only one eye
while smiling to hide his tears.

670
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,600
(I won't let her see me crying.)

671
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,480
- All the dating experts gathered.
- Absolutely.

672
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,720
- Exactly.
- That's interesting.

673
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,610
Won Hee is an expert on dating.

674
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,140
I went on a blind date not long ago.

675
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,260
That's great.

676
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,720
But it didn't go well.

677
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,260
- You don't know that.
- It's still going on.

678
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,690
- It's not over. You never know.
- "It's not over."

679
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,320
Now, I'm going to tell you
the first question.

680
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,060
What is the best method of
winning arguments with a girlfriend?

681
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,500
- Oh, that...
- Well...

682
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,360
If you try to win her to the end,
your relationship will be over.

683
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,900
- Tears of a man.
- You see...

684
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,780
- Right. Crying.
- Wouldn't that mean you lost?

685
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,600
- Crying must be the answer.
- There's a really simple method.

686
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,900
You can just apologize first.

687
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,340
- Then she'd ask, "What for?"
- Exactly.

688
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,610
- Right?
- Yes.

689
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,580
- "What are you apologizing for?"
- It feels like I'm on a quiz show.

690
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,610
- You don't even know.
- It's never what I think it is.

691
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,580
- "I'm sorry for everything."
- Right?

692
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,350
This is not a good method.

693
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,700
But many men use this method.
They ghost their girlfriends.

694
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,730
- That's the worst.
- Oh, gosh.

695
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,090
- Completely.
- That's so pathetic.

696
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,330
- I didn't know he was this petty.
- Completely.

697
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,310
- That's the worst thing to do.
- I know. It's the worst.

698
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,510
- I always lost in an argument...
- Saying, "I love you"?

699
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,310
when my boyfriend seemed pitiful.

700
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,140
- Of course.
- When he tried to appeal to pity.

701
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,570
If he's sick and seems to have
gotten thinner,

702
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,910
it makes me think
that he can't live without me.

703
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,910
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- Fainting 3m away from her...

704
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,020
while she's looking at you.

705
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,060
It's an effective way.

706
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,150
It's more effective when she's
looking at you from behind.

707
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,500
You're so petty. Every method
you suggested is so pathetic.

708
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,530
They're cowardly and petty.

709
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,940
It's more effective if you faint
when she's watching you from behind.

710
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,160
While she's watching you
from behind.

711
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,510
Now, I'm going to reveal
the four answer choices.

712
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,570
(The answer choices are revealed.)

713
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,480
- See? Saying sorry is an option.
- You were right.

714
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,600
One of them is listening to her
without saying anything.

715
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
That's upsetting. Number two is
definitely not the answer.

716
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,990
- That would anger her even more.
- It's definitely not the answer.

717
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,410
- It makes a woman angry.
- Right.

718
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,310
- Could number three be the answer?
- It's my style.

719
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,310
Number four is my style.

720
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,730
- That's the worst method.
- It's my style.

721
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
Number three?

722
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,530
- I like number 3.
- I'd choose number 3.

723
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,090
- I'd choose number three too.
- Won Hee...

724
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,860
Won Hee picked it
based on what he hopes for.

725
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,820
(Being romantic is the best.
Kiss her so she stops speaking.)

726
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,540
- Won Hee...
- With his lips...

727
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,630
That's what I hope for.

728
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,510
Based on what he hopes for,

729
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,810
- he picked number 3.
- I'd choose number 3.

730
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,780
You shouldn't do that right away.

731
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,400
- It could backfire.
- Then what should be done first?

732
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,980
Do number 1 before doing number 3.

733
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,720
- Or number 2 before number 3.
- I'm sure it's number 3.

734
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,670
Je Hoon, what would you do?

735
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,310
If I argue with my girlfriend,
I would...

736
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,310
do number 2, number 1,
and then number 3.

737
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,530
- 2, 1, 3.
- 2, 1, 3?

738
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,080
- Oh, 2, 1, 3?
- Number 2?

739
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,530
That would be a perfect way.
You listen to what she has to say,

740
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,030
apologize to her, and kiss her.

741
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,530
- Would you not do number 4?
- Number 3 must be the answer.

742
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,440
If you argue back, she might think
you don't care if you break up.

743
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Men rarely go with number four.

744
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,100
The worst option is
number 4, 3, and then 1.

745
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,900
- That's the worst.
- Jae Suk, that's me.

746
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,670
That's how I usually act.

747
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,340
I argue back before apologizing
and then get slapped in the face.

748
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,520
- 4, 3, 1 is the worst combination.
- 4, 3, 1...

749
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,990
"Hey! You're in no position
to say that to me."

750
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,190
- You know so much about dating.
- Of course, I do.

751
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,220
He knows so much.

752
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,810
I specialize in things like this.

753
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,730
He doesn't have much experience
but knows so much about dating.

754
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,590
- I specialize in petty things.
- Exactly.

755
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,960
- I know...
- He hasn't dated many girls.

756
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,320
- True.
- He wasn't popular with girls.

757
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,040
- Why would you say that?
- Gosh.

758
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,740
If you repeat number three,
it would be even worse.

759
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,060
(Being romantic is the best.
Kiss her so she stops speaking.)

760
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,660
You would get slapped in the face.

761
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,940
(Too much romance)

762
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,040
That's so funny.

763
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,710
Okay. Please bring us the tubs.

764
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,950
- I think it's number three.
- This time...

765
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,310
- Which of us should go?
- I think it's the answer.

766
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,780
- Kwang Soo and I will go.
- Okay.

767
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,310
- Kwang Soo, I'll secure number 2.
- I'll secure number 1.

768
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,720
- Number 1 and 2.
- But...

769
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,080
Jae Suk, we'll secure
numbers 1 and 2.

770
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,310
- Okay.
- But I think it's number three.

771
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,990
I don't think number two is
the answer. You'd get yelled at.

772
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,850
You're right.
I'll go with number three.

773
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,350
(Fortunately, they picked
another option.)

774
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,360
I want to sit in the first one.

775
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,740
- Okay. I'll make sure of it.
- Okay.

776
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,540
- Someone hit me in the back.
- You can go with number three.

777
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,060
- I'll go with number 1.
- 1 of them hit me.

778
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,310
- You said you'd go with number 2.
- He wants number 1.

779
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,100
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Come here.

780
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,310
- Sit here.
- What are you doing? Kwang Soo.

781
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,400
- Go ahead and try.
- Ready...

782
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,670
(Whoever claims the tub
after a minute wins the right.)

783
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,410
(The countdown starts now.)

784
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,250
(He fell on the floor
in an instant.)

785
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,260
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

786
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,080
Okay. Good.

787
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,730
Jong Kook, he's hitting me.
Jong Kook.

788
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,920
(The sly brothers are
attacking him together.)

789
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,590
Number four might be
the correct answer.

790
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,120
- Number four.
- Kwang Soo, lift him up. Come on.

791
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,440
- He's lifting Haha up.
- That's good.

792
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,710
- Go on. Go.
- He picked Haha up.

793
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,010
- Good.
- Sit down.

794
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,330
30 seconds remaining.

795
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,010
Kwang Soo, let's stay closer.

796
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,900
- That's a good idea.
- He's sitting in number three.

797
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,570
- 2.
- Number 4 can't be the answer.

798
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,050
- What if it's number 4?
- Number 4 can't be the answer.

799
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,290
- Let's see.
- Hold on. It hurts.

800
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,020
(Which of the four
chose the correct answer?)

801
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,350
- I hope it's number one.
- The correct answer is...

802
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,230
- Number 3.
- 32 percent chose this option.

803
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,260
That's so high.

804
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,800
The correct answer is...

805
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,700
(Is it number 3 or 4? Or is it
number 2 that Se Chan fought for?)

806
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,160
"An eye for an eye.
Argue back logically..."

807
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,270
"so she has nothing to say."

808
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,740
(The correct answer is number four.)

809
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,100
(Neither number 2 nor number 1
was the correct answer.)

810
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,660
- I thought it wasn't the answer.
- Me too.

811
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,140
To be honest, I thought
it could be the answer.

812
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,980
- It's hard to believe.
- I was wrong.

813
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,480
- I'm shocked. Times have changed.
- I have goosebumps.

814
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,290
Saying sorry is ranked second.

815
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,150
Number 2 is ranked 4th,
and number 3 is ranked 3rd.

816
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,220
- I see.
- I see.

817
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,760
- Number four isn't a good solution.
- I didn't expect this.

818
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,590
It's hard for us to guess
what men in their 20s and 30s...

819
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,730
- would think about such matters.
- We're like old fossils.

820
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,090
What were we talking about?

821
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,230
We thought about the old-fashioned
way of dating.

822
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,590
- I became an old fossil.
- Exactly.

823
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,270
- It's an old-fashioned way.
- It's shocking.

824
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,600
Here's the second question.

825
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,480
"What's the most cowardly thing
you've done to your girlfriend?"

826
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,670
- The most cowardly thing?
- Yes.

827
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,480
- The most cowardly thing.
- Okay.

828
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,670
- Usually...
- Okay.

829
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,580
Men usually do such things
when they get dumped.

830
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,520
They would bad-mouth their
ex-girlfriends.

831
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,880
- That's petty too.
- A cowardly thing?

832
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
- It's cowardly.
- It happens.

833
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,230
- You've done that before, right?
- That's petty.

834
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,620
- He's so petty.
- I guess he has.

835
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,700
- Jae Suk, that's you.
- That's petty.

836
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,820
- That's him.
- You're cowardly and petty.

837
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,920
I understand because you were young.

838
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,660
- It's cowardly. What about you?
- Exactly.

839
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,310
- Anything cowardly?
- Cowardly things.

840
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,010
I haven't... What did I do?
I haven't done any cowardly...

841
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,670
I didn't ask about
the things you have done.

842
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,210
Oh, right. Things that others
would do.

843
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,070
If you still don't understand
the rules...

844
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,450
We're not sharing
our personal experiences.

845
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,750
Well...

846
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,140
Bad-mouthing the ex-girlfriend
after the breakup.

847
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,580
I just said the same thing.

848
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,790
- Won Hee, come on.
- What is he doing right now?

849
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,260
- Write a script for him.
- He said the same thing.

850
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,960
- I'm sorry.
- I can't believe this.

851
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,320
- Won Hee.
- I just said the same thing.

852
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,730
Maybe I was talking
about a different situation.

853
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,440
- As if no one had said that.
- My goodness.

854
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,970
- Unbelievable.
- He said it 30 seconds before that.

855
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,940
- What is wrong with him?
- I'm sorry.

856
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,970
Je Hoon, do you have any ideas?

857
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,980
In my case,
I really liked this girl,

858
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,010
but I told her I hated her.

859
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,810
- I see.
- That's cowardly but cool.

860
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,840
To play hard to get?

861
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,020
Yes. Well, I liked her so much,

862
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,340
but she wouldn't tell me
how she felt about me.

863
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,310
- Because of your pride?
- It hurt my pride.

864
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,910
- So I said I hated her.
- Kwang Soo, tell them.

865
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,490
- You know...
- Tell them what you did before.

866
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,650
- When a couple breaks up,
- Yes, tell that story.

867
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,230
- the man asks for his gifts back.
- Exactly.

868
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,890
- Did you do that?
- Gosh.

869
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,890
Of course.

870
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,320
That's not right. Don't you think?

871
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,800
You're still paying for the gifts
you bought for her every month.

872
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,970
Exactly.

873
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,630
Why would anyone ask
for their gifts back?

874
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:55,810
Or you know it's not right,
but you need money urgently,

875
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,140
so you take money
out of your girlfriend's wallet.

876
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,220
- Gosh, Jae Suk.
- No way.

877
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,570
That is so pathetic.

878
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,690
Everything you said is so pathetic.

879
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,310
They're all so cowardly
and pathetic.

880
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,610
That's hilarious.

881
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,610
(After hearing a lot of
pathetic stories...)

882
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,690
- "I thought of ending things too."
- That's similar to Je Hoon's story.

883
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,790
"Saying I thought of ending things
too as she broke up with me."

884
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,700
"Okay. I thought of
ending things too."

885
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,320
- "I'm glad you said that."
- "I'm glad to hear that."

886
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,620
I've done number two before.

887
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,660
Number two.

888
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,060
"Leaving where we were when she was
looking at an expensive item..."

889
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,740
- "saying it didn't look nice".
- You see...

890
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,600
- That sounds very real.
- That sounds real.

891
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,780
I can assure you that you'll do that
a dozen times in marriage too.

892
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,310
- I...
- Not just while dating someone.

893
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,070
- I can relate to that too.
- Really?

894
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,570
Yes, it happens.

895
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,340
- I'm sure men do that a lot.
- I've done this a lot before.

896
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,080
- That's unexpected.
- "Saying I loved her..."

897
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,520
Number three is so funny. My gosh.

898
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,850
Read number three.

899
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,530
"Saying I loved her..."

900
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,030
- "just to get to second base".
- Right.

901
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,270
That's...

902
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,730
"I love you. You trust me, right?"

903
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,240
- "I love you. You're the only one."
- "I love you."

904
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,800
- "You trust me, don't you?"
- "I love you so much."

905
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,600
That's impressive.

906
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,440
"Lying that something urgent
happened to rest at home..."

907
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,480
"on the day of your date."
This happens too.

908
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,870
- In a long-term relationship...
- That sounds real.

909
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,400
Men in a long-term relationship
usually make such excuses.

910
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,780
This is from men
in their 20s and 30s.

911
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,910
- Right.
- They don't have a lot of money.

912
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,910
So I think most of them
picked number two.

913
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,250
- That's most likely.
- Number two.

914
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,880
As a guy though,

915
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,080
number three
seems the most cowardly.

916
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,490
But for those in their 20s...

917
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,060
- Number 2.
- Number 2 could be right.

918
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,320
Please choose two from each team.

919
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,300
- From each team?
- Won Hee, go ahead.

920
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,000
- Won Hee, you're up.
- And So Min.

921
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,090
- My answer would be number 4.
- Number 1 isn't so bad.

922
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,800
It'll be Ji Hyo and Je Hoon for us.

923
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,010
- Number one...
- Start.

924
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,860
- How about 1 and 2?
- 1 and 2?

925
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,540
- Number 2.
- Go for number 2 immediately.

926
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,600
Won Hee, go for number two.

927
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,010
That'll be our safe bet.

928
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,340
Get ready...

929
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,720
(1 minute begins! Start!)

930
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,750
Won Hee, be careful.

931
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,020
- What?
- I knew it.

932
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,050
Won Hee, be careful.

933
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,220
(I knew it.)

934
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,690
There's an insect in here.

935
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,260
- Won Hee, hold your ground.
- Won Hee!

936
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,350
Hold your ground.

937
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,460
Wait, my arms hurt.

938
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,230
- Get inside.
- Won Hee!

939
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,760
- Hold your ground.
- Is this how it'll be?

940
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,890
- Please get up.
- This is how it'll be?

941
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,030
(He learns about the Running Man way
while on the floor.)

942
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,000
- I give up.
- Je Hoon gave up.

943
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,130
- Head back inside.
- But I am inside.

944
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,540
- I'm in the tub.
- Look at Won Hee.

945
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,060
- But I'm already in it.
- Get back in there.

946
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,160
How?

947
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,540
- Hold on.
- You secured your tub.

948
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,480
Just stand up and walk back in.

949
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,140
(He takes Haha's advice
and leaves the tub.)

950
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,450
Won Hee!

951
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,570
(The number 2 tub gets stolen.)

952
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,290
- This isn't right.
- You can't leave it completely.

953
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,290
This is wrong.

954
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,520
- What...
- Are you kidding me?

955
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,990
- This isn't right.
- You can't leave it completely.

956
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,230
- This is wrong though.
- Nicely done!

957
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,420
- Won Hee, seriously?
- That was mean of him.

958
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,960
- Is this how it'll be?
- Unbelievable.

959
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,770
- Oh, dear.
- Who told me to get up?

960
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,530
I can't believe Won Hee.

961
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,970
You all selected your tubs.

962
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,390
- Let me reveal the ranking then.
- Sure.

963
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,240
In first place is...

964
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,360
(The answer to the second survey)

965
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,310
Saying "I love you"
just to get more physical.

966
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,750
(The answer was number 3
which Won Hee chose!)

967
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,070
See?

968
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,220
See? What did I tell you?

969
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,480
- See?
- No way!

970
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,720
- Unbelievable.
- Can you believe it?

971
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,250
It's number 3, not 2?

972
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,460
- It was number three.
- No way.

973
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,150
Number 3 had 38 percent
while number 2 had 21 percent.

974
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,380
- Not number one then.
- No way.

975
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,090
Number 1 was in 3rd place
while number 4 was in 4th place.

976
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,890
I'm suddenly reminded
of all the times someone...

977
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,420
- confessed their love to me.
- Hey.

978
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,270
The winner of this game
is Team Je Hoon.

979
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,400
(Team Je Hoon wins the entire game.)

980
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,210
You'll now head out
to the first site.

981
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,370
- Sure.
- Okay. Let's go.

982
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,280
- Okay.
- All right.

983
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,900
Over here, guys!

984
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,020
(The robbers head out
deep into the woods.)

985
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,070
- Open the door.
- Open the door.

986
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,380
- What is it?
- What is this place?

987
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,550
(A tomb that was hidden)

988
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,150
- What...
- We must be role-playing.

989
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,520
- It's cool though.
- Here we go.

990
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,850
We're here to rob the tomb.

991
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,190
(The reason why the chairperson
gathered the robbers)

992
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,090
- It's pretty though.
- What is this place?

993
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,260
A land of mystery.

994
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,770
- Hold on.
- What is this place?

995
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,230
I see several rooms.

996
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,740
(The undercover officers will begin
their investigation here.)

997
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,330
Look at the cool flames.

998
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,770
- What is this?
- What?

999
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,830
- What is this place?
- It's for us to rob.

1000
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,630
- The category list.
- What?

1001
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,900
China, furniture, statues,

1002
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,900
- paintings...
- What now?

1003
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,310
(The category of items
they can steal.)

1004
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,670
- We're here to rob the place.
- The setting's so cool.

1005
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,020
Consider me intrigued.

1006
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,340
(Welcome to the tomb you'll rob.)

1007
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,790
It's giving me
an "Indiana Jones" vibe.

1008
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,060
- Gems.
- This is great.

1009
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,580
(The well-designed set
gets them into character.)

1010
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,580
There are lanterns too.

1011
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,580
- This is a working lantern.
- Hey, you're right.

1012
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,820
- It's an actual lantern.
- Exactly.

1013
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,500
- Robbers.
- Yes.

1014
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,390
This is the real reason...

1015
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,160
why the chairperson
gathered you here.

1016
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,700
We have the chairperson
and police officers among us.

1017
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,940
Right, the chairperson is among us.

1018
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,970
There are two
police officers, right?

1019
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,810
- Yes.
- Who invited us here?

1020
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,100
(Who invited us here?)

1021
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,210
That awkward tone.

1022
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,840
"Who invited us here?"

1023
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,840
Don't do that on purpose
just to seem suspicious.

1024
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,610
Suk Jin's not playing
any major role today.

1025
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,050
(Jae Suk doesn't
suspect him at all.)

1026
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,580
Could the police officer be dirty?

1027
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,910
It's time for the first robbery.

1028
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,880
In the amount of time you have,

1029
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,080
you'll take whatever treasure
you like from the tomb...

1030
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,850
and bring it back out here.

1031
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,530
Each team will get
a chance to enter.

1032
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,470
The winner of the previous game
will get a minute...

1033
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,510
while the losing team
will only get 30 seconds.

1034
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,170
In the two rooms you'll enter
lie all sorts of treasure.

1035
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,330
There are seven
categories in total,

1036
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,640
and items from the same category
have the same price.

1037
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,480
- Some are worth zero dollars.
- Zero?

1038
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,750
Others are 1,000, 2,000,
and 3,000 dollars respectively.

1039
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,520
One category has items
worth 10,000 dollars.

1040
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,380
10,000 dollars?

1041
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,990
- Then that's all you really need.
- Yes, exactly.

1042
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,650
- Got it.
- Just know...

1043
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,650
that the chairperson
and police officers...

1044
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,420
know which items are the priciest.

1045
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,860
(The chairperson and police officers
know what's worth 10,000 dollars.)

1046
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,290
Then we'll be able
to suspect who it is.

1047
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,540
Anyone who steals
the priciest item...

1048
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,630
(What they steal
will serve as evidence.)

1049
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,900
(Glaring)

1050
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,860
(Me? It's not me.)

1051
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,880
Hold on a second.

1052
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,400
Wait, have you already
begun your investigation?

1053
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,570
- Who...
- Of course.

1054
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,040
- Who are you looking at?
- I just...

1055
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,440
My eyes met Jong Kook's
about three times just now.

1056
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,820
You can take as many as you want.

1057
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,940
Just bring them to your station
in the amount of time you have.

1058
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,960
Any broken items...

1059
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,360
or those you didn't have time
to place won't count.

1060
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,880
Once the teams are done,

1061
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,690
I'll privately let you know
the price of your items.

1062
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,000
- Privately?
- Yes.

1063
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,070
The winning team will head out
with those lanterns.

1064
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,270
Good luck.

1065
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,170
- The lanterns are so pretty.
- It must be dark inside.

1066
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,270
Get robbing.

1067
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,400
Let's go.

1068
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,730
Come on!

1069
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,770
(Dark and dim)

1070
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,770
Right here.

1071
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,440
- Everything's set.
- My guess is that...

1072
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,420
the bigger and harder
to move the item might...

1073
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,520
Let's go.

1074
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,880
(They take a look around
before robbing the room.)

1075
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,020
How do we...

1076
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,020
I see coins here.

1077
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,090
This is what I'm taking.

1078
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,150
Books.

1079
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,690
Can one even take this?

1080
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,130
- How can you carry that?
- Can one carry this?

1081
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,630
(The statue is too big
for anyone to carry.)

1082
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,290
The china seems pricey.

1083
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,730
(Old pieces of china
definitely seem pricey.)

1084
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,860
This chair too.

1085
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:38,110
(Je Hoon checks if one can
carry the large cupboard.)

1086
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,650
The time... How long do we have?

1087
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,480
- A minute.
- I see.

1088
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,610
- Get ready...
- The heavier items.

1089
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,150
(The robbing begins.)

1090
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,090
Hold on a second.
Why are you all heading over there?

1091
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,500
(Je Hoon places the china
on top of the cupboard.)

1092
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,520
Not these.

1093
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,290
Not these small ones.

1094
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,590
- Hold on.
- Be careful.

1095
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,730
- Those books.
- They're too heavy.

1096
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,860
It's too heavy.

1097
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,400
It's just too heavy.

1098
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,810
(Ji Hyo only takes
what she can carry.)

1099
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,770
(Meanwhile, Je Hoon
takes a lot of the china.)

1100
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,040
(Jong Kook utilizes
the muscle he has.)

1101
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,690
We can at least bring two.

1102
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,750
(He steals the statue
that's taller than him.)

1103
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,920
- What's that?
- It's a statue.

1104
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,360
Is it that heavy?

1105
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,590
That doesn't look...

1106
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,150
too expensive to me.

1107
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,150
They're being
petty thieves that they are.

1108
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,320
Yes, like petty thieves.

1109
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,190
Suk Jin stole what fits him.

1110
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,840
He brought the books
he would've read.

1111
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
- Old books.
- They're his, right?

1112
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
(Old books that are reminiscent
of Suk Jin's school years)

1113
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,540
- The books he probably read.
- She stole china.

1114
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,770
You brought a lot.

1115
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,540
- They don't look expensive.
- I agree.

1116
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,770
Jong Kook...

1117
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,070
- What is that?
- Bigger items...

1118
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,840
aren't necessarily pricier.

1119
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,380
Bigger doesn't mean pricier.

1120
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,690
Gosh, it's heavy.

1121
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,980
It doesn't seem
that expensive to me.

1122
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,060
- He's faking it.
- It's so heavy.

1123
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,790
Je Hoon, be careful.

1124
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,790
- What...
- Look at what he brought!

1125
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,250
- Time's up.
- Is it over?

1126
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,750
- Time's up.
- It's over.

1127
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,000
(Je Hoon stole a cupboard
and six china pieces.)

1128
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,130
What you're carrying now
don't count.

1129
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,340
Time's up.

1130
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,860
- Okay.
- These don't count?

1131
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,190
Haha, what were you thinking?

1132
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,840
It's harder than expected.

1133
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,440
Suk Jin brought items
from a variety of categories.

1134
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,630
Yes, exactly.

1135
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,770
From four.

1136
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,650
A painting, china pieces,
books, and a statue.

1137
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,770
I stole some gems...

1138
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,570
and R coins which are valuable
in the Running Man world.

1139
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,250
Coins.

1140
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,690
- These are probably the priciest.
- You don't need anything else.

1141
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,320
All I need are the R coins.

1142
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,480
All right.

1143
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,750
The second team is up next.

1144
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,190
- Guys, let's go.
- Let's go.

1145
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,000
- R coins are the most valuable.
- Okay.

1146
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,590
I don't need a lantern.

1147
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,290
(Determined)

1148
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,360
This won't be easy.

1149
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,860
The flames are fake.

1150
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:45,540
(Team Won Hee gets 30 seconds
to search the tomb.)

1151
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,730
(Won Hee chooses
the light paintings.)

1152
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,400
(So Min fills her bag
with treasures...)

1153
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,070
(and then goes for the statue
that's bigger than her.)

1154
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,290
My arms hurt.

1155
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,710
Why is this so heavy?

1156
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,610
You won't believe how heavy this is.

1157
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:06,360
(Kwang Soo loads the items
on the cupboard like Je Hoon.)

1158
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,690
(Wobbly)

1159
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,900
I dropped the books!

1160
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,690
- Time's up.
- I'm done.

1161
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,790
Already?

1162
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,590
What on earth.

1163
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,070
- My hands hurt.
- Those aren't allowed.

1164
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,670
- No?
- My hands hurt.

1165
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,210
- They're so heavy.
- Tell me about it.

1166
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,070
- I thought this looked cool.
- Me too.

1167
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,170
But it broke.

1168
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,340
You broke it?

1169
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,980
- Someone broke it.
- Wait...

1170
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,540
- It's broken.
- No, it's almost broken.

1171
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,090
- Hold on.
- Look at the crack.

1172
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,650
What's broken isn't allowed.

1173
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,960
See?

1174
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,380
I specifically said so
at the beginning,

1175
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,560
- so that doesn't count.
- He's right.

1176
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,900
- No way.
- Guys,

1177
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,020
out of the 10 of you,

1178
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,820
the one with the lowest amount...

1179
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,790
- Zero dollars?
- The lowest amount is...

1180
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,040
(The one with the lowest amount
out of the 10)

1181
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,070
It's 1,000 dollars.

1182
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,900
- What?
- Did he or she only steal one item?

1183
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,710
- The one with the highest amount.
- The highest amount.

1184
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,500
- How much is it?
- The highest amount...

1185
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,880
- is 20,000 dollars.
- What?

1186
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,920
(The one with the highest amount
has 20,000 dollars.)

1187
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,380
- He or she must've known.
- Hold on.

1188
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,290
Maybe it's someone
who stole two of the same kind?

1189
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,590
You have a point.

1190
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,480
- It smells like prior knowledge.
- Exactly.

1191
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,150
Look over there.
There are two paintings.

1192
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,690
20,000 dollars?

1193
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,250
But he also has some china pieces.

1194
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,750
That could be worth nothing.

1195
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,290
- You're right.
- This person knew.

1196
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,670
- I have two of the same kind.
- 20,000 dollars?

1197
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,960
I stole two of the same kind.

1198
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,460
- The statute.
- That he did.

1199
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,730
- I don't think it's me though.
- He stole two statues.

1200
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,230
You'll each be told
the amount you stole.

1201
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,500
- Make sure no one else sees it.
- Got it.

1202
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,040
- Sure.
- I doubt anyone will.

1203
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,670
- Ji Hyo.
- Sure.

1204
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,770
- I think I know who it is.
- Thanks.

1205
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,110
This must be kept a secret.

1206
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,150
(They can make assumptions
depending on their amount.)

1207
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,840
- So...
- Darn it.

1208
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:47,960
(Haha was confident that
the gems and R coins were valuable.)

1209
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,590
(Haha has the least amount
at 1,000 dollars.)

1210
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,190
This narrows it down.

1211
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,630
- I think I know who it is.
- You can tell...

1212
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,540
- once you calculate your amount.
- Right.

1213
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,210
You can tell who has two
of the priciest items.

1214
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,670
(Statue: 10,000 dollars)

1215
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,900
(Jong Kook has the highest amount
with 20,000 dollars.)

1216
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,110
But that person
might've stolen the items...

1217
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,000
- without knowing their value.
- Exactly.

1218
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,210
(Other members stole statues too.)

1219
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,440
(Suk Jin,)

1220
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,820
(Se Chan,)

1221
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
It's bigger than you.

1222
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,060
(Suk Jin, Se Chan, and So Min)

1223
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,420
(Could the chairperson
or the police officers...)

1224
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,290
(who know the prices be among them?)

1225
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,590
Does it mean we're going to start
playing mind games now?

1226
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,630
That's it, right?

1227
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,020
- It started way before.
- Play what?

1228
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,130
It already started?

1229
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,090
- Please Won Hee. Pay attention.
- What are you doing?

1230
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,170
I'm sorry.

1231
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,960
- What's wrong with him?
- I'm sorry.

1232
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,900
- I'll join now.
- It started with the show.

1233
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,610
- Really?
- Why would we begin now?

1234
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,940
I thought
we were just starting that.

1235
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,980
I'm sorry.

1236
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,170
- All right. We will...
- We started already.

1237
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,270
- move on to our second mission.
- Okay.

1238
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,980
(They move on to the second mission
after 1st round of tomb robbery.)

1239
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,020
Nicely done.

1240
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,150
- Mine!
- Gosh, that was pretty tough.

1241
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,590
Mine. It's mine.

1242
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,320
(But why are the members
playing foot volleyball?)

1243
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,380
Mine!

1244
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,230
- So Min, take your time.
- Kick it high.

1245
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,690
Kick it high.

1246
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,590
(What? What was that just now?)

1247
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,290
(The ball goes back to Won Hee.)

1248
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,670
(Gosh.)

1249
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,040
(Suddenly dancing the mask dance
from Bongsan)

1250
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,900
- He's awful at this sport.
- Come on, Won Hee.

1251
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,460
- Won Hee.
- He can't kick.

1252
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,860
I missed it just once.

1253
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,170
- Won Hee is an entertainer too.
- Gosh.

1254
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,480
So I can't kick
because I messed up once?

1255
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,980
All right. Gather around.

1256
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,150
- We have to gather around.
- Where?

1257
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,380
It was fun.

1258
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,570
As you warmed up
by playing foot volleyball,

1259
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,320
- you sized each other up, right?
- Yes.

1260
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,610
Won Hee can't kick.

1261
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,920
- Won Hee...
- We found out.

1262
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,520
- You can't kick at all.
- I was so shocked.

1263
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,480
- We did it on "My Little Old Boy".
- He's an entertainer.

1264
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,190
I wasn't that bad.

1265
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,250
- I'm unexpectedly good.
- Won Hee.

1266
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,190
All right. Teamwork is
important for the second mission.

1267
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,920
It's called Spare Nothing
for Foot Volleyball.

1268
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,020
Spare Nothing?

1269
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,730
Four members from both teams will
play a match of foot volleyball.

1270
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,770
- 4 members.
- 4 members.

1271
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,130
However, in order to get the ball
over the net to the opposing team,

1272
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,980
all of the members in your team
must touch the ball at least once...

1273
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,630
and pass it over the net.

1274
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,630
(Everyone in the team must touch
the ball before passing it over.)

1275
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,810
- What?
- To get the ball over...

1276
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,810
(That won't be easy.)

1277
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,570
If you fail to get the ball over
after everyone has touched it once,

1278
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,920
everyone must touch the once again.

1279
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,710
Wait. We...

1280
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,610
You will divide into your teams
just like before.

1281
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,150
So we're going
to have different teams now?

1282
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,690
But...

1283
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,630
What's the prize of winning
this foot volleyball match?

1284
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,420
It's just like before.

1285
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,920
Won Hee, why do you think
we're playing games?

1286
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,070
(Chuckling)

1287
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,170
- Won Hee.
- I wanted to know in detail.

1288
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,130
- I'm sorry.
- Let me tell you this in advance.

1289
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,230
Let's pull out a spoon.

1290
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,310
- Okay.
- You'll go first?

1291
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,340
- Should I go first?
- Do you want to go first?

1292
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,570
You can choose one color.

1293
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,110
- Green or yellow?
- Who's thinking about me?

1294
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,230
He's looking at you now, So Min.

1295
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,250
- Who?
- Je Hoon.

1296
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,540
Je Hoon, I'm good at this.
I can do well. I'll do my best.

1297
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,270
- I'll try to choose So Min.
- Pick me this once.

1298
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,590
Will her wish come true?

1299
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,610
(Will So Min's wish come true?)

1300
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,560
Will her wish come true?

1301
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,090
- How did he pick her?
- Really?

1302
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,090
(He picks So Min.)

1303
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,290
- How? How did you know it was her?
- Good for you, So Min!

1304
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,960
- She's happy.
- No, she might be bad at it.

1305
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
- How did he do that?
- All right.

1306
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,130
- Let me get Jong Kook.
- Gosh, Won Hee.

1307
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,840
(Please let it be Jong Kook.)

1308
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,400
- Did you pick me?
- Yes, I got him.

1309
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,400
- You got him?
- Yes!

1310
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,270
- Yes!
- You got him?

1311
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,400
We have this in the bag.

1312
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,980
- We got this in the bag.
- Gosh.

1313
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,770
- How did you pick me?
- We got this in the bag.

1314
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,150
Jae Suk is the best of
the remaining members. Seriously.

1315
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,480
Let it be Jae Suk.

1316
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,320
- Gosh, it's Suk Jin. Good.
- Gosh. Okay.

1317
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,320
- "Gosh, it's Suk Jin."
- It's all right.

1318
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,340
Well done.

1319
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,190
- We're totally ruined.
- Guys.

1320
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,820
- Gosh, this is...
- It's...

1321
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,380
- What a team.
- I should try my best.

1322
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,590
All right. You can warm up now.

1323
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,730
- Let's warm up.
- We won this!

1324
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,400
- 1, 2, 3, 4. And over the net.
- Okay.

1325
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,590
- Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4?
- So Min, good luck!

1326
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,130
One,

1327
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,840
- two.
- That's right.

1328
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,840
- Won Hee.
- It's Won Hee's turn.

1329
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,940
Do a header.

1330
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,440
- Won Hee.
- It's Won Hee's turn.

1331
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,610
(Kicking in the air)

1332
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,480
(Captain Im shows potentials
to be the weakling of the team.)

1333
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,900
Nice. He can't kick!

1334
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,980
- I'm messing it up on purpose.
- When that happens,

1335
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,880
- put your head on the ball.
- Okay. I got it now.

1336
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,840
- He's going to be trouble.
- I'm messing it up on purpose.

1337
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,820
- We didn't start yet.
- We'll zero in on Won Hee.

1338
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,980
Let's go after Won Hee.

1339
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,440
We'll start now.

1340
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,730
- Let's go. Okay. Go.
- Get it. You got it, right?

1341
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,960
Nice serve.

1342
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,790
- Stay close.
- One.

1343
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,150
- Two.
- Great.

1344
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,730
- Pass it to Ji Hyo.
- Do a header. Pass it to her head.

1345
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,920
- Two.
- Great.

1346
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,170
- Pass it to Ji Hyo.
- Do a header. Pass it to her head.

1347
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,290
- Over the net.
- Nice!

1348
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,440
Save it!

1349
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,590
(Save it!)

1350
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,500
Look. Won Hee, listen.

1351
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,130
When the ball is high,
just do a header.

1352
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,040
- Bump it with your head.
- Should I put my head on it? Okay.

1353
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,710
- Won Hee was scolded, right?
- Yes.

1354
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,940
- Gosh.
- He raised his voice.

1355
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,940
- You got scolded, right?
- Do you agree?

1356
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,650
- Don't focus on only kicking.
- Won Hee.

1357
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,270
Are you under a lot of pressure?
Should I take over?

1358
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,790
Should I take over?

1359
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,250
(Team Je Hoon continues
to play offense.)

1360
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,360
Move. Out of my way! Won Hee. Gosh.

1361
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,750
(He suddenly bumps it with his belly
as Jong Kook screams.)

1362
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,230
(What was that?)

1363
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,360
Move. Out of my way! Won Hee. Gosh.

1364
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,070
- Gosh.
- One.

1365
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,090
- Two.
- Gosh.

1366
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,960
It's out. I'm sorry.

1367
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,360
No, it's okay. Next time, just move.

1368
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,770
Won Hee. Won Hee,
he scared you just now, right?

1369
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,810
- "Move!"
- He got scared.

1370
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,770
Don't try to receive the serve
wherever it goes.

1371
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,170
- I won't do it.
- Okay.

1372
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,670
It's too much.

1373
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,710
- So Min, cover that part.
- We can do it.

1374
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,540
- He's causing so much trouble.
- We can do it.

1375
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,610
We can do it.

1376
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,380
- Nice. Use your body. Shoulders.
- One.

1377
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,480
Yes. We got it.

1378
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,690
- Won Hee!
- Okay.

1379
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:41,750
- Won Hee.
- Okay.

1380
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,820
It's here.

1381
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,980
(Will he be able to redeem himself?)

1382
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,480
- Do a header.
- Okay.

1383
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,880
- Okay. It's here.
- Do a header.

1384
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,590
(He manages to get it over the net.)

1385
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,090
(Suddenly flustered)

1386
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,420
- Great.
- The ball is still alive.

1387
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,570
- Okay.
- Je Hoon.

1388
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,400
- Yes. Je Hoon, take your time.
- Go.

1389
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,730
- Nice.
- Great.

1390
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,230
- Jong Kook.
- Mine.

1391
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,460
Won Hee.

1392
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,570
(Sprawling)

1393
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,230
Won Hee.

1394
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,480
(He leaves his team
utterly vulnerable once again.)

1395
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,480
(His anger level is going up.)

1396
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,250
Why did you come to me?
Why did you move?

1397
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,380
- You should have stayed there.
- He's crying.

1398
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,090
He's the worst.

1399
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,750
(He's provoking Won Hee
by tapping on his bottom.)

1400
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,380
- It's all right.
- Okay.

1401
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,860
(Coach Jong Kook is
trying hard not to lose it.)

1402
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,980
Good luck.

1403
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,920
So Min, I'm right behind you.

1404
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,360
Don't you worry. Mine!

1405
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,360
One.

1406
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,130
- Two.
- So Min.

1407
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,570
- Come here, So Min.
- I should kick it too.

1408
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,670
Great. Do a header.

1409
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,730
- That's it!
- That's it!

1410
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,810
I got it.

1411
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,360
- Okay. Get it.
- This is it.

1412
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,040
Won Hee, kick it high.

1413
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,170
Won Hee got the ball.

1414
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,650
- Won Hee, kick it high.
- Won Hee got the ball.

1415
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:39,750
Won Hee.

1416
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,880
- Run.
- Just kick it gently.

1417
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,210
- One more time!
- Kick it again!

1418
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,820
- Just kick it gently.
- One more time.

1419
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,340
- One more time, Won Hee.
- Do it again!

1420
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,790
(Do it again!)

1421
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,020
You could have kicked it again!

1422
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,650
(Coach Jong Kook lost it
in the end.)

1423
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,790
- You could have...
- We could have gone one more round.

1424
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,500
I think you gave up too early.

1425
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,090
- I forgot.
- You didn't know the rule, right?

1426
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,130
I forgot.

1427
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,360
You got scolded, right?

1428
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,420
- He did.
- Yes.

1429
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,090
Won Hee, the Black Sheep.

1430
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,460
Nice.

1431
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,000
Let's catch up.

1432
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,360
Okay. Wait.

1433
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,400
- One.
- So Min, wait.

1434
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,810
- Two.
- So Min.

1435
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,310
- Three.
- Jae Suk.

1436
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:11,670
- Four.
- That's it.

1437
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,880
- 1.
- 1. All right.

1438
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,380
Touch the ball. No.

1439
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,880
- Bump the ball.
- Bump the ball.

1440
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,380
- Three.
- Won Hee!

1441
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,250
(It's the weakling,
Won Hee's turn again.)

1442
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,380
(He had to be trained
by the scary coach.)

1443
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,590
(He must get the ball over the net
this time no matter what.)

1444
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:27,790
- Bump the ball.
- Won Hee!

1445
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,230
(Kicking with vigor)

1446
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:30,690
- Great.
- Won Hee!

1447
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,520
(A fiery shoot with determination)

1448
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,540
(He finally did it!)

1449
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,840
- Yes.
- Yes!

1450
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,400
Well done.

1451
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,540
- Good job.
- I knew it.

1452
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:41,770
It's all right.

1453
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,730
Okay.

1454
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,110
(Team Won Hee is feeling confident
after their first score.)

1455
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,440
Any part of your body
has to hit the ball.

1456
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,520
(They will continue their offense
with Jong Kook's serve.)

1457
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,250
- Jae Suk.
- All right.

1458
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,750
Wait. So Min, this is yours.

1459
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,880
- So Min.
- You can get it over the net.

1460
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,250
- That's it.
- Good luck!

1461
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,460
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo.

1462
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,860
(Flailing)

1463
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,920
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo.

1464
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,290
(Suk Jin juggles the ball.)

1465
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,170
(Sighing)

1466
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:07,900
Nice!

1467
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,170
Nice try.

1468
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,270
Nice try.

1469
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,460
- Great.
- Gosh.

1470
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,210
- So Min, that was perfect. Good.
- Well done.

1471
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,770
(They resume the match
after calming down.)

1472
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,310
- Mine!
- It's hard.

1473
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,380
Wait.

1474
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,500
So Min, bump it gently.

1475
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,840
- Bump it gently.
- Okay.

1476
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,940
- Three.
- That's it.

1477
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,020
- Haha, get it.
- This is dangerous.

1478
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,340
- Gosh.
- Okay.

1479
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,650
- Okay. It's mine.
- Suk Jin.

1480
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:26,820
Do a header.

1481
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,380
See? That was long.

1482
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,190
- Gosh. Save it.
- It's back again.

1483
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,230
(Boiling with anger)

1484
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,020
- Do a header.
- Like this.

1485
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,130
- When you kick, the pass is long.
- Okay.

1486
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,650
- Just put your head on the ball.
- Everyone is getting scolded.

1487
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:40,420
Suk Jin and Won Hee are
getting scolded so much.

1488
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,360
No. Not yet. Don't give up yet.
We can do it.

1489
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,440
- Yes, we can do it.
- We can do it.

1490
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,940
- Let's go.
- We're doing well now.

1491
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,940
We're doing well.

1492
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,270
- You got it, right?
- Of course.

1493
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,630
- One. You get it.
- Suk Jin.

1494
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,710
- Gently.
- Won Hee, you get it.

1495
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:50,810
Use your head! Won Hee.

1496
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,250
- Gently.
- Won Hee, you get it.

1497
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,480
(Kneeing the ball)

1498
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,520
- Gently.
- Won Hee, you get it.

1499
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,210
(The weakling is back.)

1500
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,540
Your head! Use your head!

1501
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,480
You have a head. Use your head!

1502
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,980
- Why would you kick it?
- Where did you hit the ball with?

1503
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,320
(He's getting scolded for using
his foot during foot volleyball.)

1504
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,190
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1505
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,190
No more mistakes from now on.

1506
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,230
He's driving me crazy.

1507
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,900
This is crazy.
I should start doing headers.

1508
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,670
- Okay. It's over.
- It's all thanks to Won Hee.

1509
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,290
- It's all thanks to Won Hee.
- It's over.

1510
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,670
- You can play this time.
- It's all thanks to him.

1511
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,810
- Let's do this!
- Okay.

1512
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:19,810
We can do it!

1513
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:20,900
Let's go.

1514
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,670
- Great.
- Move.

1515
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,000
- Out.
- No, it's in.

1516
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,570
- Great.
- Out.

1517
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,610
(Move!)

1518
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,320
(Jong Kook does a Sargent jump.)

1519
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,690
(He miscalculates
the point of contact.)

1520
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,110
(Gosh. Darn it.)

1521
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,820
(Covering his mouth)

1522
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,090
What's wrong with you?

1523
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,190
(He was bragging so much earlier.)

1524
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,900
- You said you got it.
- You should have moved.

1525
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,500
You said you got it.

1526
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,290
- We got two.
- Listen.

1527
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,500
You said you got it.

1528
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,230
I told you to move.
Why didn't you move?

1529
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,570
That's hilarious. It's hilarious.

1530
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,000
- It's hilarious.
- Keep going.

1531
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,630
It's so funny.

1532
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:56,770
- Hold on.
- Let's play now.

1533
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,250
Hey, whose team are you on?

1534
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,380
(Suddenly coming to his senses)

1535
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,710
Whose team are you on?

1536
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,480
- What are you doing there?
- You can't laugh at him.

1537
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,540
- Right. I get why he's laughing.
- I can understand him laughing.

1538
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,590
- But you...
- You can't laugh at them.

1539
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:08,860
You're on our team.
How can you laugh at us?

1540
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,130
- I'm sorry.
- All of us are working hard.

1541
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:12,360
- What are you doing?
- You can't do that.

1542
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,790
- What are you doing?
- Should you be laughing now?

1543
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:15,020
You can do it!

1544
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,400
- Gosh.
- Don't give up yet.

1545
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,650
It was hilarious.

1546
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,290
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1547
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,170
(They resume playing
after suppressing their anger.)

1548
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,170
Good.

1549
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,500
- Mine.
- Great.

1550
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,610
- Okay. Great.
- One.

1551
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:25,630
Nice.

1552
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,630
- I'll kick it high.
- Okay.

1553
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,630
So Min, it's your turn.

1554
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:28,630
- Great.
- Gently kick it over.

1555
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,110
- That's it. You got it.
- Nice.

1556
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,540
Gosh.

1557
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,570
You got it.

1558
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,670
(It's an embarrassing moment
for him.)

1559
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,540
(The audience is satisfied
with his slapstick comedy.)

1560
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,540
- Are you okay?
- My gosh, look.

1561
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,820
- He tripped.
- I'm okay.

1562
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,150
- I'm okay.
- He tripped.

1563
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,610
- Are you okay?
- It was so sudden.

1564
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,960
- Are you okay, Jong Kook?
- Sorry.

1565
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,960
- That was funny.
- You're okay? Are you pretending...

1566
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,690
- to be okay because you're ashamed?
- I'm okay.

1567
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,730
- You're okay, right?
- I'm fine.

1568
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,900
It's so funny seeing Jong Kook
so flustered like that.

1569
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,230
Hey, Jong Kook.

1570
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,670
This is the set point.

1571
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:57,230
- Okay.
- It's the match point.

1572
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,340
It's the set point.

1573
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,900
So Min, that was perfect.
That's it.

1574
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,340
Kick it when it comes down.

1575
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,110
(Determined)

1576
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,500
(Will the game come to an end now?)

1577
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,650
- Nice serve.
- Mine.

1578
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,170
- Nice serve.
- Mine.

1579
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,570
- Great.
- Okay.

1580
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:10,820
- One.
- Go.

1581
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,020
(The ball goes sideways.)

1582
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,210
(At that moment, Won Hee runs over!)

1583
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,730
(Will he redeem himself
and save the team?)

1584
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,560
Won Hee, are you okay?

1585
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,860
(He suddenly slides.)

1586
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,920
(Laughing)

1587
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,940
Are you okay?

1588
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:31,040
(Won Hee saved everyone
from boredom.)

1589
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,000
(His body couldn't handle
the pressure.)

1590
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,110
Won Hee, are you okay?

1591
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,340
(Sighing)

1592
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,940
Is something the matter?
What is up with you today?

1593
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,400
Are you okay?

1594
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,250
Is something the matter?

1595
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,110
- Are you okay?
- Nice try.

1596
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,690
The game is over.

1597
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,090
The game is over! The game is over!

1598
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,790
- Good job.
- The head. The head.

1599
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,650
The difference between Je Hoon
and Won Hee divided the results.

1600
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,860
- I know. Je Hoon did really well.
- That's what I think.

1601
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,790
- Je Hoon did really well.
- Seriously.

1602
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,360
(Glancing over)

1603
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,770
(He puts his arm
around Won Hee's shoulder.)

1604
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,360
- Won Hee.
- Won Hee, are you crying?

1605
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,040
No, no. No, no.

1606
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,710
- Won Hee, it's okay.
- Jong Kook didn't hit you, did he?

1607
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,810
- No, no.
- Why is your face so red?

1608
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,440
People who just turned on the TV
might take it the wrong way.

1609
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,480
- I am okay.
- Smile, Won Hee.

1610
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,880
Smile.

1611
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:20,540
We will now go to the last tomb.

1612
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,250
- Okay.
- Okay.

1613
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,090
It's the last tomb.

1614
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,090
Hey, I know what to do now.

1615
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:30,250
I know what to do in order to help.

1616
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,400
- You have one minute.
- Okay.

1617
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,770
Get ready. Set, go.

1618
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,770
(Team Je Hoon starts robbing
for 1 minute.)

1619
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:36,460
(Looking around)

1620
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:38,400
You should have told us!

1621
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:41,230
- They said we start right away.
- Still...

1622
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,840
(Haha picks up a painting.)

1623
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,750
(Se Chan and So Min enter
another room.)

1624
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,040
Where are the gems?

1625
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,250
I can't take it outside.

1626
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,340
Come on.

1627
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,380
(Je Hoon keeps looking
for something.)

1628
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,360
(He picks up a statue.)

1629
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,360
(Did he pick it...)

1630
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,360
My goodness.

1631
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,460
(because it's
the most expensive item?)

1632
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,320
A minute.

1633
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,920
I should bring a big one.

1634
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,170
It has nothing to do with size.
All statues are the same.

1635
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,290
- Really?
- Yes.

1636
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,540
Is the price the same as before?

1637
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,380
(Je Hoon brought an item
that is worth 10,000 dollars.)

1638
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,750
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

1639
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:19,840
I dropped it.

1640
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,750
(Where is he headed?)

1641
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,020
(Another statue?)

1642
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,290
(Time's up.)

1643
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:32,250
We will appraise the items
you brought.

1644
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,750
(Jae Suk, Haha, Ji Hyo,
Je Hoon, and So Min)

1645
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,500
We only made one trip.

1646
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,230
The second team will go now.

1647
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,570
- Okay.
- I have three items.

1648
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,170
- Let's go.
- We have 30 seconds, right?

1649
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,840
- 3 paintings.
- 30 seconds.

1650
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,710
Jae Suk's painting is damaged.

1651
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,460
- It's damaged.
- The painting is fine.

1652
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,540
- No, it's damaged.
- The painting is what matters.

1653
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,940
His face is crumpled.

1654
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,000
- The painting.
- His face is crumpled.

1655
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,110
- No, no.
- The frame could be expensive.

1656
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,710
- The painting is fine.
- I can't accept an item like this.

1657
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,320
This item is damaged.

1658
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,860
Okay! Nice shot!

1659
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,480
Let's see the ones behind it.

1660
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:05,730
I will get back at you.

1661
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,920
You can move that one.

1662
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,460
I will get back at you.

1663
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,650
Shall I move it?

1664
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,670
- Okay. Let's go.
- Get ready. Set, go.

1665
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:13,670
(Team Won Hee's robbery starts!)

1666
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,230
All right.

1667
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:16,630
(Did Jong Kook decide to get
the furniture?)

1668
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,670
There is nothing.

1669
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,040
We can only make one trip.

1670
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,210
- Suk Jin.
- We can only make one trip.

1671
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,380
- Put it down.
- You can put it there.

1672
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,440
- Come on.
- 2, 1.

1673
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,110
They didn't get here on time.

1674
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,820
You guys are out.

1675
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,320
(Won Hee and Kwang Soo, Suk Jin,)

1676
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,750
(Ji Hyo, and Jong Kook)

1677
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,920
Here are the results
of the second robbery.

1678
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,730
The lowest price is zero dollars.

1679
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,650
The highest price is...

1680
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:42,650
(The highest price)

1681
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,500
- 10,000 dollars.
- Who is it?

1682
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,460
(Je Hoon is the one
behind the item!)

1683
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,570
Did anyone bring one item?

1684
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,230
- It can't be someone with one item.
- Hold on.

1685
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,670
- Je Hoon.
- Me?

1686
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,840
I just brought one item.

1687
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,540
- Did you bring 1 item?
- He brought 1 item.

1688
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,070
(Did Je Hoon pick a statue
by chance?)

1689
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,380
(Je Hoon looked for a statue
as soon as the robbery began.)

1690
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:06,040
(Could Je Hoon be the chairperson
or a police officer?)

1691
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,980
- Did you bring 1 item?
- 1 item.

1692
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,360
Things are becoming clear.

1693
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,500
The ones who didn't bring any items
can't be the chairperson.

1694
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,500
They didn't do their best.

1695
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,670
Perhaps they did it on purpose
in order to avoid suspicion.

1696
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,400
- Really?
- I don't know if they are...

1697
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,360
the chairperson or a police officer,
but I have my eyes on a few people.

1698
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,710
- It's obvious.
- Is Jong Kook going at it again?

1699
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:28,710
I am not it, right?

1700
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,230
- Kwang Soo isn't it.
- Okay!

1701
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:33,650
Kwang Soo isn't it.
Kwang Soo isn't it.

1702
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,070
I didn't try my best
during the foot volleyball match.

1703
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,540
- What?
- Never mind.

1704
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,750
- I was just saying.
- Why are you mumbling?

1705
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:44,110
- Seriously.
- Why are you so unsure?

1706
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:45,860
There is no way Won Hee is it.

1707
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,230
- Won Hee isn't it.
- For goodness' sake.

1708
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:49,460
I am giving you a hint.

1709
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,920
Let's move on.

1710
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,360
I will now give you
the rules of the final race.

1711
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,000
It's Tomb Robbers versus Betrayers.

1712
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,570
- Betrayers.
- Tomb Robbers versus Betrayers.

1713
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:01,360
If the chairperson
or the two police officers are out,

1714
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,000
the race ends right away.

1715
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:07,170
When everyone is dispersed
before the race...

1716
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,650
(When everyone is dispersed
before the race...)

1717
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,340
Is that really necessary?

1718
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,750
Before the race...

1719
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,650
(Listening)

1720
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,360
- What are you doing?
- I am listening carefully.

1721
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,420
We look like robbers, right?

1722
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,480
- Suk Jin is covering his ears.
- Seriously.

1723
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,630
The sound resonates this way.

1724
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:22,060
Before the race begins,

1725
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:25,130
(The robbers don't want to miss
a word from the producer.)

1726
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,960
- every criminal will get...
- Every criminal.

1727
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,170
- one chance of betrayal.
- Betrayal.

1728
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,860
(Every criminal will get
one chance of betrayal.)

1729
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,630
One chance?

1730
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,340
- What is that?
- Do we only get one chance?

1731
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,520
If you betray the chairperson
and side with the police officers,

1732
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,440
the odds of the penalty change.

1733
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,840
(The odds of the penalty change.)

1734
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,590
The number of members doesn't matter
with Team Police.

1735
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:50,380
If Team Police loses,
one member will get the penalty.

1736
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,960
(If Team Police loses,
1 member will get the penalty.)

1737
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,630
But if Team Chairperson loses,

1738
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,500
everyone except for one member
will get the penalty.

1739
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,290
(Everyone except for 1 member
will get the penalty.)

1740
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,230
(A betrayal brings down the odds
of getting a penalty.)

1741
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:02,270
Then...

1742
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:05,540
- I should betray.
- You can join Team Police...

1743
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,230
- to avoid the penalty.
- The chairperson...

1744
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,340
and the robbers are
on the same team, right?

1745
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,480
- That's the case now.
- If you betray...

1746
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,480
You can betray.

1747
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,150
If you think about the odds...

1748
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,270
Everyone will betray
the chairperson.

1749
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,070
However, not everyone can betray.

1750
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,150
Are there limits?

1751
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,840
Members who want to betray
and join Team Police...

1752
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,020
- must pay the price.
- We need money.

1753
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,130
The price will be revealed
when you go to your spot.

1754
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,250
- We need money.
- I bet it's expensive.

1755
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,400
- You can't betray if you are poor.
- There is a price.

1756
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,360
Once you decide to betray or not,

1757
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,520
you can use your mission money...

1758
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,360
to buy a hint on the police officers
or the chairperson.

1759
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,730
(Buy a hint on the police officers
or the chairperson.)

1760
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,130
If you make wrong deductions...

1761
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,040
and rip off
a fellow team member's name tag,

1762
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,130
you will be out right away.

1763
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,900
(You are out if you rip off
a fellow team member's name tag.)

1764
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:48,250
Please go to your spot...

1765
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,250
to decide on the betrayal
and purchase a hint.

1766
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

1767
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,540
(What will become
of the Tomb Robbery Association?)

1768
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,960
(Current amount of money: Jong Kook,
Je Hoon, Suk Jin, Se Chan, So Min,)

1769
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,750
(Jae Suk, Haha, Won Hee, Ji Hyo,
and Kwang Soo)

1770
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:00,480
When will you tell me
how much I need to betray?

1771
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,500
Hurry up and tell me.
I have a lot of money.

1772
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,460
I have 12,000 dollars.

1773
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:10,230
The current amount of money
you have is 23,000 dollars.

1774
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,570
The price of the betrayal.

1775
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:14,540
(The price of the betrayal is...)

1776
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,230
The price of the betrayal is
7,000 dollars.

1777
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,230
(7,000 dollars.)

1778
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,770
- And...
- It's quite expensive.

1779
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,480
- 7,000 dollars.
- What?

1780
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,610
7,000 dollars.

1781
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,380
(Since Jae Suk has 9,000 dollars,
the betrayal will take everything.)

1782
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,540
(Will he betray the team
or stay loyal?)

1783
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,610
This is driving me crazy.

1784
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:31,380
The price of the betrayal is
7,000 dollars.

1785
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,730
It isn't that expensive, but...

1786
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,560
7,000... 7,000 dollars?

1787
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,860
Then I have just the amount.

1788
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,860
There must be members
who can't afford to betray.

1789
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,860
That's right.
They might not have enough money.

1790
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,840
- Am I in the last place?
- You are in the last place.

1791
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:46,900
Among all the members?

1792
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,380
(He is in the last place
among 10 members.)

1793
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,040
7,000 dollars?

1794
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,000
(Se Chan has 18,000 dollars.)

1795
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,170
I will betray!

1796
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,170
(I will betray!)

1797
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,340
It's in my nature.

1798
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,750
I need to avoid the penalty.

1799
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,380
Since there are two police officers,
they are more likely to win.

1800
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,880
Okay. I will buy it.

1801
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,090
I have to buy it.

1802
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,670
Since I have enough money,
betrayal seems like a good choice.

1803
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,570
- I will betray.
- Okay.

1804
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,960
Kwang Soo and a few others...

1805
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,570
- will betray.
- A lot of people will betray.

1806
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:18,570
(Some of them could be police offers
who are acting.)

1807
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,230
Betrayal?

1808
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,040
(This man is torn.)

1809
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,810
I don't know. Should I betray?

1810
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:29,170
People shouldn't betray.

1811
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,210
(People shouldn't betray.)

1812
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,210
(How will it be?)

1813
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,540
How will it be?

1814
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,210
There is no reason for me...

1815
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,250
(There is no reason for me...)

1816
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,060
to betray.

1817
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,810
(Je Hoon announces that there is
no reason for him to betray.)

1818
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,250
(1 hour before the shoot
at E Cafe in Yangpyeong)

1819
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,830
You two are undercover officers
who received tip-offs...

1820
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:11,560
and infiltrated
Tomb Robbery Association.

1821
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:16,060
You win if you find and eliminate
the chairperson.

1822
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,270
I will give you
the price of the items.

1823
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:20,770
(They memorized
the price of the items in advance.)

1824
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:23,310
(He got relatively cheap items
during the 1st robbery...)

1825
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,080
(in order to avoid suspicion.)

1826
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:29,770
(Then he succeeded to get
a statue...)

1827
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:32,140
(during the 2nd robbery.)

1828
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,250
(He acquired 10,000 dollars.)

1829
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,750
(Je Hoon, a police officer,
blended in with the robbers.)

1830
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,620
I will find the robbers who betrayed
the association...

1831
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,620
and ask them...

1832
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,500
to identify the chairperson.

1833
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,060
(Among
the four new police officers...)

1834
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:52,870
(is a police officer
who didn't need to betray.)

1835
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,560
(Meanwhile, other members)

1836
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,710
I won't betray.

1837
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,410
- I won't betray.
- I won't betray.

1838
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:58,600
I will stay on this team.

1839
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,770
I will say that I used my money.

1840
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,910
"I used 7,000 dollars..."

1841
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:05,210
"and became a police officer."
I will say that.

1842
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,750
That's the loyalty
of the tomb robber family.

1843
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,290
(The chairperson is hiding
among them.)

1844
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,680
- You could purchase a hint.
- Okay.

1845
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,750
It's 10,000 dollars per hint.

1846
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,180
What are you playing at?

1847
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,980
What are you playing at?

1848
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,160
Unfortunately...

1849
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,520
How could a hint be
more expensive...

1850
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,330
than the betrayal?

1851
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,890
Is a hint more expensive?

1852
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:26,100
(He only has 3,000 dollars.)

1853
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,430
- There are two types of hints.
- Okay.

1854
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:32,830
One type lets you inquire about
a specific member's affiliation.

1855
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:35,250
(- What's A's affiliation?
- A is a member of Team Police.)

1856
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,850
The other type
lets you inquire about...

1857
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:40,450
the chairperson
or a police officer's identity.

1858
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,910
(- The chairperson!
- The chairperson is a comedian.)

1859
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:46,850
I brought two statues earlier.

1860
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,620
They cost 10,000 dollars each.

1861
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,750
There were other people
who brought them.

1862
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,200
I will inquire about Je Hoon.

1863
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,620
He is too suspicious.

1864
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:59,460
(Jong Kook receives a password.)

1865
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,100
(He needs to find and open
the hint box to receive the hint!)

1866
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:07,270
Then I will buy two hints
on the police officers.

1867
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,580
Since there are people
I am suspicious about,

1868
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,770
the hints will make me certain.

1869
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:13,210
The hints will narrow them down.

1870
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,810
Firstly, Jong Kook...

1871
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,210
made a lot of money...

1872
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,020
during the robberies.

1873
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,390
I think...

1874
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,500
there is a chance...

1875
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:29,390
he knew the price of each item
because is the chairperson.

1876
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:33,000
I will buy a hint
on Jong Kook's affiliation.

1877
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,600
Then I will use 10,000 dollars...

1878
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,370
to buy a hint on the chairperson.

1879
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:42,540
(5 robbers versus 5 police officers)

1880
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,640
Actually,

1881
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,020
if I were a police officer,

1882
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,060
I would stick
with the other police officer.

1883
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:53,060
(Serious)

1884
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:55,620
(Cawing)

1885
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,160
The crows are laughing at you.

1886
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,890
They didn't laugh. They cried.

1887
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:00,890
They cried.

1888
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:04,060
Crows cry, not laugh.

1889
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,230
(Even crows would laugh...)

1890
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:07,330
You drive me crazy.

1891
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:08,660
(at his simple-minded deduction.)

1892
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,770
Where could the lock be?

1893
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:15,580
(What?)

1894
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,140
Je Hoon, where are you going?

1895
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,310
(He finds Jae Suk,
a robber who hasn't betrayed.)

1896
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:19,350
Mr. Chairperson.

1897
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,850
- Mr. Chairperson?
- Yes.

1898
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,040
Why are you calling me that?

1899
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:23,620
Mr. Chairperson.

1900
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,250
- Hey.
- I will be loyal to you.

1901
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,750
- Did I become the chairperson?
- Yes.

1902
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:29,350
- Je Hoon, I am not the chairperson.
- Really?

1903
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,580
Yes.

1904
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,430
(The rookie police officer's tactic
isn't very effective.)

1905
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,100
(Isn't he the police officer?)

1906
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:37,770
- Ms. Chairwoman.
- Hello.

1907
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,040
(His next target is Ji Hyo,
a robber.)

1908
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,200
You must be exhausted.

1909
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,100
Gosh, I am exhausted.

1910
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,660
(He doesn't gain
any helpful information.)

1911
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:45,930
Mr. Chairperson.

1912
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,000
You are here.

1913
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,850
You aren't it.

1914
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:52,210
(He figured out
that Haha is an underling.)

1915
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,870
- You aren't it.
- I was happy for a second.

1916
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:57,140
Jae Suk, how much money
did you have?

1917
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:58,910
- Me?
- You had some money, right?

1918
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,850
- I didn't have a lot.
- Really?

1919
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,430
According to Suk Jin,

1920
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:04,430
- the statues cost 10,000 dollars.
- Really?

1921
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,460
That's what Suk Jin said.
He stole a statue...

1922
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,270
- and got 10,000 dollars.
- I got it too.

1923
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:11,770
- You and So Min stole one each.
- Me too.

1924
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:13,230
- Did you steal one?
- I stole one.

1925
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,310
Jong Kook stole 2
during the 1st robbery.

1926
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:17,060
He got 20,000 dollars.

1927
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:21,480
What are you doing
during an important conversation?

1928
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:23,250
What are you doing?

1929
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,000
- Did you just pick your nose?
- Why did you pick your nose?

1930
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,910
Can't I pick my nose?

1931
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:29,210
We were having
an important conversation.

1932
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,750
This much finger went inside.
Did you see that?

1933
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,910
What?

1934
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:32,980
He picked his nose.

1935
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,790
- What about it?
- I mean,

1936
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:36,230
you didn't scratch your nose.

1937
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,730
You picked your nose for real.

1938
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:38,750
For goodness' sake.

1939
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,000
Why wouldn't I do that?

1940
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:41,700
Ji Hyo, did you have a lot of money?

1941
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,960
In any case,

1942
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,270
we should gather information.

1943
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,870
Let's find the hints.

1944
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,270
- I mean, treasures.
- During the second robbery,

1945
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,230
I didn't make any money.

1946
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,160
- Se Chan.
- Yes, Jong Kook?

1947
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,870
- You punk.
- Jong Kook.

1948
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,640
Did you betray?

1949
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:58,370
- I can't tell you about that.
- You are right.

1950
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:59,540
Right now...

1951
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,120
Hold on. You have a lot of money.

1952
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:05,020
Hold on. What makes you think
that I have a lot of money?

1953
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,060
- Hold on.
- I know you do.

1954
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:10,060
It's strange that you know
how much money...

1955
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,680
- I have.
- Hold on.

1956
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,520
- You are like a judge.
- Listen.

1957
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,370
I will be honest with you.

1958
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,930
I received a lot of money...

1959
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,770
for the items I brought back.

1960
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,730
Then I did some calculations...

1961
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:24,730
and figured out
that you made a lot of money.

1962
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,270
Jong Kook, be careful.

1963
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,770
It's not like that. The way...

1964
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:30,480
- he talks...
- Are you on his side now?

1965
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,020
Now that Jong Kook
isn't suspicious of you,

1966
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,350
you seem confident.

1967
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:36,120
- This is insane.
- Did you get a hint already?

1968
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,410
- Not yet.
- Right? Of course, you didn't.

1969
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,460
But hints are meaningless,
Kwang Soo.

1970
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,120
I already have candidates
on my radar.

1971
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,390
(The 2 of them are
on Jong Kook's radar.)

1972
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:48,730
I just need to go and check.

1973
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:51,000
Won Hee isn't a police officer.

1974
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,200
- He is just...
- No, he isn't.

1975
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,870
- He is just here as a guest.
- Jong Kook.

1976
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,830
He just came here to play
a game of foot volleyball.

1977
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,870
That's why he came today.

1978
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,980
(Walking around)

1979
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,600
- Won Hee!
- Yes?

1980
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,100
What are you looking for?

1981
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,250
Money.

1982
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:07,910
(What does he mean?)

1983
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:08,980
I am looking for money.

1984
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,410
(Won Hee still doesn't understand
the rules.)

1985
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,750
It's hard to get a hint.

1986
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,750
I am looking for money.

1987
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:14,960
It's hard indeed.

1988
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,060
It would be so easy to take off
the name tag.

1989
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:19,850
It's not the time yet.

1990
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,770
- I got you already.
- You startled me.

1991
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:24,430
- I got you already.
- Really?

1992
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:25,770
You got me already.

1993
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:30,160
(Laughing)

1994
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,640
(Won Hee avoids
everyone's suspicion.)

1995
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,370
(Meanwhile, Je Hoon,
a rookie police officer,)

1996
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,180
(was looking for a hint box.)

1997
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,950
(He finally finds one.)

1998
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,270
There is a lock.

1999
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,580
(It's the number 2 hint box
he was looking for.)

2000
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,710
There we go.

2001
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:47,460
(A box containing a hint
on the chairperson)

2002
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:52,100
"The chairperson was born
after the month of May."

2003
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,600
(The chairperson was born
after the month of May.)

2004
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,890
(What?)

2005
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:58,020
Jong Kook was born on April 25.

2006
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:00,430
Then he isn't the chairperson.

2007
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:03,430
Oh, my goodness.

2008
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,310
(The strongest candidate,
Jong Kook, doesn't have a role.)

2009
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,230
Then Jong Kook doesn't have a role.

2010
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:09,980
(Jong Kook gets taken out.)

2011
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,370
Haha, Jae Suk...

2012
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:13,410
(The real chairperson is
among them.)

2013
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:17,950
Ji Hyo can't be it.

2014
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:19,750
No way.

2015
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,060
Hold on. There is a room.

2016
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,520
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook)

2017
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,750
What's the number? 20!

2018
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,100
It's the box I was looking for.

2019
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,250
I didn't know...

2020
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,270
there was a place like this.

2021
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:31,100
2457.

2022
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,160
(A hint on the 2 police officers
is inside.)

2023
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,410
2457.

2024
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:36,770
(He carefully punches in
the numbers.)

2025
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:38,910
Let's see it.

2026
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,270
("They debuted
after Kim Jong Kook did.")

2027
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,580
"They debuted
after Kim Jong Kook did."

2028
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,520
People who debuted after I did...

2029
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,750
That's too broad.

2030
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:51,410
"They debuted
after Kim Jong Kook did."

2031
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,160
- Jae Suk, I found another hint.
- What is it?

2032
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:56,120
The police officers debuted
after I did.

2033
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,060
Too many people fit
that description.

2034
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:01,620
Either Se Chan or So Min
could be a police officer.

2035
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:02,830
- It's entirely possible.
- Right?

2036
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,870
But I think So Min is...

2037
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,870
a former robber
who switched teams with money.

2038
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:09,540
- She would have done that.
- That's right.

2039
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,730
Then there are three.

2040
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,180
There are three police officers.

2041
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:13,910
Jae Suk.

2042
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,480
I need 2,000 dollars.
Hurry up and give them to me.

2043
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,350
- Jae Suk.
- She is energetic.

2044
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:19,480
There is something about her.

2045
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,180
Don't be like that.

2046
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,620
- Hey.
- Give me 2,000 dollars.

2047
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,450
You are older than me.
It's only 2,000 dollars...

2048
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,750
for me.

2049
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,480
Oh, those words make him weak.

2050
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,060
And I will give you...

2051
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,330
- 1,000 more dollars.
- Why?

2052
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,930
Why?

2053
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,560
- Why?
- Are you giving her more money?

2054
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:37,020
Go and use it.

2055
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,500
- There you go.
- Why?

2056
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,770
(Ripping)

2057
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,640
(He removes So Min's name tag!)

2058
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,230
Go and use it.

2059
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:47,710
Let's see it. Let's see the result.

2060
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:49,680
Go and use it.
Let's see it. Let's see the result.

2061
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,850
- You betrayed the association.
- I bet she did.

2062
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:53,270
- It's obvious.
- You can't say anything.

2063
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:56,790
(What was So Min's identity?)

2064
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:59,390
A robber-turned-police officer,
So Min is out.

2065
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,620
(A robber-turned-police officer,
So Min is out.)

2066
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,730
- It's you, isn't it?
- You betrayed us.

2067
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:04,960
- You betrayed us.
- Right.

2068
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,390
I was sure of it.

2069
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,350
We were talking about you,
and you suddenly appeared.

2070
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:10,100
So this is expenses for a journey.

2071
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:13,270
Yes, money for the journey
to the afterlife.

2072
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:14,540
Farewell, friend.

2073
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:16,660
- All right.
- I shouldn't have come here.

2074
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,230
I shouldn't have...

2075
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:19,230
(Taking the money back)

2076
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:21,500
A robber-turned-police officer,
So Min is out.

2077
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,500
(Team Police member,
So Min is out!)

2078
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,750
(Original police Je Hoon)

2079
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,870
(I should've protected her.)

2080
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,250
Whatever.

2081
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,620
(Moments after!)

2082
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:28,950
(Ripping!)

2083
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,140
What did you just do?

2084
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,020
A robber-turned-police officer,
Suk Jin is out.

2085
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,180
Who are you?

2086
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:36,680
(Team Police loses two members.)

2087
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,420
(So Min and Suk Jin are out
and Je Hoon is alive.)

2088
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:45,670
(So one of them
is the last of the original police.)

2089
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:48,630
(Jae Suk is looking
for a hint box.)

2090
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,930
(He finds a hint box.)

2091
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:54,770
(What kind of hint did he buy?)

2092
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,380
Tell me about Se Chan's identity.

2093
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,450
Yes.

2094
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:02,250
2, 4, 2, 7.

2095
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,450
(Opening the hint box)

2096
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,350
I knew it.

2097
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,390
(So what's Se Chan's identity?)

2098
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:14,330
(He's a police officer!)

2099
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:15,760
It was here, number 2.

2100
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,330
Je Hoon.

2101
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:18,500
Je Hoon, what was the number?

2102
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,540
(What was the original
police officer's number?)

2103
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:23,840
You two are undercover officers.
You will pretend to be criminals.

2104
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:25,060
So we're police officers?

2105
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:30,170
I'm glad. Normally, I get to be
robbers or bad guys.

2106
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,800
But I get to be an officer
because I'm with you.

2107
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,310
I'm an officer. Good.

2108
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,470
(They went undercover
to find the chairperson.)

2109
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,550
We can get a hint
with 2,000 dollars.

2110
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:37,680
- 2,000 dollars.
- Okay.

2111
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,750
(Handing 2,000 dollars)

2112
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,420
We want a hint on the chairperson.

2113
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:43,680
They suspect
that I'm a police officer.

2114
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,000
So you should make them think
you're the chairperson.

2115
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,390
- Then, use me as bait.
- Are you sure?

2116
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,520
Tell them you think
I'm the police officer.

2117
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,000
(I'm the chairperson.)

2118
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,100
- I am the chairperson.
- No, you're not.

2119
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,430
(And Yang Se Chan is
a police officer.)

2120
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,540
(He is the chairperson.)

2121
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:03,510
(There weren't many hints
in the beginning.)

2122
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:06,950
(So Je Hoon could avoid suspicion.)

2123
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,380
(Succeeded)

2124
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,980
This is a problem. We're in trouble.

2125
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,220
- We should rip off their name tags.
- But the good thing is...

2126
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,720
- Jong Kook isn't the chairperson.
- No.

2127
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,000
If we rip everyone else's name
tag off, we will win.

2128
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,630
(It may work if it isn't
Jong Kook's name tag.)

2129
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,500
Who eliminated So Min?

2130
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,930
Jae Suk did.

2131
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:27,260
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

2132
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,970
Did you know Se Chan
is the prime suspect?

2133
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:31,970
- I didn't know that.
- It's odd that you don't know that.

2134
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:33,540
How can you not know that?

2135
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,210
I didn't get any hints.

2136
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,880
It's not about the hint.

2137
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,250
I guess you betrayed us then.

2138
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,140
- No.
- He has the character to betray us.

2139
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,220
I didn't have any money.

2140
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:43,790
So Min said the same thing.

2141
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:45,120
"Jong Kook,
I didn't have any money."

2142
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,620
But I know Ji Hyo is a robber.

2143
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:49,790
Yes, I am.

2144
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:51,630
Because I got the hint.

2145
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,520
I'm a robber.

2146
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,460
You got the hint
that says she's a robber?

2147
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:57,420
- Well, I...
- Where did you get it?

2148
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,590
You can't carry the hint around.

2149
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:01,500
- No, you can't.
- This one's different.

2150
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,410
What do you mean? Let me see it.

2151
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,300
- Maybe he found it.
- He's lying. Look at him.

2152
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,230
- Show us.
- Let me see it.

2153
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,050
- That's the one they gave us.
- Yes.

2154
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,750
I have one too.

2155
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:12,840
(Kwang Soo shows them
a piece of paper and it says...)

2156
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,010
(Song Ji Hyo)

2157
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,310
You wrote it down.

2158
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:17,840
You found it up there, didn't you?

2159
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,380
I saw it lying around.

2160
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,010
They won't give us a hint
like that, you fool.

2161
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,890
(The one lying around
like Ji Hyo said)

2162
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,460
(Kwang Soo fabricated
the hint himself.)

2163
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:30,260
(He used his fake hint...)

2164
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:33,930
(to prove he's a member of
Tomb Robbery Association.)

2165
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,410
(So he used it again
to avoid suspicion.)

2166
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:39,800
Ji Hyo, I think he's trying
to avoid something.

2167
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,300
(His action caused more suspicion.)

2168
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,550
This is crazy.

2169
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:44,100
I'm not the one.

2170
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,600
Where are you going?

2171
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,050
(Testing)

2172
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,980
You're a robber.
Why would I eliminate you?

2173
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,960
Just rip it off.
You want to, don't you?

2174
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,290
- You're dying to take her name tag.
- Don't make that face.

2175
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:59,520
Everyone suspected that it was me.

2176
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:02,890
- If I were...
- Why are you framing Ji Hyo?

2177
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,390
I'm not.

2178
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,700
(Trying to get out of it)

2179
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,040
I want us to be on the same team.

2180
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,260
(Something isn't right.)

2181
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:11,010
Even if I were a police officer...

2182
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:12,340
(Grabbing)

2183
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:13,470
What are you doing?

2184
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,410
Kwang Soo, let's stop this.

2185
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:17,050
- Kwang Soo, sorry.
- Don't do this.

2186
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:18,100
- Don't do this.
- But...

2187
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,170
- You've been weird.
- Yes.

2188
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,510
- What?
- You've been acting weird.

2189
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,420
- We have to do this.
- Don't.

2190
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,640
Don't do this.

2191
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,010
(Right then)

2192
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,760
(The only way to survive
is to run away!)

2193
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,790
(They take action since they've
been fooled by him for 10 years.)

2194
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:33,020
(Finally, they rip off
Kwang Soo's name tag.)

2195
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,850
(I told you not to rip off
my name tag.)

2196
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,300
(They just eliminated
their own team member.)

2197
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,500
Jong Kook is out.

2198
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,470
(Robber Jong Kook is out.)

2199
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:42,930
(So Kwang Soo was a robber too.)

2200
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:44,710
- Seriously?
- I told you.

2201
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:45,880
(I told you we're on the same team.)

2202
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,100
Why were you acting so strangely?

2203
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,970
I wasn't acting strangely.
I was just trying...

2204
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:51,250
find the hint and money.

2205
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,670
You should've told us.

2206
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:54,750
I told you from this morning.

2207
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,840
- I said it from the beginning.
- Then why would you lie?

2208
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,480
Why would you lie about things?

2209
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,960
I have a sickness.

2210
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,180
What? A sickness?

2211
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,520
People suspect you because you lie.

2212
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,760
Why would you lie?

2213
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,920
It's just a sickness
I've had for a long time.

2214
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,670
If you know it's a sickness,
you should get treated.

2215
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,870
Kim Jong Kook, why are you out?

2216
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:14,540
- What?
- I eliminated Kwang Soo.

2217
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,430
Why would you rip
Kwang Soo's name tag off?

2218
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:20,540
He lied about something.

2219
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:22,300
He acts strangely all the time.

2220
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,710
Try to understand me.

2221
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:26,050
Come on. I thought he betrayed us.

2222
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:27,420
(They found out Kwang Soo's identity
by sacrificing Jong Kook.)

2223
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,310
- You should work harder for me.
- Just go.

2224
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:31,180
What is it?

2225
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,720
(He finds a hint box.)

2226
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,880
The chairperson made a debut
after 2000?

2227
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,550
(Debuted after 2000?)

2228
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:42,520
(So the chairperson
is either Kwang Soo or Ji Hyo.)

2229
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,720
The chairperson made a debut
after 2000.

2230
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,340
After 2000?

2231
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,840
It's either Ji Hyo or Kwang Soo.

2232
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,210
- Did you betray them?
- Yes.

2233
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,260
Good.

2234
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,710
They must be looking for you.

2235
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:56,010
Hey, Yang Se Chan
is a police officer.

2236
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,450
- And Je Hoon?
- He's an officer too.

2237
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:58,840
Who's the chairperson then?

2238
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,880
Are you the chairperson?

2239
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,310
- No.
- You couldn't do it?

2240
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:03,420
- Didn't you have money?
- I only had 3,000 dollars.

2241
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:05,420
- He didn't have any money.
- Me neither.

2242
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:06,660
Is it Won Hee then?

2243
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:07,660
(Is Won Hee the chairperson?)

2244
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:08,680
Is it Won Hee then?

2245
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,720
(Is Won Hee the chairperson?)

2246
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,920
- Won Hee is...
- Is everyone here a robber?

2247
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,550
- Won Hee is the chairperson?
- I'm a robber.

2248
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,130
I'm really a robber.

2249
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:15,160
I am too.

2250
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:18,020
If Won Hee is the chairperson
he's in big trouble.

2251
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,300
But...

2252
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:21,700
Se Chan and Jae Hoon
went up there.

2253
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,130
- Then we should...
- Wait.

2254
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,800
get Yang Se Chan right now.

2255
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,880
Or the chairperson...

2256
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,580
Won Hee can't run around like this.

2257
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,710
They both went up.

2258
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,640
He couldn't trust us so he went up.

2259
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,300
What's wrong with him?

2260
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,420
I think they believe that you are...

2261
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,420
Well, they're going to attack me.

2262
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,450
But they won't attack you.
So you should attack them.

2263
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:40,660
It's either Ji Hyo...

2264
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,010
- or Kwang Soo.
- Yes, those two.

2265
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,880
So you should take the lead
and attack them.

2266
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,460
- Get Ji Hyo.
- Yes, either one of them.

2267
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:48,500
I don't think you can win Kwang Soo.

2268
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,670
But I don't think
you can win Ji Hyo either.

2269
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:52,540
Do you think you're strong enough?

2270
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,390
It's not like I can rip it off
after asking her.

2271
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:55,730
You should rip it off
when her guard is down.

2272
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:56,870
How can do that?

2273
01:14:57,710 --> 01:14:59,300
- They're professionals.
- I can't do it though.

2274
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,380
You should go down.

2275
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,430
They're not suspecting you.

2276
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,470
Everyone thinks you're a ghost.

2277
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:05,250
So just wander around.

2278
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,750
They don't even imagine...

2279
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,080
that you will
rip their name tags off.

2280
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,720
So let's call this "Ghost Mission".

2281
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,880
- So just rip it?
- Yes. "Ghost Mission."

2282
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,180
Okay. I'll do that.

2283
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,310
I should've just fought.

2284
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,760
- It's Won Hee.
- Where?

2285
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,920
- Won Hee!
- Where is he?

2286
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,130
Won Hee!

2287
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,390
Won Hee, come here!

2288
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,520
- Why?
- What?

2289
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,830
You're the chairperson, aren't you?

2290
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:24,800
Am I the chairperson?
What are you talking about?

2291
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:26,800
You should tell us now.

2292
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,870
- Tell you what?
- You have to be the chairperson.

2293
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:30,870
What?
What are you talking about?

2294
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:32,670
Won Hee needs to pull through.

2295
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:33,710
My gosh.

2296
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:34,910
- There they are.
- Won Hee.

2297
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:35,950
They're sticking to each other now.

2298
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,410
Yes, they are.

2299
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:39,450
Won Hee, what happened?

2300
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,420
I found out. It's not me. It's him.

2301
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:42,750
Won Hee is the one.

2302
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:46,350
- He's the one.
- How can you prove it?

2303
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:48,260
What? I have the hint.

2304
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:49,480
- Show us.
- What?

2305
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,630
Prove it.

2306
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,090
I have a hint too.

2307
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,260
(Team Police can't attack
because they're outnumbered.)

2308
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,670
Wait a minute.

2309
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:57,700
I didn't do anything.

2310
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:59,930
(He suddenly touched
Jae Suk's name tag.)

2311
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,370
I'm not sure of anything.

2312
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:02,630
Just calm down.

2313
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,060
You can trust me.

2314
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,800
- Aren't you a police officer?
- No!

2315
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,910
It's Won Hee. Just trust me.

2316
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:09,080
It's not me.

2317
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,800
- It's really not me. Please.
- Are you sure?

2318
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,550
What are you doing behind her?

2319
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:15,120
(Kwang Soo caught him.)

2320
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,120
What were you doing?

2321
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,790
He was looking at their name tags.

2322
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:21,510
- Why did you do that?
- Why did you?

2323
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:22,550
My goodness.

2324
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:24,680
Kwang Soo isn't for sure.

2325
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,020
Who eliminated Jong Kook?

2326
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,090
We can't tell you that.

2327
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:30,420
(Won Hee slowly approaches someone.)

2328
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,090
(Staring)

2329
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,430
(It's not a good time
to attack right now.)

2330
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,100
(Very worried)

2331
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,340
(Everyone's here.)

2332
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,970
(And he's getting closer
to Ji Hyo from behind.)

2333
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:44,750
- Wait. What?
- What is he doing?

2334
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:49,050
(Everyone can't believe it but
he ripped off Ji Hyo's name tag.)

2335
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:50,980
He's a police officer.

2336
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:52,590
You did it when everyone's around?

2337
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,220
- What was that?
- I can't believe it.

2338
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,680
Song Ji Hyo is out.

2339
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,660
(A robber, Song Ji Hyo is out!)

2340
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:01,220
Are you a police officer?

2341
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:03,700
(That means the chairperson
is Kwang Soo!)

2342
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:05,500
(So they found out
who the chairperson is.)

2343
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,470
- Are you a robber?
- What? I can't trust anyone.

2344
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:09,670
- Then we should get him too.
- What's going on?

2345
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,100
(Ripping off his name tag
mercilessly)

2346
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,630
(But right then!)

2347
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,250
(While everyone
is watching Won Hee,)

2348
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:19,450
(Se Chan attacks Kwang Soo!)

2349
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:21,420
- What?
- Here we go.

2350
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,550
(The moment they figured out
everyone's identity...)

2351
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:24,840
Hey, Je Hoon!

2352
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,260
- Je Hoon!
- Get Kwang Soo!

2353
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:27,920
- Hey, get him!
- Kwang Soo!

2354
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,260
No, you can't do this!

2355
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:30,920
- It's Kwang Soo.
- No, wait!

2356
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,350
Je Hoon, it's Kwang Soo.

2357
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:34,720
Come on.
Take Se Chan's name tag off!

2358
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,020
(Je Hoon's attacking Kwang Soo
the chairperson!)

2359
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,970
Why would you take it off
when everyone's around?

2360
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:41,760
- I wasn't supposed to do that?
- No.

2361
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,130
(Tomb Robbery Association will lose
if they get Kwang Soo!)

2362
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,540
Je Hoon!

2363
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,250
(He got Je Hoon's name tag!)

2364
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,550
- No!
- Je Hoon!

2365
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:52,810
(Original police, Lee Je Hoon
is out!)

2366
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,010
- Gosh, he took mine.
- Come here!

2367
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:55,770
- Eliminate Se Chan!
- No.

2368
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:58,620
(If they get Se Chan,
Team Robbers will win.)

2369
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,310
- Eliminate Se Chan!
- No.

2370
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:01,480
(The situation has changed.)

2371
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:03,380
Rip it off.

2372
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:05,020
(The original officer Yang Se Chan
is out.)

2373
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:07,920
Both officers have been eliminated.

2374
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
(Team Robber wins.)

2375
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,590
(Touched)

2376
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,870
It was intense until the end.

2377
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:16,230
I almost got my name tag
ripped off.

2378
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:19,630
Won Hee. Won Hee!

2379
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,580
What did I tell you?

2380
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:24,410
I told you to rip Ji Hyo's name tag
off when there was no one around.

2381
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:25,910
There are so many people.

2382
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,310
You think they're ghosts or what?

2383
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:29,220
- In front of nobody?
- What was that?

2384
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:30,880
I'm supposed to rip it off
in front of nobody?

2385
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:32,790
- Why did you do that?
- If I have to rip it off...

2386
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,120
How can I rip it off
in front of nobody?

2387
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,980
You did the opposite.

2388
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:37,880
- What's wrong with him?
- Did I ruin it?

2389
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,800
I was surprised.

2390
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,160
Did I do it wrong? What's going on?
I'm sorry.

2391
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,390
I don't know how the rule works.

2392
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:46,060
Our last hint was after 2000,

2393
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,390
- so there were only two.
- Right.

2394
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,510
- So...
- Are you the chairperson?

2395
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:51,600
- Yes.
- I knew it.

2396
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:53,800
You are...

2397
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,080
(Lee Kwang Soo, chairperson
of Tomb Robbery Association)

2398
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:59,510
(Chairperson Kwang Soo
knew the price.)

2399
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:02,640
(He robbed only cheap items
to avoid suspicion.)

2400
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:05,680
(As a result, he escaped
from Jong Kook's radar.)

2401
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,510
(He used money as an excused
and acted like a robber.)

2402
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,380
(Kwang Soo found out
that Suk Jin was a police officer.)

2403
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,880
(Ripping off)

2404
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:16,890
(It was Kwang Soo who eliminated
Suk Jin.)

2405
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,170
(The chairperson hid
his identity...)

2406
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:24,870
(and worked secretly.)

2407
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:29,880
- Gosh.
- I knew it.

2408
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:31,770
- That was close.
- You tried so hard too.

2409
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:33,120
- It was you.
- You should've told me.

2410
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,290
We won thanks to Won Hee.

2411
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:37,880
I couldn't believe Won Hee.

2412
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,310
The winner of Robber versus Robber:
Faceless King of Tomb Robbery is...

2413
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,130
Team Chairperson.

2414
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,980
That's us.

2415
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:48,220
There was a reason Kwang Soo...

2416
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:50,200
- didn't betray us.
- He had an unavoidable reason.

2417
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,200
He couldn't because
he's the chairperson.

2418
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:55,340
The chairperson should pick
one person to receive the prize.

2419
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,600
- That's...
- Really?

2420
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,230
- Yes.
- That's nice.

2421
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:00,970
The prize is a luxury teacup.

2422
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,210
Pick one person.

2423
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:04,770
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Sure.

2424
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:06,080
- She matches the teacup.
- Yes.

2425
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,790
- It's pretty. It's expensive.
- This is nice.

2426
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:12,090
- Ji Hyo. It's perfect for soju.
- Right.

2427
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:14,010
- It's just one sip.
- That's awesome.

2428
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:16,380
One person from Team Police...

2429
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,420
- will receive a penalty.
- That's what's important.

2430
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:19,590
- This is why I had to betray.
- I wish it's Suk Jin.

2431
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:20,960
- Today's penalty is...
- What is it?

2432
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,890
- the water basin bomb.
- What? Water basin?

2433
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,700
It's going to be cold.

2434
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,700
- That's perfect.
- It's going to be cold.

2435
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,970
I wish the person who betrayed
should be it.

2436
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,430
- That's better.
- From there,

2437
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:31,260
- pick one, Won Hee.
- Here.

2438
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,800
- I'm safe.
- You passed.

2439
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,540
I'll go next.

2440
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,450
(2nd betrayer Suk Jin)

2441
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:39,100
(It's him.)

2442
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:42,080
(Betrayer Suk Jin will
receive the penalty.)

2443
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:44,590
What happened? How did it go?

2444
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,260
It's a party.

2445
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,290
- How did it go?
- It's a party. This is nice.

2446
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:50,480
- The betrayer gets the water basin.
- To the betrayer.

2447
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,590
My goodness.

2448
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:53,390
- I just had to pick that one.
- It's heavy.

2449
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,300
- It's heavy.
- It just had to be that one.

2450
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,890
How do you want it?

2451
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:59,020
- 1, 2, 3.
- Sprinkle at once.

2452
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,590
Slowly. Yes. That's it.

2453
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,540
(A cool water bomb to a betrayer)

2454
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:04,910
(It's too cold to speak.)

2455
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:06,300
That's awesome.

2456
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:07,800
(Wet)

2457
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,170
- It's a water cannon.
- That was a good one.

2458
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:10,580
He's completely wet.

2459
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:13,310
- That was a good one.
- You totally got me.

2460
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:15,510
Good job. Suk Jin is good.

2461
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:17,250
- It was good.
- Good work.

2462
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,010
- Good work.
- Good work.

2463
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:21,790
(Finally)

2464
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:25,420
(It's the Jeju Island Special.)

2465
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,390
(They haven't been to the sea
for a long time.)

2466
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,870
(They all feel great
by the sea breeze.)

2467
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:32,520
(The island with wind,
rocks, and women)

2468
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:34,800
(Han Ji Eun, So E Hyun)

2469
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,710
(Choi Yeo Jin, Lee Ju Bin)

2470
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:39,600
(Jeju Restaurant Tour...)

2471
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,910
(is what they wished.)

2472
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,910
(Just because they came
all the way to Jeju Island,)

2473
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:44,510
(it doesn't mean
they all can have fun.)

2474
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:47,170
- Meow.
- Come on.

2475
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:49,010
(Extraordinary strong girls'...)

2476
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:50,680
(ruthless match)

2477
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,790
(Dirty fight in Jeju Island)

2478
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:54,760
(She went to school with So Min.)

2479
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:58,880
(There is an awkward reunion
with a schoolmate.)

2480
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,000
Hey.

2481
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,300
(There's tension between the two.)

2482
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:04,590
(Extraordinary relationship)

2483
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:05,700
(What will happen to them?)

2484
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,420
(The Jeju Island Special:
Wind, Women, Rocks, and Bombs)
