00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,760
(Sanjicheon on Jeju Island
with the blue sea and blue sky)

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,370
(There's Sanjitmul Park
next to Sanjicheon.)

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,660
My gosh.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,800
Hello, guys.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,430
(The members are
gathering at the park.)

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,010
Seok Sam.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,010
(Seok Sam.)

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,370
- Excuse me.
- Seok Sam.

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,370
- Excuse me.
- Come here, Seok Sam.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,550
You haven't taught me anything
for the past 15 years.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,080
(Human Cultural Asset Jae Suk,
and his pupil, Seok Sam)

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,510
- Do you want me to leave?
- Stay quiet, Seok Sam.

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,550
- This is just...
- Don't talk too much.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,460
You just let me do the laundry.

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,560
So you're Seok Sam.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,560
- He's Ji Seok Sam.
- Hello.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,360
(Assistant Manager Haha,
new recruit Jong Kook)

18
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,200
Hello.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,740
(Math Olympiad winner Ji Hyo,
Math Olympiad runner-up Kwang Soo)

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,070
Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,640
(Se Chan and So Min are
wearing matching outfits.)

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,930
Nice to meet you.

24
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,140
(A newly married couple,
Se Chan and So Min)

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,810
Nice to meet you.
I guess you are married.

26
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,640
- Right.
- We've been married for a year.

27
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,740
So you're on a trip to Jeju Island.

28
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,710
But the husband...

29
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,020
Is the husband rich?

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,110
(Is the husband rich?)

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,460
What's that supposed to mean?

32
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,050
He's a rich man with a lot of teeth.

33
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,460
I do have many teeth.

34
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,550
- So...
- What did you do for a living?

35
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,750
- I ran my own business.
- What business?

36
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,020
I used to handle big money.

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,130
What did you do?

38
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,190
He runs a restaurant.

39
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,970
- A restaurant?
- Spicy catfish stew.

40
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,630
- Spicy catfish stew.
- A restaurant.

41
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,630
- Do you live in Paju?
- Yes. How did you know?

42
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,330
He sells spicy catfish
and Korean bullhead stew.

43
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,030
- It tastes really good.
- You should visit my restaurant.

44
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,640
I'll offer a discount of 15 percent.

45
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,750
So what brings you two here?

46
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,750
I said I didn't want
to come to Jeju Island.

47
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,820
Don't raise your voice
when there are people around.

48
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,020
- Honey...
- My goodness.

49
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,550
- I mean...
- Don't embarrass me.

50
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,380
I'm sorry, but who picked out
your sunglasses?

51
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,550
Why? Aren't they nice?
I picked them.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,830
- You look pretty.
- Honey.

53
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,660
You look great.

54
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,530
- You two...
- You're so pretty.

55
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,710
Don't make fun of her.
She looks pretty.

56
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,740
Why did you marry him?

57
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,070
- Seok Sam.
- Yes?

58
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,080
- Don't be nosy.
- What? Hey.

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,800
I like their skit.

60
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,140
Seok Sam is too nosy.

61
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,270
- I'm sorry.
- You should talk to him.

62
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,350
Sir, I just said 1 word
while you said 5.

63
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,190
Seok Sam, just stay quiet.

64
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,160
- Seok Sam.
- Watch your language.

65
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,160
- Is his name Seok Sam?
- Yes.

66
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,950
- Like how you count numbers.
- I see.

67
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,160
- Seok Sam means three.
- That's what it means.

68
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,070
I've never seen him paint.

69
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,130
- I've never seen his work.
- I do an ink-and-wash painting.

70
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,840
- An ink painting.
- I just saw him draw a mustache.

71
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,100
Sure. It's a kind of ink painting.

72
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,530
- He does draw pictures.
- Sure.

73
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,940
- Are you sure?
- Don't worry.

74
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,540
Are you Math Olympiad winners?
It sounds far-fetched.

75
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,700
- I was a runner-up.
- I was the winner.

76
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,910
I know this is a skit,
but it should be plausible.

77
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,380
- What's wrong about this?
- All right then.

78
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,750
Since you are
the Math Olympiad winners,

79
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,750
please tell us about
the Pythagorean theorem.

80
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,250
Or the quadratic formula.
Just anything.

81
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,350
It's not something
anyone can understand.

82
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,630
- What is she talking about?
- It's not easy.

83
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,820
She says things that aren't
relevant to the question.

84
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,030
Do you know what an equation is?

85
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,570
You should make it more convincing.

86
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,630
- This is far-fetched.
- I know.

87
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,380
And all we can say about math
is an equation and...

88
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,630
- And quadratic formula.
- Quadratic formula.

89
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,970
What is 3.14?

90
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,850
- Pi.
- That's enough.

91
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,910
- Stop it.
- Root.

92
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,880
He's acting as if he knows a lot.
My goodness.

93
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,650
- What did you say?
- I was talking to myself.

94
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,880
- What was that?
- Well...

95
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,120
You should speak clearly.

96
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,750
- It's my bad. I'm sorry.
- You understand?

97
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,450
- Are you a new recruit?
- Yes, I'm a newbie.

98
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,350
So he's your superior.

99
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,290
- That's right. He's my subordinate.
- He's an assistant manager.

100
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,290
And I'm a newbie.

101
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,870
But what kind of
assistant manager are you?

102
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,370
- Do you have other work experience?
- With your hands in your pockets.

103
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,970
I guess you used to be
in a different business.

104
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,030
- Right. I made a career change.
- I knew it.

105
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,440
I was in a different business.

106
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,750
That's right. Our company is
known for giving a second chance.

107
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,380
He has broad shoulders.

108
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,850
His shoulders look different.

109
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,250
That's right. We are gangsters.

110
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,440
(That's right. We are gangsters.)

111
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,650
- But he looks so nice and kind.
- He's nice.

112
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,280
- He seems good-natured.
- They're not intimidating.

113
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,090
We're in charge of debt collection.

114
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,320
(We can help you
with debt collection.)

115
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,930
Today, you guys are here
for a package tour.

116
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,760
You are groups of two,
and you guys don't know each other.

117
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,130
Now you will take a Running
package tour around Jeju Island.

118
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,130
So you should pay
for the tour package.

119
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,500
You have 50 dollars
in your mission bags now.

120
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,880
- 50 dollars?
- You will scatter...

121
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,180
and put the amount you are willing
to pay in an envelope secretly.

122
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,840
The mission fund is very important
for today's race.

123
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,050
So you should think carefully
before you pay.

124
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,420
Is there the minimum amount
we have to pay?

125
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,860
Can I not pay at all?

126
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,990
It's up to you. Just put the amount
you want in an envelope.

127
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,090
He's not telling us if we should
pay a lot or not.

128
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,260
I guess we should pay
a reasonable amount.

129
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,300
- It might be better to pay a lot.
- That might be better.

130
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,960
I think we should pay a lot.

131
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,110
(I think we should pay a lot.)

132
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,940
- Make it big.
- I was going to do that.

133
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,040
(The newlyweds decided
to pay a lot.)

134
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,330
Gosh, I should put some money
in here.

135
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,380
(Passing by)

136
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,500
- It's very thin.
- For this once, I should...

137
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,050
Why did you pay so much?

138
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,250
- Do you know something?
- Well...

139
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,210
I thought about it, and if you
calculate it mathematically,

140
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,250
multiplying it by 2 or 3
should work best.

141
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,930
- That's nonsense.
- "That's nonsense"?

142
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,750
Why would a human cultural asset...

143
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,520
I paid a moderate amount.

144
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,670
I also paid a moderate amount.

145
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,230
(People who paid a little,
People who paid a lot)

146
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,890
You paid a lot.

147
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,090
I thought we should pay a lot.

148
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,200
- We collected all entry fees.
- Yes.

149
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,330
Today is
the You Must Do Everything...

150
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,040
If You Get Caught
Package Option Trip Race

151
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,840
The two people who are on the same
package trip are a team today.

152
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,140
The entry fee you just submitted...

153
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,620
will be your team money.

154
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,920
(People who paid a little,
People who paid a lot)

155
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,010
You will start your trip
with the total amount submitted.

156
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,490
- Yes!
- Nice! How much did you pay?

157
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,880
You must return
the rest of the money.

158
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,930
(In other words,
it's advantageous to pay a lot.)

159
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,430
(Honey, you did a good job!)

160
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,190
I'm in trouble. I didn't pay a lot.

161
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,370
How much did you pay?

162
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,760
- I'm worried.
- I also paid quite a bit.

163
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,630
The team with the most money is...

164
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,610
the newlyweds, So Min and Se Chan,
who paid 60 dollars.

165
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,630
Why did you pay so much?
Did you pay 40 dollars?

166
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,980
Next are Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo
with 41 dollars.

167
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,050
(Team Olympiad 41 dollars)

168
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,770
- You almost paid nothing.
- They paid 36 and 5 dollars.

169
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,120
I paid a little.

170
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,440
Team Asst. Manager Ha
and the New Recruit...

171
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,990
paid 5 dollars each,
and have a total of 10 dollars.

172
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,580
- Gosh.
- Look at that.

173
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,450
Hey High Schooler,
I'll be in your debt after today.

174
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,880
What are you talking about?

175
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,430
Team Ink-and-Wash Painting Human
Cultural Asset and pupil...

176
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,230
paid 5 dollars and 2 dollars
and have a total of 7 dollars.

177
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,300
Oh, my.

178
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,870
That's...

179
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,430
- That's cutting it close.
- That's amazing.

180
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,730
You suit each other.

181
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,240
- I'm going to owe you a favor.
- He's a real human cultural asset.

182
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,540
- He's a human cultural asset.
- I'm going to owe you a favor.

183
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,200
What kind of human cultural asset...

184
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,880
brings seven dollars to Jeju Island?

185
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,900
- I'm a human cultural asset.
- I'm...

186
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,070
I'm going to owe you a favor.

187
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,710
I brought much more money
with me when I was in high school.

188
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,750
You could have a bowl of
pork and rice soup each, and leave.

189
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,490
Today,

190
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,990
you can go back to Seoul...

191
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,630
after taking the course our travel
agency has prepared for you.

192
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,250
There will be all kinds of options
and extra fees.

193
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,950
First, each course has...

194
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,070
a set number of people
that can go sightseeing.

195
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,630
Regardless of the teams,
that number will be decided...

196
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,440
- after playing games.
- Okay.

197
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,300
The people who get
the chance to go sightseeing...

198
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,630
will be able to enjoy all
the course offers limitlessly...

199
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,630
which includes buying
food, gifts, and extra options.

200
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,040
They will get a stamp each
during that course.

201
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,180
However, for the people excluded
from going sightseeing,

202
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,820
one loser will be decided after
playing a simple game each time.

203
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,010
Also, the loser will cover
the entire cost of that course...

204
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,640
using their team money.

205
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,990
- They will pay up the whole amount.
- We should do our best then.

206
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,820
- Your team might end up in debt.
- Yes.

207
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,880
The teams who don't have a lot of
money should join forces.

208
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,690
- Okay.
- Let's join forces.

209
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,250
- Let's target them.
- This is good.

210
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,590
- We should also join forces.
- Okay.

211
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,370
The top three people who have
the most stamps...

212
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,740
when the package trip is over
will get a prize.

213
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,630
- This is regardless of teams.
- Really?

214
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,310
There will be a penalty for the team
that has the least team money.

215
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

216
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,180
You could also get the prize
and penalty at the same time.

217
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,680
Starting now,

218
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,820
you will have to even pay
for the water you drink.

219
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,290
- That's too harsh.
- You're tight.

220
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,620
I should have drunk
some water beforehand.

221
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,010
The fee you use in the car
on the way to the course...

222
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,320
will also be counted.

223
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,020
I will give each team their team
money and individual stamp passport.

224
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,090
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

225
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,800
The first schedule is...

226
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
- Yes?
- the highlight of package trips.

227
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,540
It's forced shopping.

228
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,870
- Shopping?
- Forced shopping?

229
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,370
- Okay.
- Forced shopping?

230
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,700
- They disappeared a lot these days.
- Shop with seven dollars?

231
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,610
We will go to a shopping street,
a Jeju Island tourist attraction.

232
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,400
Only three people can participate.

233
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,620
(The number of Force Shopping
participants: 3 people)

234
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,070
The first game is...

235
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,750
Noise Complaint Apartment,
which we played last time.

236
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,840
For each round,
one team leader must come out,

237
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,450
and a total of four team leaders
will play the game.

238
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,520
They will shout the game chant
at the same time,

239
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,580
and they will use both hands to
pile a hand tower after the chant.

240
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,950
If you make a sound while getting
slapped, you will be out.

241
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,730
One person
must come from each team.

242
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,730
- You must go unconditionally.
- Gosh.

243
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,300
(Jong Kook competes for
Team Running Trading Company.)

244
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,690
So Min, you should go first
since Jong Kook is there.

245
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,460
You should go after Jong Kook.

246
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,440
- It hurts.
- Jong Kook won't slap you hard.

247
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,730
Jong Kook won't slap you hard.

248
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,970
- He won't let me off.
- No, he will let you off this time.

249
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,740
Kwang Soo, do you want to go?

250
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,180
(He has no intention of going.)

251
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,610
(The Palm Tyson says, "Welcome.")

252
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,690
Gosh...

253
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,320
- You can do it.
- Come out.

254
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,920
Shop as much as you want.

255
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,060
You're really despicable.

256
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,390
New Recruit Kim, you can do it!

257
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,590
While you sing, I will...

258
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,260
- 1, 2.
- 1, 2.

259
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,860
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

260
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,800
<i>- Cross the starry bridge
- Cross the starry bridge</i>

261
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,330
(The package trip participants
know how to have fun.)

262
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,140
(Tiger mouth bounce, Catfish bounce)

263
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,140
<i>- Pass by the windy reed field
- Pass by the windy reed field</i>

264
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,680
(The newlywed bride used to have
fun on a tourist bus.)

265
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,570
- Seok Sam is energetic.
<i>- You always</i>

266
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,570
(Seok Sam is an
energetic cultural asset.)

267
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,650
He's energetic.

268
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,190
Seok Sam is energetic.

269
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,790
(Seok Sam's back hunches
whenever he's excited.)

270
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,160
<i>- Let's go
- Let's go</i>

271
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,450
- 12th floor!
- 12th floor!

272
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,580
- Okay.
- Okay.

273
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,060
I'm in trouble.
My hand is underneath her hand.

274
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,760
- We will start from the bottom.
- Will we start...

275
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,850
- from the bottom?
- Start from the 12th floor.

276
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,620
You will be eliminated
if you make a sound from now on.

277
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,670
So Min, endure it.

278
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,770
(They will be eliminated
if they make a sound from now on.)

279
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,090
(So Min must endure
Suk Jin's smashing.)

280
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,830
- Gosh, So Min took it.
- What happened?

281
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,830
(So Min passed.)

282
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,970
Second floor.

283
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,040
(2nd floor,
Ji Hyo will slap Suk Jin.)

284
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,570
- It's my turn to slap, right?
- Yes.

285
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,740
Ji Hyo, let's send him away
this time.

286
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,340
Don't make any sounds.

287
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,890
- Good job.
- Second floor.

288
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,080
(The Pupil passed.)

289
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,210
It's his turn.

290
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,580
(3rd floor,
Jong Kook will slap Ji Hyo.)

291
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,450
- Is it Jong Kook's turn?
- It's Jong Kook's turn.

292
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,820
- It's over.
- Why did you put your hand there?

293
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,950
- I didn't know.
- Take it.

294
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,620
Ji Hyo is shrewd,
so she's good at holding it in.

295
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,400
(Ji Hyo is shrewd,
so she's good at holding it in.)

296
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,040
(He succeeded at changing
jobs with his sole palm strength.)

297
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,310
(Will Ji Hyo be able to endure
his monstrous smashing?)

298
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,310
(Smashing)

299
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,440
(Enduring)

300
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,190
- Other people...
- I'm in pain.

301
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,610
- will also be eliminated.
- No.

302
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,020
- So Min, you must endure it.
- How could the pain...

303
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,160
also reach me
when Ji Hyo was slapped?

304
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,450
Fourth floor.

305
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,060
We have 10 floors left now.

306
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,620
We have eight floors left.

307
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,900
He's really bad at math.

308
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,590
- Weren't you in second place?
- I was mistaken.

309
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,690
How could you be mistaken?

310
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,600
- Are you a foreigner?
- I just got this problem wrong.

311
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,010
- That's why.
- You can't do addition.

312
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,540
Endure it. Let's go!

313
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,910
(The math geniuses are especially
weak when it comes to subtraction.)

314
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,240
- Send him away.
- It's So Min. That was...

315
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,970
(5th floor,
Jong Kook will slap So Min.)

316
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,440
My palm hurts.

317
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,150
(It's the new recruit's turn again.)

318
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,890
- It's Jong Kook's right hand.
- Jong Kook...

319
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,160
- Your...
- Yes?

320
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,080
wife will be eliminated now.

321
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,120
No, she can endure it.

322
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,800
- Endure it.
- Two people must be eliminated.

323
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,430
- It can't be helped.
- Of course, it's a game.

324
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,270
(Avoiding)

325
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,460
- She avoided him.
- She's eliminated.

326
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,070
- She's eliminated.
- She's eliminated.

327
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,010
Why did you make a sound
when you weren't even slapped?

328
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Good job.

329
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,940
- Did you see the look in his eyes?
- Yes?

330
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,910
- Did you see the look in his eyes?
- I thought you were going to die.

331
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,940
(The catfish husband is
a romanticist.)

332
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,050
- Just endure it this once.
- I can't watch this.

333
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,150
- I will also...
- It will just smart once.

334
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,740
No. Your bone might break, Ji Hyo.

335
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,320
It will just hurt once,
and it will be over.

336
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,350
(She's the Olympiad winner who has
the most patience.)

337
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,390
(The Palm Tyson is controlling
his breathing.)

338
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,620
The new recruit is angry.

339
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,160
(She took her hand out.)

340
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,070
(Shouting)

341
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,910
(The math genius took her hand out
at the crucial moment.)

342
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,230
I think you made a sound.

343
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,830
- He made a sound.
- Can you take your hand out?

344
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,280
She...

345
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,370
She took her hand out.

346
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,570
Can you take your hand out?

347
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,150
She...

348
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,700
- Isn't that cheating?
- Can you take your hand out?

349
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,280
(She's not good at subtracting, but
she's good at taking her hand out.)

350
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,190
My fingers aren't
moving "automatically".

351
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,550
- Do you mean "automatically"?
- What?

352
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,920
- Do you mean "automatically"?
- I'm sorry.

353
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,530
(So Min, Ji Hyo, Suk Jin got
eliminated in the first round.)

354
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,450
Okay, the next group should go.

355
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,720
The people who didn't play
should come out.

356
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,160
- Okay, three people should go.
- Se Chan, I can only trust you.

357
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,460
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

358
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,770
- You need to do a good job.
- You need to do a good job.

359
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,900
(Their excitement
engine is starting.)

360
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,040
- It's doable.
<i>- Let's go</i>

361
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,540
(Let's go)

362
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,440
(Insurance king Assistant Manager Ha
is showing off his karaoke skills.)

363
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,050
(Bounce)

364
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,550
<i>- You always...
- You always...</i>

365
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,740
- 9th floor.
- 9th floor. That's it.

366
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,320
- Let's go.
- No, come here.

367
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,420
- Come here.
- Come here.

368
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,160
- Let's do it quickly.
- Do it quickly.

369
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,710
- Let's do it quickly.
- Okay.

370
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,790
- Okay.
- Haha.

371
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,190
(1st floor,
Kwang Soo will slap Haha.)

372
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,260
(They will get eliminated right away
if they make a sound.)

373
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,620
Isn't this school violence?

374
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,800
- Hurry up.
- It won't hurt at all.

375
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,320
It doesn't hurt.
It didn't hurt, did it?

376
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,030
(Enduring)

377
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,120
- Didn't you make a sound?
- You're a man.

378
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,300
- It's okay, Assistant Manager Ha.
- It's okay.

379
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,700
Wait a minute, Recruit Kim,

380
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,070
are you the owner?

381
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,440
(The new recruit is full of
a sense of ownership.)

382
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,100
- It's okay, Assistant Manager Ha.
- Okay.

383
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,570
I thought you were the owner.

384
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,340
- Do it.
- Okay, the second floor should go.

385
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,510
- Okay.
- Let's go.

386
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,150
At first,
I had no idea how it will be.

387
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,210
Is it still the third floor?
Whose turn is it? Who will slap now?

388
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,240
(The representative scaredy-cats are
gathered, so the game's quite slow.)

389
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,110
- He's the human cultural asset.
- Of course.

390
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,320
(Should I slap him or not?)

391
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,580
- He has a different rhythm.
- He's rhythmical.

392
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,720
They became really close
to each other.

393
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
The four of them became really close
to each other.

394
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,090
(The hip-hop waterwheel is
suddenly turning.)

395
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,090
<i>- Beat everyone
- Beat everyone</i>

396
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,490
<i>- Bam
- Bam</i>

397
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,100
(The four scaredy-cats are using
all kinds of methods to buy time.)

398
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,200
- Let's go.
- They're finally doing it.

399
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,570
(He starts slapping after preparing
for a long time.)

400
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,940
(In pain)

401
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,230
That was intense.

402
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,440
(He succeeded at defending
while giving his face up.)

403
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,680
- That was intense.
- It didn't hurt at all.

404
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,520
- What floor are we on?
- You have six floors left.

405
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,970
- What floor are we on?
- You're on the sixth floor.

406
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,420
- Se Chan.
- Endure it.

407
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,550
(Se Chan smashes his hand
toward Jae Suk's hand.)

408
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,650
That's it. You can endure it.

409
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,660
It doesn't hurt.

410
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,980
Everyone is so well-behaved.

411
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,190
- Okay, next.
- Seventh floor.

412
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,260
It's Kwang Soo's right hand
this time.

413
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,490
He's going to use his right hand.

414
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,530
Se Chan, endure it.

415
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,900
- He's merciless.
- Let's fly away.

416
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,220
You can't lose
to a high school student.

417
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,330
You must endure it.

418
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,140
(Kwang Soo just slapped Se Chan
using his fist.)

419
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,200
He slapped with his fist.

420
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,700
(He doesn't want to lose, so he
endured it with clenched teeth.)

421
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,810
- You're going to be eliminated.
- Why did you slap with your first?

422
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,910
When did I?

423
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,070
- Young punk!
- Why?

424
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,370
How dare you slap me...

425
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,680
- Why are you hitting me?
- with your fist?

426
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,820
How dare you slap me
with your fist?

427
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,610
- Right now, you...
- Is that not allowed?

428
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,710
Shouldn't he be eliminated?

429
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,210
- He's eliminated.
- He's eliminated.

430
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,210
Why?

431
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,710
- No wonder, even I was hurting.
- He's eliminated.

432
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,930
Even I was hurting.

433
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,530
If Jae Suk makes a sound,
Haha will win.

434
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,060
If Jae Suk doesn't make
a sound, Jae Suk will win.

435
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,490
- Oh, I will be okay then.
- That's right.

436
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,460
- You will be okay.
- You did a good job.

437
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,270
Look at Jae Suk right now.

438
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,440
Look at the face
of the human cultural asset.

439
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,460
You should slap him hard.

440
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,180
- I do not know pain.
- Lay it down hard.

441
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,970
He might wet himself.

442
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,910
- Just do it already.
- Get it over with.

443
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,940
I can't watch!

444
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,820
- Darn it hurts.
- It wasn't a direct hit.

445
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,050
Haha, you're out.

446
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,050
- It wasn't a direct hit.
- He only hurt his own hand.

447
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,080
(The human cultural asset
endured the pain with willpower.)

448
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,290
- He only hurt his own hand.
- It slipped.

449
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,390
Unbelievable.

450
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,950
(Thankfully, the airplane
flies over them at the right time.)

451
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,990
- It wasn't a direct hit.
- A plane is flying over us.

452
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,770
(Everyone's happy
to film near an airport.)

453
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,770
I'm good now.

454
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,620
He's good.

455
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,900
Perfect timing.

456
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,570
Nice timing!

457
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,230
- It was nothing.
- We couldn't hear a thing.

458
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,540
You heard wrong.

459
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,010
The three will go shopping...

460
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,570
and one out of the rest...

461
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,610
will pay for the expenses
from the team's budget.

462
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,210
Just so you know,
Jong Kook is quite the spender.

463
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,420
I'm unleashing my shopaholic side.

464
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,650
Let's get going then.

465
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,190
Sure, let's head to the van.

466
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,350
Let's go.

467
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,450
Come on.

468
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,720
(Let's head off to see
Jong Kook waste money.)

469
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,120
Hello.

470
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,590
- It's good to see you.
- Shopping...

471
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,690
While on the trip,

472
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,770
- you could get hungry or thirsty.
- Right.

473
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,940
That's why we prepared
coffee, beverages, and water.

474
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,440
- Coffee too?
- Chips, chocolate, jelly...

475
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,940
are prepared for you too.

476
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,810
Beverages will cost three dollars...

477
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,640
while the snacks are five dollars.

478
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,410
Whatever you buy
will be added to the tab...

479
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,070
which will be paid
by the one paying...

480
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,110
- for the first schedule.
- Really?

481
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,190
- Hold on.
- Which will be paid...

482
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,450
(One will pay for everything.)

483
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,480
That means the three of us
can eat whatever we want.

484
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,290
If your teammate has to pay,

485
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,220
then it'll take a toll on you too.

486
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,820
There's nothing more to life anyway.

487
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,800
We'll think of
the consequences later.

488
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,960
- We'll get going then.
- Sure.

489
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,460
Can I get a bag of chips?

490
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,590
How about some coffee?

491
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,830
- Should we have some coffee?
- Please get So Min some coffee.

492
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,270
I'd like a refreshing beverage too.

493
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,310
- Coffee...
- That'll be three dollars each.

494
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,100
- Sure.
- They're not cheap.

495
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,840
Is there a cup too?

496
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,150
- One with ice.
- Nice.

497
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,710
This will be three dollars too.

498
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,050
- Sure thing.
- This too?

499
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,690
- Just hand it out.
- Can I get some jelly too?

500
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,210
- I'd like some ice too.
- Black coffee.

501
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,660
A cup of ice, please!

502
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,760
Black coffee.

503
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,120
- Unbelievable.
- This chance might not come again.

504
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,480
That's for me.

505
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,980
- This...
- Go ahead.

506
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,400
Thank you.

507
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,720
Can you get that for me?

508
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,990
We shouldn't be stingy
when on a vacation.

509
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,990
- Exactly.
- Nicely said.

510
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,670
This is the reason we save money up.

511
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,490
Everyone's spending money
like crazy.

512
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,910
Are there any chips?

513
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,230
I'll get some to you.

514
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,870
You're eating a lot today.

515
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,310
Shouldn't you stop?

516
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,100
- All right!
- Can we stop eating now?

517
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,810
One team might start off
as bankrupt.

518
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,910
We don't know who'll have to pay,
so let's eat.

519
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,980
- Unbelievable.
- This is wrong.

520
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,910
You've spent 63 dollars.

521
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,450
One team will go bankrupt.

522
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,910
- For sure.
- No matter which team pays,

523
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,290
- it will be a lot.
- One team will go bankrupt.

524
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,180
Any team will go bankrupt.

525
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,820
As long as it's not our team.

526
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,760
That's just how it is.

527
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,760
Don't you have any
sweet or savory snacks?

528
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,920
So tell me. What's your dream?

529
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,000
(Out of the blue)

530
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
That's right. What's your dream?

531
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,400
- It's to be a scientist.
- A scientist?

532
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,810
Who's your favorite scientist?

533
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,480
Nobel?

534
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,280
- Einstein.
- Who?

535
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,640
- Nobel.
- Einstein.

536
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,480
Honey, what was your dream
growing up?

537
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,950
- Me?
- He's my mentor.

538
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,990
My dream was to meet
a pretty lady...

539
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,060
- Then your dream came true.
- and live with her forever.

540
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,030
No, not quite.

541
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,700
(Darn it.)

542
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,860
- So we're at our first location.
- Right.

543
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,860
Yes, let's spend some money!

544
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,970
(Chilseongro, a shopping district
in Jeju with a long history)

545
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm going to buy you a few things.

546
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,070
This is life, I guess.

547
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,210
- Right.
- I'll spend at least 1,000 dollars.

548
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,010
(The shopping district connects us
to various tourist attractions.)

549
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,070
The three of you...

550
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,220
will have 10 minutes to shop...

551
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,840
for yourself or your teammate.

552
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,340
The three of you will get off now.

553
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,950
- Can we go shopping now?
- Yes.

554
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,290
Please put on your masks.

555
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,820
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

556
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,460
Buy something for
my daughter, will you?

557
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,990
Your daughter?

558
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,320
Human cultural asset,

559
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,850
- can you get me something too?
- Okay.

560
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,660
Let's go shopping then.

561
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,090
(They head out after
receiving various requests.)

562
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

563
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,000
Hello, everyone!

564
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,740
I'm here to spend some money.

565
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,070
(Big spender Mr. Yang
arrives at the shopping district.)

566
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,310
I'm here to spend money.

567
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,310
I need to buy clothes
for Haha's daughter.

568
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,670
Hello.

569
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,670
(The human cultural asset...)

570
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,340
(has ladies coming up to greet him
in a heartbeat.)

571
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,650
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi!

572
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,150
Hello.

573
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,490
Hi.

574
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,380
Hold on a second.

575
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,460
(He's warmly welcomed
into a clothing store.)

576
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,620
Hello.

577
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,500
(He picks a cardigan
that suits the modernized hanbok.)

578
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,000
Is it for your pupil?

579
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,860
(Is it for your pupil?)

580
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,210
No, it's for me.

581
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,310
Why would I get my pupil anything?

582
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,310
(The pupil is trained
under harsh circumstances.)

583
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,400
- Guys.
- Yes?

584
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,750
We will now see...

585
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,070
- who pays for everything.
- Sure.

586
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,450
You'll play a series
of random silent games.

587
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,950
Quite a few of them actually.

588
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,820
Silent 007,

589
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,790
Silent 3, 6, 9,

590
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,820
or Silent Word Chain.

591
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,530
You will choose the game
you wish to play.

592
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,200
- How do you play Silent Word Chain?
- Silent Word Chain?

593
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,560
You'll explain the words
with body language.

594
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,920
(In Silent Word Chain,
body language will be used.)

595
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,970
- Nice.
- Like "bicycle"...

596
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,230
This sounds like fun.

597
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,070
If you lose the round
or get it wrong,

598
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,890
you'll be met with a punishment.

599
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,630
The one with the highest
number of points will pay.

600
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,480
You'll now fall silent.

601
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,980
And go.

602
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,840
Starting with Kwang Soo,
you'll play your desired game.

603
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,140
(Silent 3, 6, 9)

604
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,320
(Clap)

605
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,960
(Silent 3, 6, 9
isn't that difficult.)

606
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,730
(There aren't any hitches so far.)

607
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,890
(Clap)

608
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,890
(Clap)

609
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,590
(Clap)

610
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,200
(Clap!)

611
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Wrong!

612
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,430
(We knew the pupil
would mess up first.)

613
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,480
Pound on his back.

614
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,170
Suk Jin receives a point.

615
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,020
(He doesn't know what he got wrong.)

616
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,820
(They switch it up
to Silent 007 next.)

617
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,060
(Bang!)

618
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,080
(0, 7, bang!)

619
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
(Argh! Argh!)

620
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,850
(0)

621
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,850
(0, 7, bang!)

622
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,090
(Argh! Argh!)

623
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,590
(0)

624
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,590
(0, 7, bang!)

625
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,360
(Argh! Argh! Argh?)

626
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,660
(Why would the pupil be shocked?)

627
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,010
Suk Jin got it wrong.

628
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,540
(Seok Sam gets it wrong
twice in a row.)

629
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,600
Suk Jin now has two points.

630
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,050
(Let's slow down a bit.)

631
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,340
(The speed is too fast
for the pupil.)

632
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,550
(Seok Sam needs time to adjust.)

633
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,180
(We'll go with Silent Word Chain.)

634
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,650
(We'll go this way.)

635
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,390
(Hopping)

636
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,620
(Frog noted.)

637
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,660
(Frog)

638
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,630
(A word that starts
with the Korean syllable "ri")

639
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,160
(He's delicately describing
a ribbon.)

640
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,100
(Ribbon noted.)

641
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,400
(Easy, right?)

642
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,280
(What on earth was that?)

643
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,640
(You didn't get it?)

644
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,720
Ji Hyo.

645
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,680
(Blinking)

646
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,180
3, 2, 1.

647
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,790
Ji Hyo receives a point too.

648
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,300
(Time's up and
Ji Hyo receives a point.)

649
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,230
The three already spent
400 dollars while shopping.

650
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,390
(They already spent 400 dollars.)

651
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,390
(Se Chan takes his time.)

652
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,270
Can a woman wear this too?

653
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,100
I'll buy one for So Min.

654
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
(The newlywed buys an item
for his wife.)

655
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,640
Meanwhile,
I'll buy this for myself.

656
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,640
I'll take this one.

657
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,750
Sure.

658
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,110
Seriously?

659
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,140
("Hapjeong Station, Exit Five"
by the human cultural asset)

660
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,250
(Chorus by newlywed Yangsebari)

661
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,680
All right, come on!

662
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,650
I'll take two!

663
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,620
I'm here to spend money, people.

664
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,800
(He seems to have experience
being in a chorus.)

665
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,570
How much have I spent so far?

666
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,970
Your total is at 180 dollars.

667
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,400
180 dollars?
I'll take one that 20 dollars then!

668
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,660
I'll spend a total of 200 dollars.

669
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,810
(He goes big
by spending 200 dollars.)

670
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,280
Since it's winter,
I should get something warm.

671
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,840
How adorable.

672
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,480
I'll take this one.
Look how cute it is.

673
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,780
(He isn't even checking the price.)

674
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,950
How adorable.

675
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,380
I'm glad I have all these gifts
for Haha's daughter.

676
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,460
(Uncle Jong Kook goes big
to help small businesses.)

677
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,580
This is great.

678
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,320
Let me see.

679
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,150
(The human cultural asset
values the fit of clothes.)

680
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,560
- I'll take this then.
- Sure thing.

681
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,820
- Can I get an unopened one?
- Sure.

682
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,590
So everything we buy...

683
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,630
will be paid for by the losing team?

684
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,130
Oh, dear.

685
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,710
The points are 2, 1, and 1.

686
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,010
This will be the last game you play.

687
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,310
If the two don't get it wrong,
will I end up paying?

688
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,370
That's right.

689
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,550
- I'll kick off the word chain.
- Sure.

690
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,640
So Min will go first.

691
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,950
The first word is "jean."

692
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,180
(A Korean word that starts
with the syllable "ji")

693
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,580
(Worm)

694
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,620
(A Korean word that starts
with the syllable "yi")

695
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,230
(Teeth)

696
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,760
(Teeth noted.)

697
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,070
Suk Jin, you're up.

698
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,300
(A Korean word that starts
with the syllable "bbal")

699
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,890
(- Let's pretend not to get it.
- Sure thing.)

700
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,780
(The Korean word that starts
with the syllable "bbal"!)

701
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,980
(I don't get it.)

702
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,980
(Being as frustrated as he is,)

703
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,220
(he starts rubbing his clothes.)

704
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,550
(Poor Suk Jin)

705
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,680
(Kwang Soo still pretends
not to know.)

706
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,650
(Are you still going to play dumb?)

707
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,680
Noted.

708
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,730
(Laundry noted.)

709
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,150
(The Korean word that starts
with the syllable "rae")

710
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,040
(He calmly starts expressing
the word that begins with "rae.")

711
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,710
(Haha gets it right away.)

712
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,900
(This seems to be
what he's describing.)

713
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,900
(Everyone seems to get it.)

714
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,670
Kwang Soo, you're out.

715
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,780
That begins with
the Korean syllable "re."

716
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,320
("Re" not "Rae)

717
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
(Embarrassed)

718
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,960
It wasn't the correct syllable.

719
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,520
(It serves you right
for teasing others!)

720
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,680
- "Rae" was the correct syllable.
- "Rae" not "re."

721
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,490
(The math genius lacks
in the language department.)

722
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,760
- It's "rae."
- Really?

723
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,920
What you described starts with "re."

724
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,730
And my word ended with "rae."

725
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,970
(Final score: Suk Jin 2, So Min 1,
Ji Hyo 1, Kwang Soo 1)

726
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,090
- It was the wrong syllable?
- Goodness.

727
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,740
- Rae.
- It was "rae."

728
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,070
- We'll conclude the game.
- Okay.

729
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,070
- Sure.
- You're back.

730
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,810
- Look.
- You bought a lot.

731
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,130
- Sure.
- You bought a lot.

732
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,710
I bought a full set.

733
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,330
My gosh, that's heavy.

734
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,170
- Are you serious?
- Sure. I bought a full set.

735
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,780
- He's open-handed.
- I also bought shoes.

736
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,550
- My goodness.
- That looks great.

737
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,910
- It's adorable.
- It's so pretty.

738
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,290
I wonder what the human
cultural asset bought.

739
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,720
Is this enough?

740
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,230
- He also bought something good.
- Show us.

741
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,260
Thank you.

742
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,650
- This is crazy.
- I appreciate it.

743
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,160
- I bought a cardigan.
- For who? Is it for me?

744
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
It's for me.

745
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,770
I bought a cardigan
which was 199 dollars.

746
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,470
Good. That's the exact amount.

747
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,630
You bought one expensive item.

748
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,860
Sure. I got a good one.

749
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,980
- Honey, what did you buy?
- I bought a lot.

750
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,780
You should buy things for me.

751
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,280
He bought them for real.

752
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,480
You should wear this.

753
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,520
You should buy things only for me.

754
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,140
- And this is...
- A sweatsuit? My gosh.

755
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,380
How could he buy...

756
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,080
- Just wear it.
- But this is...

757
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,820
- This is...
- Is this a team uniform?

758
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,990
A team uniform?
And this is for the pupil.

759
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,120
Thank you.

760
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,500
Did you buy something for Seok Sam?

761
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
(As he receives
the unexpected gift,)

762
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,700
(he can't stop smiling.)

763
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,730
This is...

764
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,770
(He can't stop smiling.)

765
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,270
- Seok Sam must be happy.
- Seok Sam, that's cute.

766
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,360
I bought a shirt for him.

767
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,240
- That's nice.
- I need something that's worth...

768
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,370
- 20 dollars.
- It's a shirt.

769
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,540
This is nice.

770
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,100
- It's pretty.
- I love this shirt. It's cute.

771
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,750
I'll tell you about the amount.

772
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,450
The transportation cost
is 63 dollars.

773
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,180
And the amount spent
on shopping is 599 dollars.

774
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,490
- So it's 662 dollars in total.
- My goodness.

775
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,560
The person who will pay
662 dollars is...

776
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
What do we do?

777
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,460
(Ji Suk Jin)

778
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,800
- Ji Suk Jin.
- My gosh.

779
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,000
(Staring at him sharply)

780
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,660
We can do better next time.

781
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,330
- We can do better next time.
- That's a lot of money.

782
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,130
Let me tell you
about the second course.

783
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,160
- Okay.
- Good.

784
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,740
Why are you so bad at playing games?

785
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,480
You should try it yourself.
They are so good.

786
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,140
- "You should try it yourself."
- They play games so quickly.

787
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,370
There's no way I can beat them.

788
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,640
The second course is
the best photo zone on Jeju Island.

789
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,720
That sounds great.

790
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,150
It has a lovely view.

791
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,530
(There are spots for the best photos
along the beach.)

792
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,560
That's nice.

793
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,850
We've found many good places.

794
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,590
- I want to see rapeseed flowers.
- Okay.

795
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,120
And the next game is...

796
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,270
- Hello, It's Me.
- What?

797
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,070
<i>- Hello, it's me</i>
- Is it about this song?

798
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,860
(Is the game about
making a phone call?)

799
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,660
(She's tearing up.)

800
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,570
It's a team game.

801
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,570
Each team will select a player
to make a phone call.

802
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,570
- And?
- You can make a call...

803
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,170
- To a friend?
- to your family or friend.

804
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,250
And one of you will talk on the
phone pretending to be the player.

805
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,080
- I'm in trouble.
- And you shouldn't get caught.

806
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,790
- If I get caught quickly, I lose?
- Right.

807
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,920
So if they say,
"What's wrong? Is it really you?"

808
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,290
- Then I lose.
- Exactly.

809
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,320
- "Who is this?"
- I should call my brother.

810
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,420
If the person on the phone
sounds suspicious, you fail.

811
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,590
First, you need to decide
whom to call.

812
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,860
- I should call my dad.
- I'll call Se Hyeong.

813
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,630
- One from each team will call.
- How do you call your dad?

814
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,740
- "Dad." I just do this.
- Who should we call?

815
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,270
Hang on. Who should we call?

816
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,370
Who should it be?

817
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,370
Should I call my wife?

818
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,900
- She will notice it immediately.
- She will.

819
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,640
When we tried, we got caught
in less than a minute.

820
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,980
Really? How did they know?

821
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,980
But...

822
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,750
- Hey.
- I wasn't like that.

823
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,380
My wife is calling me.
Do you want to try talking to her?

824
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,460
(He got a call from Chaser.)

825
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,180
- Just talk to her. Don't whisper.
- Let me try.

826
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,260
You don't have to whisper.
Stay quiet.

827
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,390
Where are you, honey?

828
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,730
- Suk Jin?
- Where are you?

829
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,770
I was surprised by your voice.

830
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,470
(Was she surprised?)

831
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,570
(I thought it was someone else.)

832
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,870
I thought it was someone else.
I'm on my way home now.

833
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,250
- Where are you going?
- Home.

834
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,950
Did you have a nice day?

835
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,340
Gosh, you're Jae Suk.

836
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,180
(He gets caught only in 10 seconds.)

837
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,290
(Happy)

838
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,290
Jae Suk, my gosh.

839
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,820
- How did she know?
- How did she know?

840
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,770
How did she know?
Su Jung, how did you know?

841
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,800
He sounded just like you.

842
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,070
I know. So you like your husband's
voice better, right?

843
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,870
- Sure.
- I knew it.

844
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,870
My gosh.

845
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,510
But why is your wife
saved as Chaser?

846
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,550
Su Jung.

847
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,280
(It's a sweet but scary name.)

848
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,480
- I didn't know that.
- Don't say that.

849
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,290
- Why is your wife a chaser?
- It's just...

850
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,790
- Okay.
- Su Jung.

851
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,290
- She's saved as Chaser.
- You should change it to runaway.

852
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,350
Su Jung.

853
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,880
Why are you with them?
Are you shooting the show?

854
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,590
- We're filming...
- She didn't know we were shooting.

855
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,620
(She didn't know about the shoot.)

856
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,970
She didn't know that. My gosh.

857
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,160
- She thought you were home.
- We're shooting Running Man now.

858
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,770
- She thought Suk Jin was at home.
- Su Jung.

859
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,540
Let's stop talking.

860
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
Hey.

861
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,370
Are they separated or what?

862
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,480
The more we talk,
the more I feel hurt.

863
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,010
- Okay.
- Bye.

864
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,170
I'll see you later, Su Jung.

865
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

866
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,520
Drive safely.

867
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,750
- She fell for it at first.
- She didn't know.

868
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,520
But she recognized you right away.

869
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,880
- Only in three seconds.
- That was funny.

870
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,290
- Who should we call?
- She has quick wits.

871
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,560
I'll call my dad,
and Ji Hyo will talk to him.

872
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,580
Ji Hyo.

873
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,390
But Ji Hyo's voice is...

874
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,360
- Ji Hyo has a unique voice.
- Gosh, this is...

875
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,360
There's no one in the world
who sounds like Ji Hyo.

876
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,500
Are you making a call right away?
Don't you need to practice?

877
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,860
- Ji Hyo is doing it.
- I rarely call my dad.

878
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,540
Hello, So Min.

879
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,070
Mom?

880
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,980
Yes. Why did you call?

881
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,750
(Her mom answered the phone
instead of her dad.)

882
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,170
Mom, where's Dad?

883
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,140
Your dad? Why?

884
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
Well...

885
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,750
Is this a mission?

886
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,910
(Your dad? Why? Is this a mission?)

887
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,180
(A mission?)

888
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,320
(She just thinks it's a mission.)

889
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,590
Yes, it's a mission.
You need to answer my question.

890
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,000
No, let your dad do it.

891
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,000
(She turns it over to her husband.)

892
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,890
- Hello?
- Dad.

893
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,740
- Yes.
- Dad, what's my nickname?

894
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,270
(Dad, what's my nickname?)

895
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,130
- Your nickname?
- My nickname.

896
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,670
- You have many. Parrot.
- Parrot?

897
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,140
(He's talking to the fake parrot
with no doubt.)

898
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,750
- Why?
- Ask him about his blood type.

899
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,410
What's your blood type?

900
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,490
Type AB.

901
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,520
What about me?

902
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,530
Yours is also type AB.
You take after me.

903
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,320
- I can't believe this.
- What?

904
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,350
Dad.

905
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,030
Who's your favorite member
in Running Man?

906
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,590
I like Song Ji Hyo.

907
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,740
(I like Song Ji Hyo.)

908
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,740
It's her.

909
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,780
(He likes Ji Hyo, but he doesn't
recognize her voice.)

910
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,810
He doesn't know.

911
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,250
What a coincidence.

912
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,780
I think she can talk to him
for three hours.

913
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,450
- She can do it for three hours.
- You know I like her.

914
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,750
All right. It's been nine minutes.

915
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,720
Dad, it wasn't me. It was Ji Hyo.

916
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,020
- Hello, sir.
- Dad.

917
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,490
I guess he wanted to be in our show
for a long time.

918
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,420
- I mean...
- He wanted to be on TV.

919
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,820
- He was so excited to be on TV.
- I think...

920
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,770
he was too excited
to notice her voice.

921
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,470
- I can't believe this.
- I didn't see this coming.

922
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,130
If she kept talking,
it would last for an hour.

923
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,740
It wasn't me. It was Ji Hyo.

924
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,780
I see. She sounded just like you.

925
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,870
What?

926
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,600
- Sir.
- I thought it would end right away.

927
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,720
- Hello, sir.
- How is it possible?

928
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,980
That was unbelievable.

929
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,340
You must be proud of your daughter.

930
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,920
I'm always proud of her
whether she's successful or not.

931
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,230
That's so nice.

932
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,500
I know. You're so proud of her,
but you don't recognize her voice.

933
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,970
I hope we will meet someday.
Thank you, sir.

934
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,500
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thank you.

935
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

936
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,860
That was really good.

937
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,480
- Is it that Ji Hyo did a good job?
- I'm disappointed.

938
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,510
- I'm disappointed with Dad.
- That was fun.

939
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,480
It's important
not to get caught at first.

940
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,050
Then it goes well.
Shall we call Sae Ho?

941
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,020
- Sae Ho?
- Let's call Sae Ho. Who'll speak?

942
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,680
Who wants to try?
Who will talk to Sae Ho?

943
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
- You'll call Sae Ho?
- Yes.

944
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,580
- Hang on.
- Or we could try this.

945
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,030
"Hello?" As if he's pulling a joke.

946
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,350
- "Hello."
- As if he inhaled helium.

947
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,530
- Good idea.
- "Hello?"

948
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,800
So who will talk to him?

949
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,420
- Kwang Soo, you should try.
- Kwang Soo?

950
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,320
I think he'll notice it right away.

951
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,470
- I think he will.
- I think so.

952
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,500
- We don't know it yet.
- It's okay.

953
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,070
- Hello, Jae Suk.
- Where are you, Sae Ho?

954
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,480
I'm shooting a TV show now.

955
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,240
Really? Are you on a break now?

956
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,100
- Pardon?
- Can you talk now?

957
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Yes. I can talk now.

958
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,780
You should go outside now.

959
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,220
- Okay.
- Hurry.

960
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,380
- I'm out.
- I'm going to...

961
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,760
give you a quiz,
so you should answer.

962
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,720
- What?
- I'm shooting Running Man now.

963
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,920
Okay.

964
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,460
First, say hello to our viewers.

965
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,760
- To viewers?
- Yes. Say hello to them.

966
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,070
Hello, nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.

967
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,860
I'm Cho Sae Ho,
and I was shooting a TV show.

968
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,970
I'm on a break now.

969
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,860
- I'm glad to talk to...
- Lower your voice.

970
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,600
- Sae Ho.
- Yes?

971
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,810
Lower your voice.

972
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,980
Okay. Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.

973
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,180
(Obedient)

974
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,150
I'm Comedian Cho Sae Ho.
I'm glad to talk to you.

975
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,080
Sae Ho, make an acrostic poem
with my name.

976
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,030
- What?
- An acrostic poem with my name.

977
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,560
- An acrostic poem with your name?
- Yes. Yu.

978
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,230
Yu.

979
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,500
(You are so...)

980
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,540
(He starts singing right away.)

981
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,470
(He sings a serenade of
an acrostic poem moanfully.)

982
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,070
You should stop him. It's over.

983
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,130
I must say he succeeded.

984
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,570
- Hey, Sae Ho.
- Yes.

985
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,050
- How did you not know my voice?
- I can't believe this.

986
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,340
- It was Kwang Soo.
- Hello, I'm Kwang Soo.

987
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,220
That's not it. You suddenly
called me. What is going on?

988
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,380
- Do you not know what's going on?
- Sae Ho.

989
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,260
How could you
not recognize my voice?

990
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,230
- Well done, Sae Ho.
- Good job.

991
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,570
Sae Ho, you weren't so funny today.

992
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,660
It's not easy to be funny
while getting a perm.

993
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,600
- Okay. Thank you anyway.
- Sae Ho.

994
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,530
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

995
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,700
- Sae Ho.
- Nice.

996
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,680
- I'll call you again, Sae Ho.
- Good job.

997
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,370
- Thanks.
- So who won?

998
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,350
- Who will win this game?
- My gosh.

999
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,080
- And So Min...
- Do you want to call Hyuk?

1000
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,450
- Let's call Hyuk.
- Do you want to try?

1001
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,350
What do you usually say to him?

1002
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,450
I won't tell you.

1003
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,830
Why not? Hey.

1004
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,390
You should tell me what to do.

1005
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,120
- "What are you doing?"
- "What are you doing?"

1006
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,220
- "What's up?"
- "What's up? Where are you?"

1007
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,490
- "Hello? Where are you?"
- "It's me."

1008
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,930
"Hey, where are you?
Where are you now?"

1009
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,240
Don't do that.

1010
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,330
- Don't you sound too sly?
- Wait a minute.

1011
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,600
- Is that how you think of me?
- No, it's not like that.

1012
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,410
- No, I don't think he's mean.
- How dare you.

1013
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,140
Were you imitating Jong Kook?

1014
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,640
- I was just focusing on your tone.
- Okay, try it again.

1015
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,910
"Hello? Hey, where are you?"

1016
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,240
- Aren't you mad, Jong Kook?
- "Did you eat?"

1017
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,470
Do I sound that vulgar?

1018
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,320
(Jong Kook's angry
to hear his vulgar tone.)

1019
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,180
- Se Chan, you try calling Hyuk.
- All right.

1020
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,120
- "Hello?"
- I think you can fake his voice.

1021
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,320
Here's the ring tone.

1022
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,990
Put it on speakerphone.

1023
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,990
Look at it shaking.

1024
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,490
Hey, Jong Kook.

1025
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,800
Hyuk, where are you?

1026
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,470
Me?

1027
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,100
I'm on Olympic Boulevard
Expressway right now.

1028
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,260
Where are you headed?

1029
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,370
I just dropped the kid off.

1030
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,470
I need to go home first
then I have to go to Gangneung.

1031
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,280
So you're going to Gangneung?

1032
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,600
Yes.

1033
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,700
Have you eaten?

1034
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,720
I will on my way to Gangneung.

1035
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,010
You will on the way?

1036
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,990
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1037
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,950
I'm on Jeju Island.
The weather is great here.

1038
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,580
You're in Jeju Island?

1039
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,820
Yes, I finished filming.
The weather is so good.

1040
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,350
Hey, doesn't Tae Hyun
call you these days?

1041
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,660
Gosh, he keeps calling me.
I'm going out of my mind.

1042
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,970
(He starts having small talk.)

1043
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,740
Why does he call me
whenever he's drunk?

1044
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,240
That's what he does these days.

1045
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,800
(He starts to spin a yarn.)

1046
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,240
I think he's obsessed with it.

1047
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,030
Because I'm not answering his calls.

1048
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,550
Is that right?

1049
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,970
It's just making me go crazy.

1050
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,580
I was dragged by him
a couple of times though.

1051
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,320
- Gosh, he dragged you?
- He sure did.

1052
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,350
(His reaction is so sloppy.
"Gosh, he dragged you?")

1053
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,550
Hyuk, where are you?

1054
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,490
- Who is this?
- "Who is this?"

1055
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,950
Hyuk, where are you?

1056
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,760
(There's no way they're going to
complete the mission anyway.)

1057
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,850
Who is this?

1058
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,370
I'm Jae Suk.

1059
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,070
- He didn't know it was me.
- Hey.

1060
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,470
- He really didn't know.
- Gosh, Hyuk.

1061
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,410
- Even when I talked in my tone.
- I can't believe it.

1062
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,410
- He really didn't know.
- Hyuk.

1063
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,470
- It's so funny.
- Yes.

1064
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,700
You've been talking to Se Chan.

1065
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,600
There's no way
he sounded like Jong Kook.

1066
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,870
I talked in my own tone.

1067
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,510
- A voice he's never heard before.
- Hyuk.

1068
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,780
- Hyuk.
- It's hilarious.

1069
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,820
- Yes.
- How can he not know?

1070
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,890
How can you
not know it's someone else?

1071
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,140
(He still thinks it was Jong Kook.)

1072
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,580
So who was I talking to?

1073
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,490
- You were talking to Se Chan.
- I think he thinks you're me.

1074
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,120
And you're talking to
Jae Suk right now.

1075
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,120
Hyuk, please get it together!

1076
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,160
- Hyuk!
- Hyuk!

1077
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,990
(Laughing)

1078
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,030
Hyuk.

1079
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,600
How can you not recognize
Jong Kook's voice?

1080
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,260
The truth is we're not that close.

1081
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,370
What?

1082
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,200
- Hey, you ruined my mission.
- I did?

1083
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,080
It's not you, is it?

1084
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,200
It is me!

1085
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,280
(It is me!)

1086
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,580
It's me, you fool!

1087
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,180
(He's all confused now and
still can't recognize his voice.)

1088
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,680
He can't trust anyone now.

1089
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,390
Hyuk, you're so funny.

1090
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,680
- Thanks. I'll talk to you soon.
- Thank you, Hyuk.

1091
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,050
- All right. Bye.
- Thank you!

1092
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,180
Take care of yourself.

1093
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,720
I can't believe him.

1094
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,300
- This is so funny.
- He talked so smoothly.

1095
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,660
It's so easy to fool him.

1096
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,930
Se Chan, call someone you know.

1097
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,070
(Se Chan from Team Newlyweds
will try calling his friends.)

1098
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,100
Who should I call?

1099
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,830
How about calling Jae Joon?

1100
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,240
- Kang Jae Joon?
- Yes.

1101
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,200
- Jae Joon will notice it's not me.
- All right.

1102
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,410
- Why don't Jong Kook call him?
- What do you usually call him?

1103
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,030
- Do you speak casually with him?
- No, I speak formally.

1104
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,140
- "Hello, sir?" Like this?
- As soon as he answers...

1105
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,350
he says, "My goodness."

1106
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,640
- "My goodness."
- "My goodness."

1107
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,140
- "Where are you?"
- "Where are you?"

1108
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,120
- "I'm off work now."
- "My goodness."

1109
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,410
- "I'm off work now."
- "Where are you?"

1110
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,410
Jong Kook, sounds like him.

1111
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,220
- "Jong Kook."
- Oh, that's it.

1112
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,890
- You're good.
- That's good.

1113
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,160
Then you should try calling him.

1114
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,330
- Yes, you try it.
- Yes.

1115
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:57,990
It's on speaker.

1116
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,930
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

1117
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,530
- Where are you?
- Where are you?

1118
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,370
Are you home?

1119
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,470
I'm somewhere I don't want to be.

1120
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,700
Oh, gosh.

1121
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,080
You mean you're home?

1122
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,970
I'm at the office
of Comedy Big League.

1123
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,550
I see.

1124
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,140
- Wait a minute.
- I...

1125
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,080
- Your voice is... Is this Se Chan?
- My gosh.

1126
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,450
(Wait a minute. Is this Se Chan?)

1127
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,950
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

1128
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,080
- It wasn't Se Chan.
- It wasn't him.

1129
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,160
- It's me. I'm Jong Kook.
- Hey.

1130
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,680
- Jong Kook, how have you been?
- Good.

1131
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,260
We're on a mission right now.

1132
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,100
Jae Joon, you recognized it too fast
so our mission is ruined.

1133
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,070
(Let me talk to him.)

1134
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,160
I'll let you talk to Se Chan.
Just a minute.

1135
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,390
- All right.
- Bye.

1136
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,240
My goodness.

1137
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,200
Wait. This isn't him either.

1138
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,870
- He noticed again.
- It's so hard to fool him.

1139
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,180
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

1140
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,680
Hey, it's me. It's Se Chan.

1141
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,180
Stop lying to me!

1142
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,910
No, it's really is me!

1143
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,890
- Come on. It's me!
- He doesn't...

1144
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,080
- It's me!
- recognize the real one either.

1145
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,410
- Jae Joon.
- He's suspicious of everyone.

1146
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
(So Min talks to Ji Hyo's brother.)

1147
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,550
(Playing word chain game with him
instead of carrying out the mission)

1148
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,660
How can her family member
not notice her voice?

1149
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,930
- I'll talk to you later.
- Thank you, Sung Moon.

1150
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,800
- Here's the result of the mission.
- Okay.

1151
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,490
Se Chan and So Min's team
completed the mission in 15 seconds.

1152
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,870
But the others failed.

1153
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,200
One more team can join them.

1154
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,910
So pick one team
to take them with you.

1155
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,140
This is good.

1156
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,350
We won so we don't have to
pay for it though, right?

1157
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,510
- Yes, you can save your money.
- That's right.

1158
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,120
Then you should take...

1159
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,740
these penniless guys with you.

1160
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,850
- Yes, the old guys.
- These guys?

1161
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,140
Yes, we should
take the old guys with us.

1162
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,780
- Take pity on them.
- Yes, take them.

1163
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,450
- Yes, take us.
- All right.

1164
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,160
All right then.

1165
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,450
- Chosen members should get off.
- All right.

1166
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,620
- It's pretty.
- Wear your masks.

1167
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,620
All right.

1168
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,300
- The four can get off the bus.
- All right.

1169
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,570
Have fun, guys.

1170
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,660
We'll go take some pictures.

1171
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,240
- See you.
- This is so nice.

1172
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,700
So Min, it's this way.

1173
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,180
Gosh, this is nice.

1174
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,870
- It's amazing.
- It's so pretty.

1175
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,200
I think it's this spot.
Photo of A Lifetime Course.

1176
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,640
- Where?
- There.

1177
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,450
Yes, this is it.

1178
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,990
- There's something to eat too.
- We should take photos here.

1179
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,510
Gosh, that's tangerine juice.

1180
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,550
It's really delicious.

1181
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,530
There's a Polaroid camera too.

1182
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,180
Gosh, what's this?

1183
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,120
You may choose the services.
The prices are listed on the menu.

1184
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,220
So Min, you can buy that.
But come here first.

1185
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,330
It's tangerine bread, isn't it?

1186
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,030
- Let's buy the couples' bracelets.
- Okay.

1187
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,870
- Choose one.
- Okay. It's pretty.

1188
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:19,870
It costs 30 dollars.

1189
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,700
I'll take two for me and my wife.

1190
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,910
You said you're not married.

1191
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,930
- I have a wife.
- Now he was a wife.

1192
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,410
I'll buy these
for Ji Hyo and Na Eun.

1193
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,280
- Then take two. Three?
- I will buy...

1194
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,240
photo of your lifetime taken
by Chan Hee. It’s 50 dollars.

1195
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
That's good.

1196
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,720
We will take
the immortal photo of...

1197
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
- The Polaroid camera.
- your lifetime taken by Chan Hee.

1198
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,010
- Yes, I'd like that.
- I want photos from Chan Hee.

1199
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,330
(Kang Chan Hee, Camera director
"Running Man", "Family Outing")

1200
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,490
("X man", "Love Letter", "2 Days
and 1 Night", "Happy Together")

1201
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,220
- Yes, Chan Hee will take photos.
- Okay.

1202
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,160
Here we go.

1203
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,760
Shouldn't the apprentice
be stand up?

1204
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,120
Gosh, sit here then.

1205
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,300
Shouldn't the apprentice
be standing up?

1206
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,370
- I'll hold up the reflector.
- Okay.

1207
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,140
What's with these two shots?

1208
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,780
Smile at least.

1209
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,510
What is this?

1210
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,600
Is it done?

1211
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,680
1, 2, 3.

1212
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,180
(Clicking)

1213
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,050
- You take one alone.
- All right.

1214
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,260
- You need one for your funeral.
- For his funeral?

1215
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,180
(His apprentice is
planning for his funeral?)

1216
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,760
- Here it is.
- Yes.

1217
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,050
I wonder how it came out.
I wish my bubbles are in it.

1218
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,350
Here.

1219
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,330
This looks like...

1220
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,390
they're going to die soon.

1221
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,910
Is it a photo of their spirits?

1222
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,070
- Are we ghosts?
- Why did it come out like this?

1223
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,830
It looks like
we're going to die soon.

1224
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,870
- And it costs 50 dollars?
- Gosh.

1225
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,010
Gosh, Chan Hee.

1226
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,600
- Immortal photo?
- Where's your immortal photo?

1227
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,640
What is this?

1228
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,240
How can you make us
look like we're about to die?

1229
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,780
Let me see it.

1230
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,240
Gosh, this makes me sad.

1231
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,180
- You two get a photo.
- Yes, we should.

1232
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,450
- Hold up the reflector.
- All right. The reflector.

1233
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,620
- Blow some bubbles too.
- Okay.

1234
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,050
Blow some bubbles, please.

1235
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,890
Hey, Mr. Human Cultural Asset.

1236
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,050
- Help us out.
- All right.

1237
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,720
(What a friendly
human cultural asset.)

1238
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,260
- Seok Sam.
- Yes, sir.

1239
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,530
(But he's strict
with his apprentice.)

1240
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,570
"Seok Sam."

1241
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,660
- "Hold this up."
- Okay.

1242
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,870
Here we go.

1243
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,030
Se Chan, move towards So Min.

1244
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,680
- Okay.
- Look towards her.

1245
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,740
Look towards her.

1246
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,240
Wait a minute.

1247
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,080
(His face turns
as red as his scarlet gums.)

1248
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,220
Just do it.

1249
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,510
Can't you take off your sunglasses?

1250
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,510
- That looks nice.
- Gosh, the bubbles.

1251
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,450
1, 2...

1252
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,280
- Wait.
- Do you usually press on two?

1253
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
1, 2.

1254
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,580
(He pressed the shutter
on the count of two.)

1255
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,260
- Wait.
- Do you usually press on two?

1256
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,930
- Do you usually do that?
- You should press on three.

1257
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,100
Is it normal to go on two?

1258
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,160
Again.

1259
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,300
- Here we go.
- Suk Jin, you're too close.

1260
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,600
- I am?
- Get out of the way.

1261
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,740
- Suk Jin, you're too close.
- Okay.

1262
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,510
Only two of us
should be in the picture.

1263
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,580
Suk Jin.

1264
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,510
- Here we go.
- Ready.

1265
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,800
1, 2, 3.

1266
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,080
- This one will be good.
- Great.

1267
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,240
- I'm sure of it.
- Yes, I'm sure.

1268
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,720
- So Min.
- Yes?

1269
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,350
I think you're really enjoying this.

1270
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,390
(Look at this.)

1271
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,550
- Let me see.
- Look at the photo.

1272
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,220
- What is this?
- What's this?

1273
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,030
This looks really weird.
What do I do?

1274
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,260
It's weird.

1275
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,030
We look too close.

1276
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,830
- It's like you're really on a trip.
- Yes, this looks real.

1277
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,370
- Come on. This isn't right.
- You two look real.

1278
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,800
- Looks like you're really in love.
- Yes, they're in love.

1279
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,030
You two look like
a couple on a honeymoon trip.

1280
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,470
And you took a photo of us
looking like we're about to die?

1281
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,080
- Come on.
- What's with our photo?

1282
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,120
How can you make it look like
it's the end of our world?

1283
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,680
- Their picture is so much nicer.
- What about our photo?

1284
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,450
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1285
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,580
- This photo's so funny.
- The photo is...

1286
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,160
We spent 250 dollars on photos.

1287
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,990
- How much did we spend?
- We can...

1288
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,200
- How much?
- We can spend more.

1289
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,990
Everyone, please get off.

1290
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:35,160
(The other members are
where they can't see the ocean.)

1291
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,760
Four of you can't take photos here.

1292
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,260
But one of you will have
to pay for the photos.

1293
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,010
You'll play Tumbling Tug-of-War
to decide who will pay.

1294
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,080
- Tug-of-war?
- Tug-of-war?

1295
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,280
It's a one on one tournament.

1296
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,050
Two members will wear...

1297
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,740
belts attached
at each end of the spring.

1298
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,390
You have one minute...

1299
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,890
to make the CD in the middle
move towards your opponent.

1300
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:57,990
- Towards your opponent's side?
- Yes.

1301
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,910
You lose if the CD is close to you.

1302
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,180
The one who loses until the end...

1303
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,490
will pay for the photos.

1304
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,260
So the CD
should be far away from me?

1305
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,600
- That's right.
- Okay.

1306
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,260
Let's start
with Lee Kwang Soo and Haha.

1307
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,490
- Ready.
- How do I do this?

1308
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,800
- The black mark is the middle.
- Set.

1309
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,870
(Nervous)

1310
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,870
(Game begins)

1311
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,910
Haha, you're doing great.

1312
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,470
That's it! Great!

1313
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,950
(Swinging his hips quickly)

1314
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,910
Okay! That's great.

1315
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,350
(Seems like the CD likes Kwang Soo)

1316
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,950
(Mathematics genius
learned games from book.)

1317
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,820
(This is fun.)

1318
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,660
Gosh, Kwang Soo!

1319
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,910
Great. Swing it more.

1320
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,490
(This isn't working.)

1321
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,800
(Disgusting hip movements)

1322
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,220
(His moves are embarrassing.)

1323
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,970
No, you can't let him win.

1324
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,970
Okay. There you go.

1325
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,390
You can't use your wrists like that.

1326
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,490
Okay. Again.

1327
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,760
- No.
- You can do this.

1328
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:50,160
- 4, 3...
- We need to go!

1329
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,370
(Will Kwang Soo win like this?)

1330
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,510
(Game over)

1331
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,080
(The whistle was blown.)

1332
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,370
What is happening?

1333
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,010
(Centerline)

1334
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,950
(The CD moved toward Kwang Soo
beyond the centerline.)

1335
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,350
(What? Why is it coming toward me?)

1336
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,410
(Assistant Manager Ha won after
an unexpected buzzer beater.)

1337
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,990
- It passed the centerline.
- But this is...

1338
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,550
- The finishing point matters.
- Yes.

1339
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,700
- Kwang Soo.
- Gosh.

1340
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,530
- Gosh, this is...
- This is so funny.

1341
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,260
- This is so funny.
- Why am I dizzy?

1342
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,100
- Should I go?
- Ji Hyo, you must win.

1343
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,640
(Round 2,
Jong Kook versus Ji Hyo)

1344
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,330
This is amazing, Jong Kook.
We just have to win this round.

1345
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,700
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

1346
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,080
It's over for us
if you lose this round, Ji Hyo.

1347
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,240
Let's win.

1348
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,510
- Ready.
- Move your hand away from it.

1349
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,870
(It's a game
on the edge of a cliff.)

1350
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,370
We must win.

1351
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,740
- Do it the other way.
- That's it.

1352
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,820
Do it the other way.

1353
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,240
- Ji Hyo.
- Gosh.

1354
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,490
- Jong Kook.
- Do it the other way.

1355
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:39,990
(He's clenching his molars hard.)

1356
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,430
Jong Kook, don't use your strength
too much from the beginning.

1357
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,680
- Ji Hyo, you're doing a good job.
- What!

1358
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,070
- Don't come toward me!
- Ji Hyo!

1359
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,970
- Don't come toward me!
- Go the other way! You got this!

1360
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,030
No.

1361
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,100
- Don't come toward me.
- The other way!

1362
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,140
That's right.

1363
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,870
End it now.

1364
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,510
Ji Hyo, endure it.

1365
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,470
Endure it.
You're winning right now!

1366
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,280
- Don't come toward me.
- You can do it!

1367
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,550
(Don't come toward me.)

1368
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,320
- Ji Hyo.
- Endure it until we win.

1369
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,580
Please...

1370
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,010
Four...

1371
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,350
- 3, 2.
- Ji Hyo, don't give up.

1372
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,140
That's it!

1373
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:11,820
(Game over)

1374
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,390
Why did you keep coming at me?

1375
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:16,160
- Okay!
- Okay!

1376
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,160
That's it.

1377
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,100
- New Recruit Kim!
- He did it on purpose.

1378
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,330
Our company's name is
actually "New Recruit".

1379
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,160
Team Olympiad lost.

1380
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,570
You will have to pay for everything.

1381
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,030
- Okay.
- We're going to win.

1382
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,600
- We might come in first.
- I know.

1383
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,680
I think it will cost a lot of money.

1384
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,970
- We lost.
- That's right.

1385
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,580
We will take everything like
family and group photos.

1386
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,700
(They spent money for no reason
without even seeing the sea.)

1387
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,640
- Come here, let's take a photo.
- Okay.

1388
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,550
(They're posing like partners.)

1389
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,620
Come here.

1390
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,910
(Ji Hyo also joined the selfie.)

1391
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,820
Kwang Soo.

1392
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:47,180
Aren't you going to join them?

1393
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,680
- Let Lee Kwang Soo in the photo.
- Let's go.

1394
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,680
Let's go.

1395
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,620
We're done. We're done
taking photos.

1396
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,890
- Let's go.
- We're done.

1397
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,070
We're done taking photos.

1398
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,100
We took a lovely photo.

1399
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,070
- The sky is lovely.
- Hurry up.

1400
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,800
- There's no airplane passing by?
- No.

1401
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:02,910
Kwang Soo, hurry up and leave.

1402
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,330
(He just spits out harsh words.)

1403
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,370
(They heard everything.)

1404
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:09,350
An airplane passed by.

1405
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,780
- It was an airplane.
- Where?

1406
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,220
- There's an airplane over there.
- Kwang Soo.

1407
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,240
It already passed by far away.

1408
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,680
(The course ended by just leaving
several wounds on Kwang Soo.)

1409
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,410
- Okay.
- Please get in the car.

1410
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,220
- This is so funny.
- That's right.

1411
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,620
- Did you take photos?
- It's so funny. What should I do?

1412
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,680
- Take a look.
- You should try one of these.

1413
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,830
- This is so...
- But you look really...

1414
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:27,160
- close and lovely in the photo.
- Who wants some tangerine juice?

1415
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,620
- Me.
- I want some.

1416
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,240
- Try this.
- This is funny. "Newlyweds."

1417
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,640
We'll get going now.

1418
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,010
This is really good.

1419
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,470
- It looks good.
- You gave him the good picture.

1420
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,280
- The total fee we used is...
- Yes?

1421
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,970
We spent a lot.

1422
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,100
You became sentimental.

1423
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,350
Take a look at that.

1424
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,410
Look at the horizon.

1425
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:48,990
Look at the sunset.

1426
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,120
(While everyone is immersed
in the scenery,)

1427
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,490
(Suk Jin is stealing snacks.)

1428
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,680
(Gosh, Suk Jin.)

1429
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,580
(The pupil is not romantic since
he's worn out from the hardships.)

1430
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,950
The sky is really beautiful.

1431
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,050
We're on our way
to eat something good.

1432
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,390
- Really? You should eat this.
- Yes.

1433
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,870
This time...

1434
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,430
(He returns the snack right away.)

1435
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,600
- Suk Jin...
- Are you serious?

1436
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,140
- His tone was...
- "You should eat this."

1437
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,300
so detestable.

1438
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,680
It's obvious that he was serious.

1439
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,080
But he's...

1440
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,200
- being serious.
- I was joking.

1441
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,700
- Were you joking?
- You were serious.

1442
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,470
- He wasn't trying to be funny.
- "You should eat this."

1443
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,640
- "You should eat this."
- He's serious.

1444
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,820
He's being real.

1445
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,490
I'm dumbfounded by the timing
I said that.

1446
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,580
I'm sorry.

1447
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,320
"You should eat this."

1448
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,580
- Look at this view.
- Gosh,

1449
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,430
look at this panorama. It's so nice.

1450
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,850
Since the sun is setting,
it's making me slightly sentimental.

1451
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,450
- Yes, my heart is...
- Do you know that?

1452
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,470
- This is the third schedule.
- Yes.

1453
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:37,700
We will enjoy playing
Jeju Island Full Course Feast...

1454
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,800
with a clear ocean view
as the background.

1455
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,870
Braised hairtail, which is a dish
that represents Jeju Island,

1456
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,370
and all kinds of fresh seafood
have been prepared.

1457
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,410
I'm going to eat this.

1458
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,450
The number of people who will
enjoy the feast is five people.

1459
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,240
- Let's eat.
- The number is too little.

1460
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,720
- Five people...
- That's a lot.

1461
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,850
It's out of eight people.

1462
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,820
- Five people are doable.
- Yes, it is.

1463
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,620
This game is Half Proverb Quiz.

1464
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,550
It will be an individual match.

1465
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:03,620
(The game will proceed
as an individual match.)

1466
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,030
- It's not a team match.
- We shouldn't do proverbs.

1467
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,160
It's advantageous to Team Olympiad.

1468
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,160
That's possible.

1469
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,490
- That's right.
- Proverbs are...

1470
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,930
Five questions will be given
to each person continuously.

1471
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,760
Listen to the last part
of the sentence...

1472
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,640
- of the proverb we say.
- Okay.

1473
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,910
Complete the front part
within three seconds.

1474
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,470
- That's hard.
- Proverbs.

1475
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,350
- You'll tell us the last part only?
- Only the last part?

1476
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,680
If we say the last part,
you have the get the first part.

1477
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,580
- The front part?
- There are a lot of hard proverbs.

1478
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,350
- We will start right away.
- Okay.

1479
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,120
- Let's start with this side.
- Let's start with this side.

1480
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,280
If you can't say it
after we say "1, 2, 3.",

1481
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,620
- you will be out.
- Okay.

1482
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,820
Ready,

1483
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,430
go!

1484
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:36,890
It's better to get beaten...

1485
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,030
1, 2, 3.

1486
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:42,470
(It's better to get beaten...)

1487
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,470
Okay.

1488
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:45,930
- "It's better to get beaten"?
- "It's better to get beaten"?

1489
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:47,430
It's better to get beaten first.

1490
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,140
- "It's better to get beaten first."
- I couldn't think of it.

1491
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,410
This is confusing though.

1492
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,430
- I'm not sure about this.
- This is hard.

1493
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,470
- It's better to get beaten...
- This is the second question.

1494
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,850
"The best side dish..."

1495
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,410
1, 2, 3.

1496
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,140
- Quail eggs!
- Hunger!

1497
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,890
(Quail eggs?)

1498
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,820
- "Quail eggs"?
- What do you mean by "quail eggs"?

1499
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,580
- Is it "quail eggs"?
- It was "Hunger."

1500
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,280
- Quail eggs...
- Quail eggs are also a side dish.

1501
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,720
Quail eggs are a side dish.

1502
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:12,450
- Please give us a little more.
- This is hard.

1503
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:13,800
It's too far back.

1504
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,260
- This is the third question.
- Okay.

1505
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,370
This is hard though.

1506
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,370
Spraying ashes on...

1507
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,640
Cooked rice.

1508
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,030
(Spraying ashes on cooked rice.)

1509
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:27,100
(The members figured out
the answer right away.)

1510
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,050
- Spraying ashes on cooked rice.
- No way.

1511
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,140
(Timeout)

1512
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,850
(It was close, but she failed.)

1513
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,820
How could we not answer
even one question?

1514
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:35,620
But I think this is doable.

1515
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,390
- Okay.
- We got zero points.

1516
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:38,990
- I really don't know what it is...
- In my opinion...

1517
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,280
- If we just get two right, we win.
- Here we go.

1518
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,280
It's Lee Kwang Soo's turn.

1519
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,430
I can't think of anything.

1520
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:44,890
Don't even look at...

1521
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,600
Trees you can't climb.

1522
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,970
(Correct!)

1523
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:49,570
Trees you can't climb.

1524
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,370
(What happened to Kwang Soo?)

1525
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:53,800
Even dogs won't catch...

1526
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,410
Winter colds.

1527
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,740
Summer colds.

1528
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,330
(Even dogs won't catch
winter colds?)

1529
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,010
- Summer colds.
- It's "summer".

1530
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:02,010
- Summer colds.
- Winter colds?

1531
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,470
A lot of people catch colds
in the winter.

1532
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,240
<i>- Winter colds</i>
- Okay.

1533
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,370
- I was close, but I got it wrong.
- Okay.

1534
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,010
They say it's rustling...

1535
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,080
(They say it's rustling...)

1536
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,890
(It's a question that's even hard
for proverb expert Jae Suk.)

1537
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,330
Effortlessly?

1538
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:19,660
What is that?

1539
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,570
(They say it's rustling
effortlessly?)

1540
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:22,930
- That's not it.
- What is it?

1541
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,470
What was it? It was something
related to sound.

1542
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:27,300
The oak leaf says that
the pine leaf is rustling.

1543
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,010
- That's right.
- That's it.

1544
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,760
- I knew it.
- This is important.

1545
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,180
- That's right.
- This difficulty will be intense.

1546
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,180
This is hard.

1547
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,200
- This is hard.
- This is the last question.

1548
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,800
The sister-in-law is
more irritating...

1549
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,220
Than the mother-in-law
who hits you.

1550
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,280
- That's not it.
- It's "who stops the fight is..."

1551
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,720
The sister-in-law who stops
the fight is...

1552
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,180
The mother-in-law who hits you.

1553
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:44,850
In my opinion, we will get to eat
if we get one question right.

1554
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,280
- You will get to eat.
- You will get to eat.

1555
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,180
- It's Kim Jong Kook's turn.
- Okay, I'll try.

1556
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,350
- It's really hard.
- I think Jong Kook will be good.

1557
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,720
- I'm not sure.
- It's hard.

1558
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,030
- It's hard.
- Let's get going.

1559
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:54,990
Your crotch will get ripped...

1560
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:59,700
Crane legs will also...

1561
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,600
It's "storks".

1562
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,030
The crotch of crow-tits will get
ripped if they follow storks.

1563
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,330
- It's "storks".
- Storks.

1564
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,930
Crow-tits were following storks.

1565
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,850
- I get what you're talking about.
- Crane legs.

1566
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,640
- Crane legs.
- Crane legs.

1567
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,850
I knew what it was.

1568
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,450
- This is the second question.
- This is hard.

1569
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:17,620
You can't see through
someone's mind...

1570
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,820
Even if you know
1,000 fathoms of water,

1571
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,050
you can't see through
someone's mind.

1572
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,350
- It's "10 fathoms of water".
- 10 fathoms of water.

1573
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,990
(It was close,
but it's a wrong answer.)

1574
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,280
(Even if you know
10 fathoms of water,)

1575
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,550
(you can't see through
someone's mind.)

1576
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,100
- It's "10 fathoms of water".
- It's "10 fathoms of water".

1577
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,470
- It's confusing.
- Gosh.

1578
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,120
Please be quiet by his side.

1579
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,490
I said it after the bell was struck.

1580
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,410
"I said it after..."

1581
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,160
- It's "10 fathoms of water".
- It's "10 fathoms of water".

1582
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,300
This is the last question.

1583
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,510
Jong Kook's proverbs are hard.

1584
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,280
We will get to eat
if we get one question right.

1585
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,700
You will get first place
if you get two questions right.

1586
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,820
Rice cakes...

1587
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,010
Give one more rice cake to
the child you hate? That's not it.

1588
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,850
(Incorrect!)

1589
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,120
- Rice cakes you can't eat...
- Rice cakes in drawings.

1590
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,490
(He couldn't answer
such an easy question.)

1591
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:54,490
But this is...

1592
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,760
- They just gave this to you.
- Gosh.

1593
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:59,160
- The last part is not enough.
- It's hard. I can't think of it.

1594
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,550
It's easy after you hear the answer.

1595
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,660
You don't know what it is.

1596
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,990
I'm currently in first place.

1597
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,430
- It's Haha's turn.
- Haha.

1598
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,700
I'm getting confident though.

1599
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,830
To sow the wind...

1600
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:08,930
And reap the whirlwind!

1601
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,740
(Correct!)

1602
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,800
He's going to eat.

1603
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,180
There will be a hole to survive...

1604
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,970
Needle.

1605
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:15,970
Needle!

1606
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,010
(Because of So Min's distraction,
he says "needle".)

1607
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,740
- Did you say that?
- Even mouse holes...

1608
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,820
Even if the sky collapses,
there will be a hole to survive.

1609
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,350
- It's not "mouse hole".
- Gosh.

1610
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,390
- I'm angry.
- How could you not know this?

1611
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,490
- This is a famous proverb.
- How could you not know this?

1612
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:29,760
This is the third question.

1613
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:31,160
To deceive yourself...

1614
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,760
- Cover your eyes!
- This was easy.

1615
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,550
(Correct!)

1616
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,220
- This was easy.
- Cover your eyes...

1617
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,890
- Haha is in first place.
- to deceive yourself.

1618
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:40,160
To be honest,
his questions are too easy.

1619
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,160
- My questions were too hard.
- That's right.

1620
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,760
- Ji Hyo's was tough too.
- Okay, I got two.

1621
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:45,780
The difficulty is too...

1622
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,510
- There's too much of a difference.
- How hard it will be for me?

1623
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:48,580
- Yes, it's like that.
- Yes.

1624
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,870
Haha, you're in first place.

1625
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,010
Whose turn is it now?
Se Chan or So Min?

1626
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,350
- It's So Min's turn.
- That's right.

1627
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,620
Junsobari.

1628
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,990
- I don't think I'll get it right.
- So Min.

1629
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,910
They will go on top
of the stove first...

1630
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,820
A whimsical calf!

1631
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,330
(Whimsical So Min said
the wrong answer.)

1632
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,620
It's "well-behaved cat".

1633
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,160
So Min, you...

1634
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,330
- I...
- What did she say?

1635
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:08,720
I suddenly didn't remember it.

1636
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,370
- A whimsical calf?
- She's really whimsical.

1637
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:12,800
Wait a minute. Yes.

1638
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,030
This is the second question.

1639
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,660
A well-behaved cat?

1640
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,680
You will survive
if you recover your senses...

1641
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,910
- A crazy man...
- What?

1642
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,080
(She blatantly throws out
wrong answers.)

1643
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,780
- It's "if you're in a tiger's den".
- Wait a minute.

1644
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,680
- It's "a tiger's den", isn't it?
- A tiger's den.

1645
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,350
- This was too easy.
- This was too easy.

1646
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,550
- How could you not know this?
- Even if you're in a tiger's den...

1647
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,320
This is the third question.

1648
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,280
You can't give it to dogs...

1649
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,390
- Someone else's habits!
- What is this?

1650
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,120
- It's "your habits".
- It's "your habits".

1651
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,800
- Your habits.
- This was too easy.

1652
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,300
- To someone else?
- To dogs.

1653
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:44,970
- In my opinion, the meanings...
- It's easy when you hear it.

1654
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:47,260
- of what I said are similar.
- That's right.

1655
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,570
- Only the details were wrong.
- "A well-behaved cat"...

1656
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,580
and "An eccentric cow"
are entirely different.

1657
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,870
I said the first thing that came
to my mind.

1658
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,180
- Let's go.
- You become dazed.

1659
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,600
- Se Chan.
- Here I go.

1660
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
- Let's go.
- Try to get one right.

1661
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:58,970
Out of the blue.

1662
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:04,890
(He just needs to get
one question right in order to eat!)

1663
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,990
- A squid.
- A bolt!

1664
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,550
(A bolt out of the blue)

1665
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,760
- A bolt.
- Hey, it was a really easy one.

1666
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,160
I will have no expectations.
I have zero expectations.

1667
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,030
I can't tease him
because it's unbelievable.

1668
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,930
You know how it is.

1669
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,760
I couldn't say what I know
due to nerves.

1670
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:24,700
A goby also jumps.

1671
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,330
When a pencil squid jumps,
a goby also jumps.

1672
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,580
(When a pencil squid jumps,
a goby also jumps.)

1673
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,450
(He sounds like a pencil squid
that is upset.)

1674
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,180
- When a gray mullet jumps...
- Is it a gray mullet?

1675
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,550
- Yes, it's a gray mullet.
- It isn't a pencil squid.

1676
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:35,990
I thought it was a pencil squid.

1677
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,350
This is the last question.

1678
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,320
He didn't get
a single question right.

1679
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,450
With acorns.

1680
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:41,530
(With acorns)

1681
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,300
(He must get this question right
in order to eat!)

1682
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:47,350
Comparing the heights.

1683
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,660
(Comparing the heights!)

1684
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,070
- That's wrong.
- It's "With acorns".

1685
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,530
Dog food.

1686
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:57,370
(Dog food with acorns)

1687
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,080
- It's so embarrassing.
- The production crew is laughing.

1688
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,780
Comparing the heights!

1689
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,140
- The newlyweds are out.
- That was hilarious.

1690
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,700
- Excuse me.
- Suk Jin.

1691
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,450
I will show you the perfect score.

1692
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:08,510
- Suk Jin.
- Okay.

1693
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,010
Suk Jin knows a lot of proverbs.

1694
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,550
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

1695
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,350
Looks at the roof.

1696
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:16,530
Dog... Dr. Dog.

1697
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:17,780
(Looks at the roof)

1698
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:20,800
- Dr. Dog?
- Dr. Dog?

1699
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,660
He said he can get
all the proverbs right.

1700
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,530
Hold on. Gosh.

1701
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:26,600
I knew it had something to do
with "Dog".

1702
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,100
I couldn't think of it.

1703
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,760
- I didn't know...
- A dog that was chasing a chicken.

1704
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,410
- what kind of dog it was.
- Let's go.

1705
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:32,740
You glare at the Han River.

1706
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,330
After scowling.

1707
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:37,180
(After scowling,
you glare at the Han River.)

1708
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,780
- Isn't it "After getting slapped"?
- After getting slapped at Jongno.

1709
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,950
Is that it?

1710
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:41,550
Where did "After scowling" come
from?

1711
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:42,990
I couldn't think of it.

1712
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,320
You kept going,
"How could you not know that?"

1713
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,850
- "After scowling"?
- After scowling.

1714
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:49,490
I suddenly couldn't remember it.

1715
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,600
- Let's resume.
- Okay.

1716
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,490
- A chicken.
- A dog that was chasing a chicken!

1717
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,570
(A dog that was chasing a chicken!)

1718
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,160
- My goodness.
- What is it?

1719
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,160
What is the answer?

1720
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,240
- Not a pheasant, but a chicken.
- Not a pheasant, but a chicken.

1721
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,870
- What is up with you?
- You should try it!

1722
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,430
You shouldn't have been so snobby.

1723
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,600
- You should try it.
- After getting the same proverb,

1724
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,370
you went,
"A dog that was chasing a chicken!"

1725
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,050
This is the last question.
To Gangnam.

1726
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:16,510
(Will he be able
to get the first part right?)

1727
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,820
- You follow your friend.
- That was easy.

1728
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,050
Hold on!

1729
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,180
(You follow your friend to Gangnam.)

1730
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,680
Hold on! Why did he get
such an easy one?

1731
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,580
- Okay.
- It was too easy.

1732
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,100
- It was too easy.
- Seriously.

1733
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,300
- I mean...
- It was too easy.

1734
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,120
I will go next.

1735
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,600
- Jae Suk.
- All right.

1736
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,140
- Let's see how well you can do.
- You know,

1737
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,430
I need to get
1 or 2 questions right.

1738
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:36,530
You only get three seconds.

1739
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:38,240
You just need to get
one question right.

1740
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,910
Let's begin.

1741
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,510
And meat is for chewing.

1742
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,050
(He often flaunted his knowledge
to other members.)

1743
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:47,010
(Will the human cultural asset
get it right?)

1744
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,270
- What?
- Song Dae Kwan.

1745
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,810
- Insadol.
- What?

1746
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,100
(- Song Dae Kwan.
- Insadol.)

1747
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,740
You need strong teeth.

1748
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,140
- Song Dae Kwan.
- Insadol.

1749
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,540
Which proverb ends
with "And meat is for chewing"?

1750
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,620
- What is that?
- What is that?

1751
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,390
Words are for talking
and meat is for chewing.

1752
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,020
- That sounds familiar.
- It's so difficult.

1753
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,330
Why is it so difficult?
The difficulty level is too high.

1754
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,990
Gets no wind.

1755
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,120
This one is easy.

1756
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,870
- It's easy.
- What was it? A household?

1757
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,200
A household?

1758
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,970
You were being so cocky earlier.

1759
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:21,240
- What is it?
- A tree with many branches.

1760
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,390
- A tree with many branches.
- A tree with many branches.

1761
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:25,240
Gosh, I knew this proverb.
I have to get one right.

1762
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,310
You only remember it
after you hear the answer.

1763
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,640
- Okay.
- That was funny.

1764
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,700
He might not be able to eat.

1765
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,910
Keep you awake all night long.

1766
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:32,970
- This one is easy.
- Late-learned thieving skills...

1767
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:33,970
keep you awake all night long.

1768
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,970
I thought it was
"Thieving for the first time".

1769
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,990
Who came in last?

1770
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,040
There must be many people.

1771
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,990
- We came in last.
- 4 people got 0 questions right.

1772
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:42,790
- 4 people?
- There is space for 1 more person.

1773
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:44,950
Why don't the four of you play
rock-paper-scissors?

1774
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,890
Why don't you give us
the same question?

1775
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,600
- The one who answers should eat.
- Shall we do that?

1776
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,600
Let's go.

1777
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,620
And he asks to give you his bag.

1778
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:55,890
(And he asks to give you his bag.)

1779
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:57,970
Talk to a porter
and he asks to give you his bag.

1780
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,330
(Talk to a porter
and he asks to give you his bag.)

1781
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,430
(And he asks to give you his bag.)

1782
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,080
(Se Chan is out.)

1783
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,410
- Gosh, it's so easy.
- Do you know it?

1784
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,470
You spare a man
and he asks to give you his bag.

1785
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,390
Save a man from drowning
and he asks to give you his bag.

1786
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,240
- There you go.
- That's right.

1787
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,790
(Save a man from drowning
and he asks to give you his bag.)

1788
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:16,180
- Okay.
- Is that the first part?

1789
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,580
- The first part.
- Save a man from drowning.

1790
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,390
- That's right.
- Jong Kook succeeded.

1791
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,520
Why isn't it about a porter?

1792
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,490
Save a man from drowning
and he asks to give you his bag.

1793
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:24,490
It's about a drowning man.

1794
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:25,770
Thus,

1795
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,540
five members except for Ji Hyo,
So Min, and Se Chan will eat.

1796
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,870
Okay.

1797
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,410
(They acquire a stamp.)

1798
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,970
What is this?

1799
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,330
Oh, my goodness!

1800
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,770
- It's the braised hairtail.
- What is this?

1801
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:38,600
- What is this?
- What is this?

1802
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,720
This is a meal you must eat.

1803
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,910
It's tasty.

1804
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:44,140
(Running Tour provides
a proper meal.)

1805
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,740
- It's so tasty.
- Thank you.

1806
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,060
Thank you for the meal.

1807
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,620
- We got this dish.
- Let's mix it with rice.

1808
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,430
Do you want some hairtail?

1809
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,700
- Yes!
- Do you want some hairtail?

1810
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,760
Please give us some.

1811
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,770
Please give us a piece.

1812
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:58,990
Then you should get
a question right.

1813
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,790
What question?

1814
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,970
I will give you three seconds.
Can I decide on a member?

1815
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,410
- Devotion will touch the sky.
- I mean...

1816
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:06,810
- Can I decide on a member?
- Devotion...

1817
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,640
(The proverb quiz
left Se Chan traumatized.)

1818
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,350
He asked if he can decide on
the member.

1819
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,100
- I will decide on Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

1820
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,870
Travels 400km.

1821
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:17,390
A foot without words...

1822
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,680
(A foot without words?)

1823
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,240
- A word without feet...
- A foot without words!

1824
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,220
- I am sorry.
- A word without feet.

1825
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,620
I am sorry.

1826
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,080
I can't believe she said,
"A foot without words".

1827
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,490
- A word without feet...
- A foot without words!

1828
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,700
- A foot without words!
- She was in a hurry.

1829
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,520
The wrong proverb suits Ji Hyo.

1830
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,990
The losers will play a game
to decide who will pay.

1831
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,430
- Yes.
- That's right.

1832
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:38,560
- Thank goodness both of us won.
- I know.

1833
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,540
- I will give you the game.
- Okay.

1834
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:45,100
Se Chan will pay.

1835
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,100
Okay!

1836
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,020
- You lost.
- That was pretty far.

1837
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,350
- The total of the meal is...
- How much is it?

1838
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,080
- 374 dollars.
- What?

1839
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,080
(374 dollars!)

1840
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,790
It isn't as expensive as I thought.

1841
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,990
The first place was
the most expensive.

1842
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,850
You ate a lot.
The total is 370 dollars.

1843
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:05,390
We will get coffee to go...

1844
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,390
- and move on to the last mission.
- Okay.

1845
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,890
- We should turn the tables.
- Let's do that.

1846
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:13,410
(They completed the course.)

1847
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,740
What comes now isn't a mission.

1848
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,540
You just need to go to the cafe
and order coffee to go.

1849
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,370
- Really?
- Who wants to go?

1850
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,770
We will go.

1851
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,370
No, no. My pupil is here.

1852
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:25,040
- Your pupil.
- Seok Sam can go.

1853
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,390
- Your pupil.
- Listen.

1854
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,160
I have a few pupils too.

1855
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,160
- Like who?
- What?

1856
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,180
Didn't you say
you were born in 2002?

1857
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,560
- He was born in 2004.
- 2004.

1858
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:36,450
In which year were you born?

1859
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:37,990
2001.

1860
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,290
- He is older.
- You are older.

1861
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,390
Why are you speaking so casually
to an older boy?

1862
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:43,200
- Seok Sam.
- Why do I need to...

1863
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:44,640
Why did I become someone
who was born in 2004?

1864
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,740
Seok Sam, I can't believe you!

1865
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,700
Do you want me to whip your legs?

1866
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,910
What about my legs?

1867
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:53,080
- He is polite to Jae Suk.
- Listen.

1868
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:54,810
You look young. Why don't you go?

1869
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:56,240
(Are you interested in me?)

1870
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:57,850
Are you interested in me?

1871
01:01:57,850 --> 01:01:59,140
(Laughing)

1872
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,720
He is happy.

1873
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,350
- He is happy.
- He is single.

1874
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:03,890
He said earlier that he is single.

1875
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,290
Since I am going through puberty,
I am interested.

1876
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,390
- Seok Sam, stay in your lane.
- He is going through puberty!

1877
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:12,390
- He is going through puberty!
- This is insane.

1878
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,790
The newlyweds and Seok Sam
should go.

1879
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:14,790
That's a good idea.

1880
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:15,890
We will go together.

1881
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:17,410
Seok Sam, let's go together.

1882
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:18,540
Okay, Seok Sam.

1883
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,370
Why did I become a boy
who was born in 2004?

1884
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,010
- Wait for us.
- Seok Sam, wait for us.

1885
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,140
Okay.

1886
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,700
- How pretty!
- Seom and Some.

1887
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:26,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

1888
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,080
- How pretty! It's pretty here.
- Hello.

1889
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,580
I really like this.

1890
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,740
Let's buy some bread too.

1891
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,620
- Let's do that.
- Shall we get the corn sticks?

1892
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,580
Two cups of iced chamomile tea.

1893
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,060
The bread is incredible.

1894
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,720
This is where you take photos.

1895
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,720
Where?

1896
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,830
- My goodness.
- Hey.

1897
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,100
- How pretty!
- Shall I take a photo of you guys?

1898
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,100
It would look really beautiful
during the day.

1899
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,330
This is where you take photos.

1900
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:49,490
I will take a photo of you guys.

1901
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:50,640
- Okay.
- My goodness.

1902
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,100
This is an amazing spot.

1903
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:55,140
1, 2, 3.

1904
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,850
(We are newlyweds for the day.
Seok Sam, take nice photos.)

1905
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,310
- Give me the phone now.
- You should get your photos taken.

1906
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:03,020
Should I keep my mask on?

1907
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,990
- Smile.
- 1, 2, 3.

1908
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,260
(He poses like he went to college
in the 80s and 90s,)

1909
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,160
1, 2, 3. Let's do this.

1910
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,260
Smile.

1911
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,330
- Smile.
- 1, 2, 3.

1912
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,680
(He is taking selfies.)

1913
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,490
1, 2, 3. Let's move a bit here.

1914
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,220
- Let's take it like this.
- It's prettier.

1915
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,830
1, 2, 3.

1916
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:20,700
(Seok Sam is excited.)

1917
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,430
(Making a V-sign)

1918
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:25,470
It came out really well.

1919
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,640
(He is excited to see the photos.)

1920
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,580
(Se Chan runs away
after fooling him.)

1921
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,350
- This is nice.
- When you come to Jeju Island,

1922
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,540
you should take a lot of photos.

1923
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,790
Hold on. Hey.

1924
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:39,850
Did you guys take selfies?

1925
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,450
You took selfies. Okay.

1926
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,680
It's okay.
It's okay to take selfies like that.

1927
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,330
That's what you do
when you are newlyweds.

1928
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,700
This place is the best.

1929
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,450
The two of you should sit here.

1930
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:51,560
Here?

1931
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,060
What a shot!

1932
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,290
Make a heart over your heads.

1933
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,660
- That's so old.
- Go ahead and make a heart.

1934
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,270
- That's so old.
- Come on.

1935
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,140
One... Go ahead and do it.

1936
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,040
1, 2, 3.

1937
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,240
- I should work with cameras.
- Why?

1938
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:08,620
Are you good at taking photos?

1939
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,680
This is a work of art.

1940
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,990
- You take good photos.
- That's a nice photo.

1941
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:13,180
- You take good photos of your wife.
- Yes, I do.

1942
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,680
- I will take your photos for real.
- No.

1943
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,760
- I am serious.
- Suk Jin.

1944
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,180
- I don't need photos.
- I am serious.

1945
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,560
I will take them for real.

1946
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,220
- You need photos from here.
- I don't want to do that.

1947
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:23,600
I don't like what I am wearing.

1948
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,830
(Despite the complaints,
he poses in an old-fashioned way.)

1949
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:27,240
- It's a good shot.
- One...

1950
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,390
(He zoomed in on Suk Jin's face.)

1951
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:31,600
I will focus on your face.

1952
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,930
(This photographer eliminated
the background.)

1953
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:37,010
Okay. You don't need to take
many photos.

1954
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,100
(You can't tell if he is
in Jeju Island or Yeouido.)

1955
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:41,310
He is handsome.
Suk Jin is handsome, isn't he?

1956
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:43,620
I focus on the face
when I take photos.

1957
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,680
I see.

1958
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,390
- I don't focus on the background.
- It's nice.

1959
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:49,020
- What do you think?
- You...

1960
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:50,950
You zoomed in too much.

1961
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,120
I focused on the face.

1962
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,290
- I focused on the face.
- You zoomed in too much.

1963
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:56,430
Be careful.

1964
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,270
Let's get going now.
Is our order ready?

1965
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,040
(They are waiting inside the bus.)

1966
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,390
(Wriggling)

1967
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,830
(He is distracted.)

1968
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,510
You aren't a human cultural asset,
are you?

1969
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,470
(He is too unfocused
to be a human cultural asset.)

1970
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:11,510
What do you do for a living?

1971
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:12,740
Aren't you a human problem?

1972
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,080
- I am a human cultural asset.
- A human problem.

1973
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:18,290
My drawing of an orchid...

1974
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,540
costs 20,000 to 30,000 dollars.

1975
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:21,790
You are an artist.

1976
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,180
- Do you have a nickname?
- What?

1977
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,290
- A pen name?
- Something like a pen name.

1978
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:28,120
How could you call it a nickname?

1979
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,390
A nickname?

1980
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:31,490
You make it sound like a nickname
from school days.

1981
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:34,040
Something like a silly goose.

1982
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,790
A nickname! A nickname!

1983
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:37,560
What's your pen name?

1984
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,010
Do I really need to reveal it
to someone like him?

1985
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:42,180
I am not sure
if you would know, but...

1986
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,970
Do you know
who Johns Hopkins is?

1987
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:48,020
- That came out of nowhere.
- Johns Hopkins.

1988
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:51,450
- He is a famous painter.
- That's right, I respect him a lot.

1989
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:52,890
(Reading the room)

1990
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:55,060
Did you just say Johns Hopkins is
a famous painter?

1991
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,680
- This is insane.
- This is insane.

1992
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,760
I can't have a conversation
with them.

1993
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,330
- What?
- Johns Hopkins.

1994
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:03,490
- Johns Hopkins.
- He is a famous painter, right?

1995
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,270
- Is he a stock investor?
- What?

1996
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:06,430
He asked if he is a stock investor.

1997
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:09,430
Seriously.

1998
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:10,700
Johns Hopkins.

1999
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,080
Do you have a favorite work of his?

2000
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,200
- Yes.
- What is it?

2001
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,310
"Deviation".

2002
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,310
My favorite is "Jonathan's River".

2003
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,770
"Jonathan's River".

2004
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:22,040
- "Jonathan's River".
- It draws you in.

2005
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,770
It's so frustrating to talk to them.

2006
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,990
Why aren't you saying anything?

2007
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,990
Are you laughing
because you understand it?

2008
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:29,080
Of course.

2009
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,680
- I respect him.
- You respect him.

2010
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:33,220
All right. Make light work.

2011
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,620
(A sudden quiz)

2012
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:35,620
Let's.

2013
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,490
(That's ingenious.)

2014
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:40,890
That works too.

2015
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:43,330
- She is witty.
- She is witty.

2016
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:44,430
She is witty.

2017
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,510
- That cafe is a work of art.
- Why?

2018
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,700
It's so nice.

2019
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:49,140
It's so nice.

2020
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,510
Is it by the sea?

2021
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:52,950
It's more than that. It's so big.

2022
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,180
Here you go.

2023
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,770
The packaging is pretty.

2024
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:57,270
Thank you.

2025
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,490
- Okay.
- Who is paying for this?

2026
01:06:58,490 --> 01:06:59,580
Seok Sam, thank you for the coffee.

2027
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,990
- Okay.
- Is Seok Sam paying for this?

2028
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:02,910
It will be included in the total.

2029
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:04,390
The total wasn't that big.

2030
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:05,490
(They go to the location
of the last mission!)

2031
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,830
Are you satisfied with the trip?

2032
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,700
- Yes.
- It's perfect.

2033
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,990
I will now explain
which course remains.

2034
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,890
Give us a chance to turn the tables.

2035
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:16,740
- You can turn the tables.
- Really?

2036
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:18,810
All right.
The best part of flying is...

2037
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:20,560
- the in-flight duty-free shop.
- Yes.

2038
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,810
On the bus,

2039
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:23,910
- you can purchase a souvenir.
- Really?

2040
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,770
- Each team can choose 1 souvenir.
- 1?

2041
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:28,180
There is something
I need to tell you in advance.

2042
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:31,540
Since we don't have time to visit
a souvenir shop,

2043
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,990
So Min will sacrifice her free time
and go with us tomorrow.

2044
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,160
- Good job.
- If you agree, we will give her...

2045
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,220
- a penalty exemption card.
- I will go tomorrow.

2046
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,390
- So Min?
- Yes.

2047
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,160
- She is staying another day.
- We will give it to her.

2048
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,430
- Okay.
- A penalty exemption card.

2049
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,620
- Really?
- You will have a shoot tomorrow.

2050
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,330
- Thank you.
- If you don't want it...

2051
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,970
- I want it. Give it to me.
- It's yours.

2052
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:52,100
Choose a souvenir
So Min will buy it tomorrow.

2053
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,140
- Okay.
- Let's see.

2054
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,240
Let's see.

2055
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,770
- The hairtail set.
- It's expensive.

2056
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:57,970
It's the real deal.

2057
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,010
I want to buy wine.

2058
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,970
- I like tilefish.
- Tilefish is the best.

2059
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:03,720
- It has a long face.
- Then...

2060
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,790
you should take a hairtail set
to your parents.

2061
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,220
Thank you.

2062
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,760
- It's for you, Seok Sam.
- The hairtail.

2063
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:09,850
Yes, the hairtail.

2064
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:11,720
We want tangerine wine.

2065
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,260
- Tangerine wine.
- Let's drink wine.

2066
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,600
We also want tangerine wine.

2067
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,890
- Let's eat cheonhyehyang.
- Aren't you a student?

2068
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,220
- Seriously.
- That's wrong.

2069
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:21,770
- Hey, hey.
- Get the hairtail set.

2070
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,060
Get the hairtail set.

2071
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,160
- Seaweed chips.
- Eat hairtail.

2072
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,870
He looks like seaweed chips,
so that should be his souvenir.

2073
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:27,830
- Hairtail.
- How could you say that?

2074
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,480
- You look like seaweed chips.
- It's your hair.

2075
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:31,900
- I will get the hairtail set.
- Hairtail.

2076
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:34,010
The total cost of the coffee...

2077
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,740
and the expensive souvenirs
you have chosen is...

2078
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,940
- 773 dollars.
- What?

2079
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,610
That's the worst.

2080
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:40,980
I forgot about the coffee.

2081
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:42,980
The last mission will change
the rankings.

2082
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:45,450
- I will explain the last mission.
- Okay.

2083
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:49,120
- Soon, we will arrive at a cafe.
- Okay.

2084
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,430
(Soon, they will arrive at a cafe.)

2085
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:53,320
Two team members
will decide on the order...

2086
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,070
and enter the cafe every one minute.

2087
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:58,160
It's your mission to stay
without getting recognized.

2088
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:00,830
- By whom?
- Only the cafe owner knows.

2089
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:03,070
The part-timers and customers
don't know about the shoot.

2090
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:05,240
- I have an advantage.
- How about the cameras?

2091
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:08,280
The staff members
are already hiding in the cafe.

2092
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,720
(The staff members
are ready to film!)

2093
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:12,540
Two members will enter the cafe
at a time.

2094
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,980
The 2nd team will enter
after 1 minute.

2095
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:18,060
If your name gets called,
you are out.

2096
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,230
That team will get the penalty.

2097
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:20,780
(You are so-and-so, right?)

2098
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:23,530
What if someone says,
"You look familiar?"

2099
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:25,620
- No, your name has to be called.
- Your name.

2100
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,970
Wait until everyone enters the cafe.

2101
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,970
If all eight members enter
without any names being called,

2102
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:33,400
then you need to take turns
to order the drinks too.

2103
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,400
- Can I take off my glasses?
- Of course.

2104
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:36,940
- People don't recognize me.
- We are allowed...

2105
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,240
- to cover our faces, right?
- Can we wear...

2106
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,870
- a hat?
- You can wear a mask and a hat.

2107
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,320
Can we wear sunglasses?

2108
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:43,780
But I am wearing modern hanbok.

2109
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:47,150
But I am wearing modern hanbok.
It will catch people's eyes.

2110
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,480
- You should wear a jacket.
- This is bad.

2111
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,690
Let's play Race of Wits
for the order.

2112
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:53,530
- The losers go first.
- Yes.

2113
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,060
- It's Race of Wits.
- Race of Wits.

2114
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,930
Don't stand up. Call out the number.

2115
01:09:57,930 --> 01:09:59,490
- Get ready.
- Set.

2116
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:00,990
- Set.
- I will go first.

2117
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,330
- I will go fourth.
- Go.

2118
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,330
One.

2119
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,230
- 2.
- 3.

2120
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:06,230
- 4.
- 5.

2121
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:07,230
- 6.
- 2.

2122
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:08,230
- 3.
- 4.

2123
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,230
- 5.
- 6.

2124
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,230
- 7.
- 7.

2125
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:11,350
Okay.

2126
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:12,980
(Seok Sam and Kwang Soo lose.)

2127
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,010
Rock-paper-scissors.

2128
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,410
He is so cute.

2129
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,480
- Kwang Soo is cute.
- Kwang Soo is cute.

2130
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,080
- Kwang Soo is cute.
- He is cute.

2131
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,780
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

2132
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,820
(Team Olympiad will go first.)

2133
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,150
- Okay.
- What happens if Kwang Soo goes...

2134
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:25,430
and gets caught?

2135
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,650
- Then it's game over.
- Is it game over?

2136
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:27,950
That won't do.
Don't send in Kwang Soo first.

2137
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:30,430
No, no. You just need to hang in
for a minute.

2138
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,570
Okay.

2139
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:32,790
A hat and a mask, right?

2140
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,400
Let's do this.

2141
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,830
My hair at the back of my head
is too long.

2142
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:38,860
Kwang Soo,
you look suspicious already.

2143
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,940
(They even turned off the light.)

2144
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,180
Should I put on a cap?

2145
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:42,730
You look suspicious.

2146
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,680
People will recognize you
as soon as you enter.

2147
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,480
Kwang Soo, it's game over.

2148
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,720
- You should know that.
- No.

2149
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,040
- I will show you.
- Don't get your hopes up.

2150
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,350
- Do you have a cap?
- Where is it?

2151
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,480
(The 1st team,
Team Olympiad gets off.)

2152
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:55,280
People rarely recognize me,

2153
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,980
but you are too recognizable.

2154
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,980
I am wearing a school uniform too.

2155
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,120
(Anyone will be able to tell
that he is Lee Kwang Soo.)

2156
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,100
I am too tall to be a high schooler.

2157
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,990
You are too tall
to be a high schooler.

2158
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:05,900
We need to go that way.
Isn't that the cafe?

2159
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,100
(They act natural
and approach the cafe.)

2160
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,940
(However)

2161
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,510
Why are there so many people?

2162
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,030
(Since it's 7:30 p.m. on a weekday,
the cafe is packed...)

2163
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:17,680
(with students and office workers.)

2164
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,150
Let's sit down first.

2165
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,280
(Safely filmed
in adherence to the guidelines)

2166
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:24,150
(The two students enter.)

2167
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,980
(The cafe is packed with customers.)

2168
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:36,490
(A customer looks at Kwang Soo
as soon as he enters.)

2169
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:38,620
(Thankfully, he didn't recognize
Kwang Soo.)

2170
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:42,530
(A staff member's cell phone)

2171
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:46,030
(They walk past the customers
without ordering.)

2172
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:47,700
Let's sit over there.

2173
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:51,610
(They arrive at a secluded place.)

2174
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:57,410
This table is perfect.

2175
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,720
No one will look at us.

2176
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,890
(At that moment,)

2177
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,220
(a customer looks at Ji Hyo!)

2178
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,620
(She turns her head away.)

2179
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,890
We look natural.

2180
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:08,150
(Team Olympiad sneaked in
pretty well.)

2181
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:11,120
(Staring)

2182
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,230
I see more seats over there.

2183
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:15,330
(What?)

2184
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,330
(Is she looking at Kwang Soo?)

2185
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,400
(Kwang Soo was looking
for a more secluded spot...)

2186
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,280
(when a female customer looked
in his direction!)

2187
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:26,480
(Did she recognize Kwang Soo?)

2188
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,070
(Uninterested)

2189
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,820
(She resumes talking to her friend.)

2190
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,850
Let's not move.

2191
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,580
(This high school student
who is 2m tall can't even stand up.)

2192
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:36,610
Let's not move.

2193
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:39,620
(While Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo
overcame many crises...)

2194
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,990
- What?
- That's too obvious. I'm not lying.

2195
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:43,060
Really?

2196
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:46,030
(Jong Kook and Haha can't
hide themselves.)

2197
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,990
- We need to cover the mic.
- What?

2198
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,160
(They look like they're here
to take over the cafe.)

2199
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,440
Is it here?

2200
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:55,440
- Hello.
- They're here.

2201
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,030
- Jong Kook and Haha are here.
- They're here?

2202
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,070
(Staff's phone)

2203
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:59,400
Hello.

2204
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,180
(Humming)

2205
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:02,220
- Hello.
- Hello.

2206
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:05,350
(Jong Kook tries to act normal
by humming.)

2207
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:09,060
(To be safe,
they must grab a seat first.)

2208
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:13,260
(Jong Kook sits down.)

2209
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:16,290
(Haha moves to the other side.)

2210
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:19,990
(They're going to split up
to avoid suspicion.)

2211
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,730
(Jong Kook, Haha)

2212
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,200
(They safely grab a seat.)

2213
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,270
(After 1 minute...)

2214
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,480
- What?
- Hey.

2215
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,980
Don't worry.

2216
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:33,110
- Is it here?
- Look at our pants.

2217
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:35,980
Our pants are...

2218
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,650
- Is it here?
- I think so.

2219
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,240
- It's here.
- Seriously.

2220
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,720
(Staff's phone)

2221
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,080
(2 people in weird hanboks appear
in a cafe full of young people.)

2222
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,690
Your pants are embarrassing.

2223
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:47,950
Jae Suk.

2224
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:50,530
That's so weird.

2225
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:52,470
That's obviously Jae Suk.

2226
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,570
He looks weird.

2227
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:58,810
(They steal people's attention.)

2228
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:01,810
(As they walk, they can feel
people looking at them.)

2229
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,330
Let's go somewhere else.

2230
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,980
I didn't know it was this bright.

2231
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,040
(People in the cafe are stirred.)

2232
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,020
Why is it so bright?

2233
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:12,080
(They move in a rush.)

2234
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:14,560
(What?)

2235
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,320
(They enter a room.)

2236
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,320
What's this place?

2237
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,150
- Why is it so bright?
- What's this room?

2238
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:20,620
I didn't expect it
to be this bright.

2239
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,820
- What's this room?
- What's this?

2240
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,930
I think some people recognized us.

2241
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:26,320
- What?
- Some people recognized us.

2242
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,490
I think they recognized us.

2243
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,440
I noticed my pants...

2244
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,970
I saw you from the back.

2245
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,940
You look like a martial arts player.

2246
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,400
You should go place an order.

2247
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,310
- I was so flustered.
- People here don't know.

2248
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:41,350
(However,)

2249
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:43,220
(someone's approaching them.)

2250
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,110
She's looking at Jae Suk.

2251
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:49,820
- Okay.
- I think she's looking at us.

2252
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,560
This is bad.

2253
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,730
(Glancing)

2254
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:56,060
(Please don't come.)

2255
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:59,690
(Jong Kook's glancing at them.)

2256
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,070
People here don't know yet.

2257
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,140
Should I sit somewhere else?

2258
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,200
I think some people noticed.

2259
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,640
They're here.

2260
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:10,830
Who are they?

2261
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:11,850
Se Chan and So Min.

2262
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:12,900
(After 1 minute...)

2263
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,410
They're here.
They covered their faces perfectly.

2264
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:18,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

2265
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,080
Don't they look weird?

2266
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,650
- They look suspicious.
- They're wearing matching.

2267
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:25,780
- They look so weird.
- My goodness.

2268
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,730
They're wearing matching clothes.
That's so weird.

2269
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:29,790
- They're wearing matching clothes.
- What's up with them?

2270
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:31,900
Are they placing an order?

2271
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,100
Are they?

2272
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,660
(Staff's phone)

2273
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,900
What are you having?

2274
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,070
I'll sit over there.

2275
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:39,470
(So Min's going to place an order
to avoid suspicion.)

2276
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:40,640
What would you like?

2277
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:42,310
Well...

2278
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:45,180
(While So Min's ordering,
Se Chan sits in the corner.)

2279
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:49,070
They're ordering something.

2280
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,350
Well...

2281
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,080
I'll have two iced tea.

2282
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,720
(The employee raises his head...)

2283
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,390
(upon hearing So Min's voice.)

2284
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:02,820
(Will he notice that it's So Min?)

2285
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:04,730
- Two iced tea?
- Yes.

2286
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:06,530
- For here?
- Yes.

2287
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:10,100
- Yes.
- That's 5.8 dollars.

2288
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:14,230
I got so nervous
that I ordered iced tea.

2289
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:15,480
- Good job.
- Because I was so nervous.

2290
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,900
I was so nervous.
I didn't know what to order.

2291
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,540
- Let's go over there. Let's move.
- Is there a table?

2292
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,320
- Is there a table?
- Let's move over there.

2293
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,440
Okay.

2294
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,190
- Over there.
- Let's go.

2295
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:27,410
(They feel pressured
since it's open.)

2296
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,060
(They quietly move
to the partitioned area.)

2297
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:33,320
(What?)

2298
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,560
(A glass wall?)

2299
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,190
There's a glass wall.

2300
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,470
Why is there glass?

2301
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,790
(He almost broke a glass
for trusting Seok Sam.)

2302
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,290
There's glass.

2303
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:44,770
You said there's a door.

2304
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:46,660
It's glass.

2305
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:48,700
There's a table. We have to go now.

2306
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,180
We have to go now.

2307
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:51,350
- We have to go.
- Let's go.

2308
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,540
(They try to move
to the partitioned area again.)

2309
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:55,720
(Running Man members think...)

2310
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,910
(they look natural if they put
their hands in the pockets.)

2311
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,080
(They all grabbed a seat.)

2312
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,620
You have to place an order.

2313
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,820
We have to order.

2314
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:11,400
(Since all 4 teams are here,
they have to order from Team 1.)

2315
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,940
He's ordering something.

2316
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:17,900
Kwang Soo is too obvious.

2317
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,730
He's too obvious.

2318
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:20,860
Do I look weird?

2319
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,310
Look at me. Do I look weird?

2320
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,730
Do we look weird?

2321
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:25,350
Your order.

2322
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:27,650
Do you have money?

2323
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,870
Hello. What would you like?

2324
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,190
- Peppermint...
- Hot chocolate...

2325
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,610
(Despite altering his voice,)

2326
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:36,890
(people focus on the 2m tall
high school student.)

2327
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:38,820
Is it just one drink?

2328
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,260
We're going to share.

2329
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,100
Just one, please.

2330
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:45,230
(When two students barely
place an order,)

2331
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:48,600
(one customer gets up
and approaches them.)

2332
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,730
(He approaches Kwang Soo.)

2333
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:52,830
Excuse me.

2334
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:55,780
(Excuse me.)

2335
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:58,740
(He tries to talk to Kwang Soo
and Ji Hyo.)

2336
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:02,910
(If a customer says their names,
they fail.)

2337
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:04,650
Are you Lee Kwang Soo?

2338
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,080
(Being careful)

2339
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,580
Are you Lee Kwang Soo?

2340
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:13,450
(Pretending not to hear him)

2341
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:15,060
Are you Song Ji Hyo?

2342
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:16,760
You failed the mission. Come back.

2343
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,860
(Team Olympiad fails the mission.)

2344
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,860
(Oh, it's Lee Kwang Soo
and Song Ji Hyo.)

2345
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,330
Kwang Soo got caught.

2346
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:25,610
Right. He got caught.

2347
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,400
- They got caught.
- Their mission is over.

2348
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,480
They got caught.

2349
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,510
(Hello.)

2350
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:30,830
- Kwang Soo got caught.
- He got caught.

2351
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,400
My goodness.

2352
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,180
Kwang Soo. Did you get caught?

2353
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:37,940
(The 2m tall high school student's
shoulders sag after failing.)

2354
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,440
(A "V" for the win)

2355
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:43,020
I told you not to open your eyes
like that.

2356
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,650
Lee Kwang Soo got caught.

2357
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,990
(Kwang Soo's arrest is delivered
to suspicious people.)

2358
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,770
Is it over?

2359
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,030
- It's over.
- Is it over?

2360
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:54,290
- Did someone get caught?
- Yes.

2361
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:56,230
(It's a surprise that
they didn't get caught.)

2362
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,640
Did Kwang Soo get caught?

2363
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,360
- He did.
- I saw it.

2364
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,680
Who got caught?

2365
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,010
Kwang Soo got caught.

2366
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,010
- Okay, okay.
- That's a relief.

2367
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:07,110
I was wrong to think...

2368
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:08,980
- Where were you?
- I didn't see you. Where were you?

2369
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,110
- I didn't see you.
- But...

2370
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:11,740
- We were in a room.
- You don't know,

2371
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:13,350
- but you all looked weird.
- Really?

2372
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,190
- It's really suspicious.
- You were really weird.

2373
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:16,760
When you walked in,

2374
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,260
I almost called the police.

2375
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,060
They looked so weird.

2376
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,600
We were surprised.

2377
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,100
It was so bright.

2378
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,430
We were like, "My goodness."

2379
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,790
- And our pants were flapping.
- That's funny.

2380
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:30,230
- We all looked weird.
- We were all suspicious.

2381
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,010
- Let's get in the car.
- Get in the car.

2382
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:33,110
It's worth calling the police.

2383
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:35,640
Here's the result
of the last mission.

2384
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,940
- I will announce three winners.
- Who are they?

2385
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,850
It's based on the number of stamps.

2386
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:40,980
- Okay.
- Oh, stamps.

2387
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:41,980
First place goes to...

2388
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,020
(1st place completed 4 courses.)

2389
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,240
Yoo Jae Suk.

2390
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,690
- Really? You placed first?
- That's amazing.

2391
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:46,890
- Me?
- Is it an individual play?

2392
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:48,890
- He played a lot.
- Yes.

2393
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:50,480
Second place goes to...

2394
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,950
Ji Suk Jin, Kim Jong Kook
and Yang Se Chan.

2395
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:53,030
- Oh, really?
- Me too?

2396
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:54,080
- That's awesome.
- I didn't know.

2397
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:57,690
We'll give these four people
a prize.

2398
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:00,400
So Min will purchase the prize
tomorrow.

2399
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,770
- Am I buying them tomorrow?
- Yes.

2400
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:03,160
- Okay.
- Goodness.

2401
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:05,110
Now, I have to announce the penalty.

2402
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:09,640
Do we receive the penalty as a team?

2403
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,700
Yes.

2404
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,850
It's an opening penalty.

2405
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,040
(There will be an opening related
penalty in a month.)

2406
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,870
Lately, the opening penalty's
getting weird.

2407
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:17,610
It's getting weird.

2408
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:18,980
- It's getting really weird.
- It's very childish.

2409
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,610
- You have to come early.
- You have to come early.

2410
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:21,950
- It's a hassle.
- It's troublesome.

2411
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,220
- It's such a hassle.
- It's troublesome.

2412
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,430
Jae Suk and Suk Jin's
Team Human Cultural Asset...

2413
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,560
has negative 655 dollars.

2414
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:29,950
We spent a lot.

2415
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,790
Team Asst. Manager Ha
and the New Recruit...

2416
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:33,690
kept 10 dollars.

2417
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,900
Team Newlyweds has negative
314 dollars.

2418
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:39,510
Next, Team Olympiad...

2419
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:43,180
has negative 1,212 dollars.

2420
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:45,700
So they will have
the opening penalty.

2421
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,370
- Lee Kwang Soo. Seriously...
- Come on.

2422
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:50,780
That's the end of Part Two of
Jeju Island Special.

2423
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,220
Thank you.

2424
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,440
(The next day)

2425
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,260
This place is really big.

2426
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:59,620
I didn't know there was a duty free
in south of Jeju Island.

2427
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:00,620
(Shopping completes the trip.)

2428
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:03,450
I should pick what best suits them.

2429
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:07,030
I heard lately Suk Jin enjoys wine.

2430
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:09,440
This is perfect for Jae Suk.

2431
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,470
(Sweet snacks for Jae Suk
who loves snacks)

2432
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,360
I'll get cosmetics for Se Chan
and Jong Kook.

2433
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:15,830
I'll make sure to deliver them
to Seoul.

2434
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:21,780
(It's fall, the season of food.)

2435

2438

in Seoul with history.)

2440

(If Soo Yong and Suk Jin go,
it's an old restaurant.)

2441
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:36,290
It's 200 years old.

2442
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:37,730
(No area...)

2443
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:39,030
(or menu...)

2444
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:41,640
(is set.)

2445
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:44,730
(They must cast the place
themselves.)

2446
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:46,160
We should go here.

2447
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,230
(Hangover soup
with 84 years of history)

2448
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,530
It's 100 years old.

2450

the younger they become.)

2451
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:56,110
(They fight to eat...)

2452
01:21:56,110 --> 01:21:57,180
(and to reduce their ages.)
