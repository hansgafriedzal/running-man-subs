1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,840
(Coming soon)

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,010
(A special opening ceremony for
the penthouse resident presentation)

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,680
(It's a luxurious opera performance
that anyone can't watch.)

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,020
(4 residential candidates
of the penthouse appeared.)

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,050
(Ha Do Kwon, Kim So Yeon,
Lee Ji Ah, Eugene)

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,760
(Their merciless fight
to join the top club will begin.)

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,100
(While the opera performance
reaches its climax,)

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,440
(the battle to get the penthouse
becomes fierce.)

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,870
(It will be revealed soon.)

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,270
(And last week,)

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,980
(6 guests joined...)

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,380
(the Old Restaurant Race
in Running Man.)

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,760
(And they got a mission.)

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,760
(They have to find old restaurants
and eat meals there.)

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,990
(And they will subtract the years
of their history from the team age.)

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,360
(Make your team age 0.)

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,330
(Current Team Age)

18
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,090
(To subtract their numbers,)

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,060
(they have to complete
their mission.)

20
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,340
(They go through a mission to set
the order to subtract their number.)

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,020
(2 members with the most years left
will get a penalty.)

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,240
(And the members with the most years
got a hidden mission.)

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,990
(They roll the dice to subtract
his and one opponent's age.)

24
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,550
(White for himself, red for
a member of another team)

25
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,630
Jong Kook, which member
will you choose?

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,820
(Jong Kook picked Se Chan.)

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,790
(3 years was subtracted
from Se Chan's age.)

28
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,900
(Ji Hyo picked Jae Suk.)

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,240
(1 year was subtracted
from Jae Suk's age.)

30
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,460
(Team Suk Jin has 64 years left.)

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,010
(Team Jong Kook has 82 years left.)

32
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,430
(Team Ji Hyo has 107 years left.)

33
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,070
(Which team will make their age 0
and win the race?)

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,650
(Team Ji Hyo: Jongno, 107 years
Team Suk Jin: Seongbuk, 64 years)

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,480
(Team Jong Kook:
Myeong-dong, 82 years)

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,910
That was good.

37
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,290
Thank you for the food.

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,960
It will be hard
to make it 200 years.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,430
It's impossible.

40
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,590
I know.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,630
H restaurant is 80 years old.

42
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,150
Then we will have
only two years left.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,990
We picked the wrong
restaurant earlier, right?

44
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,370
We should've picked
this restaurant first.

45
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,870
This restaurant is
really good though.

46
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,080
Once you try their beef gone soup,
you won't want to eat it elsewhere.

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,000
- Really?
- If it suits your taste.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,270
(Once you try their beef gone soup,
you won't want to eat it elsewhere.)

49
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,970
Anyone can say that.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,020
Gosh.

51
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,370
Don't you think?

52
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,420
"If it suits your taste."

53
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,490
You can say that
for all restaurants.

54
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,860
I mean,
some like it and some don't.

55
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,620
People either like it a lot
or hate it a lot.

56
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,090
I get that the food is good.

57
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,700
But isn't it too much to say that
you can't eat it elsewhere?

58
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,150
Let's be honest.

59
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,520
- Don't you think so?
- Right.

60
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,370
I won't want to eat beef bone soup
at other restaurants?

61
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,560
I think it's far-fetched
to say that.

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,640
(Sighing)

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,340
You're recommending this restaurant
because you liked it.

64
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,680
You should think
before you say anything.

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,870
My point.

66
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,640
- That was too much.
- I know, right?

67
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,970
- It's upsetting, right?
- Yes.

68
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,900
It can be misleading.

69
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,180
Hang on. You've been quiet
the whole time, and you suddenly...

70
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,890
Bomi is being nice
because she has a good personality.

71
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,020
- I agree.
- Sure.

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,550
If you date someone mean,
she will hang you out to try.

73
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,520
We're just saying that
because you broke up with her.

74
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
So...

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,830
I just said this place makes
good beef bone soup.

76
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,640
- I know.
- Then do you really have to...

77
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,090
"Why would you say that?"

78
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,460
(Why would you say that?)

79
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,460
(He suddenly starts a skit.)

80
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,000
"What's with that look
on your face?"

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,030
"Are you saying I'm strange?
I want to break up with you."

82
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,680
This is what happens.

83
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,650
It can happen.

84
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,810
"Once you try their beef gone soup,
you won't want to eat it elsewhere."

85
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,180
Because I said that...

86
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,180
"My mom runs
a beef bone soup restaurant."

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,090
How would I know that?

88
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,250
(He adds some details in the story.)

89
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,650
Do you want her to shut down?

90
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,800
That's not what I meant.

91
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,250
- If you try their food...
- Then I won't eat it.

92
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,560
"You think they are the only ones
who make good beef bone soup."

93
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,060
That's not what I said.

94
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,800
- "Fine."
- My gosh.

95
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,170
I didn't see this coming.

96
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,170
- You should break up.
- That's unbelievable.

97
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,240
We're here.

98
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,900
Put on a mask.

99
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,930
Jong Kook.

100
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
It says "Ha" like my name.

101
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,970
(H Restaurant, opened in 1939,
passed down through 3 generations)

102
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,550
(80-year-old traditional
Korean beef soup)

103
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,090
(Beef soup made with beef leg bones,
brisket, and intestines)

104
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,890
(It's a beef bone soup restaurant
with a long history.)

105
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,860
(According to Kwang Soo, it can
ruin you for other beef bone soup.)

106
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,960
This restaurant is
about 82 years old.

107
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,990
It's 82 years old.

108
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,070
- Hello.
- Hello, ma'am.

109
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,900
Is this place 82 years old?

110
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,460
What? 83 years?

111
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,270
I used to come here
to buy take-out beef soup.

112
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,360
Right.

113
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,030
- You remember him.
- Yes.

114
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,600
Ma'am, how old is this place?

115
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,470
(If it's over 82 years old, they
can make their team age 0.)

116
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,840
(What will she say about
the history of this restaurant?)

117
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,280
It's 82 years old.

118
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,480
(The place has a tradition
of 82 years.)

119
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,960
(The age Team Jong Kook has left
is also 82 years.)

120
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,350
That's amazing.

121
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,890
- 82 years?
- It's perfect.

122
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,560
It's perfect.

123
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,350
- We opened this restaurant in 1939.
- I see.

124
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,270
- That's right.
- It's exactly 82 years.

125
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,160
- It breaks even.
- Kwang Soo said this.

126
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,700
If you try your beef bone soup,
you won't want to eat it elsewhere.

127
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,270
That's why
I'm still having a hard time.

128
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,940
Let's order the food then.
We don't have much time.

129
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,270
We will have beef bone soup.

130
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,810
- Just one serving, please.
- Please make it special.

131
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,650
- This is unbelievable.
- I know.

132
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,880
I can't believe it breaks even.

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,980
Let's start the mission then.

134
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,280
- We have to hurry.
- Give us the mission.

135
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
- Okay.
- I don't want to lose.

136
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,020
How is this possible?

137
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,760
Pyongyang naengmyeon and
hangover soup with clotted blood?

138
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,590
We should go to a place like this.
I bet you feel queasy now.

139
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,650
(Suk Jin wants to go
to the gamjatang restaurant.)

140
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,830
Let's go to the gamjatang
restaurant then.

141
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,090
- Okay. Let's do that.
- What you've had is...

142
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,090
- I know.
- Let's eat something spicy.

143
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,770
Now we're going
to a restaurant you want.

144
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,770
Gamjatang is really good.

145
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,510
It tastes good with rice.

146
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,770
Are there 3 teams or 4 teams?

147
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,340
Why don't you calculate your age?

148
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,270
First, we went to the restaurant
that's 48 years old.

149
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,450
- Then the second one was...
- It was 84 years old.

150
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,650
- 84 years.
- That's crazy.

151
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,780
So it's 132 years in total.

152
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,390
- Then how many do you have left?
- 66.

153
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,590
We have 66 years left.

154
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,720
How old is this restaurant?

155
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,980
- It's 63 years old.
- 63 years?

156
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,060
Then we can finish it
with this restaurant.

157
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,790
- We can finish it.
- We can do that.

158
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,000
We can finish it
if we do things right.

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
(How would they finish it
when they need 3 more years?)

160
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,790
(1 hour ago)

161
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,460
(He got 1 year deducted
from his age thanks to Ji Hyo.)

162
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,810
(Jae Suk became the oldest member
and found out about the mission.)

163
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,170
(He got another 1 age deducted
with his bad luck.)

164
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,540
(Jae Suk got 2 years deducted
with the hidden mission.)

165
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,960
(They might be able to win the race
with the next restaurant.)

166
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,280
We can finish it
if we do things right.

167
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,060
This is it.

168
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,060
Is that it?

169
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,150
(They arrive at the restaurant.)

170
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,590
(T Gamjatang Restaurant)

171
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,360
(It was open in 1958 and has been
passed down through 3 generations.)

172
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,940
(The restaurant was redecorated,
so it looks neat and clean,)

173
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,460
(but the place still
has its old heritage.)

174
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,210
(Open 24 hours)

175
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,880
Gosh, it smells great.

176
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,470
(The soup is rich
and the meat is tender.)

177
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,080
All right. This is the last mission.

178
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
Okay. I have to win this time.

179
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,980
You can subtract 63 years here.

180
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,350
I have to get rid of all of my age.

181
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,090
Otherwise, we might be the last.

182
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,460
Right. We have to win.

183
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,890
If you complete this mission,
you will have one year left.

184
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,920
Okay.

185
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,590
This mission is...

186
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,090
called Finger Fencing.

187
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,070
You will put paint on your hands,

188
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,360
and the one who puts...

189
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,770
more paint on your opponent's face
in one minute wins the game.

190
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,440
So what's important is
whom you fight against.

191
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,640
Soo Yong has long arms.

192
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,950
I want to fight against Chang Hee.

193
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,340
You'll play Palm Face Down or Up.

194
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,380
We play Palm Face Down or Up.

195
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,750
<i>Palm Face Down or Up</i>

196
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,540
(Suk Jin versus Soo Yong)

197
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,110
I'll fight against Chang Hee.

198
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,690
(It's a big match between
two men born in 1966.)

199
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,060
I'm in trouble.
He has very long arms.

200
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,060
- I will win by default.
- It's a done deal.

201
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,130
I will win by default.

202
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,460
- Ready.
- All right.

203
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,520
(Legend of Yeouido High School,
Kim Soo Yong)

204
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,160
(He's a living legend
with magical fists.)

205
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,460
(A real hungry fighter,
Ji Suk Jin)

206
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,170
(He's a man in his 50s
who's quite strong for his age.)

207
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,270
(It's a match between
two rivals of the same age.)

208
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,540
Start.

209
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,540
(The 1 minute begins.)

210
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
(Rubbing)

211
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,960
(Suk Jin got paints on his face
only in 5 seconds.)

212
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,390
(He plays an impenetrable
defense with his long arm.)

213
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,060
(Reaching out...)

214
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,160
(to his face)

215
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,590
(Suk Jin is losing
the game helplessly.)

216
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,010
Hang on. Come here.

217
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,080
He told Soo Yong to come.

218
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,270
(Confident)

219
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,470
- Hey, your arm... Move it.
- Look at Soo Yong.

220
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,450
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- Three.

221
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,020
2, 1. Time's up.

222
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,190
- Who won?
- Soo Yong wins.

223
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,390
Why do you even ask?
Isn't it obvious?

224
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,350
All right. Okay.

225
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,380
(Suk Jin will have
a match for 3rd.)

226
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,530
3, 2...

227
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,220
Time's up.

228
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,620
- Who won?
- Nam Chang Hee won.

229
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,750
(Nam Chang Hee won!)

230
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,360
(Suk Jin came in last place again.)

231
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,620
You'll be the last one to eat.

232
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
I know. Gosh, you.

233
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,730
- Leave some for me.
- Okay.

234
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,500
This is the final round.

235
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,600
(The long-awaited final round)

236
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,970
- Let's do this.
- Go for it.

237
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,040
(The fast Suyu-ri Locust)

238
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,970
- Let's go.
- Soo Yong is very tall,

239
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,580
so it won't be easy.
I'll use my speed to win.

240
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,710
- Should I stand here?
- I'm faster than him.

241
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,970
(Their pride is on the line.)

242
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,420
Ready, set, go.

243
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,450
(The final round begins.)

244
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,190
It won't be easy, Jae Suk.

245
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,090
Soo Yong has a really long reach.

246
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,350
(Jae Suk is moving quickly
to get closer to him.)

247
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,300
They put some paint
on each other right away.

248
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,300
Jae Suk looks as if he put on
makeup for a show.

249
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,170
The way the paint got
on his face is funny.

250
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,210
(Korea's best MC's mouth
stands out more with paint over it.)

251
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,940
(However,)

252
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,500
(Soo Yong got more paint
on his face!)

253
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,080
Jae Suk is good at this.

254
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,710
Soo Yong, you should attack now.
Or else, you'll lose.

255
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,050
(Soo Yong will lose at this rate.)

256
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,250
(Soo Yong's final attack
with 8 seconds remaining)

257
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,250
Or else, you'll lose.

258
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,460
(Will Jae Suk be able
to block his attack?)

259
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,360
(Giggling)

260
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,990
(Jae Suk barely managed to block
his attack.)

261
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,170
Two.

262
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,630
2, 1.

263
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,600
(The game is over.)

264
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,710
Time's up.

265
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,080
My gosh. I think...

266
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,870
(The comedians from KBS
showed no mercy on each other.)

267
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,950
- Yoo Jae Suk won.
- That was amazing.

268
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,840
Jae Suk won.

269
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,450
Jae Suk was really fast.

270
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,710
That was a great match.

271
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,850
I won...

272
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,090
in my hometown.

273
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,590
(The pride of Yongmun High School)

274
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,750
- You look like you lost though.
- Really?

275
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,160
Don't wash your face.

276
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,030
- Are you okay?
- Darn.

277
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,170
- Starting with first place.
- Where is my bag?

278
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,630
63 years.

279
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,500
(Jae Suk who was the oldest member
removed all his age badges.)

280
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,540
Next, please.

281
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,910
(Soo Yong and Chang Hee also
removed all their badges.)

282
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,000
Can he deduct all the years left?

283
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,920
I think he has one year left.

284
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,970
(Only Suk Jin has 1 year left.)

285
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,240
(If another team wins, he who is
1 year old will get a penalty.)

286
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,320
It's hard to predict.

287
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,380
Everyone.

288
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,610
- You deducted 63 years in total.
- Yes.

289
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,980
(At that moment, an announcement
was made for all the teams.)

290
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,850
Team Soo Yong and Chang Hee won.

291
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,330
(Team Soo Yong and Chang Hee won.)

292
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,360
(This team won?)

293
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,090
(Team Ji Hyo was at their 3rd place
about 10 minutes ago.)

294
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,090
I'll go to the restroom too.

295
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,260
Go ahead.

296
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,410
(And So Min sneaked out alone.)

297
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,100
(She betrayed her team
and completed the hidden mission.)

298
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,140
(She got to deduct 1 year from her
age and another team's member's.)

299
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,110
(And the person So Min chose
to get 1 year deducted was...)

300
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,710
(She picked Suk Jin
without any doubt.)

301
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,820
(So Min chose Suk Jin because he's
the oldest and less threatening.)

302
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,060
- I got my age deducted.
- Oh, yes!

303
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,420
- Exactly one year got deducted.
- Really?

304
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,460
- Exactly one year?
- Really?

305
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,960
Thanks to So Min and Ji Hyo,

306
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,590
your team was able to deduct
the exact years you had left.

307
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,160
So Min deducted exactly one year
from my age?

308
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,930
- Yes, and your team won.
- That's awesome.

309
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,990
(Team Suk Jin naturally won
thanks to So Min's mistake.)

310
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,130
We won?

311
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,700
I won after a long time.

312
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,410
(Even they're surprised.
Who knew they would win?)

313
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,840
(And Team Ji Hyo heard the news.)

314
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,940
Then... Hang on.

315
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,000
Hang on a second.

316
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,080
Ji Hyo, did you
get all the age deducted?

317
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,370
Two members with the most years left
will get a penalty.

318
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,240
(The oldest two will receive
a penalty.)

319
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,920
Did you see him put on an act?

320
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,140
- This is crazy.
- I saw him. He was smiling.

321
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,190
- I'm the oldest among us.
- I thought we'd win too.

322
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,820
I thought we would win.

323
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,850
Anyway, the youngest three...

324
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,430
on our team won't receive
a penalty, right?

325
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,120
Jong Kook and I are the oldest two.

326
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,030
You're right.

327
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,570
We should've finished the food
more quickly.

328
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,960
(The end of the race and the penalty
will be revealed at the end!)

329
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,630
(And a week later...)

330
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,710
(We haven't seen the makeup team's
tools in a while.)

331
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,680
- Hi, Ji Hyo.
- Hi.

332
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,420
- Hi.
- Hello.

333
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,580
(Ji Hyo still seems half asleep.)

334
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,690
What was it? What should I do?

335
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,880
(She sat in the chair
without any attempt to resist.)

336
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,030
As for that,

337
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,030
- it's kind of...
- Hi, Ji Hyo.

338
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,160
(At that moment,
Kwang Soo showed up!)

339
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,220
(Kwang Soo also seems pretty weird.)

340
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,330
Hi, Kwang Soo.

341
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,590
(Kwang Soo also seems pretty weird.)

342
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,670
I totally forgot about this.

343
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,540
- What's going on?
- Are you dressed as Beethoven?

344
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,360
You remind me of "Guardian:
The Lonely and Great God".

345
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,440
You look like Beethoven.

346
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,680
(Why are they getting makeup done
before the shoot?)

347
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,140
(They teamed up and lost 2 weeks ago
in the Jeju Island special episode.)

348
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,610
(And they were chosen as the members
to receive the opening penalty.)

349
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,480
(And today is the day
of their penalty.)

350
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,720
We were told it was a penalty.

351
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,250
- It'll take some time.
- This is how you'll look.

352
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,170
We're going to do this makeup.

353
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,070
- You'll wear a wig.
- We prepared a wig.

354
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,200
Like this.

355
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,170
(Short exclamation)

356
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,940
This is what we're going to do.

357
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,500
We'll only try
the distinguishing features.

358
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,500
We'll do the bright eyebrows,

359
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,950
blush like this,
and heart-shaped lips.

360
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,590
(So Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo started
their makeup for the penalty.)

361
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,880
That makeup suits you.

362
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,210
(The sleepy Angry Bird)

363
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,030
Don't I look like a penguin?

364
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,300
- Will Kwang Soo wear this makeup?
- Yes, the same makeup.

365
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,720
- I'll wear the same makeup?
- Yes.

366
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,840
(He didn't know it until now.)

367
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,940
A man wearing that makeup?

368
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,840
Yes, you'll wear the same makeup.

369
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,100
(Oh, no. I'll wear that makeup too?)

370
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,730
- But...
- You'll look like a musical actor.

371
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,180
We'll make you look good.

372
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,710
I mean...

373
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,000
(I mean... That's not what I meant.)

374
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,910
It's because she's not
wearing a wig.

375
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,110
- She'll look different in a wig.
- She's right.

376
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,680
I don't want to look different.

377
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,790
(It's Kwang Soo's turn
to transform.)

378
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,210
You put on the hairnet
and changed your clothes, right?

379
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,620
(Troubled and bitter)

380
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,720
I'll make you look great.

381
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,660
Because you're not wearing
any base makeup now,

382
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,390
- I'll apply just a little.
- Sure. Go ahead.

383
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,940
(So she started applying
base makeup on his face.)

384
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,370
(And he put on a wig,
which will add elegance.)

385
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,540
Don't I look scary?

386
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,500
(Don't I look scary?)

387
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,050
(Are you sure
this is the right way?)

388
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,210
Oh, gosh.

389
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,550
Did you come from the underworld?

390
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,690
- Are you from the underworld?
- You look so scary.

391
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,920
You look so scary like Annabelle.

392
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,790
Didn't you come from the underworld?

393
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,060
(Even Annabelle is scared...)

394
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,350
(of Kwang Soo's underworld makeup.)

395
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,830
I think I may look better
without that.

396
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,170
People will scream and run away
when they see me.

397
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,170
That's how scary I look right now.

398
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,710
(After an hour of makeup, they'll
perform at the opening ceremony.)

399
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,730
- Are we going to use this umbrella?
- I mean, the level of scariness...

400
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,470
(What performance will
these 2 opera singers give?)

401
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,870
(Everyone else is busy
preparing the opening.)

402
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,640
(The performers from Europe
are standing awkwardly.)

403
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,820
(They don't know what to do.)

404
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,880
I'm so embarrassed because no one
seems to think this is strange.

405
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,300
Ji Hyo looks like a pretty doll.

406
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,070
Ji Hyo looks like a pretty doll.

407
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,490
Why doesn't Kwang Soo?

408
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,730
(You know why.)

409
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,540
Hit us with some extra light.

410
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,870
You look really pretty.

411
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,940
This is driving me crazy.

412
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,680
Will the guests be there too?

413
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,710
- Yes.
- Yes.

414
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,810
Really?

415
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,050
(Really?)

416
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,790
It's so embarrassing that I have to
meet them looking like this.

417
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,790
Hello. Hello.

418
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,190
(He's about to meet the guests
looking like this.)

419
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,060
This is driving me nuts.
I want to go home.

420
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,530
I don't usually feel embarrassed
about things like this.

421
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,720
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo feel
unusually embarrassed today.)

422
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

423
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,860
(The 1st guest to meet
the performers, Ha Do Kwon)

424
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,000
Hello.

425
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,210
(The 1st guest to meet
the performers, Ha Do Kwon)

426
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,580
(In the drama "The Penthouse",)

427
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:16,840
(he plays a classical vocal teacher
who bows before the power!)

428
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,820
(The last time
he came on Running Man,)

429
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,950
(I came here to beat
only one person.)

430
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,320
(He challenged Jong Kook
recklessly.)

431
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:31,120
(His clothes got ripped,
and he only got humiliated!)

432
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,670
(He's back with the other cast
members to redeem himself!)

433
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,890
Hi, Do Kwon.

434
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,960
(We haven't seen each other
in a while.)

435
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,860
- We got a penalty.
- You look...

436
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,080
(But we look so weird right now.)

437
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,040
(Laughing)

438
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,870
(Kwang Soo is lowering his head.)

439
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,340
You guys went to Jeju Island...

440
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,080
and called us here in Paju
when it's so cold.

441
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,840
I like Jeju Island too.

442
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,090
(I like Jeju Island too.)

443
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,850
It was hilarious.

444
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,790
You put her in a headlock
and threw her down.

445
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,660
(He proves that he's a huge fan
of the show.)

446
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,800
Crush them all like you did.

447
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,090
(He's asking her for a favor.)

448
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,800
(He knows so much
about Running Man.)

449
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,700
It was funnier when Jong Kook
threw you down.

450
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,740
Were you all right?

451
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,860
I got acupuncture treatment
for two days. Lying on my belly,

452
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,740
- Really?
- I regretted what I had done.

453
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,940
I don't care about promoting
my drama.

454
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,200
I'll make sure to win today.

455
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,820
(Forget promoting my drama,
I'll make sure to win today.)

456
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,720
(He didn't learn his lesson.
He announced his 2nd challenge.)

457
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,990
Make an appointment at the clinic
for tomorrow.

458
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,090
Since it's my second time here,
I feel more comfortable here...

459
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,260
than on the drama set.

460
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,690
(After greeting Do Kwon
who's like a family to them...)

461
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,190
- And change your clothes...
- Hello.

462
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

463
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,590
Hello.

464
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,890
Hi. It's been a while.

465
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,890
- You look pretty.
- This is a penalty.

466
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,900
It doesn't look like a penalty.

467
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,200
(This is her 1st appearance
on a variety show!)

468
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,010
(Lee Ji Ah, the queen of
the penthouse on the 100th floor!)

469
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,440
(She goes back and forth between
her sweetness and intensity.)

470
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,590
(From the national fairy
to a mom with great mother's love!)

471
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,950
(Eugene makes the viewers cry!)

472
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,530
(She got a role as an evil
character after 20 years.)

473
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,390
(And she's pulling it off.
Kim So Yeon, the heartless woman!)

474
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,090
(The cast members of "The Penthouse"
came on Running Man!)

475
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,660
- Hey, you look so pretty.
- I don't know...

476
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,360
So Yeon, you're teasing me, right?

477
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,630
No, I'm not. I mean it.

478
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,570
You really look great in that.

479
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,280
I think you look pretty.

480
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,130
You look gorgeous.
I want to try this too.

481
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,870
(Oh, my!)

482
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,250
I think they really mean it.

483
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,020
- They started the shoot out there.
- Oh, I see.

484
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,080
It's good to see you again.

485
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,720
The guests will go out first.

486
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,990
I'm nervous.

487
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,320
Me too.

488
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,330
(The 4 special guests
who are a little bit nervous...)

489
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,000
(and the calm representatives
get ready to go on stage.)

490
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,830
- What's with your clothes?
- Is this an award ceremony?

491
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,390
I'm so nervous.
I should've taken some pills.

492
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,390
- Should I have taken pills?
- Don't worry, we have Eugene...

493
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,500
and Do Kwon with us.

494
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,930
People from Running Man are crazy.

495
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,310
(What's going on in the hall?)

496
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,010
(The penthouse
briefing session for residency)

497
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,440
It's kind of fancy.

498
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,670
(The penthouse briefing session
seems very luxurious.)

499
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,370
- It's luxurious, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

500
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

501
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,750
Hello.

502
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,990
It's nice to meet you all.

503
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,760
(Well-dressed bidders
have come to the briefing session.)

504
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,060
(Bowing)

505
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,120
- This way.
- Hello.

506
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Join us.

507
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,190
(It seems
he's never done this before.)

508
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,650
- Sebastian, you're here.
- Hello.

509
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm not that butler.

510
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,620
- You're not?
- No.

511
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,000
- A son of a wealthy family.
- Aren't you a magician?

512
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,200
- No, I'm from a wealthy family.
- Are you two a team?

513
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,570
Can you make a pigeon appear?

514
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,930
- Yes.
- Here it is.

515
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,280
(A wealthy boy's magic show)

516
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,510
Are you going to...

517
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,700
Are you going to
saw this woman in half?

518
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,750
- Yes, he is.
- I'll cut her in half with a saw.

519
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,870
(While the two in velvet
make a joke...)

520
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,940
When I walked in here,

521
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,290
I almost did a perfect bow
to one of us.

522
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,180
- Why?
- I thought he was Im Ha Ryong.

523
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,230
I thought he was Im Ha Ryong.

524
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,120
(Possessed by Ha Ryong's spirit)

525
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,060
Come on. Hey.

526
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,770
How could you mistake me for him?

527
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,890
- We look totally different.
- You two look the same.

528
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,840
- We look completely different.
- My goodness.

529
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,540
- Come on.
- He didn't look like him at first.

530
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,860
But these days,
he looks so much like Ha Ryong.

531
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,630
This is so funny.

532
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,670
You are the VIPs who want to get
into the penthouse and that's why...

533
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,670
- you came to the briefing session.
- All right.

534
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,440
We prepared an opening
performance for you.

535
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,590
- Is that so?
- Really?

536
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,790
Should we stand over there?

537
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,990
(Can't be sure which country or era
they are from.)

538
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,650
(But the delegation is ready
to congratulate the opening.)

539
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,000
It's the opening performance
for the penthouse briefing session.

540
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,730
- So it's the opening performance.
- I love to be entertained.

541
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,190
It's a briefing session.

542
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,830
- So are we rich?
- Look at the spotlight.

543
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,040
- I guess we are rich.
- They're treating us this well?

544
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,590
What is it?

545
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,630
(The curtain opens.)

546
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,700
My goodness.

547
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,480
(So elegant)

548
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,510
(What is this?)

549
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,940
- What's this?
- What is this?

550
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,110
- What's that?
- What is this?

551
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,340
This is just like Hurricane Blue.

552
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,490
- What is this?
- What's this?

553
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,940
(It's a high-quality performance
for the VIPs, not a costume show.)

554
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,450
What on earth is this?

555
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,380
- My goodness.
- Gosh, what's this?

556
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,650
So they're going to sing a song?

557
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,890
Look at Kwang Soo's lips.

558
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,330
(His awkward shoulder dance)

559
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,160
This is not exactly a penalty
for Jo Hyo.

560
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,270
You look so pretty.

561
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,840
Ji Hyo, you're so pretty.

562
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,800
- You look like a doll.
- Yes, she is.

563
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,130
- It's not a penalty for her.
- She looks so pretty.

564
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,200
(While everyone
is paying attention...)

565
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,600
He didn't practice at all.

566
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,630
He doesn't know the lyrics.

567
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,250
His lips don't match.

568
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,550
- Gosh, he's bad at this.
- His lips don't match.

569
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,020
Seems like the lyrics don't match.

570
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,410
It's just like Hurricane Blue.

571
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,180
Hello, Lee Yoon Seok.

572
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,410
He's imitating Yoon Seok?

573
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,790
He's imitating Mozart.

574
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,680
(What a horrible performance?)

575
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,830
- Don't you think they're good?
- They are good.

576
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,120
She looks like a Russian doll.

577
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,830
(Soon after,
Jo Hyo does her solo part.)

578
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,660
She's like a Russian doll.

579
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,300
(She competes with her looks
not with her singing skills.)

580
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,310
She doesn't know the lyrics either.

581
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,810
She didn't practice either.

582
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,810
Her lips should be vibrating.

583
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,010
Make it vibrate.

584
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,200
Vibrate!

585
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,840
They should be vibrating.

586
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,580
That's it.

587
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,910
- That's it, that's it.
- Yes, she's doing great.

588
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,490
(They've been ignoring Kwang Soo
for the last five minutes.)

589
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,020
That's it. She's good.

590
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,060
So cute.

591
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,830
(It's a lip-synced performance
but it's pretty perfect.)

592
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,230
She's good.

593
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,620
(Kwang Soo, what are you doing?)

594
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,840
(He missed a beat.)

595
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,200
No, no, he missed it.

596
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,130
My goodness, what is he doing?

597
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,480
(It's getting closer to the climax.)

598
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
(Performing madness)

599
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,320
(An unprepared delegation
does its best on the stage.)

600
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,520
My goodness.

601
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,790
(An unprepared delegation
does its best on the stage.)

602
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,880
(Finishes the performance
with burning passion!)

603
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,230
Ole!

604
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,920
(Overaggressive stage manners
for the poor quality performance)

605
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,620
Ole!

606
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,970
It's kind of fun.

607
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,030
Don't they both
look better than usual?

608
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,190
- Yes.
- They look better.

609
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,340
- Yes, the makeup.
- Ji Hyo, you look great.

610
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,470
- Wait a minute.
- Ji Hyo looks great.

611
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,970
Ji Hyo, you look great.

612
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,040
Wait a minute.

613
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,930
- You're so pretty.
- Stop talking about her.

614
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,940
- You look good too.
- Yes, you do.

615
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,200
But Ji Hyo really looks nice.

616
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,080
- It suits you.
- Everyone is saying she's pretty.

617
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,410
You're all saying,
"Ji Hyo, you look great."

618
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,340
Kwang Soo, you look
like a dead person.

619
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,260
- What?
- It's like a dead person's face.

620
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,260
A dead person?

621
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,380
He's back from the dead.

622
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,950
Were you trying to
make him look like Jiangshi?

623
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,180
- Jiangshi?
- Is he from "Surprise Mystery TV"?

624
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,420
Isn't he Jiangshi?

625
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,390
He's from "Surprise Mystery TV"?

626
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,470
It's for an opera.

627
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,970
- Were you imitating Han Gi Beom?
- What are you talking about?

628
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,770
- Stand closer.
- This is so funny.

629
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,040
You look better wearing makeup.

630
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,200
Yes, but it really suits Jo Hyo.

631
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,360
I got it.

632
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,280
Jo Hyo really looks nice.

633
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,700
So are we rich people?

634
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,980
- Are we moving into the penthouse?
- Yes, you are rich.

635
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,340
The guests at the backstage are...

636
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,990
- Stop talking, Kwang Soo.
- I should make an introduction.

637
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,720
I should make an introduction.

638
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,840
I don't think so.

639
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,180
You don't have to.

640
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,060
- What are you saying?
- Your timing was wrong.

641
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
- Stay quiet, Jiangshi.
- Yes, be quiet.

642
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,490
- Jiangshi.
- He's not even human.

643
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,120
Like I said, all eight of you
are VIPs who came to...

644
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,390
the briefing session
of the penthouse.

645
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,890
Yes, finally.

646
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,090
And some VIPs will join you.

647
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,500
- I can hear them talking.
- Yes.

648
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,840
They're the real VIPs.

649
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
I'm sure.

650
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,930
I should enjoy this.

651
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,310
No, no.

652
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,900
Should we make a cool appearance?

653
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,700
- A cool appearance?
- Yes, like this.

654
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,670
Here are the other bidders.
Please come out.

655
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,910
(Leading actors of "The Penthouse")

656
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,840
(Ha Do Kwon, Kim So Yeon,
Lee Ji Ah, and Eugene)

657
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,110
Eugene.

658
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,790
- Ji Ah.
- It's been a long time.

659
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
(Good to see you!)

660
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,290
- Hello.
- My goodness.

661
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,560
It's been a long time.

662
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,260
Hello, Do Kwon.

663
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,650
Hey, So Yeon.

664
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,270
- Do Kwon's here with us again.
- Hello.

665
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,270
- Do Kwon.
- Hello.

666
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,240
Do Kwon, are you okay now?

667
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,770
- Jong Kook attacked you before.
- Why are you here again?

668
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,900
- Are you okay?
- Have you been working out?

669
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,400
- Of course.
- Gosh, I can see that.

670
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,080
- Do Kwon, it's good to see you.
- You look great today.

671
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Yes, you look good.

672
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,810
All right. These are the leading
actors of "The Penthouse".

673
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,600
- Please welcome them.
- Hello.

674
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,110
The drama is so hot right now.

675
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,370
- Yes, it is.
- It's hot.

676
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,370
It's very popular.

677
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,750
The story is so interesting
that you can't wait to see the next.

678
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,790
You're so right.

679
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,020
- The development of the plot is...
- Yes, it's so fast.

680
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,230
- Fast enough to draw attention.
- Yes, starting with Eugene.

681
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,500
Why don't you
introduce yourselves for us?

682
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,230
Hello, everyone.

683
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,500
It's been a long time
since I appeared on TV shows.

684
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,700
- So I'm very excited.
- All right.

685
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,160
- She's a fairy.
- It's been a long time.

686
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,930
I'm playing Oh Yoon Hee
on "The Penthouse".

687
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,100
- Yes, welcome!
- Welcome, Yoon Hee!

688
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,940
Yoon Hee!

689
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,980
- All right.
- Yoon Hee.

690
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,640
- I think for Eugene...
- Yes.

691
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,940
this is her first appearance
on Running Man.

692
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,140
- Yes.
- Really?

693
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,410
I didn't know at first.

694
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,640
- But it's her first time.
- I know.

695
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,110
I've never seen
so many cameras in front of me.

696
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,180
There's a reason why
we have so many cameras.

697
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,030
It's because we like to show off.

698
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,000
Yes, we're pretentious.

699
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,690
- Some of them don't even work.
- Yes, he's right.

700
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,160
Four of them don't even work.

701
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,970
- No red lights on some of them.
- Yes.

702
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,300
They're phony cameras.

703
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,600
We also have dolls.

704
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,070
But you know what?

705
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,870
- I've seen her on TV shows.
- Yes.

706
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,010
But I've never met her
in person for the filming.

707
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,340
- Lee Ji Ah is here with us.
- Hello.

708
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,820
Hello.

709
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,720
You don't appear
on variety shows, do you?

710
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,440
No, that's why it's my first time
seeing most of you in person.

711
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,680
- She's right.
- Yes.

712
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,410
- So she's so nervous.
- Yes, I am.

713
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,230
- She's never been on variety shows.
- You're right.

714
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,530
This is your first variety show,
isn't it?

715
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,730
Do you usually enjoy
watching Running Man?

716
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,300
(Do you usually enjoy
watching Running Man?)

717
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,500
(Well...)

718
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,630
No, she doesn't.

719
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,970
(No, she doesn't.)

720
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,630
- Just stay quiet.
- Give her a second.

721
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,740
You should stay quiet.

722
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,600
Can't you guess that?

723
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,370
- You don't watch "The Penthouse".
- I do watch it.

724
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,870
You do? What's it about?

725
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,050
Veiled enmity and jealousy
of the rich.

726
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,050
That's not it.

727
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,680
- It's not?
- It's not about that.

728
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,790
- Veiled enmity and jealousy.
- Maybe you've watched the middle.

729
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,220
They're fighting
to get into the penthouse.

730
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,730
- Isn't that right?
- No, not really.

731
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,000
I guess he read the plot on Naver.

732
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,090
People must've given you advice
on what to do on our show.

733
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,570
What did they say?

734
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,860
They just told me to be myself.

735
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,240
- But...
- Okay, who told you that?

736
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,310
My agency and my friends.

737
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,480
But it's really hard to be myself.

738
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,010
You're right.
People tell you to be yourself.

739
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,050
- Well...
- But it's hard.

740
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,440
I think I need
some time to get used to this.

741
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,720
But when you get used to it...

742
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,320
- Then the filming ends.
- Then I say, "See you next week!"

743
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,090
So you should try
to get used to it faster.

744
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,180
- All right?
- Okay.

745
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,330
I bet she prepared something
to show us her talent.

746
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,830
Show my talent?

747
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,120
- Gosh.
- She's more nervous.

748
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,450
We won't force you.

749
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,330
- We did that in the old days.
- She'll pass out.

750
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,300
So we've talked to Ji Ah.

751
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,000
Now let's talk to So Yeon.
You were on our show before, right?

752
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,840
- No, this is my first time.
- Gosh, it's her first.

753
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,580
- It the first for all three.
- Right.

754
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,370
Yes, this is the first time
on our show for all three of you.

755
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,370
My niece's biggest wish is for
her aunt to appear on Running Man.

756
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,370
Really?

757
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,140
I mentioned it
in my interviews as well.

758
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,020
And she turns 20 next year.

759
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,260
Already?

760
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,650
- How long has it been then?
- I thought, "It's been too long."

761
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,990
So she thought of it first
when she was 10.

762
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,850
Yes, her wish came true in 10 years.

763
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,090
Her dream has come true.

764
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,890
- Yes.
- Many of you won't know this...

765
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,190
- but we have many young fans.
- Yes, it's true.

766
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,500
- Yes, we do.
- Children love our show.

767
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,200
So Yeon, you're playing
the villain on "The Penthouse".

768
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,470
Yes, I am.

769
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,900
Is it your first time
playing the villain?

770
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,510
This is my second. I played
the villain about 20 years ago...

771
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,780
on "All About Eve".

772
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,750
(Courtesy of MBC)

773
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,320
You're incredible.

774
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,410
If you're worried about Woo Jin,
you should go to London.

775
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,990
I grew up watching that show.

776
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,120
- I loved it.
- It was popular.

777
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,730
So you were a young fan
of "All About Eve"?

778
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,850
Yes, of course, I was.
She was an announcer on the show.

779
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,060
Yes, you're right.

780
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,390
(Making a fuss)

781
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,620
She must be so happy.

782
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,040
- This is so exciting.
- Good for you.

783
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,300
You haven't changed a bit.

784
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,430
- Ji Ah.
- Yes.

785
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,430
Why did you laugh...

786
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,160
after watching them
make a fuss about it?

787
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,900
Well, I'm just getting used to it.

788
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,310
- You're getting what?
- I'm getting used to it.

789
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,840
- To our reaction.
- So you're learning how to react?

790
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,020
You can learn
a lot from their reaction.

791
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,050
That's how you react when you're
surprised or glad to meet someone.

792
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,880
She was on "All About Eve".
How would you react?

793
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,450
(Making a fuss)

794
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,290
- I'm a big fan.
- They're here.

795
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,850
I loved your drama.

796
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,650
Gosh, I can't believe this.

797
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,230
I'm such a huge fan.

798
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,570
- All right.
- This is how you should react.

799
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,230
This is what we do.

800
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,000
We'd like you to make a fuss.

801
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,090
"All About Eve"?

802
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,570
("All About Eve"?)

803
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,510
("All About Eve"?)

804
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,580
- That's just too much.
- You went too far.

805
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,750
That's ridiculous.

806
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,220
- Oh, okay.
- Kwang Soo.

807
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,720
I just gave them an example.

808
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,090
I was excited
and surprised to see you.

809
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,110
- He passed out.
- That was funny.

810
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,090
That's too much though.
That's just what he does.

811
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,620
He has his own universe.

812
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,260
As you were saying, in the drama...

813
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,830
- you play...
- In the drama,

814
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,090
I'm the head of the art department
at Cheong A Arts High School.

815
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,500
- The head of art department.
- And I'm a famous soprano.

816
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,390
I have everything,

817
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,200
but I always lose to Oh Yoon Hee...

818
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,100
- who's standing right here...
- She gets in your way.

819
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,740
- at critical moments.
- I see.

820
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,140
So I have
an inferiority complex and...

821
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,110
It's just that
she's not good enough.

822
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,170
(Sulky)

823
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,180
They are having a war
of nerves even here.

824
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,520
It was funny when So Yeon did this.

825
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,990
She couldn't deny it,
so she was just...

826
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,060
(She uses her whole body
to express her feelings.)

827
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,260
You know what I mean.

828
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,350
That was funny.

829
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,090
Oh, okay. I did it.

830
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,360
- They are so into their characters.
- She thinks she's better.

831
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,930
Honestly, we are totally
absorbed in our characters now.

832
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,240
I can see that.

833
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,860
She was shooting the drama
until early this morning.

834
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,310
And these two...

835
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,870
- haven't slept for days.
- What about you, Do Kwon?

836
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,600
- I bet he had a sound sleep.
- I had a good sleep.

837
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,640
(I had a good sleep.)

838
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,480
He seems to be in the best shape.

839
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,670
- I can see that.
- He's the only one who looks good.

840
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,140
- He's ready to face Jong Kook.
- I want to run fast...

841
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,760
- since this is "Running Man".
- Ji Ah said...

842
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,590
you're the only one
who looks good today.

843
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,760
- He's in good condition.
- You look nice today.

844
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,850
Your face is glowing.

845
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,760
He had a good sleep.

846
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,920
- Do Kwon is like my soulmate.
- He's finally here.

847
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,190
Do Kwon, were you okay
when you joined our show last time?

848
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,240
You said you came
to catch Jong Kook,

849
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,840
but you just got humiliated.

850
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,510
I got treated with
acupuncture for two days.

851
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,400
I had the bee sting therapy
and cupping treatment.

852
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,440
- It must've been bad.
- You got cupping treatment?

853
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,080
- Yes.
- And you posted...

854
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,020
- some photos on your social media.
- Really?

855
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,250
After the show was aired,

856
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,750
- he posted a review.
- He posted a review.

857
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,110
- This is what he wrote.
- He also added a message.

858
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,490
"I went to shoot "Running Man" with
Kang Doo Ki's uniform yesterday."

859
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,760
It's like his diary.

860
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
- I can't read it all.
- It's a diary.

861
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,350
It says "face-to-face
confrontation".

862
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,360
He says he lost the face-to-face
confrontation with Jong Kook.

863
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,470
(Flustered)

864
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,430
It's like his essay.

865
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,700
Do Kwon, this is too long. And
there's no substance in the story.

866
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,370
It says "face-to-face
confrontation".

867
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,480
This is too long.

868
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,700
The point is...

869
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,550
that I should've avoided
the confrontation with Jong Kook.

870
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,980
- I see.
- It's like a little kid's diary.

871
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,750
This is how Do Kwon looks
in the drama.

872
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,450
That's how he looks.

873
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,650
- He's a music teacher in the drama.
- Right.

874
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,060
He looks like Beethoven.

875
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,290
- He's a teacher. But he ran away.
- Tell us about your part.

876
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,260
I'm a vocal teacher.

877
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,000
- He majored in voice.
- Right.

878
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,360
And my character is
a kiss up, kick down.

879
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,040
- What?
- I'm polite to superiors...

880
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,010
and harsh on subordinates.
I'm a teacher like that.

881
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,310
How would you compare it
with your personality?

882
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,200
It fits me well.

883
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,980
(He's a kiss up,
kick down for real.)

884
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,010
What did I tell you?

885
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,280
That was neat.

886
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,050
- He's honest.
- Right.

887
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,750
That's why
your acting was so natural.

888
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,950
- Exactly.
- Anyway,

889
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,450
thank you all for joining us
despite your busy schedule.

890
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,230
- The drama isn't over yet.
- Right. They're still shooting it.

891
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,560
So they have no time to rest.

892
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,830
How is your new movie,
The Pirates" going?

893
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,390
- It's going well.
- Actually,

894
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,190
- he's shooting summer scenes.
- Right.

895
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,500
But it's winter now.
It's been put off a little.

896
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,040
- Oh, no.
- That's why your cheeks are red.

897
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,740
- What?
- Because it's cold.

898
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,930
- This is because it's cold?
- Oh, dear.

899
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,670
- I bet he's cold now.
- I feel bad for him.

900
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,630
- Did you get frostbite?
- No.

901
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,050
It looks like frostbite.

902
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,600
And you have age spots here.

903
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,640
- Stop that.
- It's a mole.

904
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,610
- Is it a mole?
- Age spots?

905
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,550
All right.

906
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,350
Today's race is called
Recruiting Penthouse Race.

907
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,090
You will be playing one on one.

908
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,230
Okay. Today is the day.

909
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,920
The penthouse...

910
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,230
- Suk Jin, stop that.
- Stop being silly.

911
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,830
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

912
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,970
They will have a hard time
editing the video. Don't do that.

913
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,470
- I just...
- You can't just say anything...

914
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,070
- because you're paid.
- That's not it.

915
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,270
- I just can't stay quiet.
- He's like a parrot.

916
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,930
- Should I stay quiet?
- Stop it.

917
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,080
My goodness.

918
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,810
Suk Jin, I'll see you in jail.

919
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,810
(He talks a lot, but he doesn't
understand the rules well.)

920
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,220
You will be playing
an individual race today.

921
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,610
The first four people who make it
to the penthouse...

922
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,610
will be the winners.

923
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,950
- 4 people.
- There will be 4 winners.

924
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,850
- 4 people?
- What? 4 people?

925
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,950
It's first come, first served.

926
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,850
- The four of us should win.
- Exactly.

927
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,500
The 4 winners will get a prize
and the other 8 will get a penalty.

928
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,070
During the race, the mission fund
is very important.

929
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,500
You will soon go through
missions in each round...

930
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,270
and be divided into two groups
of six, top club and bottom club.

931
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,080
And those in the top club...

932
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,080
will get twice the money the bottom
club gets from each mission.

933
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,050
It will make a big difference.

934
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,550
So you should make it
to the top group...

935
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,720
- and save as much money as you can.
- I have to be in the top club.

936
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,320
You can also increase
your mission fund...

937
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,450
at the gathering of each club,

938
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,590
so you should try
to take advantage of it.

939
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,850
(There will be 4 winners,
and the rest 8 will get a penalty.)

940
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,190
We will start the mission
once you get changed.

941
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,920
- Okay.
- All right.

942
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,470
Let's go get changed.

943
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,970
(Who will be the 4 winners
of this race?)

944
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,040
(They get changed
and move to the mission spot.)

945
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,280
I like your eyebrows.

946
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,700
Thank you.

947
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,100
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo are
still wearing the makeup.)

948
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,440
It was so funny when you lip-synced.

949
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,320
- You were very good.
- You did it well.

950
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,720
- Kwang Soo was terrible at first.
- He was bad.

951
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,820
- It was strange.
- At the last moment,

952
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,560
he just kept opening his mouth.

953
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,090
(Groaning)

954
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,050
(He grabbed Se Chan
by the collar.)

955
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,620
(Upset)

956
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,760
Wasn't it funny when he did this?

957
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,490
He was like this.

958
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,200
Because of what you said...

959
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,990
It was totally out of sync
because of that.

960
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,030
You should've done this too.

961
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,160
- Everyone.
- Yes.

962
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,180
Now you will go through a mission...

963
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,740
to be divided into the top club
and the bottom club.

964
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,550
- Okay.
- This is important.

965
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,370
The members of the top club
and the bottom club...

966
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,240
will be treated and paid
differently during the race.

967
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,280
I see.

968
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,010
Gosh, this is very important.

969
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,350
I have to be in the top club
no matter what.

970
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,350
- I have to make it to the top club.
- We'll be in the top club for sure.

971
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,450
Of course.

972
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,390
I can see who is
not going to make it.

973
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,820
- What are you talking about?
- You are divided already.

974
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,300
Don't say that.

975
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,700
They're standing together.

976
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,890
There will be three missions.

977
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,870
And the male and female
winners of each mission...

978
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,510
will join the top club.

979
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,140
So there will be
six winners in total.

980
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,600
- I see.
- It will be hard.

981
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,640
Here's the first mission.

982
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,350
It's about strength.

983
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,550
- Oh dear.
- My gosh.

984
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,490
(The weak members are
disappointed to hear that.)

985
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,620
Look at Do Kwon.

986
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,280
Look at Do Kwon.

987
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,180
- Do Kwon seems confident.
- Why are you nodding your head?

988
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,220
- This is a face-off battle.
- He's worked out for this moment.

989
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,260
It's a face-off battle.

990
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,390
What the male members
are competing in is...

991
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,490
the traditional wrestling
of Cumberland, England.

992
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,240
- Wrestling?
- What? Wrestling?

993
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,490
It's a match between
two male members.

994
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,870
They will embrace each other
crossing their arms.

995
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:39,340
The person who throws his opponent
to the ground wins the game.

996
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,180
It's like ssireum
and wrestling combined.

997
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,680
- This is a little...
- My gosh.

998
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,570
To make it to the top club...

999
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,850
Do Kwon is taking off his jacket.

1000
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,820
Do Kwon is...

1001
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,390
If you win this match,

1002
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,720
you will join the top club
right away.

1003
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,280
That sounds great.

1004
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,320
Let's go to the top club!

1005
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,820
I might be able to win
if I'm lucky with my opponents.

1006
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,930
I'm seven.

1007
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,800
- I'm five.
- Okay.

1008
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,600
- I'm number 1.
- He's number 1.

1009
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,470
Okay!

1010
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,870
- Number 4.
- I'm number 2.

1011
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,240
First, it's Jong Kook
versus Se Chan.

1012
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,840
We don't know it yet.

1013
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,410
What do you not know?

1014
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,740
His girlfriend is rooting for him.

1015
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,370
Gosh, stop it.

1016
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,140
- Se Chan is strong.
- Hey.

1017
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,550
- Are they really dating?
- No.

1018
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,850
No? Is it a joke?

1019
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,850
- What is So Min doing?
- So Min, wait.

1020
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,490
Your girlfriend is rooting for you.

1021
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,550
Are you his girlfriend?

1022
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,600
(No, I'm not.)

1023
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,450
(I'm just working.)

1024
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,370
- Like this?
- That's right.

1025
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,570
- He should give up.
- Like this?

1026
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,490
- Hang on.
- Hold your hands like this.

1027
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,760
- Hold your hands like this.
- Are we doing ssireum like this?

1028
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,870
If your upper body touches
the ground, you lose.

1029
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,870
You should just lie down.

1030
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,870
Ready.

1031
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,300
Everyone seems nervous.

1032
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,280
Start.

1033
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,550
Gosh, stop that.

1034
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,640
(Interesting)

1035
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,820
Keep your back straight.

1036
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,240
- Keep your back straight.
- My goodness.

1037
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,160
(After checking up on him,
Jong Kook presses him right away.)

1038
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,160
(But Se Chan is holding out.)

1039
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,450
My goodness.

1040
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,030
(While everyone is watching it
with interest,)

1041
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,450
(Do Kwon analyze Jong Kook's moves
with his hawk eyes.)

1042
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,760
Can I adjust my grip
during the match?

1043
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,390
If you try to hold out,
you might break your back.

1044
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,740
Your girlfriend is about to cry.

1045
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,140
Oh dear.

1046
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,140
(Sad)

1047
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,140
Look. She's acting.

1048
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
(Plopping down)

1049
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,470
This is the movie, "Rocky"

1050
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,140
(The capitalist couple is
always ready to act.)

1051
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,600
(She forces herself to cry
with exaggerated gestures.)

1052
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,740
This is crazy.

1053
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,970
This is like a scene
from the movie, "Rocky".

1054
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,950
- Se Chan, So Min is crying.
- Se Chan!

1055
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,450
He wants to show something
to his girlfriend.

1056
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,910
- Gosh.
- Good.

1057
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,820
(As he sees his girlfriend cry,
he exposes his gums.)

1058
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,590
Good.

1059
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,820
(But he eventually caved in.)

1060
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,390
(You tried hard.)

1061
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,800
So how was it?

1062
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,640
You held out for quite long though.

1063
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,660
- You did well.
- You lost, but you did well.

1064
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,800
I exhausted him a little.

1065
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,300
It's not like that.
He just fought and lost.

1066
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,340
He fought and lost.

1067
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,600
He fought but lost.

1068
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,600
- He just lost.
- He fought and lost

1069
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,070
- Jong Kook.
- Se Chan is strong though.

1070
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,910
(Do Kwon just reflects upon
Jong Kook's moves without laughing.)

1071
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,910
- It's me and Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1072
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,180
This is meaningless though.

1073
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,350
This is a big match.

1074
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,220
If I win, I will have to fight
against Jong Kook.

1075
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,760
It's okay. I'll beat you up
and fight against Jong Kook.

1076
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,180
- Okay.
- He's wearing cotton pants.

1077
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,990
Suk Jin works out a lot.

1078
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,760
Gosh, his torso is...

1079
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,990
His torso is quite thick.

1080
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,430
Suk Jin is vigorous
in spite of his old age.

1081
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,700
- In spite of his age?
- Don't say that.

1082
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,390
- Ready.
- He has a big torso.

1083
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,430
Start.

1084
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,870
Push him hard.

1085
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,180
(Round 2 starts.)

1086
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,430
Gosh, it hurts.

1087
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,550
(Groaning)

1088
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Gosh, it hurts.

1089
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,640
(They're loud,
but they are not moving at all.)

1090
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,820
(It looks more like a free hug.)

1091
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,640
What kind of fight is so loose?

1092
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,350
- Come here.
- It hurts.

1093
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,990
(Not an ounce of strength
can be felt.)

1094
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,890
They're both squeezing
with all their might.

1095
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,180
Why are you only hugging each other?

1096
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,660
Hold on.

1097
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,120
(Thud)

1098
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,030
Did you seriously just hit me there?

1099
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,600
(For the first time,
the game gets interesting.)

1100
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,660
(He fights back.)

1101
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,470
(That hurts...)

1102
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,910
(He stumbles across
a viable attack.)

1103
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,030
Hold on a second.

1104
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,800
Wait.

1105
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,050
- You can't use your legs.
- Wait.

1106
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,450
But he hit me first.

1107
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,350
- You can't kick him.
- He kicked me first.

1108
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,070
This isn't how the game should be.

1109
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,720
- Isn't this cheating?
- You shouldn't kick.

1110
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,450
I'm sorry about that,
but he kicked me first.

1111
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,620
You've been given a yellow card.

1112
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,760
- You'll go again.
- Can't you use your legs at all?

1113
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,760
- Hold on.
- So how do you knock someone back?

1114
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,160
Ji Ah...

1115
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,820
Ji Ah seems exhausted.

1116
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,470
(Spacing out)

1117
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,390
She's already tired.

1118
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,390
- Ji Ah...
- She's already exhausted.

1119
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,740
I can't forget the look on her face.

1120
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,370
Have you never seen
anything like this before?

1121
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,410
Is it new to you?

1122
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,700
This is how we have fun.

1123
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,010
What's with that face?

1124
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,600
I'm sorry, guys.

1125
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,740
I mean...

1126
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,640
These are the games we usually play.

1127
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,350
Living in a penthouse doesn't mean
you can look down on us.

1128
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,470
Suk Jin, come on.

1129
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,010
Stop playing dirty, all right?

1130
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,890
- You're the dirty one here.
- This is hilarious.

1131
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,850
- Ready, set, go.
- Let's do this!

1132
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,120
Suk Jin...

1133
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,620
Suk Jin doesn't have
any strength left.

1134
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,950
- What on earth?
- Jae Suk's...

1135
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,350
(Jae Suk seizes the opportunity
to win easily.)

1136
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,350
What on earth?

1137
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,370
(The lackluster game
ended with no takeaway.)

1138
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,490
That would be worth
a full point in judo.

1139
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,200
Nicely done.

1140
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,570
You drained a lot of his strength.

1141
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,740
Are you all right?

1142
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,910
- Get lost.
- You drained his strength.

1143
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,140
That's the key at the moment.

1144
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,680
Nicely done.
What a good game, Suk Jin.

1145
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,800
Okay!

1146
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,870
It's Ha versus Ha next.

1147
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,180
Haha, show him what you've got.

1148
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,820
- Don't let him win easily.
- Do Kwon must win to save face.

1149
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,680
Your son Dream is watching.

1150
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,260
- Grab each other.
- There's a huge size difference.

1151
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,550
Wait, where's So Yeon?

1152
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,850
- Hold on a second. Wait.
- He's no joke, right?

1153
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,490
You won't believe how strong he is.

1154
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,720
(Let's see what Do Kwon
has to offer.)

1155
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,030
- Ready...
- Distract him.

1156
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,260
Hold on a second.

1157
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,530
- I doubt...
- Hold on a second.

1158
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,340
Wait.

1159
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,660
(Do Kwon takes the lead
the moment the game begins.)

1160
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,640
Do Kwon, hold on a second.

1161
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,140
- Do Kwon's determined.
- Do Kwon, wait.

1162
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,410
- Do Kwon...
- You really should calm down.

1163
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,140
- Calm down.
- Calm down a bit.

1164
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,740
Get out of my way.

1165
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,410
(Don't interrupt me!)

1166
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,720
(Jong Kook Hunter can't be stopped.)

1167
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,950
- Do Kwon!
- I'll just say I'm sorry.

1168
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,320
- Calm down for a second.
- I'm fine!

1169
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,820
- He's seeing red.
- What's with you?

1170
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,930
Hold on.

1171
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,760
Okay, fine. We'll say you won.

1172
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,030
- He's seeing red.
- What's with you?

1173
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,640
(He unleashes his full power.)

1174
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,840
(Groaning in pain)

1175
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,840
(Like we expected, Do Kwon wins.)

1176
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,100
- You...
- Unbelievable.

1177
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,030
- Do Kwon...
- Haha, are you all right?

1178
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,300
- I saw your eyes flip.
- Haha isn't that weak, you know.

1179
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,820
Do Kwon's no joke.

1180
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,070
You should've done it
like me and Suk Jin.

1181
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,240
This is how I was trained to be.

1182
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,050
- His lips are drained of blood.
- My gosh.

1183
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,320
Partner,

1184
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,660
- crush him.
- Got it.

1185
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,820
(I'm amazed.)

1186
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,260
I'm looking for payback today.

1187
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,320
Kwang Soo advanced by a default win.

1188
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,390
Why don't we start
with Do Kwon and Kwang Soo?

1189
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,840
Okay, Do Kwon and Kwang Soo.

1190
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,930
- This...
- It can go either way.

1191
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,100
This sounds like fun.

1192
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,470
This is hard to tell.

1193
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,340
Haha, it's hard to tell.

1194
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,240
- I'll root for the Ha family.
- Kwang Soo isn't weak,

1195
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,870
and he also plays dirty.

1196
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,240
He plays dirty?

1197
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,510
(No one expects this
to be a clean game.)

1198
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,780
- He's really strong.
- Wrap it up on your end.

1199
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,410
He's really tall though.

1200
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,680
Hold on.

1201
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,720
(Kwang Soo presses his chin down.)

1202
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,220
Hold on.

1203
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,850
He's pressing with his chin.

1204
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,850
(The game begins
with Kwang Soo cheating.)

1205
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,990
Nice.

1206
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,570
Kwang Soo...

1207
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,800
Are you kidding me?

1208
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,180
What's the matter with him?

1209
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,840
I said he wasn't an easy opponent.

1210
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,970
(The match was dead serious.)

1211
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,180
Before I could even...

1212
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,070
Do Kwon, why are you
taking this so seriously?

1213
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,510
This isn't wrestling!

1214
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,350
This is supposed
to be a variety show.

1215
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,120
This isn't the Olympics, you know!

1216
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,450
- Unbelievable.
- Are you kidding me?

1217
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,760
- He only has one goal today.
- Tell me about it.

1218
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,120
Are you all right?

1219
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,350
He didn't complain about
my chin attack and sent me flying.

1220
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,600
- What on earth was that?
- You did well.

1221
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,740
- Do Kwon's strong.
- What did I tell you?

1222
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,160
He's really strong.

1223
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,340
Kwang Soo's not an easy opponent.

1224
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,160
(All I'm after is Jong Kook.)

1225
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,180
(Jong Kook, just you wait.)

1226
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,300
He's looking at Jong Kook.

1227
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,700
- He came determined today.
- Do Kwon...

1228
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,100
He must've counted his days.

1229
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,370
- Okay, come on.
- Don't I know it.

1230
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,570
Jong Kook has to beat me first.

1231
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,510
- What?
- He has to beat me first.

1232
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,120
- Just quickly lie down.
- He has to...

1233
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,220
- Just quickly lie down.
- Why don't we...

1234
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,530
film how it'll end first?

1235
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,720
- With him on the ground first.
- Like this?

1236
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,530
- You never know.
- I call three seconds.

1237
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,800
- Are you ready?
- Ready...

1238
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,600
Go!

1239
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,820
(Darn it...)

1240
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,870
- Just stay lying down.
- As gently as possible.

1241
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,140
So that you won't get hurt.

1242
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,240
- He fought and lost!
- You were gently put down.

1243
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,010
- It's over.
- Did something even happen?

1244
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,680
- You fought and lost.
- Jae Suk...

1245
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,510
- I fought and lost.
- Yes, you did!

1246
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,010
You fought and lost.

1247
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,370
- You fought and lost.
- That I did.

1248
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,640
You lost completely.

1249
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,820
You fought and lost.

1250
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,050
(Is it my turn now?)

1251
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,090
- It's now the finals.
- The finals.

1252
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,180
The final match.

1253
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,410
- Do Kwon, come forward.
- He has awaited this moment.

1254
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,030
Finally, Do Kwon...

1255
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,220
Do Kwon...

1256
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,930
(He took all games seriously
so that he could take on Jong Kook.)

1257
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:47,990
But...

1258
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,490
(Jong Kook, I'm back.)

1259
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,240
(During episode 515,
he swore to bring Jong Kook down.)

1260
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,870
(And then the two
went head-to-head.)

1261
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,680
(Do Kwon fought
until his clothes got ripped.)

1262
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,640
(During their first match,
he suffered a humiliating loss.)

1263
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,720
(He internalized his rage
and came back to win.)

1264
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,510
(Even before rage took over,
he scanned Jong Kook's play style.)

1265
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:13,390
(I've waited for this day,
Jong Kook.)

1266
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,260
(Do Kwon gets a chance
to seek revenge.)

1267
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,760
- Which side?
- He's dead serious.

1268
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,100
- What's more comfortable?
- He really wants to win.

1269
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,700
- Whatever's comfortable for you.
- I'm good either way.

1270
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,970
- Same here.
- How about this then?

1271
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:22,990
Either way is fine.

1272
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,570
It's almost intimidating.

1273
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,240
Jong Kook...

1274
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,070
Do Kwon's just as big as Jong Kook.

1275
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,200
Look. Do Kwon's in it to win it.

1276
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,410
I know.

1277
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,140
(Everyone holds their breaths
to watch the big match.)

1278
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,140
(Will Do Kwon get his revenge?)

1279
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,240
Be careful.

1280
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,510
It'll be different this time.

1281
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,680
The legs...

1282
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,590
(Do Kwon attacks first.)

1283
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,680
(But Jong Kook won't budge.)

1284
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,910
Don't use your legs.

1285
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,160
Just the upper body.

1286
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
(They are equally powerful.)

1287
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,160
(But right then...)

1288
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,200
(The two fall at the same time.)

1289
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,530
(Who will be the winner?)

1290
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:01,410
(Do Kwon's back
touch the ground first.)

1291
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,430
Jong Kook wins.

1292
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,070
(Jong Kook twisted his torso
so that Do Kwon's back...)

1293
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,700
(touched the floor first.)

1294
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,100
- Jong Kook wins.
- Jong Kook wins.

1295
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,410
Do Kwon's face was pressed hard.

1296
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,010
Do Kwon's face was pressed hard!

1297
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,720
His face was pressed into the floor.

1298
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,780
Are you all right?

1299
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,180
Serves you right for taking him on.

1300
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,410
You lost again.

1301
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:19,890
- Are you all right?
- We rooted for you.

1302
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,220
(He worked out for nothing.)

1303
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,530
- You...
- He grabbed the back of his head.

1304
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,350
He's now sulking again.

1305
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,600
(Sulking)

1306
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,700
He sulks every time he loses.

1307
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,490
- He just can't win.
- Do Kwon...

1308
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,470
- He's now in tears.
- Look at Jong Kook, will you?

1309
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,800
- He might call his mom.
- It's just a game, you know.

1310
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,010
- And so the winner...
- So much for working out.

1311
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,340
is Jong Kook.

1312
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,640
(Jong Kook makes it
to the top club.)

1313
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,550
We'll now begin the ladies' match.

1314
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,620
The game is pull-up bar wrestling.

1315
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,090
(The ladies will compete
in a pull-up bar wrestling.)

1316
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,090
You will hang from the bar
and knock down...

1317
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,760
your opponent to win.

1318
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,160
This won't be easy.

1319
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,430
So Yeon and Eugene,

1320
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,550
haven't you done this before
on other variety shows?

1321
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:00,800
- I don't think I have.
- I see.

1322
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,030
Then you'll get your chance today.

1323
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,120
(Firmly)

1324
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,300
Ji Ah.

1325
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,470
I...

1326
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,840
Number five gets an advantage.

1327
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,100
(Ji Ah heads straight
to the semi-finals.)

1328
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,930
Nice, I want number five.

1329
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,370
Eugene, let's check your number.

1330
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,510
- Number 2.
- Number 2.

1331
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,470
- I chose number one.
- Then it's you and Eugene.

1332
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,180
So Min and Ji Hyo
will also go head-to-head.

1333
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,410
- We chose 3 and 4.
- Okay.

1334
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,910
Show them the strength
of the Running Man ladies.

1335
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,590
(Tournament Bracket)

1336
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,050
- So Yeon, head on up.
- Oh, dear.

1337
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,820
We'll help.

1338
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,320
The rivals go head-to-head.

1339
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,890
- You're right.
- Their characters are rivals.

1340
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,070
- I got this.
- There you go.

1341
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,640
(Eugene sets the tone of the match.)

1342
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,930
(She said she hasn't tried
anything like this before.)

1343
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,530
(The prima donna of pull-up bars)

1344
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,010
You...

1345
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,200
She's on the athletic side.

1346
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,050
You should hold
the mattress for her.

1347
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,850
How...

1348
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,120
- Did I get up here too soon?
- I think you did.

1349
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,510
Eugene, I'm sorry.
I'll pick up the pace.

1350
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,890
- Sorry about this.
- No, it's fine.

1351
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,620
So Yeon...

1352
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,120
(Dangling)

1353
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,390
- Hold on.
- What on earth was that?

1354
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,470
So Yeon, please.

1355
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:10,760
What on earth was that?

1356
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,990
- We can't even begin the game.
- Are you kidding me?

1357
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,530
Can I just advance
to the next round?

1358
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,570
- Let me advance.
- The game's as good as over.

1359
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,200
- But...
- Eugene wins!

1360
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,240
No, please get back up there.

1361
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,280
Oh, dear.

1362
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,470
I'll get up there first,
so stay here and relax.

1363
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:29,010
- She offered to go up first.
- I truly believe that So Yeon...

1364
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,550
should be on variety shows.

1365
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,180
- She...
- She's hilarious.

1366
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,280
- She really is.
- You know what I mean, right?

1367
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,720
- Of course, I do.
- She's so sweet.

1368
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,430
- Now...
- She's kind-hearted.

1369
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,490
- That's it.
- Eugene, go ahead.

1370
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,430
- She's up there.
- She made it up there.

1371
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,430
So Yeon's hilarious.

1372
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,530
- Okay, good.
- She's up there.

1373
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,740
(Meanwhile, without any help...)

1374
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,140
I feel like it's already over.

1375
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,240
- Eugene's incredible.
- It's already over.

1376
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,370
Be careful.

1377
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:52,570
It's already over.

1378
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,340
- She can't move.
- It's over.

1379
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,910
It's already over.

1380
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,140
(The fluttering of her foot
makes no difference.)

1381
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,350
- Just go for her legs.
- So Yeon's about to give up.

1382
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,550
(So Yeon's about to give up.)

1383
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,910
(Eugene is still relaxed.)

1384
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,260
(No one knows how So Yeon feels
better than So Min.)

1385
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,890
- Eugene...
- It's already over.

1386
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,590
So Yeon's about to give up.

1387
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,160
(So Yeon drops without
being able to hold for a minute.)

1388
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,220
(Eugene wins
with the perfect stance.)

1389
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,030
You were like a monkey!

1390
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,970
- A monkey.
- Are you all right?

1391
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,870
- How nimble of you.
- All you did was hang there.

1392
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,470
So Yeon, what happened?

1393
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,300
Did you win? Congratulations.

1394
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,140
(Did you win? Congratulations.)

1395
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,050
- What did you just say?
- Of course, she won.

1396
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,120
So Yeon asked if Eugene won.

1397
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,450
Congratulations.

1398
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,320
Why would you congratulate her?

1399
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,820
(After losing,
she congratulates Eugene.)

1400
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,220
What just happened?

1401
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,260
So Yeon is quite peculiar.

1402
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,990
- So Yeon is really funny.
- She's always been like this.

1403
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,800
She's doing a great job
on the variety show.

1404
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,660
- I can see that.
- Yes.

1405
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,620
She couldn't beat her in real life
just like in the drama.

1406
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,660
Right.

1407
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,160
She can never beat her.

1408
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,530
So Yeon does a lot of things
like that.

1409
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,410
You know what I mean, right?

1410
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,660
She keeps losing.

1411
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,430
She makes gestures like this
when she reacts.

1412
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,280
She often reacts excessively.

1413
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,740
- Just like Americans do.
- Yes.

1414
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,970
(Her Hollywood style reactions
seemed unusual from the opening.)

1415
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,970
That's so funny.

1416
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,390
Are you still laughing?

1417
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,490
- She's the queen of reaction.
- Right?

1418
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,910
- She's the queen of reaction.
- That was so funny.

1419
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,320
She always makes three gestures
in a row.

1420
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,120
(It's at least
a triple combination.)

1421
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,200
It's so hilarious.

1422
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,530
Ji Hyo versus Ji Ah.

1423
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:20,720
- Ji Hyo, step on it first.
- Ji Hyo versus Ji Ah.

1424
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,200
- I'm excited.
- After I...

1425
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,370
- After I go up?
- Ji Ah, please come forward.

1426
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,660
I don't think I can do this.
I'm worried.

1427
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,700
Ji Hyo, you and Kwang Soo must win.

1428
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,430
- Ji Ah... Ji Ah.
- Yes?

1429
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,430
- I have a question for you.
- It won't be easy.

1430
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,780
Have you ever done anything
like this?

1431
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,840
Never.

1432
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,350
When was the last time you did it?
Did you do it when you were a kid?

1433
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,780
- She must've tried hanging...
- Kids rarely do this.

1434
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,910
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1435
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,350
- Not many kids do this.
- Do they play dodge ball?

1436
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,550
- I've never tried this before.
- Dodge ball?

1437
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,390
But I think she's quite strong.

1438
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,590
Really? Then we never know.

1439
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,590
Let's find out.

1440
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,050
She may be quite strong,
but Ji Hyo is extremely strong.

1441
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,220
It'd be so funny if she did
a great job on the bar.

1442
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,320
She would move like this.

1443
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,160
- "Bring it on!"
- Like this.

1444
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,320
(Making a fuss)

1445
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,740
(Teasing a guest is
the most fun thing to do.)

1446
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,760
I don't know. I already feel dizzy.

1447
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,760
- Please step up on the mat.
- He never misses a chance.

1448
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,140
(They can't stop themselves
from teasing their guests.)

1449
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,240
- How should I do this?
- Put your foot on this.

1450
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,470
Do you need any help?
Or can you do it by yourself?

1451
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:08,740
Step on it. I'll help you.

1452
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,910
- You should pull it a little.
- Gosh.

1453
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:11,740
- Seriously.
- Go, Shim Su Ryeon!

1454
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,070
Put your leg over the bar.

1455
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:14,370
- How should I do this?
- That's right.

1456
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:15,910
- Pardon?
- How should I put my legs over it?

1457
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,550
- Like a barbecue...
- Like a chicken over the fire.

1458
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,260
- We'll support you under here.
- Right.

1459
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,120
Gosh, seriously.

1460
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,950
- 1, 2...
- This is so annoying, right?

1461
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:23,950
(Cheeky)

1462
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:25,990
It's annoying, right?

1463
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,720
(As she sighed unintentionally,)

1464
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,720
(Jae Suk read her mind.)

1465
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,660
(Maybe Jae Suk was right
seeing that she burst out laughing.)

1466
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,970
I know how that feels.

1467
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,800
- I know how that feels.
- I know that too.

1468
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,030
- You know, right?
- Yes.

1469
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,280
- "Why did my agency accept..."
- "Why..."

1470
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,700
"the invitation from this show?"

1471
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,510
- "I'm so annoyed."
- "Gosh, this is so annoying."

1472
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,870
When will you get to do
something like this?

1473
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,120
- Where else could you try this?
- "Gosh."

1474
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,870
"Gosh, seriously."

1475
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,090
- Can you see right through me?
- Yes, I can.

1476
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,260
I'm so excited about this match.

1477
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,760
Ji Ah, come on.

1478
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,090
Wrap your legs around the bar
like this.

1479
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,220
- We'll lift your legs.
- Help her out.

1480
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,930
- I have no idea.
- It's okay.

1481
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,530
- Step on here.
- Step on his shoulder.

1482
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:02,800
- But I can't...
- Step on my shoulder.

1483
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,070
Step on my shoulder.

1484
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,640
- We'll lift your legs.
- Good.

1485
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,370
- Ji Hyo seems so relaxed.
- Good.

1486
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,700
- Like that.
- Done.

1487
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,760
- Done. She's ready now.
- 1, 2, 3.

1488
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,840
- Okay.
- Good.

1489
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,510
- She's ready.
- Ready.

1490
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,200
- You can start now.
- I think...

1491
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,350
- You never know.
- Gosh. What do I do?

1492
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:17,740
- Ji Ah.
- Yes?

1493
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:18,970
- Well...
- You never know.

1494
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,070
You should push her.

1495
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:21,320
Push her, Ji Ah.
You should push her.

1496
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,640
(As Jae Suk advised her
to push Ji Hyo...)

1497
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,010
Push the black socks off the bar.

1498
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,990
- That's good.
- Push her legs off the bar,

1499
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,160
and you'll win. That's good.

1500
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,280
(Surprised)

1501
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,760
- Just push... That's good.
- Ji Ah seems really strong.

1502
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,930
- Ji Ah.
- We can't predict the result.

1503
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,450
- She's so strong.
- The black socks.

1504
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,720
- Ji Hyo shows no mercy.
- My goodness.

1505
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,970
(But her opponent is
the merciless Ji Hyo.)

1506
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,640
Oh, her leg fell off.

1507
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,740
What should I do?

1508
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,530
(She got the hang of
hanging from the bar.)

1509
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:42,760
- No!
- Ji Hyo is amazing.

1510
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,410
- Push her other leg off the bar.
- I'm impressed.

1511
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,510
- Ji Hyo is laughing.
- Ji Ah.

1512
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,180
- You can do it!
- She's very strong.

1513
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,280
- Push her leg off the bar.
- Oh, my.

1514
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,780
Oh, no. Ji Hyo used up
all her energy.

1515
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,550
Ji Ah seems as strong as Ji Hyo.

1516
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,890
(Ji Ah seems unexpectedly strong.)

1517
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:57,890
Gosh.

1518
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,720
- Goodness.
- That's good.

1519
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,890
- My gosh.
- Ji Ah.

1520
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,590
Keep going.

1521
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,950
Gosh. I'm running out of energy.

1522
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,030
They could win just by hanging there
without falling.

1523
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,050
She's so strong.

1524
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,820
(The unexpected tight match
made everyone's jaw drop.)

1525
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,160
Wrap your arm around it.
That's good.

1526
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,220
You're doing great.

1527
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,570
Here she goes.

1528
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,570
(Ji Ah started pushing her
with all her might.)

1529
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,200
I don't know who's going to win.

1530
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,240
This is so fun to watch.

1531
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,800
She's doing well
when Ji Hyo is really strong.

1532
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,470
Ji Hyo is amazing,

1533
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,200
- Ji Hyo won't let her win easily.
- and Ji Ah is amazing too.

1534
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,010
- She's really strong.
- Awesome.

1535
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,180
(Is she the Ji Ah we know?)

1536
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,490
- They're both really strong.
- Look at them.

1537
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,680
Ji Ah,

1538
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,490
since you're hanging there,
you don't want to lose, right?

1539
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:34,950
(You're right.
I don't want to lose.)

1540
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,120
We know...

1541
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,890
"This is annoying,
but I want to do my best."

1542
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,600
It's hard to give up
although it's annoying.

1543
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,660
- You'll win if you hold out long.
- Even though it's annoying...

1544
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,930
It's because she's competitive.

1545
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,120
(Her arms and legs feel weak
because she's laughing.)

1546
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,200
You're almost there. No!

1547
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,390
(Ji Ah who has been doing well
lost!)

1548
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:47,470
Ji Ah.

1549
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:48,530
- They're both strong.
- You're almost there. No!

1550
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,140
Ji Ah.

1551
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,780
(She's expressing her disappointment
with her entire body.)

1552
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,570
Are you all right?
Are you all right, Ji Ah?

1553
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:57,950
No.

1554
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,410
Please give them some water.

1555
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,620
- Water, please.
- Eugene will be at an advantage.

1556
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,680
- She ran out of energy.
- By the way,

1557
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,720
I find Ji Ah...

1558
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,760
- so cool...
- Yes.

1559
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,990
because she never lies.

1560
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,620
She said no
when I asked if she was okay.

1561
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,220
(The variety show rookie is
honest at every moment.)

1562
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,390
I think she's overwhelmed
because she hung for so long.

1563
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,390
Ji Ah, you're very strong too.

1564
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,030
She has good endurance too.

1565
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,140
- Gosh.
- You're no joke.

1566
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,260
Can't I have another sip?

1567
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,740
Of course, you can.

1568
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,600
(Jae Suk kindly closed the lid.)

1569
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,510
(Can't I have another sip?)

1570
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,350
Well... Hey, Ji Ah.

1571
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,370
(She's drinking water hastily.)

1572
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,320
- Why?
- I didn't try to take it from you.

1573
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,550
I just gave her the lid,
and she said,

1574
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,780
"Can't I have another sip?"

1575
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:40,280
- She's too obsessive.
- I was...

1576
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:43,620
I was just giving you the lid.

1577
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,200
I wasn't trying to take the bottle
away from you.

1578
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,890
You can take it home.

1579
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,970
People working on variety shows
are not that stingy.

1580
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,760
- I don't think I can...
- You can take it home.

1581
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,370
I can't stand up.

1582
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,700
Of course, she's tired.

1583
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:57,530
While Ji Hyo is
recharging her energy...

1584
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,680
Does anyone want a match
to get additional mission funds?

1585
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,370
- Between guys?
- Yes. It'll be too hard...

1586
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,140
- for Ji Hyo to have a match now.
- Additional mission fund?

1587
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,410
- Yes, we'll give you extra money.
- We're going to...

1588
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,910
- Do Kwon.
- I bet Do Kwon wants another match.

1589
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,140
- With Jong Kook?
- Yes.

1590
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,280
(Do Kwon has another chance
to get revenge.)

1591
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,720
With me? I don't have to accept it.

1592
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,620
I'm already in the top club.

1593
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,010
Then I'll have a match
with Do Kwon.

1594
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,220
- Okay.
- Have a match with Kwang Soo.

1595
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,530
You must defeat Kwang Soo...

1596
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,090
- before challenging Jong Kook.
- Kwang Soo is good at this.

1597
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,160
Kwang Soo is...

1598
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,700
I've never lost in any games
using a pull-up bar.

1599
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,660
Kwang Soo has never lost
in any pull-up bar games.

1600
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,800
- Do Kwon.
- Do Kwon.

1601
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,340
You already have children, right?

1602
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,570
I had a vasectomy.

1603
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,300
Really? Then you have nothing
to worry about.

1604
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,680
- Okay.
- "Okay"?

1605
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,570
I'll tell you his nickname now.

1606
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,970
Assassin on the Pull-up Bar.

1607
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,220
I've never lost.

1608
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,220
The winner will get
additional mission funds.

1609
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,240
- Okay.
- Yes.

1610
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,410
(Ha Face-Off
who always fights head-on)

1611
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,760
Ready.

1612
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:51,450
(As the whistle was blown,
the assassin started attacking.)

1613
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,220
- Goodness gracious.
- Look at that.

1614
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:00,370
(As soon as the match began,
Do Kwon got the advantage.)

1615
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,600
Look at that. I knew it.

1616
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,530
(But Kwang Soo won't let him win.)

1617
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,800
- Oh, my goodness.
- He's getting the drop on him.

1618
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,280
- Do Kwon won't give up.
- He's amazing.

1619
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,140
Gosh. He's unbelievable.

1620
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,240
(Do Kwon pushed his face
with his foot.)

1621
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:18,090
(The underhanded, dirty fight
began more quickly than expected.)

1622
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,410
You can do it.

1623
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,260
(His feet got on Assassin
on the Pull-up Bar's nerves.)

1624
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,950
Kwang Soo won't let him win.

1625
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,090
- Kwang Soo is... Oh, boy.
- Kwang Soo.

1626
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,260
Kwang Soo.

1627
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,570
Oh, boy. Kwang Soo.

1628
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,640
(Kwang Soo started going crazy.)

1629
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:37,200
(A match between the kings
with world views)

1630
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,140
(Do Kwon's short jabs?)

1631
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,570
(Or Kwang Soo's long punch?)

1632
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:43,370
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo...

1633
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:44,600
My gosh.

1634
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,680
(So Yeon is reacting
most excitedly.)

1635
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,240
(Kwang Soo went mad as he's
fighting the person he wanted.)

1636
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,910
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo...

1637
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,850
(It's complete chaos.)

1638
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,930
Here goes the assassin.

1639
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,120
Assassin on the Pull-up Bar...

1640
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,930
(The time has come. Assassin
on the Pull-up Bar is here.)

1641
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,890
(He started executing him
moving his leg like a straw cutter.)

1642
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,010
(He's really incredible.)

1643
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,450
(This is even more dramatic
than "The Penthouse".)

1644
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,470
My goodness.

1645
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:20,010
(Assassin on the Pull-up Bar is now
using his final weapon, his fist.)

1646
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,680
(Do Kwon's legs became wobbly
because of his fist attack.)

1647
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,890
(Will he become another victim
on a pull-up bar?)

1648
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:28,950
(Ha Face-Off used his arm strength
not to fall.)

1649
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,490
Gosh, that's dirty.

1650
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:34,720
(His arm muscles for hunting
Jong Kook are finally shining.)

1651
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,300
(Do Kwon's counter-attack)

1652
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,390
It's so dirty.

1653
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,740
(He's starting the true
head-to-head fight.)

1654
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,530
- This is hilarious.
- It's so dirty.

1655
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,470
(Assassin on the Pull-up Bar is
screaming out of joy.)

1656
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,280
(The 2 mad men won't give an inch.)

1657
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,010
- This is crazy.
- My gosh.

1658
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,320
This is really...

1659
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,870
(Both are running out of energy.)

1660
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,510
Do Kwon is doing
as well as Kwang Soo.

1661
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,780
Watching this alone is hard.

1662
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,220
- This is crazy.
- My gosh.

1663
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,350
- They're both incredible.
- My gosh.

1664
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,430
Do Kwon...

1665
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,160
Do Kwon is fighting dirty too.

1666
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,970
(Kwang Soo succeeded in
assassinating Do Kwon in the end.)

1667
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:13,240
He's exhausted.

1668
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,530
Do Kwon is exhausted.

1669
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:15,660
Look at him.

1670
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,970
Look at Do Kwon.

1671
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,370
You, dirty punk.

1672
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,240
(It was a great match
full of dirty moves.)

1673
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,740
You, dirty punk.

1674
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,470
Kwang Soo won
additional mission funds.

1675
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,320
- Do Kwon, good job.
- You did a great job.

1676
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,280
- Good job.
- Assassin on the Pull-up Bar won.

1677
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,510
No one can beat him.

1678
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,350
Assassin on the Pull-up Bar...

1679
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,590
Even Jong Kook can't beat him
on a pull-up bar.

1680
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,180
No one can beat him.

1681
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,930
Listen, guys.

1682
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,760
- He received only 10 dollars.
- What?

1683
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,430
(He earned only 10 dollars
for the arduous assassination.)

1684
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,570
- 10 dollars.
- It was so hard to win.

1685
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,010
- Hey!
- You're like a beggar.

1686
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,530
I have 10 dollars.

1687
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,800
You can have it.

1688
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,930
- Thank you.
- The beggar received money.

1689
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,240
Kwang Soo was so enthusiastic
as if there's no tomorrow.

1690
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,300
This is how much he loves
Running Man.

1691
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,620
This is the happiest moment
of the month.

1692
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,640
Kwang Soo, I want to
give you something.

1693
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:08,780
Give him 50 dollars
out of my paycheck.

1694
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,820
Jae Suk.

1695
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:12,320
I didn't say that
to get 50 dollars from you.

1696
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,890
- It's a token of my affection.
- Give him 100 dollars at least.

1697
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,930
- Give him 100 dollars.
- Should I?

1698
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,640
I'll give you 100 dollars
out of my paycheck.

1699
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,870
What about you?

1700
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,600
What about you?
You won't do anything?

1701
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,660
Give Do Kwon 100 dollars
out of my paycheck.

1702
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,870
He asked me
if I wouldn't do anything.

1703
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:27,340
- Give him money out of Suk Jin's.
- Great.

1704
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,550
Suk Jin doesn't seem happy.

1705
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:30,550
- He might leave the show.
- Then...

1706
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,140
I'll have only 200 dollars left.

1707
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,140
(You and your jokes.)

1708
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:36,850
(While they were laughing
and making jokes,)

1709
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:39,950
(someone caught Jae Suk's eyes.)

1710
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,160
Look at Ji Ah.

1711
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,660
(Look at Ji Ah.)

1712
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,160
- What?
- You know,

1713
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,120
she watched us in an annoyed state.

1714
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,660
(She was having a reality check
at a corner.)

1715
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,970
- No, no.
- That was hilarious.

1716
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,530
That was hilarious.

1717
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,070
(Everyone wants to tease Ji Ah
as she is new to variety shows.)

1718
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,160
- This is how we live.
- You should witness it.

1719
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,240
Ji Ah, this is how we live.

1720
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,800
We have lived this way
for over 10 years.

1721
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,300
I am having so much fun.

1722
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:03,050
- I am having so much fun.
- This is fun.

1723
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,850
Ji Ah, you don't need to be sorry.

1724
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:07,570
We are really happy
that you visited the show.

1725
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:08,680
- That's right.
- This is fun.

1726
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,640
You are showing the reactions
we never give.

1727
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,160
- Seriously.
- Her reactions are so unique.

1728
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,850
I am laughing so much
thanks to you, Ji Ah.

1729
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,950
Shouldn't Do Kwon go home now?

1730
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,030
- Are you okay?
- He used up his energy.

1731
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,660
- Do Kwon.
- His face turned pale.

1732
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,850
His face turned pale.

1733
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:22,120
- Look at his lips.
- He should go home.

1734
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,160
A face-off.

1735
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,660
- Are you okay?
- A face-off.

1736
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,760
We should face him Face-Off.

1737
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,070
Face-Off.

1738
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,760
- Ha Face-Off.
- Ha Face-Off.

1739
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,760
They had a face-off.

1740
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,970
Ha Face-Off.

1741
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,530
Now, it's time for the finals.

1742
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,100
- Good luck.
- With Eugene's skills,

1743
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,410
you don't know what will happen.

1744
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,640
- Eugene is incredible.
- Seriously.

1745
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,910
She is on another level.

1746
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,370
Are you ready?

1747
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,390
(Women's final)

1748
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:43,390
(A match between two strong women)

1749
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:44,680
Eugene can go up on her own.

1750
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:47,220
I am excited about this match.

1751
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,030
We will begin
as soon as they hang from the bar.

1752
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:50,160
(The winner of this match
will join the top club.)

1753
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,450
(Who will be the winner
of the women's match?)

1754
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,600
(Ji Hyo is still exhausted.)

1755
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,140
- Ji Hyo is...
- Did it begin?

1756
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,390
- It began.
- Let's go.

1757
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:07,600
(On the other hand,
Eugene is relaxed.)

1758
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,700
Come on.

1759
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,810
(Ji Hyo attacks first
in order to end the match quickly.)

1760
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,310
(Will she take Eugene down
with a single attack?)

1761
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:20,450
(In her attempt to attack,)

1762
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,490
What?

1763
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:23,220
(Ji Hyo exhausts her energy
and falls.)

1764
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,720
- What?
- She went back up!

1765
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,330
(The prima donna of
the pull-up bar is relaxed.)

1766
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,100
(She continues to give reactions.)

1767
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,830
(Disappointed)

1768
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:37,830
My goodness.

1769
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,810
Ji Hyo wasn't lucky
with her opponents.

1770
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:43,060
- She was already out of energy.
- My arms gave out.

1771
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,510
- My goodness.
- I was lucky.

1772
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:48,580
My goodness. Thus, the winner of
the women's match is...

1773
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,470
Eugene.

1774
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:52,180
She is incredible.

1775
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,520
In the first match of strength,

1776
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,760
Eugene and Jong Kook joined
the top club.

1777
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,810
Okay, okay.

1778
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,760
Now comes the second match.

1779
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:04,490
It's the match of composure.

1780
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,430
- Composure?
- I have confidence.

1781
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,060
- I can do well in this match.
- I never lose composure.

1782
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,790
I have the mental strength.

1783
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,290
I never lose composure.

1784
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,060
There will be a men's match
and a women's match.

1785
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,740
The game will proceed the same way.

1786
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,330
When you come out
and put a recorder in your mouth,

1787
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,930
another member
will tickle or hit you.

1788
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:21,950
You are out
if the recorder makes a sound.

1789
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:25,120
This has nothing to do
with the inner composure.

1790
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,680
I am really ticklish.

1791
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,790
I can't stay composed
when someone tickles me.

1792
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,680
I won't last a second.

1793
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,680
(Go ahead.)

1794
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:35,430
That happens.

1795
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,120
How do I hold in the sound?
There must be a way.

1796
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:42,060
(Everyone plays the recorder.)

1797
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,560
(He shows off his recorder skills
from the elementary school days.)

1798
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,790
(Squeaking)

1799
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:47,870
(The room gets filled
with various notes...)

1800
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,640
(and the performance
of "Airplane".)

1801
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,270
(The music class must be playing,
"The Netherworld of Recorders".)

1802
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,270
Go with the C sharp chord.

1803
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,720
Ji Ah looked at the recorder
and went...

1804
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:01,790
(Sighing)

1805
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:03,390
Did she do that again?

1806
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:04,680
She held it and went...

1807
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,220
I didn't do that.

1808
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:08,430
- I understand.
- I didn't do that.

1809
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:12,200
"What is this? What is this?"

1810
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,970
- "What is this?"
- That's so funny.

1811
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,870
(She diligently prepares
for the game.)

1812
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:19,890
Breathing out through your nose
should help, right?

1813
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,540
- Give it a try.
- When you get tickled...

1814
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,140
- Give it a try.
- How do you do it?

1815
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,430
When you get tickled... Tickle me.

1816
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,100
(Squeaking)

1817
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:27,510
(As soon as he begins,)

1818
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,200
(he makes a sound.)

1819
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,770
- Breathing out through your nose...
- Suk Jin.

1820
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,910
- She barely touched you.
- Ji Ah, isn't this fun?

1821
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,640
Isn't this fun?

1822
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,640
(His instant reaction
makes her chuckle.)

1823
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,020
She is incredulous.

1824
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:38,620
This is...

1825
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:39,910
- Try it when I tickle you.
- But this...

1826
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:40,930
Put the recorder in your mouth.

1827
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,850
(Try it when I tickle you.
Put the recorder in your mouth.)

1828
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:44,720
- Do it with your nose.
- Do it with your nose.

1829
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,330
- No!
- Come on.

1830
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,830
(Why did he put the recorder
against his nose?)

1831
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,060
- Hold on.
- What are you doing?

1832
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,740
- Are you stupid?
- Are you nervous?

1833
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,870
- Are you stupid?
- You are nervous, right?

1834
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,430
- Breathe out through your nose.
- Suk Jin.

1835
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:57,430
I can't put this
back in my mouth now.

1836
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,270
- It's your nose. Try it.
- For goodness' sake.

1837
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:01,850
It all depends on who tickles you.

1838
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:05,120
Why don't we go with the order
we chose earlier?

1839
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,990
- 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.
- Yes.

1840
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:09,180
- We decided on it earlier.
- Then I will tickle Se Chan.

1841
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,390
- Suk Jin, go first.
- Me?

1842
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:12,620
- Suk Jin.
- Number four.

1843
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,120
(The person who will attack Suk Jin
for 30 seconds is...)

1844
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,350
- Who's number four?
- I am!

1845
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,520
- Kwang Soo is strong.
- He won't be able to hold it in.

1846
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,850
- Is it you?
- Jiangshi.

1847
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,020
- He is good. He tickles nonstop.
- Is it you?

1848
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,970
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- This is crazy.

1849
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,200
A clown came. For goodness' sake.

1850
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:29,140
You should know
that I found the perfect tactic.

1851
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:32,200
I learned to breathe out
through my nose.

1852
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,640
That's right. Stay composed.

1853
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,200
Suk Jin, you will experience pain.

1854
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,310
No, no. He won't hurt me.

1855
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,410
It will be a disaster
if you wet your cotton pants.

1856
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:40,410
Set.

1857
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,520
(The time limit is 30 seconds.)

1858
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,520
Go.

1859
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,620
(Squeaking)

1860
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:49,060
(He exhaled powerfully.)

1861
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,330
0.8 seconds.

1862
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:51,490
That was 0.8 seconds?

1863
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:52,950
Suk Jin,
you are currently in first place.

1864
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,120
- Hey.
- What?

1865
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,270
- You are currently in first place.
- Why did you rip my ribs?

1866
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,770
(He was defenseless
to the attack on his ribs.)

1867
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:58,790
Who is next?

1868
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,770
It's Do Kwon. Do I tickle Do Kwon?

1869
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,510
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk is good at this.

1870
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:03,600
Do Kwon, are you ticklish?

1871
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,580
- Are you ticklish?
- He isn't ticklish.

1872
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,680
- Hold on. In that case...
- He would pretend even if he is.

1873
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,120
You didn't block the opening,
did you?

1874
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,520
- Oh, it makes a sound.
- Hold on.

1875
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,490
Hold on. I need to think.

1876
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,620
The tactic that needs censorship
is your only way.

1877
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:21,830
(They think about cheating.)

1878
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,430
Jae Suk, do it our way.

1879
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,950
The camera crew should only shoot
his bust.

1880
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,720
Let's go
with Assassination Number One.

1881
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,290
Let's go with that tactic.

1882
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,660
- Okay.
- Get ready.

1883
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:32,330
Get ready.

1884
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,660
Set.

1885
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,510
Hold it.

1886
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,200
(Jong Kook approaches him
from behind.)

1887
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:39,580
(You should do it!)

1888
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:42,100
(Jong Kook attacks instead.)

1889
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:46,040
(But Do Kwon withstands it.)

1890
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,620
- He is holding it in.
- He is withstanding it.

1891
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,490
(Do Kwon is doing better
than anyone expected.)

1892
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,910
I didn't start, Do Kwon.

1893
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:53,930
(I didn't start, Do Kwon.)

1894
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:54,930
(It's a bolt out of the blue.)

1895
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:57,790
Jae Suk needs to start.

1896
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:58,830
Why did you go?

1897
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:00,600
- I was playing around.
- It's Jae Suk's turn.

1898
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,620
- Jong Kook, it isn't your turn.
- Jae Suk didn't start.

1899
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,700
- Let's start over.
- It isn't your turn.

1900
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,970
Jong Kook is so mischievous.

1901
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:07,560
- I guess that wasn't very funny.
- He was playing around.

1902
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,660
It's my turn.

1903
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,810
- Stop it, Jong Kook.
- All right.

1904
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:12,910
- He withstood it really well.
- I thought it would be funny.

1905
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,910
All right. Let's get ready.

1906
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:16,140
Hold on.

1907
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:19,410
- This is...
- They are so serious.

1908
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:20,490
(He puts it in front of Do Kwon.)

1909
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:21,790
Hey.

1910
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,260
There is no other way.

1911
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,390
(Assassination Number 2:
Set up a screen to hide foul play.)

1912
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,950
- We are taking it far.
- Seriously?

1913
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,020
I am a guest.

1914
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:31,020
Manners.

1915
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,560
- Let's go.
- Our tactics won't work.

1916
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,020
He will probably hold it in
even if we stab him with a needle.

1917
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:35,600
Let's go.

1918
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,540
(Do Kwon's 2nd attempt
finally begins.)

1919
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:39,660
For goodness' sake.

1920
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,140
Attack this area.

1921
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,540
- Gosh.
- It isn't working.

1922
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,240
He isn't ticklish.

1923
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,600
- He is incredible.
- He is holding it in.

1924
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:51,020
- His entire body is tense.
- Nothing is working.

1925
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,040
My goodness.

1926
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,390
- How is this possible?
- He has no weak points.

1927
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:55,810
(They hear the news
of a strong contender.)

1928
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,490
- Let's attack at once.
- Are you okay?

1929
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,120
Let's attack at once.

1930
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,790
(The onlookers' hands are on him.)

1931
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:04,790
(Rushing over)

1932
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:08,020
(Go away.)

1933
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:09,830
(Do Kwon chases away
the cheating onlookers.)

1934
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:11,290
He is incredible.

1935
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:12,990
Nothing is working.

1936
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,740
That was unbelievable.

1937
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,060
(The incredibly composed man,
Ha Do Kwon)

1938
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,510
He withstood everything.

1939
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,910
- He was good.
- Don't you feel ticklish?

1940
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,270
Of course, I do.

1941
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,700
- Did you hold it in?
- You gritted your teeth.

1942
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,410
- He is incredible.
- Is it my turn?

1943
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,240
- Is Do Kwon tickling him?
- It's Do Kwon.

1944
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,620
- Do Kwon.
- It's Do Kwon.

1945
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:28,990
(Do Kwon will attack.)

1946
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:30,040
It's time for revenge.

1947
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,260
They met again.

1948
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,350
Recorder Assassin.

1949
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,520
- Recorder Assassin.
- Assassin on the Pull-up Bar.

1950
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,200
(Do Kwon wants revenge, but
playing dirty is Kwang Soo's forte.)

1951
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,560
(Who will be
the winner of this match?)

1952
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,490
Do Kwon is putting his fingers
between Kwang Soo's ribs.

1953
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,040
You don't need to use
a lot of force.

1954
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,100
Just push a bit.

1955
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,430
Do Kwon, it would be better
to aim for the armpit.

1956
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:47,540
- Get ready.
- Really?

1957
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,540
- No, no. Ribs are more sensitive.
- Get ready.

1958
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:50,810
- You can do it.
- Go.

1959
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,910
- He is holding it in.
- He is holding it in.

1960
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,640
(He holds it in!)

1961
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,120
- He is holding it in. The armpit.
- He is holding it in.

1962
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,240
Hit his armpit.

1963
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,520
(If he holds it in for 30 seconds,
he will be in 1st place.)

1964
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,220
You should make it painful.

1965
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,310
How does he do that?

1966
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,640
(Take this.)

1967
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,990
(He was forced to breathe.)

1968
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:07,620
Wasn't that the Heimlich maneuver?

1969
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,060
(Do Kwon's maneuver
made a clear sound come out.)

1970
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,390
Wasn't that the Heimlich maneuver?

1971
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,890
8.2 seconds.

1972
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,600
- 8.2 seconds.
- What was that?

1973
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:15,720
- I am jealous.
- Do Kwon.

1974
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:17,330
- Do Kwon joined the top club.
- He joined the top club.

1975
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,740
- Do Kwon joined the top club.
- Okay, okay.

1976
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:21,200
- I tried so hard for this.
- Congratulations.

1977
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,240
I tried so hard for this.

1978
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,330
- Now, the four women.
- Women's match.

1979
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:25,470
The five women.

1980
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,740
- Ji Ah is number 1, right?
- Number 2.

1981
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,850
- Number two.
- It's So Min's turn.

1982
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:30,410
So Min should go first.

1983
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:32,140
- You will be tickled.
- Will I be tickled?

1984
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:35,140
(She belatedly moves to the center.)

1985
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,520
So Min, did you block the opening?

1986
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:40,220
- Let me see.
- No.

1987
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,120
Hold on.

1988
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,390
- Did she block the opening?
- She blocked the opening.

1989
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,990
For goodness' sake.

1990
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:46,120
Hold on.

1991
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,370
(She tried to cheat.)

1992
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:49,020
She put the electrical tape
in her mouth.

1993
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,100
- This is...
- Listen.

1994
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,160
- It's not like that.
- This is...

1995
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,240
what you do
when you are playing against us.

1996
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,640
- So Min, you went too far.
- Take it off.

1997
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,810
- It's not like that.
- Seriously.

1998
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,950
- I am really ticklish.
- Let's take it off.

1999
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,200
She taped the opening.

2000
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,220
She taped the opening.

2001
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:05,770
- Unbelievable.
- She is unbelievable.

2002
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:07,220
I am really ticklish.

2003
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:09,040
- Take it off.
- The recorder still makes a sound.

2004
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,520
- Take it off.
- I think...

2005
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,790
this show is worse
than "The Penthouse".

2006
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,290
Ji Ah said...

2007
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:18,020
this show is worse than the drama.

2008
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,720
The drama is fictional,

2009
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,770
but this is real.

2010
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,770
I am so nervous.

2011
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,890
I might pee.

2012
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:26,660
Get ready. Get ready.

2013
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,040
(So Min gives it a go.)

2014
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,140
Set...

2015
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:34,240
- Don't move. Don't move.
- She is doing pretty well.

2016
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,200
She is breathing through her nose.

2017
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,150
- Grab her nose.
- Grab her nose.

2018
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,570
Ji Ah, grab her nose.

2019
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:41,520
Grab her nose.

2020
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,080
(So Min buys time
by breathing through her nose.)

2021
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:47,780
(Squeaking)

2022
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,490
(Here comes a steam train.)

2023
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:52,320
- It was 2 against 1!
- I had no choice.

2024
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,900
You breathed through your nose.

2025
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,430
(Se Chan and Ji Ah's teamwork
took out So Min.)

2026
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,600
16 seconds.

2027
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,690
- That's a good score.
- She withstood it for a while.

2028
01:08:58,690 --> 01:08:59,970
She withstood it for a while.

2029
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,730
- Ji Ah, come here.
- It's okay.

2030
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:02,900
Ji Ah, come here.

2031
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:05,900
Eugene will tickle her.

2032
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,240
Get ready.

2033
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:10,980
- What am I going to do?
- Set...

2034
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:14,690
- What was that?
- Hold on.

2035
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:17,480
(She bursts out in laughter
instead of playing the recorder.)

2036
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,780
- Hold on.
- What was that?

2037
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,890
(What was that just now?)

2038
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,760
I thought her recorder was making
a strange sound.

2039
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,030
It was her laughter.

2040
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:25,100
Hold on. Hold on.

2041
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,190
She hasn't gone yet.

2042
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,290
- What was that?
- What?

2043
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,820
You should play the recorder.

2044
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,790
You should play the recorder.
Laughter doesn't count.

2045
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:33,100
Go again.

2046
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,160
You can't take the recorder
out of your mouth.

2047
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,200
Don't take the recorder
out of your mouth.

2048
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,870
Things are becoming more fun, right?

2049
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:40,570
(She goes over the rules again.)

2050
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:42,240
- Do we start over?
- Do we need to start over?

2051
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,870
- You need to start over.
- Get ready.

2052
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:45,020
Take a deep breath.

2053
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,440
Catch your breath.

2054
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:47,980
Don't take it out of your mouth.

2055
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,980
- Laugh with it in your mouth.
- Get ready.

2056
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:52,780
(Laughing)

2057
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,390
Don't take it out of your mouth!

2058
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,120
(She bursts out laughing.)

2059
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,190
- Hey.
- Hey.

2060
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:00,970
Don't take it out of your mouth!

2061
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:02,860
- Play it!
- Come on!

2062
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,990
When you play this game,
you can't take it out of your mouth!

2063
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:06,570
What's the use of the recorder
if you aren't going to do that?

2064
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,200
- Seriously.
- We could have gone without it.

2065
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,830
- But I...
- Stop with that hearty laughter.

2066
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,610
- Don't take it out of your mouth.
- Keep it in there.

2067
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:14,010
Play the recorder.

2068
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:16,570
Should we tape the recorder
on her mouth?

2069
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,870
(Eugene suggests
an extreme measure.)

2070
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:20,280
- Come here, Ji Ah.
- Come on.

2071
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,080
Keep the recorder in your mouth.

2072
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,190
If you want to laugh,

2073
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,760
- do so into the recorder.
- That's right.

2074
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,860
Every time she gets ready...

2075
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:28,280
Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do...

2076
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,760
- Why are you holding it that way?
- Is she holding it properly?

2077
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,230
It's not like you need to play it.

2078
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:32,490
You don't need to hold it properly.

2079
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:34,360
- Hold it as you want.
- This is so funny.

2080
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,400
- She is so diligent.
- This is so funny.

2081
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,440
Ji Ah, you are doing well.

2082
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:40,900
- Should I hold the recorder?
- Okay, okay.

2083
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,110
Open wide.

2084
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,810
(Be a good girl, Ji Ah.)

2085
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:45,830
Open wide.

2086
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,310
She is treating her like a baby.

2087
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:50,280
Here. Let's put it
between your teeth.

2088
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,480
Open wide. There you go.

2089
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,680
Let's go.

2090
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,890
(Baby Ji Ah's
recorder class is over.)

2091
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:57,980
- Let's go.
- Go.

2092
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,360
There we go.

2093
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,620
- She is out.
- That was refreshing.

2094
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:02,120
(They finally hear
the sound of the recorder.)

2095
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,190
(Feeling refreshed)

2096
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,360
That was hilarious.

2097
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,430
That was refreshing.

2098
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:10,270
(Eugene is up next.)

2099
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,470
That was funny.

2100
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:12,970
Eugene.

2101
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:14,830
- Get ready.
- I will laugh in mi.

2102
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,230
- Mi.
- Mi.

2103
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,480
- I bet she will do well.
- That's a good idea.

2104
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,780
- Mi.
- Eugene.

2105
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:19,810
Set...

2106
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,110
- She isn't ticklish.
- She is holding it in.

2107
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,110
- She isn't ticklish.
- She isn't ticklish.

2108
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,240
That's how you hold it in.

2109
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,440
Isn't it ticklish?

2110
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:31,450
(Ji Hyo continues to tickle her.)

2111
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:34,150
- What are you doing?
- Are you tickling her?

2112
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,530
(Ji Hyo attacks her scalp.)

2113
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,290
Aren't you going to tickle her?

2114
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:40,320
(Ji Hyo runs out of ideas
as Eugene is impenetrable.)

2115
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,820
You are tormenting her.

2116
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:43,990
You are tormenting her.

2117
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:46,160
(Ji Hyo's hands move quickly
to hear the mi sound.)

2118
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,310
- She is incredible.
- I think Eugene will swear.

2119
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:49,900
This isn't working.

2120
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,010
(Eugene hangs on
until 20 seconds pass.)

2121
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,180
This isn't working.

2122
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,810
She succeeded.
She withstood everything.

2123
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,570
She is strong.

2124
01:11:57,570 --> 01:11:58,680
Eugene succeeded.

2125
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,570
She is strong.

2126
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,860
Ji Hyo became mean
because of that makeup.

2127
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:07,190
- It's the makeup.
- So Yeon.

2128
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,320
- It's the makeup.
- Gosh.

2129
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,320
- She feels bad.
- What am I going to do?

2130
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,650
So Yeon, who are you talking to?

2131
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:14,270
"Gosh." Who are you talking to?

2132
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:15,620
She kept going, "Unbelievable."

2133
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,230
She has American reactions.

2134
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,830
- You should give us one gesture.
- Okay.

2135
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:22,010
You keep showing us
three gestures in a row.

2136
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,140
Unbelievable.

2137
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:25,780
- I can't help myself.
- Okay, So Yeon?

2138
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:26,980
Okay.

2139
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:28,870
- Get ready.
- This is so funny.

2140
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,510
- You can put your hands on her.
- Okay.

2141
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:31,570
Set...

2142
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:33,180
What am I going to do?

2143
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,410
(Why is So Yeon screaming?)

2144
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,720
Why... Why...

2145
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,890
- So Yeon.
- Why did you do that?

2146
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,650
- So Yeon.
- You are not the one being tickled.

2147
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:43,950
So Yeon, Ji Hyo didn't blow
the recorder yet.

2148
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:45,320
You need to keep going.

2149
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,650
(Screaming)

2150
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,970
Why is she acting like
she's being tickled?

2151
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:49,160
Why did she give up?

2152
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:51,160
- So Yeon, what was that?
- Why...

2153
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,990
This isn't a difficult game.

2154
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:55,140
- She gets goosebumps.
- She gets goosebumps.

2155
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,230
Why do you get goosebumps?

2156
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:58,510
- Why do you get goosebumps?
- Hurry up and attack!

2157
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:00,110
- My goodness.
- She is crying.

2158
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:01,680
(Screaming)

2159
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,850
Why is she feeling ticklish?

2160
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,180
- So Yeon.
- Yes?

2161
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,070
Your fingers are only doing this.

2162
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,020
- I mean...
- Go ahead and tickle...

2163
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:09,150
- her armpit.
- What am I going to do?

2164
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:11,860
(What am I going to do?)

2165
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,930
You are doing it wrong. Tickle her.

2166
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,120
(Screaming)

2167
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,230
My goodness.

2168
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:18,490
Excuse me.

2169
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:20,560
(So Yeon is bad at attacking.)

2170
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,100
She won!

2171
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,530
(She suddenly announces
that Ji Hyo won.)

2172
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:27,700
What was that?

2173
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,510
- "She won!"
- "She won!"

2174
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,010
(So Yeon saw that there was no hope
and decided to end the match.)

2175
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,510
My goodness.

2176
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:34,810
Why are you so funny?

2177
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:38,220
- What was that?
- Her fingers didn't even touch her.

2178
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,410
I bet...

2179
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,780
I can make her play the recorder
without touching her.

2180
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:43,890
- I...
- 0.1 seconds.

2181
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,450
The barest touch will take her out.

2182
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,730
Set.

2183
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:52,690
She is holding it in.

2184
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:55,070
She is holding it in.

2185
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,620
- She is determined.
- But...

2186
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:58,270
(What?)

2187
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:01,730
(So Min makes her breathe.)

2188
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:02,810
- Hey!
- Hey!

2189
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,510
- What was that?
- Why did you punch her?

2190
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:06,570
You startled me.

2191
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:11,180
So Yeon is out.

2192
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,740
So Yeon can withstand
getting tickled,

2193
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,540
but she didn't expect
a punch to her stomach.

2194
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,350
- She was startled.
- She held it in.

2195
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:17,580
So Min is unbelievable.

2196
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:19,390
- Seriously.
- So Min is unbelievable.

2197
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,860
Eugene and Ji Hyo,
play rock-paper-scissors.

2198
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,290
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

2199
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:25,400
She won.

2200
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,100
Ji Hyo joined the top club.

2201
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:28,360
That's impressive.

2202
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:30,470
So Yeon, cross this line.

2203
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:33,600
(They have a match of patience
right afterward.)

2204
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,970
(Ji Ah and Haha join the top club.)

2205
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:38,310
Shim Su Ryeon.

2206
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:40,900
Top club and bottom club members,
please line up together.

2207
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,940
Okay.

2208
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:44,110
- For goodness' sake.
- We got divided.

2209
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:46,070
I told you earlier...

2210
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:48,820
that the mission fund is
very important in this race.

2211
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,320
Each member of the top club
will receive 200 dollars...

2212
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,320
and each member of the bottom club
will receive 100 dollars.

2213
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:57,280
The first gathering will give you
a chance to increase the money.

2214
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,730
- Gathering?
- Decide...

2215
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,120
whether to turn in your money
as the gathering fee...

2216
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,270
or to keep it to yourself.

2217
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,830
If you choose the latter,
you keep the money to yourself.

2218
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,900
The collected gathering fee...

2219
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,510
will be doubled...

2220
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:12,010
and divided among the six members.

2221
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:13,780
- My goodness.
- It will be doubled.

2222
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,110
For example, let's say...

2223
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:18,870
all six members of the top club
turn in 200 dollars each.

2224
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:22,390
1,200 dollars will become
2,400 dollars...

2225
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:26,150
and each member will receive
400 dollars.

2226
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:28,930
Let's say 1 member turned in
100 dollars...

2227
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:30,820
and 1 member turned in 0 dollars.

2228
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:32,900
Then the total amount will be
900 dollars.

2229
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,860
The doubled amount, 1,800 dollars,
will be divided into 6.

2230
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,860
Each member will only receive
300 dollars.

2231
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:43,510
The member who didn't turn in money
will take the lead.

2232
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:45,830
We chose the right club.

2233
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:48,310
For now, we chose the right club.

2234
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:50,570
- In the end...
- You know,

2235
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:52,320
we have no reason
not to turn in money.

2236
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,020
- There he goes again.
- Don't even start.

2237
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:56,240
You automatically say those things.

2238
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,110
We have no reason
not to turn in money.

2239
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,950
- I see.
- We have two swindlers.

2240
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:01,230
He says that,
but he won't turn in money.

2241
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:03,980
So Yeon, we need to turn in...

2242
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,430
as much money as possible...

2243
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,150
- and double it.
- I will turn in money, of course.

2244
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:08,600
Here is what I think.

2245
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:10,790
So Yeon will lose
all of her money today.

2246
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:13,330
- It's bound to happen.
- The results of the next mission...

2247
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:14,570
will change the members.

2248
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,730
- The members can change.
- I see.

2249
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:16,860
We could move to the top club.

2250
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,830
I won't name any names,

2251
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:21,150
but these two members
will be enough to destroy that club.

2252
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,940
Jae Suk, one member will be enough.

2253
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,150
One member will be enough.

2254
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,680
I will give you the money.

2255
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:29,780
You can secretly turn in
as much money you want to your VJ.

2256
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:31,320
- If so...
- Hey.

2257
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,410
I'm going to turn in
everything I have.

2258
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:33,520
- I'm going to turn in everything.
- Okay.

2259
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,980
Let's just turn in
a little bit each.

2260
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,260
All is too much, so let's just
turn in a little bit each.

2261
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,490
- Let's just turn in everything.
- Hey.

2262
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:39,650
I took everything out now.

2263
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:41,230
- I also took everything out.
- Me too.

2264
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:42,270
Let's just turn in
everything we have.

2265
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:44,490
The only way we can catch up
with them is to turn in everything.

2266
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:45,690
We need to catch up.

2267
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,070
Can we give it to you right now?

2268
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,310
- To be honest...
- Give it to your VJ.

2269
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:49,330
Give it to your VJ.

2270
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,370
- Who should I give it to?
- Oh, my.

2271
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:52,980
- Hey.
- Do I have to do it again?

2272
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,610
- Say it out loud.
- I'm about to vomit.

2273
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,040
- This is his.
- I'm about to vomit.

2274
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,240
Who should I give it to?

2275
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,610
Why are you showing it so obviously?

2276
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,650
(Will they keep their promise?)

2277
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,150
- Can I give it to you now?
- One person...

2278
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,610
Okay, me?

2279
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,860
I'm going to give you everything.

2280
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,580
I will get double back.

2281
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,480
(So Yeon turned in everything
she had as promised.)

2282
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,950
You have to turn in
everything for this.

2283
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,260
(The other people also completed
turning their money in.)

2284
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:12,690
We all promised...

2285
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,260
- to give 200 dollars.
- Don't betray us.

2286
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,770
- If so...
- I really won't betray you.

2287
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:17,490
We should get
400 dollars back individually.

2288
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:18,990
- That's right.
- If not, someone didn't turn it in.

2289
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:21,400
I'm going to find out who it is
no matter what and get revenge.

2290
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:22,660
Okay.

2291
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:23,730
That's scary.

2292
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:25,180
(They promise to turn 200 dollars
in with a scary warning.)

2293
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,640
(What choice will Ji Ah make?)

2294
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,240
Didn't we promise
to turn in everything?

2295
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,570
What?

2296
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:34,520
- What is happening?
- That's not it.

2297
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,650
That's not it.

2298
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:38,360
I told you I'll get revenge
if someone betrays us.

2299
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,280
You can't betray us.

2300
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:41,760
You should see what happens
if it doesn't work.

2301
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,320
I will get revenge.
if you betray us.

2302
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,400
I will turn everything in.

2303
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,490
(Scared Ji Ah
turned 200 dollars in.)

2304
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:51,660
(The other 5 people also completed
turning it in.)

2305
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:53,790
I will reveal the amount
of the bottom club first.

2306
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:56,640
- You promised 100 dollars each.
- Yes.

2307
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,310
The amount of six people is...

2308
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:00,330
We did a good job
if we get 600 dollars.

2309
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:01,480
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

2310
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,280
- It's 170 dollars.
- What?

2311
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,110
(The bottom club's lodge money is
a total of 170 dollars.)

2312
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:07,240
- What?
- Gosh.

2313
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,040
- What?
- I turned in 100 dollars.

2314
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,110
- I turned in everything I had.
- Gosh.

2315
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,890
- What?
- That's the worst thing ever.

2316
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:13,190
(He's lying.)

2317
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:14,530
(He's also lying.)

2318
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:15,980
I turned in everything, but you
only turned in 10 dollars each?

2319
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:18,690
- 170 dollars?
- 170 dollars is too harsh.

2320
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:20,790
If you double 170 dollars
and round it up,

2321
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:22,690
- we will give you 60 dollars each.
- That's the worst thing ever.

2322
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:24,120
- What?
- But...

2323
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,230
- So Yeon...
- 170 dollars?

2324
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:26,600
- How much did you turn in?
- Someone didn't turn it anything.

2325
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,010
I turned in everything I had
in the entire envelope.

2326
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:29,330
So Yeon turned in everything.

2327
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,360
Then...

2328
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,900
- It's Jae Suk then.
- There are only 170 dollars.

2329
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,940
- She didn't turn in anything.
- I really turned it in.

2330
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,940
- Did you turn it in?
- I really did.

2331
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:39,220
I'm going to turn in everything.

2332
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,780
(He laid a smoke screen
by being loud deliberately.)

2333
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:44,220
We must turn in everything.

2334
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,060
(He only turned in 30 dollars.)

2335
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,060
(Catching on)

2336
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:49,820
(Se Chan turned in 20 dollars.)

2337
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,190
Wait a minute.

2338
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,530
(After smiling,)

2339
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:54,100
(he puts on a serious look
right away.)

2340
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,900
I won't turn in anything.

2341
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,160
(He pretends to turn it in,
but withdraws it quickly.)

2342
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,570
(Suk Jin turned in 0 dollars.)

2343
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,160
- How much did you turn in?
- 20 dollars.

2344
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,610
20 dollars.

2345
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:03,360
(She didn't disappoint us
with her tiger moth-like deeds.)

2346
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:07,200
(Here's another tiger moth who goes
crazy during missions like this.)

2347
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,680
(He hides it in his pocket
right away.)

2348
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,220
(Kwang Soo turned in 0 dollars.)

2349
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:14,240
If we don't turn everything in
this time,

2350
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,820
it will be completely impossible
to turn the tables.

2351
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:17,910
That's the worst thing ever.

2352
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:19,910
- You shouldn't have done that.
- If she paid 100 and you paid 40...

2353
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,430
Three people here
didn't turn in anything.

2354
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:24,690
- Oh, my. I got goosebumps.
- People didn't turn in anything.

2355
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:25,760
- It's you.
- Oh, my.

2356
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:27,530
You saw me turn it in
earlier, right?

2357
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:28,970
I turned in too much.

2358
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:30,030
You saw me turn it in, right?

2359
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,570
- I don't think I saw it.
- What?

2360
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:33,530
- A lot didn't turn it in.
- Did you only pay 20 dollars?

2361
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:34,900
I will announce the amount
of the top club now.

2362
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,940
- 1,200 dollars.
- They had to have gone all in.

2363
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,700
I will announce the amount
of the top club now.

2364
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,230
- 1,200 dollars.
- They must get 1,200 dollars.

2365
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:42,870
I'm going to scream
if we don't get 1,200 dollars.

2366
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:44,040
They have to get 1,200 dollars.

2367
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,040
The top club promised
to turn in 200 dollars each.

2368
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,070
They're a strong competitor.

2369
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:48,650
- The total amount is...
- It's 1,200 dollars.

2370
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:49,720
We got that amount unconditionally.

2371
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,110
- 1,010 dollars.
- What?

2372
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:53,980
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

2373
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,260
- 1,010 dollars.
- What?

2374
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:57,230
(Gosh, come out.)

2375
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,600
- I swear I turned it in.
- Jong Kook.

2376
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,650
- I swear.
- Jong Kook.

2377
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:02,160
I swear.

2378
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:05,160
If you double and divide that,
you'll get 340 dollars each.

2379
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,600
- Who is it?
- It's you, isn't it?

2380
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,310
- No.
- I really turned it in.

2381
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:09,610
I really did.

2382
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:11,230
- I have an empty envelope.
- You're really...

2383
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,280
You saw my empty envelope.

2384
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,610
- Did you turn it in?
- I turned it in earlier.

2385
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,650
How could you only turn in
10 dollars, not 100 dollars?

2386
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:19,040
(Who survived by themselves
and turned down loyalty?)

2387
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,650
It will be hard for this team
to restore trust.

2388
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,780
(Top club showing a division
versus bottom club that lost trust)

2389
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,260
(But this isn't the end.)

2390
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:31,820
(The top club war is getting
more intense with the mission fee.)

2391
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,060
(But at that moment...)

2392
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,290
(They started to discover mysterious
delivery boxes one at a time.)

2393
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,140
(They suddenly became urgent.)

2394
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:44,470
(Escape from this place right now.)

2395
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,810
(The final hurdle
to move into the penthouse)

2396
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:51,180
(Everyone here is a competitor.)

2397
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:54,110
(But is the time they move in
all different?)

2398
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,910
(It's war against time...)

2399
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:58,610
(for everyone to move in
from now on.)

2400
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,950
(The war for the penthouse sparks.
How will the grand finale be like?)

2401
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,430
(The Penthouse Special 2:
Moving In War)

2402
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,450
(And the ending of
last time's Old Restaurant Race)

2403
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,430
The winning team of today is...

2404
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,290
Kim Soo Yong
and Nam Chang Hee's team...

2405
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:11,900
which originally started
as the oldest.

2406
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,440
(Suk Jin's team won
with a total of 198 years.)

2407
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,470
Ji Hyo and So Min gave one each,

2408
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,900
- so it divided evenly.
- Really?

2409
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,030
(They were off guard thinking
Suk Jin's team was old.)

2410
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:20,640
I only gave them one.

2411
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,650
- We will give you the prize first.
- Okay.

2412
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,850
The prize is a set of
wooden tableware for each person.

2413
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,540
- Isn't that...
- They're given a gift.

2414
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:29,080
- They're dishes.
- I'm jealous.

2415
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,980
- They look nice.
- They look nice.

2416
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,190
(He's full of energy
since it's about time to end.)

2417
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,650
We will tell you the penalty.

2418
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:38,620
The penalty is to take away
from your remaining ages.

2419
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,690
1 blow on your forehead
will take away 15 years.

2420
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,470
1 blow on your wrist
will take away 5 years.

2421
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:43,490
We won't have to receive
a lot of blows then.

2422
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:44,970
We will only have to receive
one blow on our wrists.

2423
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:46,530
- So...
- Show me your forehead.

2424
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:47,640
- Should I hit like this?
- Yes.

2425
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,070
(The weakness of the oldest team
is that they have no strength.)

2426
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,160
I didn't hit him properly.

2427
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:53,530
(They finished taking away
years up to Jong Kook's team.)

2428
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,280
(Kim Soo Yong, Nam Chang Hee,
Bomi, Namjoo, Hoshi, Mingyu)

2429
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,410
- It's over.
- Good job.
