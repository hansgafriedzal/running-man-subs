1
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,790
It's Do Kwon. He went too far.

2
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,900
- I'm sure it's him.
- Right.

3
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,260
He shouldn't be doing this, right?

4
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,820
I saw an empty envelope though.

5
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,920
He went too far.

6
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,300
- It was so obvious I could tell.
- Right.

7
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,660
- It's okay. I understand.
- Say something to explain.

8
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,030
- No. We should wait and watch.
- He's not saying anything.

9
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,170
I'm sure it's him.

10
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,140
- I told you.
- He has nothing to say.

11
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,140
(The members of the top club
promised to turn in 200 dollars.)

12
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,280
(But he hesitated as he heard he
can get his share without paying.)

13
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,250
(He pretended to pay
all his money.)

14
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,420
(He turned in only 10 dollars.)

15
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,420
(I turned in all my money.)

16
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,700
(He even showed
an empty envelope shamelessly.)

17
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,270
I can't believe
he turned in only 10 dollars.

18
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,340
Do Kwon, you look different
from the opening.

19
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,810
What happened to your hair?

20
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,470
My hair?

21
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,740
- Where's my cap?
- It's good that you're comfortable,

22
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,110
- but it's just too funny.
- You shouldn't have said that.

23
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,670
You should've just let him be.

24
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,240
Why did you say that?

25
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,190
Do Kwon is unbelievable.
He's the only person who'd do it.

26
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,020
- Jong Kook, I...
- Here. Take this.

27
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,160
You can distribute it.

28
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,550
Oh, this is my share.

29
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,300
- I can't believe this.
- Gosh.

30
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,920
- It's not much.
- Oh, no.

31
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,660
(So Yeon turned in 100 dollars.)

32
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,270
I got six.

33
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,970
That's good.

34
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,630
(The members of the top club
get 340 dollars each.)

35
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,270
But this is...

36
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,580
(Focused)

37
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
(Glancing)

38
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,750
Where else would
Ji Ah have a chance...

39
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,020
to count the play money
so seriously like this?

40
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,140
- So how much did I get?
- What's wrong?

41
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,820
- 340 dollars.
- It's 340 dollars.

42
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,880
340 dollars. Is that right?

43
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,690
- Yes.
- She likes it.

44
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,830
I have to get away from this team
as soon as possible.

45
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,830
On this team...

46
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,690
This isn't just about me.
So Yeon needs to leave this team.

47
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,000
- This team is terrible.
- So Yeon is...

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,570
Only So Yeon turned in 100 dollars.

49
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,860
Honestly, we can't be sure
if she turned in 100 dollars.

50
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,030
- Who else would it be?
- No one can be sure.

51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,210
I'm sure she did.

52
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,130
- Did you turn in your money?
- We never know.

53
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,880
- Hang on. She probably didn't.
- Maybe she didn't pay 100 dollars.

54
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,080
You never know
what Cheon Seo Jin is up to.

55
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,640
(You never know
what Cheon Seo Jin is up to.)

56
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,410
- Eugene.
- She's her rival.

57
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,090
- But...
- Stop being so immersed!

58
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,690
She keeps thinking
about the drama even here.

59
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,880
(Cheon Seo Jin starts acting.)

60
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,910
Oh Yoon Hee.

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,930
- Now you will have a lunchtime.
- Okay.

62
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,400
The top club will eat
Korean beef at a nice place.

63
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,930
My goodness. It's Korean beef.

64
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,870
(It's the prime Korean beef.)

65
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,630
(They shout for joy.)

66
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,660
(Are they eating Korean beef?)

67
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,970
It must be delicious.

68
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,700
And the bottom club will eat
instant cup noodles in a tent.

69
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,780
- Instant cup noodles?
- Yes.

70
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,280
It's Korean beef versus cup noodles.
That's terrible.

71
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,380
- I know.
- I know.

72
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,570
So how do we go to the top club?
Is it even possible?

73
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,780
Yes. You can make it to the top club
through this mission.

74
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,880
The members of each club
may change after the mission.

75
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,280
The bottom club will go through
a mission first...

76
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,820
and decide the members
to advance to the top club.

77
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,820
(The result of the mission will
decide members for the top club.)

78
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,900
The top club will go
through a mission as well.

79
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,500
If they fail the mission, they will
be demoted to the bottom club.

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,900
- So it's like a waiting number.
- Exactly.

81
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,630
I really don't want
to go to the bottom club.

82
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,470
This is sad, but I don't think
So Yeon will leave this team.

83
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,500
Me?

84
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,180
(Laughing)

85
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,180
When So Yeon laughs like that,
it means she swore at you.

86
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,180
I think so.

87
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,680
"You are not in a position
to say that to me."

88
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,880
- I guess she meant that.
- No. I'll do a good job this time.

89
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,690
(I'll do a good job this time.)

90
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,090
- What?
- She never stops.

91
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,480
What was that?
"I'll do a good job this time."

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,780
- "I'll do a good job this time."
- That's how So Yeon is.

93
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,900
- But...
- She looks so haughty,

94
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,160
- but she sounds so kind.
- She has an unexpected charm.

95
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,190
She keeps laughing.

96
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,870
Is it real or fake?

97
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,530
She's laughing for real.

98
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,970
She's innocent.

99
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,570
The mission
for the bottom club is...

100
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,070
Compliment on Me.

101
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,070
What is it about?

102
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,440
The six of you will lie down
with your eyes closed.

103
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,380
One of you will pick
a name you want...

104
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,350
and compliment the person.

105
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,040
The rest of you will hear
the compliment lying down.

106
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,910
And if it sounds like the compliment
is meant for you, you can get up.

107
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,950
If you're correct,
you get two points.

108
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,880
If you get it wrong,
you lose one point.

109
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,720
And if you don't get up when it's
for you, you also lose one point.

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,190
(If they get up when it's not
for them, they lose 1 point.)

111
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,000
So you should say something
that can apply to many people.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,190
You should make the other
members lose more points.

113
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,870
Let's begin.

114
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,340
- You should sound ambiguous.
- Exactly.

115
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,500
I should do that
to make it to the top club.

116
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,180
Have you made up your mind?

117
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,810
Okay. You may start.

118
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,380
Well... First,

119
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,140
this person has a lot of charms.

120
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,420
(The person has a lot of charms.)

121
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,690
It's me. Don't talk about me.

122
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,710
It's about me.

123
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,010
- Gosh, it's So Min again.
- It's mine.

124
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,020
Se Chan is thinking
about So Min again.

125
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,080
(She thinks she's full of charms.)

126
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,890
(He's talking about me.)

127
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,430
- My heart is racing now.
- It's mine.

128
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,940
Can I get up now?

129
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,240
(They all try to show off
their hidden charms.)

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
(Laughing)

131
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,460
What was that? That startled me.

132
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,630
Her laughter makes me feel drowsy.

133
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,640
Exactly. It tickles my heart.

134
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,550
It sounds dreamlike.

135
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,210
This is how she starts laughing.

136
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,290
(Laughing)

137
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,150
(She has an addictive
sound of laughter.)

138
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,820
You should sound relaxed.

139
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,730
Say one more.

140
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,490
And...

141
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,860
this person's smile...

142
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,150
My goodness.

143
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,690
(This person's smile...)

144
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,730
(My goodness.)

145
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,570
The smile is a little attractive.

146
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,440
- Should I get up?
- Just a little?

147
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,700
- What should I do?
- It's not a lot.

148
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,610
This is crazy.

149
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,830
- The ranking by looks?
- Yes.

150
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,550
Well... My gosh.

151
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,770
I don't think I can say that.

152
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,440
- Why not?
- He can't say that.

153
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,420
Hang on. He can't talk about the
ranking by looks, so it's Jae Suk.

154
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,580
What?

155
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,140
Is it Jae Suk?

156
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
I think this person's appearance...

157
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,080
from the back...

158
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,580
(The person's appearance
from the back?)

159
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,360
What? The back hair?

160
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,800
- I think...
- Back hair?

161
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I bet he's talking
about the back hair.

162
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,930
Hey.

163
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,690
He's talking about the back hair.

164
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,690
Are you talking about the back hair?

165
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,130
- If you are, it's Kwang Soo.
- I got it.

166
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,900
All right. One.

167
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
(It's time to get up.)

168
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
Two.

169
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,130
(They wouldn't budge.)

170
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,070
- Two.
- Is So Yeon sleeping?

171
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,070
(Laughing again)

172
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,640
Three.

173
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,550
(Kwang Soo gets up
with a lot of back hair.)

174
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,190
(Was Se Chan talking
about Kwang Soo?)

175
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,750
All right. It's done.

176
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,880
Lee Kwang Soo and Kim So Yeon
lost one point each.

177
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,290
What?

178
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,360
It was you, So Yeon.

179
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,730
You lost your point.

180
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,430
(She sees her name...)

181
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,000
(and feels excited.)

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,670
Why are you happy
when you lost your point?

183
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,820
(It looks like she won the game.)

184
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,370
You lost your point, So Yeon.

185
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,900
Oh, I see. I'm still grateful.

186
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,540
What is she talking about?

187
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,180
- Because I gave you a compliment?
- Sure.

188
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,770
- Because of the compliment.
- Right.

189
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,480
Thank you.

190
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,570
(She likes to be complimented.)

191
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,980
She gives a lot
of strange reactions.

192
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,790
I see. I lost the game.

193
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,080
Thank you, anyway.

194
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,250
This is so nice. Thank you.

195
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,290
(Excited)

196
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,190
It's fun to trick them.

197
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,520
I should get up at the right moment.

198
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,300
I guess I'll make the top three.

199
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,090
Hang on. It's So Yeon's turn.

200
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,670
(So Yeon is trying to pick
whom to compliment.)

201
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,900
(Snatching the cushion)

202
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,480
This round... I mean,
this round will decide...

203
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,700
(I think I had a cushion here.)

204
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,810
(After pathetically
pawing the air several times,)

205
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,380
(he gets up
to look for the cushion.)

206
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,510
I'm sure I had a cushion.

207
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,190
Oh, your cushion?

208
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,340
- Was it you?
- Yes.

209
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,790
You're quite irritating today.

210
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,650
We should take this outside.

211
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,750
All right.

212
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,320
I should give him some money.

213
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,520
He wants us to think he's nice.

214
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,360
You should pick one.

215
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,890
(So Yeon decided
whom to give compliments.)

216
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,740
(Everyone wants her to
compliment them.)

217
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,260
This person is...

218
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,260
someone I really wanted to meet.

219
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,440
- I see.
- My goodness.

220
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,900
I think Kwang Soo
is getting excited.

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,040
You're right.

222
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,880
- He loves this type of compliment.
- Kwang Soo.

223
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,770
- He loves this type of comment.
- Kwang Soo.

224
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,270
- Anything else?
- And...

225
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,210
any clothes look good
on this person.

226
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,210
Kwang Soo is a model, you know.

227
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,320
(This model is ready to get up.)

228
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,650
So anything looks good
on this person.

229
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,490
Unexpectedly,

230
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,990
this person could've been
a good student.

231
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,860
(Unexpectedly, this person
could've been a good student.)

232
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,670
(A good student?)

233
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,090
Kwang Soo
suddenly put his legs down.

234
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,960
(As he heard "a good student",
he politely put his legs down.)

235
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,760
It sounds like she's describing me.

236
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,040
Wait a minute. I think it's me.

237
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,110
- I'm sure it's not me.
- It sounds like me.

238
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,240
I really think it's about me.

239
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,130
Wait a minute. Do you mean that?

240
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,050
- I'm sure it's not me.
- Wait a minute.

241
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,250
The last thing is...

242
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,480
that my best friend...

243
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,050
likes this person a lot.

244
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,050
That's difficult to guess.

245
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Can you tell us
who your best friend is?

246
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,150
- Lee Sang Woo.
- Who?

247
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,630
- I think I know now.
- He likes this person.

248
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,950
Why am I expecting it to be me?

249
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,690
It's possible that it's So Min.

250
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,890
- Stand up if you think it's you.
- All right.

251
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,730
1, 2, 3.

252
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,330
(The person who looks good in
any clothes and was a good student)

253
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,700
- Three!
- It's me.

254
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,070
- I think it's So Min.
- Yes, I think it's me.

255
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,230
No one else?

256
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,510
So Min, Suk Jin, and Se Chan
get one point deducted.

257
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,780
- Why me?
- It was Se Chan?

258
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,050
- It was Se Chan?
- Me?

259
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,320
- Why?
- It was Se Chan?

260
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,550
- It was Se Chan?
- Me?

261
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,610
But that's ridiculous.

262
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,950
That didn't sound like me at all!

263
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,760
He looks good in any clothes?

264
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,720
I look good in any clothes?
That is a lie.

265
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,690
I look like a smart person?
That's another lie.

266
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,430
- I wasn't lying!
- And her best friend.

267
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,940
- I really meant that.
- But he's ignorant.

268
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,090
It seems you would've been
a good student.

269
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,170
Not at all.

270
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,070
Shouldn't I get 1st place?

271
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,280
Now I'll tell you the rankings.

272
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,940
The person who gets to the top
of the waiting list is Jae Suk.

273
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,970
Good for you.

274
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,970
- The 2nd place goes to So Min.
- You?

275
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,190
- The 3rd place goes to Suk Jin.
- Yes!

276
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,290
The 4th place goes to Kwang Soo.

277
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,950
The 5th place goes to So Yeon.

278
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,390
The 6th place goes to Se Chan.

279
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,760
- I came in last.
- Se Chan is...

280
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,430
So Yeon got the 5th place,
but she's just happy about it.

281
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,430
Because I thought I'd come in last.

282
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,400
- I'm sorry. You came in last.
- You're a positive person.

283
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,990
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

284
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,090
- My goodness.
- She's super positive.

285
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,460
We have to focus
on our defense because...

286
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,040
their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
are too strong.

287
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,180
So if all of them get wrong answers,
we all can take their places?

288
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,070
- Yes, that's possible.
- Okay, what should we do?

289
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,310
If they get six wrong answers,
we can all move up.

290
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,740
But to be honest,

291
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,080
I don't want that to happen.

292
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,110
- Why not?
- Me neither.

293
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,340
Because that's impossible.

294
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,260
If I can't make it,
I don't want anyone to move up.

295
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,290
We should stop them no matter what.
If one of them comes here,

296
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,850
- we'll fall apart.
- Yes, we should stop them.

297
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,120
They're evil.

298
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,260
(He already betrayed
the others, so he's evil.)

299
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,720
Here's the mission for the top club.

300
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,220
It's called Lyrics Kungkungtta.

301
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,400
The rules of the game is
the same as Kungkungtta.

302
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
It's Kungkungtta, but you should
come up with a three-syllable word.

303
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,270
But the last player...

304
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,940
should sing at least one measure of
a song that starts with your word.

305
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,810
For example, if the fifth player...

306
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,010
says "Lee Ji Ah",
the 6th players could sing...

307
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,340
<i>Ah, my beautiful land
of beautiful scenery</i>

308
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,690
- So the sixth player should sing?
- Yes.

309
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,940
(Desire for winning
to protect the top club)

310
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,920
But it doesn't matter
which song, right?

311
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,260
Is it okay to sing
from the middle part of the song?

312
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,530
- It doesn't matter?
- It doesn't matter.

313
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,080
You can sing any part.

314
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,120
- Can we practice?
- Yes.

315
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,570
You know a lot of
Korean pop songs, right?

316
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,460
Yes, but only the old ones.

317
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,940
She must know a lot of children
songs too since she has kids.

318
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,960
- That's right.
- All right.

319
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,490
You should sit here then.

320
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,040
- You'll be the last player.
- Well, let's...

321
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,910
- Let's practice first and see.
- Okay, sit there.

322
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,070
- If it works, I'll stay.
- All right.

323
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,510
Then we'll go in this order.

324
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,840
- You'll move up to the top club.
- What?

325
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,570
- You'll move up.
- I'm sure of it.

326
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,740
Well, of course I'll move up.
You don't even have to say it.

327
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,050
My goodness, he sounds so arrogant.

328
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,320
Just because he came in first,
he's being arrogant.

329
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,690
- You came in first just this once.
- And suddenly he's arrogant.

330
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,890
I'm sure I'll enjoy my Korean beef.

331
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,480
Let's practice.

332
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,930
This is a practice.

333
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,990
- Yes, let's practice.
- All right.

334
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,490
Ji Ah, you go first. Go!

335
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,070
Squid.

336
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,140
- I'm sorry.
- 1, 2, squid.

337
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,010
(Squid)

338
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,140
I'm sorry, you're not
supposed to do it like that.

339
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,140
- Kung, kung.
- Please focus.

340
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,700
- Please focus.
- You should be bouncy.

341
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,610
- 1, 2, squid. Like this.
- All right.

342
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,710
- Do it like this.
- Ready, go.

343
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:00,060
- Kung, kung, kung.
- Kung, kung, kung.

344
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,450
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta.
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta.

345
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,430
(To a novice game player Ji Ah,
the beginning part is a challenge.)

346
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,820
(The beginning letter is "Go".)

347
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,900
Hometown.

348
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,300
- No.
- Three syllables.

349
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,270
- 3 syllables.
- A 3-syllable word.

350
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,770
My goodness, what are you doing?

351
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,200
Change seats!

352
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,100
- You haven't played much, have you?
- Gosh, hometown?

353
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,370
- You should hit knees first.
- You haven't played much, have you?

354
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,440
Hit your knees, then clap once.

355
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,910
- Practice.
- Then say the word.

356
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,150
She says she can do this.

357
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,440
- Okay, let's practice.
- I won't get to say anything.

358
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,890
- You'll practice again?
- Yes.

359
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,980
- Again?
- Come on.

360
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,550
How many times
do they get to practice?

361
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,850
- Let's just begin!
- They should...

362
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,320
You try it then.

363
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,030
- Yes, let's show them then.
- All right.

364
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,760
- We can do this right.
- Let's see if you can succeed.

365
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,820
- Of course we can.
- Let's do this.

366
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,090
- Let's show them what we've got.
- Don't be nervous.

367
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,220
Ready, go.

368
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,720
(The top club is having trouble,
so professionals are demonstrating.)

369
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,190
- Go, go, go!
- Go fast.

370
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,360
(The beginning word is "Kang".)

371
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,800
Kang Ho Dong.

372
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,860
- Dongmakgol.
- Dongmakgol.

373
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,810
- He's giving them answers.
- How can they play so badly?

374
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,410
- Cardboard.
- Good.

375
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,840
- Earthworm.
- What was that?

376
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,150
Earthworm. Earthworm.

377
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,280
Bruce Lee.

378
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,740
- <i>You say "Yong"</i>
- That's it.

379
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,890
What is that?

380
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,260
(You say "Yong")

381
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,450
(He wrote a new song
while he's under pressure)

382
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,580
What on earth is that?

383
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,850
I told you this is difficult.

384
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,820
<i>You say "Jung"</i>

385
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,930
<i>And get along with each other</i>

386
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,400
<i>That's what love is about</i>

387
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,070
(Is this a real song?)

388
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,070
Is that a real song,
or are you making this up?

389
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,540
Hey, guys.

390
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,680
Why aren't you singing along?

391
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,600
- Why do you keep singing?
- This is a difficult game.

392
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,100
- It is difficult.
- Yes, this is too difficult.

393
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,240
Ji Ah, you're already
here to film the show.

394
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,280
So you have to do this.

395
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,190
- Lee Ji Ah, you can do this!
- Let's go!

396
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,560
Thank you! Yes!

397
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,110
You should be here again next week.

398
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,260
Now the real game begins.

399
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,480
Don't say it's a practice.

400
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,660
Ready, go.

401
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,930
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta.
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta.

402
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,930
Do, re, mi.

403
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,090
(The beginning word is "Do",
so she said, "Do, re, mi".)

404
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,190
Midopa.

405
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,860
- What? Midopa?
- Seriously?

406
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,670
(You're going with "Midopa"?)

407
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,940
- What? Midopa?
- Seriously?

408
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,270
But it no longer exists.

409
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,280
Ji Hyo.

410
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,830
It's a department store
from the old days.

411
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,150
- Midopa?
- Midopa.

412
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,280
She said that word before.

413
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,050
- She did that before.
- Ji Hyo.

414
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,050
(She uses the name whenever
she has to begin with "Mi".)

415
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,420
(Midopa)

416
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,480
(She still calls out the store
that existed 18 years ago.)

417
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,400
- I loved Midopa though.
- Stop saying the word.

418
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,120
- That's all you can come up with?
- All right, all right.

419
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,170
Lotte Shopping absorbed Midopa.

420
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,770
- Is that so?
- Yes.

421
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,940
I'm sorry.

422
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,670
- So Jae Suk goes to the top club.
- Congratulations.

423
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,910
(Jae Suk joins the top club
right from the start.)

424
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,010
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

425
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,550
(In the next round,)

426
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,110
(they keep failing.)

427
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,190
(So So Min and Suk Jin
get in the top club.)

428
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,350
They'll replace all of us.

429
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,790
- It's my turn.
- It's Kwang Soo's turn.

430
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,480
We all should stop
Kwang Soo from getting in.

431
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,950
- We should stop him.
- What are you talking about?

432
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,190
- Cheer up, guys!
- Come on!

433
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,400
Cheer up!

434
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,300
- We'll be ruined if he gets in.
- Don't say that.

435
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,860
So it's Kwang soo's turn to get in?
Okay.

436
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,600
(An important round for Kwang Soo
because it's his turn to advance)

437
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,280
(The beginning word is "Na".)

438
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,310
Na Hoon A.

439
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,330
Next is "A".

440
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,810
- Madam.
- Next is "Ma".

441
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,600
Malatang.

442
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,570
Tangsuyuk.

443
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,740
Yukgaejang.

444
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,160
Jang... Jang.

445
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,660
(If she succeeds, they can stop
Kwang Soo from joining the club.)

446
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,620
- Jang...
- Okay!

447
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,160
She almost made it.

448
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,400
I can't believe it.

449
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,720
<i>This isn't a joke</i>

450
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,900
We did our best.

451
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,360
- We did well, didn't we?
- Yes.

452
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,070
We're done. Lee Kwang Soo
and Jeon So Min joined.

453
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,810
(Ji Hyo fails in the next round, so
everyone gets out of the top club.)

454
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,870
So all members are changed?

455
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,970
Can't you let them play
a group jump rope or something?

456
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,440
- Look at Ji Hyo's face.
- Give them another chance.

457
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,210
- My goodness.
- It gets hard when you sit here.

458
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,420
- I'm serious.
- It wasn't a real game, was it?

459
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,710
So all members are changed?

460
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,190
- We have no other choice.
- Yes, all members are changed.

461
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,850
- All right.
- Let's all change seats.

462
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,060
The top club gets 200 dollars.

463
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,450
(The top club gets 200 dollars.
The bottom club gets 100 dollars.)

464
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,090
We should increase
the amount of our money.

465
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,030
- We'll get double this time.
- Be quiet if you're not paying.

466
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,860
We can get double,
so we should pay a lot.

467
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,070
We'll get double.

468
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,730
- This time...
- All right.

469
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,960
(Even if you pay only a little,
you get one-sixth of the total.)

470
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,810
- We'll get double this time.
- Let's do it right.

471
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,140
- Seriously.
- You won't pay much, right?

472
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,700
No, I'm going to turn in all.

473
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,570
I'm serious this time.
We can double it.

474
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,520
Let's do it right. We should...

475
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,870
(Kwang Soo goes up first
to pay for the lodge money.)

476
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,610
Here it is.

477
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,150
You can't look.

478
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,610
What are you doing?

479
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,760
Wait.

480
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,390
What are you doing there?

481
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,890
I can't just say it?
I should turn in the money?

482
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,120
I'm sure So Yeon
will be smart this time.

483
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,820
(They're not revealing
how much Kwang Soo gave.)

484
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,530
Honestly, guys. Come here.

485
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,800
Let's be honest.

486
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,900
- How much did you turn in?
- 150 dollars.

487
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,200
- Come on.
- I gave 150 dollars.

488
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,410
Don't lie to me.

489
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,970
Then let's turn in 100 dollars each.
We can do that, can't we?

490
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,600
- You can turn in 100 dollars, no?
- So Min, turn in 100 dollars.

491
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,570
100 dollars.

492
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,920
- Okay, go turn in the money.
- So Min, go.

493
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,610
You'll have many thoughts
on your way there.

494
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,050
- But don't think too hard.
- So Min, just go.

495
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,080
- You'll struggle, but...
- I'll hold this for you.

496
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,580
You should overcome it.

497
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,580
Just take three steps.

498
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,590
Don't think about anything
on your way here.

499
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,190
Come on, So Min.
Go turn in the money.

500
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,590
This is an individual race
after all.

501
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,090
It isn't the first time
they betrayed you.

502
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,320
(Encouraging her to betray them)

503
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,170
So Min, don't open the envelope.

504
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,300
I'm not opening it.

505
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,770
I'm really not going to open it.

506
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,460
I didn't open it.
I just gave the money.

507
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,810
Okay, 10 bills.

508
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,600
(Se Chan, Suk Jin, and Jae Suk
paid for the lodge money.)

509
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,940
They really turned it in.

510
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,570
(It's So Yeon's turn
to turn in her money.)

511
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,790
(At the first gathering,)

512
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:34,110
(she trusted the other members
and turned in all her money.)

513
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,650
It's 170 dollars.

514
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,820
(And she got betrayed.)

515
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,270
(So Yeon experienced the heinous
universe of Running Man.)

516
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,700
(If she still trusts them,
she will turn in 100 dollars again.)

517
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,930
(So Yeon turns in 50 dollars.)

518
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,980
(She turned in only 50 dollars
instead of 100.)

519
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,070
So Yeon, did you
turn in 100 dollars?

520
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,570
(The members' betrayal
has rubbed off on So Yeon.)

521
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,400
- We get 100 dollars, right?
- So it's 600 dollars in total.

522
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,320
Let's turn in 100 dollars each.

523
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,750
Then we will get 200 dollars each.

524
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,490
We have to watch Do Kwon
carefully as he turns around.

525
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,520
No, Do Kwon. Make sure
to turn in all your money.

526
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,410
This is an individual race
after all.

527
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,320
Do Kwon, this is
an individual race after all.

528
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,350
We should win.

529
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,530
- I'm not feeling good.
- All right.

530
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,660
Here.

531
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,890
The results are in.

532
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

533
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,270
- The top club...
- It should be more than 600.

534
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,360
- I guess...
- It's at least 600.

535
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,900
It should be at least 500 dollars.

536
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,930
Good.

537
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,240
We're the top club.

538
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,070
- The top club has gathered...
- It should be at least 500 dollars.

539
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,810
(What's the amount of the gathering
fee from the top club?)

540
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,870
170 dollars.

541
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,910
(170 dollars)

542
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,610
- I can't believe this.
- It's just like before.

543
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,450
- You guys are unbelievable.
- It's the same as before.

544
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,580
It doesn't matter whether we're
in the top club or the bottom club.

545
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,610
170 dollars.

546
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,880
(Even So Yeon who betrayed the
members is surprised to hear that.)

547
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,560
(Unbelievable)

548
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,230
Our team is really...

549
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,360
- Hey.
- We're in the top club now.

550
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,090
- Hey, this is...
- They gathered over 1,000 dollars!

551
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,570
(What's wrong with them?)

552
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,070
- They are so funny.
- Did So Yeon pay 100 dollars again?

553
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,310
How could it be 170 dollars again?

554
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,870
Look at your face.

555
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,840
You seem really upset.

556
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,250
- All of you look the same.
- Hey.

557
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,480
- Except me...
- I turned in 100 dollars.

558
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,720
The 5 of you turned in
70 dollars in total.

559
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,180
You guys are unbelievable.

560
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,880
You know what?
I really turned in 100 dollars.

561
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,820
- I turned in 100.
- That's enough.

562
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,030
I thought they would pay this time.

563
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,030
Hey, So Min. I got it.

564
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,960
They all say they paid.

565
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,700
- My gosh.
- What's wrong, So Yeon?

566
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,090
- What's wrong?
- You guys are so mean.

567
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,770
- My goodness.
- I told you, So Yeon.

568
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,360
We have the worst members
on this team.

569
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,400
- But you guys are unbelievable.
- So Yeon...

570
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,310
So we will double the amount
and divide it by six.

571
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,870
You get 60 dollars each.

572
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,100
(They get 60 dollars each.)

573
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,820
We're getting extra money anyway.

574
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,290
Whether I turn in 100 or 200,

575
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,550
I get the same amount of money.

576
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,910
It's always the same.

577
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,790
- It never changes.
- You should make it big.

578
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,060
- This is funny.
- We can't make it big with 60.

579
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,120
My gosh.

580
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,620
It's the bottom club now.

581
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,300
- They got 100 dollars each.
- 100 dollars each.

582
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,200
We all promised
we'd turn in all we have.

583
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,890
- I won't let it slide.
- There are six members.

584
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,540
- It's 600 dollars.
- It should be 600 dollars.

585
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,100
- The amount gathered is...
- It has to be 600.

586
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,570
(The amount gathered is...)

587
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,600
600 dollars.

588
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,480
Hey, look at that.

589
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,100
The bottom club
gathered 600 dollars.

590
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,900
So you will get 200 dollars each.

591
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,280
- Yes.
- Well done.

592
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,720
- So they got more money than us.
- It was a good plan.

593
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,410
(I hate you.)

594
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,680
It will be hard for them
to restore faith in each other.

595
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,020
It will be hard for them.

596
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,230
So whether we're in the top club
or the bottom club doesn't matter.

597
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,030
It's good that
the members aren't mixed up.

598
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,230
- I'm so glad.
- It's better this way.

599
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,820
(Current Amount of Gathering Fee)

600
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,000
Now it's time to eat lunch
at your clubhouse.

601
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,310
At the clubhouse,
you will find something...

602
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,510
that might help you
get into the penthouse.

603
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,780
Please make sure to look for it.

604
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

605
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,640
I'm eating instant noodles,
but I feel good.

606
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,320
- My gosh.
- I really turned in 100 dollars.

607
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,050
(The luxurious house
for the top club)

608
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,410
(There are various kinds
of snacks in the neat house.)

609
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,120
Gosh, the fridge is full of food.

610
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,650
(Their lunch is Korean beef
cooked by a chef.)

611
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,850
(In the front yard
of the top clubhouse,)

612
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,390
(there are 4 SUVs
with special settings.)

613
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,000
(Unlike the well-equipped
top clubhouse,)

614
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,270
(the bottom clubhouse is...)

615
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,510
(empty.)

616
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,870
(There are only a few
cup noodles in an empty tent.)

617
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,050
This is the 200 dollars you earned.

618
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,820
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

619
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,840
- All right then.
- Unless we betray each other,

620
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,250
- things will go smoothly.
- It's really nice.

621
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,550
This is thick.

622
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,990
- I know.
- This is so good.

623
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,320
Can we eat cup noodles now?

624
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,410
You don't have
enough cup noodles now.

625
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,080
- What?
- You have only three.

626
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,490
(What did you say?)

627
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,620
We need at least six.

628
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,960
The top club has a lot.

629
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,970
So you should go ask them for food.

630
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,590
- I see.
- Or...

631
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,300
- They will never give us food.
- We should bring five more.

632
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,000
We should give these two
to our guests.

633
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,040
No, it's okay.

634
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,160
- No, it's okay.
- Please. This is for you.

635
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,600
- Why would you give it to Do Kwon?
- I'm not giving it to Do Kwon.

636
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,980
This isn't for him.

637
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,980
I'm not giving it to Do Kwon.

638
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,550
(Aren't I a guest here?)

639
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,550
Why would I give it to Do Kwon?

640
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,550
Let's give this to Ji Hyo
since she's a girl.

641
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,410
- And the men will go get food.
- You're so cool.

642
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,790
Jong Kook, it's better to send
the three women.

643
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,290
- You think?
- Yes.

644
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,530
Then let's just stay here and...

645
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,120
Can we share these together?

646
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
Ji Ah, you've never begged
for food in your life, right?

647
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,730
I'm really sorry, but you should...

648
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,030
bring these with you.

649
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,090
To get some meat.

650
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,360
They might have some plates there,
but just in case.

651
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,980
- Should we go there...
- Do Kwon. You got the money.

652
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,100
- So you should...
- You should go too.

653
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,870
Think about what you did to us.
You should go get some food.

654
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,450
- That's what I can do.
- Okay.

655
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,070
- He took it right away.
- You should go there...

656
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,820
and get three cup noodles
and some meat.

657
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,950
I'm so hungry, Se Chan.

658
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,560
- Come here, So Yeon. So Min.
- Okay.

659
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,120
The meat is so juicy.

660
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,350
Let me try the meat.
So Yeon, have some.

661
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,650
The meat tastes so good.

662
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,700
(The top club enjoys
their luxurious meal.)

663
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,730
The meat is really good.
Who cooked it?

664
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,330
Some chefs cooked it outside.

665
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,770
- Chefs?
- Are there chefs?

666
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,710
- Yes.
- Did they bring in chefs?

667
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,510
(The members who fit the bottom
club better are enjoying the food.)

668
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,810
- It's good, isn't it?
- It is.

669
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,310
By the way, Suk Jin,
did you take off your shoes...

670
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,780
to get in here?

671
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,140
Why?

672
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,520
(It's a filming set,
but he took off his shoes.)

673
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,450
We all are wearing shoes.

674
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,560
But you took off your shoes.

675
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,120
- Hey.
- He's not wearing shoes.

676
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,730
Why are you wearing shoes here?

677
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,080
So Yeon got in here
with her shoes on,

678
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,820
but she took them off
after seeing your feet.

679
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,360
(A while ago)

680
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,160
Should I take off my shoes?

681
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,540
(As Suk Jin takes off his shoes...)

682
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,360
What? Did they take off their shoes?

683
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,510
(She placed her shoes neatly
next to Suk Jin's.)

684
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,130
(Their shoes are
outside the carpet.)

685
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,640
This isn't a real house.

686
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,980
I just took them off
because of the carpet.

687
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,250
I think he's totally
immersed in our show.

688
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,180
If you get him a set,

689
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,350
he can actually live in it.

690
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,320
- Excuse me.
- You guys are eating already.

691
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,490
Did you eat cup noodles?

692
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,590
- We have only 3.
- We got only 3 servings.

693
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,800
- Really?
- It's 50 dollars per serving.

694
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,500
What are you talking about?

695
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,970
- You should pay.
- Right. Give us some money.

696
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,360
It's 50 dollars per serving.

697
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,430
(I'll give you this!)

698
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,740
(So Yeon shows a warm spirit
of comradeship among the frauds.)

699
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,750
- We should share it together.
- But we should...

700
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,010
What are you doing, So Yeon?
What are you doing now?

701
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,070
Oh Yoon Hee!

702
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,410
- What are you doing?
- Shim Su Ryeon.

703
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,450
- So Yeon.
- Ma Doo Ki.

704
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,520
(She holds out a plate
to her generous friend.)

705
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,560
So Yeon, you're...

706
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,460
Thank you.

707
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,730
- Hey.
- Can I get one ramyeon?

708
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,560
- Ramyeon.
- Oh, right. We need ramyeon.

709
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,730
- We need at least six.
- We... I know.

710
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,800
We need at least six.
I feel so miserable.

711
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,040
It's 10 dollars for 5 bowls of rice.

712
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,270
10 dollars
for 5 bowls of rice? Okay.

713
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,330
It's a deal. I'll buy
five bowls of rice.

714
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,600
I can spend 10 dollars for my team.

715
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,480
Do we really not get any food?

716
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,170
- Can't we eat?
- No.

717
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,610
I didn't even have breakfast
before coming here.

718
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,880
- I'm really hungry now.
- Hey, it shouldn't be too cheap.

719
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Ji Ah, so you should
give us some money.

720
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,520
We need 200 dollars for this.

721
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,120
- This is worth 200 dollars.
- Definitely.

722
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,530
- My gosh.
- It's 200 dollars.

723
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,350
- I'm hungry. This is too expensive.
- We're eating them off.

724
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,420
What are you doing?

725
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,970
- Thank you.
- What are you doing now?

726
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,120
- Hey!
- What was that?

727
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,160
- Thank you.
- What are you doing now?

728
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,090
(She picks up some meat...)

729
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,270
(and runs away!)

730
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,830
- Hey, Lee Ji Ah!
- What was that?

731
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,870
(She begs for food
and even steals it.)

732
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,170
- What was that?
- My gosh.

733
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,170
(She's doing so many
exciting things for the first time.)

734
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,980
Gosh, I can't open it.

735
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,110
- What was that?
- Shim Su Ryeon!

736
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,880
- She stole the food.
- What did Ji Ah just do?

737
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,610
- She stole it.
- Shim Su Ryeon.

738
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,850
- Did she take the food?
- She just swept it.

739
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,030
(Su Ryeon was faster than light
stealing the meat.)

740
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,700
My gosh. You guys did a good job.

741
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,920
I paid 20 dollars for this.

742
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,970
- Really?
- Yes.

743
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,000
And this is...

744
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,070
- I stole it.
- She stole it.

745
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,090
Well done.

746
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,700
Very good.

747
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,740
It must've been your first time
to steal something.

748
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,330
- She stole meat on our show.
- It's so funny.

749
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,930
Let's be honest.

750
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,780
- You got some money earlier.
- Bring it here.

751
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,310
- Let's gather the money together.
- I didn't get any money.

752
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,550
Just go bring the money.
This won't do.

753
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,250
Se Chan got 10 dollars.
We both got 10 dollars.

754
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,250
This is it.

755
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,020
- This is from Do Kwon.
- All right then.

756
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,410
We all should share it,
so turn in another 10 dollars.

757
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,180
(We all should share it,
so turn in another 10 dollars.)

758
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,150
- What? That sounds strange.
- 10 dollars.

759
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,200
- We should make it 60 dollars.
- We need 60 dollars.

760
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,160
- Turn in 10 dollars.
- It should be 60 dollars.

761
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,230
We should make it 60 dollars.

762
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,240
We all turned in 10 dollars each.

763
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,160
- How much is it now?
- Give me that.

764
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,270
- Why?
- Why did you get the money?

765
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,780
- I told you to turn in 10 dollars.
- I did.

766
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,330
Suk Jin, give me 10 dollars.

767
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,400
- Okay. I'll turn in 10 dollars.
- All right.

768
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,950
But why?

769
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,110
To make it a divisible amount.

770
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,180
Where's my money? What?

771
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,290
- Darn it.
- What?

772
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,790
Who is it?

773
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,890
- My goodness.
- You have no money?

774
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
- I can't believe this.
- Do you not have money?

775
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,000
You were wearing the bag.

776
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,090
Hey, who was that?

777
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,160
I didn't do it.

778
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,930
- Who did it?
- What?

779
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,660
- It's not me.
- I can't be on this team.

780
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,280
- This team...
- This is unbelievable.

781
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,430
My gosh.

782
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,010
- I didn't do it.
- Who did this?

783
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,340
How is this happening?
We're a team though.

784
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,080
Eat your meat and calm down.

785
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,840
- How...
- Do you not have any money?

786
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,380
Jae Suk, if he has no money,
he should be out.

787
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,820
If he can't pay the fee, he's out.

788
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,620
- Hang on.
- You have money here.

789
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,420
- You have.
- Just turn in your money.

790
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,460
- Turn it in.
- But this is...

791
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,530
(He lost most of his money
and has only a few bills left.)

792
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,540
(He lost about 300 dollars.)

793
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,660
- You have it there.
- You have some.

794
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,930
Darn it.

795
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,360
Who would take your money?

796
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,710
You're mistaken.

797
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,600
Who took my money?

798
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,010
- You have your money.
- Why would you slander others?

799
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,310
Here's 60 dollars
that you earned earlier.

800
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,070
- Oh, right. I forgot about that.
- Yes.

801
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,070
(They receive the lodge money
they earned.)

802
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,950
Who on earth did that? Hey.

803
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,220
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo, was it you?

804
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,910
- No. You were carrying the bag.
- Is my name written here?

805
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,110
When could I steal it?

806
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,110
- It wasn't me. Believe me.
- Why can't you look me in the eye?

807
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,110
I caught you trying to
steal his money.

808
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,730
- You heard me... Suk Jin.
- You were carrying it.

809
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,560
You heard what I said to So Min,
didn't you?

810
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,320
(While continuing
the meaningless interrogation...)

811
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,150
What about mine?

812
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,270
I gave all the envelopes.

813
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,930
- We all received the money.
- Give me my money.

814
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,000
- She just distributed the money.
- What are you doing?

815
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,040
- Gosh, seriously.
- What is wrong with him?

816
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,270
What is wrong with you?

817
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,600
- Who took two envelopes?
- I don't know what happened.

818
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,780
Who took two envelopes?

819
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,170
- Come on. Give me mine.
- Who did that? I took only one.

820
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,140
- It wasn't me. It wasn't me.
- Give me my money now.

821
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,220
- Who took all the envelopes?
- It really wasn't me.

822
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,880
- Who distributed the envelopes?
- "You brats."

823
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,180
- You brats. I won't let it slide.
- I can't believe this.

824
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,790
- Who on earth...
- Hey, listen.

825
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,920
Who took all the envelopes
right in front of everyone?

826
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,030
- That's impossible.
- Listen. I gave one for each.

827
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,300
- Who did that?
- How could you take it?

828
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,970
- Who took it?
- Hey.

829
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,300
(No one took it, but his money
disappeared like magic.)

830
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,330
(This is what really happened.)

831
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,970
(Se Chan took 4 envelopes!)

832
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,600
(Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
took 1 envelope each.)

833
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,660
(Se Chan gave 1 to So Min...)

834
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,540
(and 1 to So Yeon.)

835
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,280
(He put the 2 remaining envelopes
in his bag!)

836
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,520
(The protruding mouth thief
stole from the original thief.)

837
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,550
- And he received one, right?
- Just give him back his money.

838
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,720
So there should be four envelopes.

839
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,790
- How many do you have?
- Just give him his money.

840
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,990
- I have three.
- You should give it to him now.

841
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,320
Think of how old Suk Jin is.

842
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,520
- Hey, give it to him.
- Think of my age, seriously.

843
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,650
- I'm not even wearing shoes now.
- Suk Jin is...

844
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,820
- Darn it.
- He's... Listen.

845
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,850
He's the second oldest
after Immortal Chan Hee.

846
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,970
- And you guys...
- Give it to him now.

847
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,590
He's a legend.

848
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,300
- You guys...
- He's a legend.

849
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,630
Why won't you immerse yourselves
in your roles? You're wearing shoes.

850
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,710
We're shooting in an indoor set!

851
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,170
- Hold on. This is...
- Just give me my money now.

852
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,900
- Give me one dollar each.
- It wasn't me.

853
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,900
This is driving me crazy.

854
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,910
(The lunch break is over while
Suk Jin is looking for the thief.)

855
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,550
We'll begin the second missions
starting with the bottom club.

856
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,580
- Okay.
- Yes.

857
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,290
Before we begin, I think
we all should keep it together.

858
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,520
- Absolutely.
- We should really turn in money.

859
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,530
- You shouldn't steal others' money.
- Someone actually did that.

860
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,150
- Who stole it?
- Someone stole money?

861
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,500
Yes, it really happened.

862
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,700
Suk Jin's money he kept in his bag
disappeared.

863
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,130
While I was trying to figure out
who stole my money,

864
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,240
my share of the lodge money...

865
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,630
Do you know the only good thing...

866
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,270
- about being on our team?
- What is it?

867
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,710
You know that we steal from
and lie to each other, right?

868
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,280
But we never question each other
so persistently.

869
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,050
We give up before we find out
who did it.

870
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,170
- It's so great.
- We always...

871
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,320
The bottom club will be the 1st team
to complete the 2nd mission.

872
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

873
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,790
(1st, Eugene, 2nd, Lee Ji Ah,
3rd, Kim Jong Kook)

874
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,720
(4th, Song Ji Hyo, 5th, Haha,
6th, Ha Do Kwon)

875
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,150
I'll explain the rule of
the top club's last mission.

876
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,150
- Okay.
- Okay.

877
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,760
The top club's second mission is...

878
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,860
It's Dangerous Outside the Blanket.

879
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
It's dangerous indeed.

880
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,300
Each of the six of you will take
turns. Throw the blanket in the air,

881
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,040
and lie down under it properly
to succeed.

882
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,100
(It's a success if the blanket
covers more than 2-3rd of the body.)

883
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,040
- Each of us will do it?
- Yes.

884
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,070
Isn't it too easy?

885
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,170
- Your lower body must be covered.
- It sounds easy.

886
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,070
If you succeed 6 out of 10 times,
all of you will remain on the team.

887
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,520
- It sounds...
- I think we can do this.

888
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,820
- You'll be eliminated after that.
- I think we can do this.

889
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,910
It's okay if the feet are
outside the blanket, right?

890
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,950
No, the feet must be
under the blanket.

891
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,560
- The upper body is okay?
- Yes.

892
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,410
Your legs and belly must be
under the blanket.

893
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,320
- We can do this!
- Let's go!

894
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,560
- Let's all finish it at one try.
- Okay.

895
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,700
Let's complete the mission
in six attempts.

896
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,060
And we all submit 200 dollars.

897
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,390
Gosh, I'm so sick of it.
All right. Here we go.

898
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,240
Throw the blanket and follow it
to lie down.

899
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,600
- You know what I mean, right?
- Watching the blanket?

900
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,400
- Exactly.
- You'll watch how it moves?

901
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,600
- Would you be able to see it?
- Of course.

902
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,130
(- Would you be able to see it?
- Of course.)

903
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,210
You won't have enough time for that.

904
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,400
I'll have enough time.

905
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,220
- The blanket will fall fast.
- It's because you're weak.

906
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,550
- I can move fast, you know.
- Indeed.

907
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,410
I can move as fast as you can.

908
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,410
Even though I'm weak,
I'm not as weak as you are.

909
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,260
- It's because you're so weak.
- I can do as well as you do.

910
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,080
- I'm not as weak as you are.
- I can move fast.

911
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,460
- No. I'm much stronger than you.
- You're weaker than me.

912
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,500
Even though I'm weak,
I'm not as weak as you are.

913
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,090
- I can do as well as you.
- You're not as fast as me.

914
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,590
Here they go again.
It's like an online video.

915
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,700
Let's subscribe.

916
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,070
The blanket won't wait for you.

917
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,010
- No, but I'll make it wait.
- You can't move that fast.

918
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,310
- How are you going to do that?
- Here I go. Throw it high.

919
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,050
(Jae Suk, the 1st person to try
who boasts his speed)

920
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,900
The blanket should float.
Throw it lightly. That's good.

921
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,110
(Jae Suk threw
the blanket lightly.)

922
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,670
(Will he succeed
for the 1st time on his team?)

923
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,720
- He succeeded.
- Oh, no.

924
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,820
(Jae Suk failed.)

925
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,910
- It's dangerous outside of it.
- It's as not easy as it sounds.

926
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,410
- It doesn't seem easy.
- It's not so easy.

927
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,610
Gosh, it's not easy.

928
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,730
Should he have moved
toward the back a little?

929
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,320
- It moved in that direction.
- The position was wrong.

930
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,560
Kwang Soo, you must succeed.

931
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,590
The position was wrong.

932
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,150
(The speed enthusiast failed
in his 1st attempt.)

933
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,860
Don't lie on your belly.
You should lie on your back.

934
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,860
- Lie on your back while sliding.
- Exactly.

935
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,240
You should listen to him.

936
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,300
I'm so nervous.

937
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,160
The key is to make the blanket
fall straight down.

938
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,810
- Keep your head up.
- That's right.

939
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,900
Good. He's being cautious.

940
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,280
Kwang Soo, don't lie on your belly.

941
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
He'll lie on his back and cry
because he gets poked by his mic.

942
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,980
(He's moving the blanket
with care and affection.)

943
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,520
- That's good.
- Kwang Soo,

944
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,410
you look as if you're making a bed
for Zo In Sung.

945
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,050
(You look as if you're making a bed
for Zo In Sung.)

946
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,290
What... Hang on a second.

947
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,520
Why would you bring him up
when we're playing a game?

948
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,560
- That's what it looks like.
- Why would I make a bed for him?

949
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,080
You would do that for him
if you two go on a trip together.

950
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,420
- I wouldn't do that.
- Kwang Soo,

951
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,760
making a bed for In Sung...

952
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,000
- wouldn't be so embarrassing.
- Right. Do it for him.

953
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,770
- He didn't tell you to wash it.
- Right.

954
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,390
Think that In Sung is lying here,
and you're covering him...

955
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,240
- with that blanket.
- Why...

956
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,330
Understood? In Sung is lying here.
Cover him with the blanket.

957
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,240
- Sleep well, In Sung.
- That's good.

958
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,510
(He's on butler mode.)

959
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,710
Cover him with the blanket.
That's good.

960
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,710
He did it.

961
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,410
(Kwang Soo spread the blanket
carefully using his imagination.)

962
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,520
(Will he succeed
thanks to the imagination?)

963
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,520
(He threw the blanket well.)

964
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,820
(And he lied down quickly.)

965
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,410
(His feet are outside the blanket.)

966
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,820
Did you see that?

967
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,820
- Your feet should be covered.
- It's because he has long legs.

968
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,530
It's because he's tall.
His head is right here.

969
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,120
- His feet should be covered too?
- It's because he's tall.

970
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,090
- The blanket is too small.
- What kind of rule is that?

971
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,970
But you did a good job because you
thought In Sung was here.

972
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,700
- I'll go next. I'll do it.
- What a shame.

973
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,090
- So Min.
- Suk Jin... Okay.

974
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,710
Good. That's how it should be done.

975
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,710
You should make it float high. Yes.

976
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,280
- Go under it quickly.
- She did it.

977
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,600
(So Min threw it boldly
and rushed under it.)

978
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,050
- He almost succeeded.
- She did it.

979
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,450
(Plopping down)

980
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,340
(She's lying on the floor
without the blanket over her body.)

981
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,410
- So Min, you might catch a cold.
- Good job.

982
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,350
- Great job.
- Cover yourself with the blanket.

983
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,260
- You did well.
- Good job.

984
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,890
- Good job.
- I've been saved.

985
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,000
- Many of us will move to that team.
- That was funny.

986
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,160
- My gosh.
- It was going well.

987
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,540
At least 1 or 2 of us
should be out of our team.

988
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,660
- I agree.
- Some of us should be eliminated.

989
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,330
- We should change members.
- He almost succeeded.

990
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,130
- It's So Yeon's turn now.
- She'll do well.

991
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,170
I'll give it a try!

992
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,210
- I have a feeling she'll succeed.
- I'll give it a try!

993
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,980
(Will she be able to succeed
unlike the other members?)

994
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,280
(So Yeon gives it a try.)

995
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,750
I have a feeling
that she'll succeed.

996
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,720
(Giggling)

997
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,220
(She slipped
while standing on the same spot.)

998
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,460
- What just happened?
- Wait.

999
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,990
- Wait.
- That doesn't count.

1000
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,700
- That doesn't count as an attempt.
- She didn't start.

1001
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,000
- That doesn't count.
- She didn't start.

1002
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,120
- Jong Kook, please.
- What did you do?

1003
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,270
- So Yeon, what happened?
- That doesn't count.

1004
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,130
Why? So Yeon, did you slip?

1005
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,390
- She didn't start.
- She'll do it now.

1006
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,010
- She slipped.
- Obviously, that wasn't an attempt.

1007
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,630
- She slipped. It's okay.
- Listen.

1008
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,210
- You slipped, right?
- I was so surprised.

1009
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,870
- She was surprised.
- Let's ask her.

1010
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,250
I'll ask her. So Yeon,
did you start or not?

1011
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,070
- I... I didn't start.
- That's right.

1012
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,250
- She didn't start.
- You can start now.

1013
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,910
She didn't start.
She was surprised too.

1014
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,880
- The blanket slipped off her hands.
- That's right.

1015
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,790
- She dropped it.
- It's because she was taken aback.

1016
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,760
- We'll give her another chance.
- Thank you.

1017
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,080
- It's understandable.
- Yes.

1018
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,560
- So Yeon, you should go under it.
- You're doing well.

1019
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,650
- I'll give it a try now.
- Okay.

1020
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,920
- Okay. Good.
- So Yeon, go under it.

1021
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,150
Go under the blanket. Go.

1022
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,860
My goodness.

1023
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,070
(Sitting straight down)

1024
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,070
- My goodness.
- No. That's not how you do it.

1025
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,800
(Dumbfounded)

1026
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,600
- So Yeon, listen.
- Is she serious?

1027
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,800
- Put your head on this side.
- You see...

1028
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,780
- Your head should be on this side.
- This is ridiculous.

1029
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,550
- You tried to do that, right?
- So Yeon, try one more time.

1030
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,010
She didn't lie down
when we told her to.

1031
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,410
She didn't play the recorder
when she was supposed to.

1032
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,890
- We'll give her 5 more chances.
- Try 1 more time.

1033
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,510
- We'll give her 5 more chances.
- Try just 1 more time.

1034
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,890
- So Yeon, try again.
- Gosh.

1035
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,510
It's not that she's not good at it.
She doesn't understand the rule.

1036
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,720
- Your head should be on this side.
- So Yeon, you should...

1037
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,330
- Why can't I...
- move forward. That'd be better.

1038
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,030
- I see. Then I throw the blanket,
- You should go under it.

1039
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,700
go to this side, and lie down
like this...

1040
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,240
- No, no. That's not it.
- You should just...

1041
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,530
- And lie down like this...
- No, no.

1042
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,010
- You can lie on your belly too.
- Just lie down like this.

1043
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
- So Yeon, that's how it's done.
- You can do that too.

1044
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,510
Go under the blanket.

1045
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,410
- Lie on your belly.
- Right. Lie on your belly.

1046
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,580
Like diving.

1047
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,450
(Rushing forward)

1048
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,450
My gosh.

1049
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,780
(Like this?)

1050
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,640
So Yeon. So Yeon.

1051
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,620
Go back. You should say you'll
start before you begin.

1052
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,990
Say you'll start
before you begin, okay?

1053
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,620
- So Yeon, it was okay.
- It's okay.

1054
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,760
Say you'll start before you begin.

1055
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,700
- I don't know how to do it.
- You did well.

1056
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,800
- Just lie down.
- You should lie on the floor.

1057
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
- With your head on the pillow.
- Exactly.

1058
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,390
- This bag is so uncomfortable.
- That's good.

1059
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,390
(The magic to summon thieves)

1060
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,100
- No, no.
- This bag is so uncomfortable.

1061
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,970
(So Yeon runs to the staff
avoiding the thieves.)

1062
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,010
Please watch my bag.

1063
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,600
- You can put it there.
- Okay.

1064
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,780
So Yeon, I think you should
carry your bag.

1065
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,120
- I can't.
- In front of the camera...

1066
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,320
- You would steal it anyway.
- The last attempt. Say, "Start".

1067
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
I'll start.

1068
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,550
She made it.

1069
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,410
- What?
- I can't see her.

1070
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,430
- What's going on?
- Where did she go?

1071
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,550
(1 of the tiger moths gets excited
as So Yeon is under the blanket.)

1072
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,120
(She's stealing
a mission fund envelope quickly.)

1073
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,300
- That's crazy.
- She might think we did that.

1074
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,760
- Look what So Min is doing.
- Look at her.

1075
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,100
- What? Hey!
- Look what So Min is doing.

1076
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,990
Hey! I mean, excuse me.

1077
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,600
- Wait. Stop. That's my money.
- Gosh, seriously.

1078
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,030
- Goodness gracious.
- That's funny.

1079
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,430
My goodness. I can't believe this.

1080
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,680
(So Yeon found her bag with her
triple combination reaction.)

1081
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,280
Five members.

1082
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,720
- 5 of you should be replaced.
- 5 members?

1083
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,180
If five members should be replaced,

1084
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,990
So Yeon should remain on the team.
Okay.

1085
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,010
- Do Kwon.
- Let's go.

1086
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,720
Finally, we eliminated Do Kwon.
Good riddance.

1087
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,620
I think Do Kwon will
complete our team.

1088
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,660
I belong to this team.

1089
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,700
(He thinks
he belongs to the other team too.)

1090
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,220
I belong to this team.

1091
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,300
I can't believe we all are
on the same team.

1092
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,530
All the trustworthy people
gathered this time.

1093
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,740
- Let's increase our mission funds.
- Welcome, So Yeon.

1094
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,300
I can't believe we all are
on the same team.

1095
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,330
I ended up
being Jong Kook's enemy again.

1096
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,600
Let's all turn the full amount in
this time.

1097
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
- Okay.
- Kwang Soo.

1098
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,780
- Suk Jin, turn in all the money.
- Okay. I'll do that.

1099
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,140
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1100
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,140
If we don't turn the full amount in,
we won't be able to win.

1101
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,350
We must increase our mission funds
because they have more money.

1102
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,220
Let's all turn the whole envelope in
this time.

1103
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
- Or else, we can't win.
- We can't turn the game around.

1104
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,320
We should turn all the money in.

1105
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,220
Don't be greedy and turn it in.

1106
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,930
- Let's turn it in.
- Let's do that.

1107
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,760
All right. I'll announce the amount
of the top club.

1108
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,100
- Our team?
- Yes.

1109
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,700
I hope someone on that team
betrayed the others.

1110
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,260
Each member received 200 dollars.

1111
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,160
The total amount of money
you turned in is...

1112
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,140
- 1,200 dollars.
- Okay!

1113
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,760
(They turned 1,200 dollars in.)

1114
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,640
That's perfect.

1115
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,010
- Without Do Kwon here...
- Nice.

1116
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,010
So this is how it feels.

1117
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,370
She said, "So this is how it feels."

1118
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,780
How much did we collect?

1119
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,850
- You each received 100 dollars.
- Right.

1120
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,350
- The total would be 600 dollars.
- Exactly.

1121
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,850
Please...

1122
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,760
You collected 130 dollars.

1123
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,280
- What?
- 130 dollars?

1124
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,450
(The bottom club
only has 130 dollars?)

1125
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,930
- What?
- 130 dollars?

1126
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,390
But I handed in 100 dollars.

1127
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,390
- You guys are awful.
- I handed in 100 dollars.

1128
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,200
- Suk Jin...
- I'm telling the truth.

1129
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,390
- I handed in 100 dollars.
- No, I did.

1130
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,470
I handed in the entire envelope.

1131
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,470
I did too.

1132
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,600
You won't be able
to win that way though.

1133
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,640
It's more than I thought.

1134
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,780
I'm guessing that
everyone handed in...

1135
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,300
about a dollar or two.

1136
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Do Kwon must've paid up.

1137
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,350
I doubt it.

1138
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,950
The top club receives
400 dollars each...

1139
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,410
while the bottom club
receives 40 dollars each.

1140
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,680
(400 dollars each for the top club,
40 dollars each for the bottom club)

1141
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,220
Nice.

1142
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,620
That's more than I thought
the bottom club would collect.

1143
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,830
Shortly, the briefing session
for residency...

1144
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,680
regarding the move to the penthouse
will begin.

1145
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,990
You are all to attend it...

1146
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,490
after a short break
at your respective lounges.

1147
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,660
Okay!

1148
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,070
(Who will get to move
into the penthouse?)

1149
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,640
This is the worst.

1150
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,300
We're on a different level
with the other club.

1151
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,080
(The clubs get to enjoy a break.)

1152
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,740
It's so cool that
we all stuck together.

1153
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,700
I'm curious as to how much I have.

1154
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,280
I don't know how this money
will come into play,

1155
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,080
but we each have a hefty amount.

1156
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,180
I love the proud expression
Ji Ah holds...

1157
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,660
when counting her money.

1158
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,280
- Her fake money.
- Right, her fake money.

1159
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,390
- She absolutely loves it.
- She's so different from...

1160
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,530
when we met her in the beginning
of the show.

1161
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,390
(She shows off her fake money.)

1162
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,030
(It wasn't easy to earn
amidst the hyenas.)

1163
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,100
She's showing off.

1164
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,330
There really is a lot.
It'll take a while to count.

1165
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,930
(Quietly, they all
count their money.)

1166
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,930
Look at you all
cherishing your fake money.

1167
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,470
It's useless at home, but still.

1168
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,280
It's just paper once filming ends.

1169
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,140
(At this moment though,
they couldn't be happier.)

1170
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,780
The other club won
at least 300 dollars each.

1171
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,950
Darn it.

1172
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,320
It doesn't matter though...

1173
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,080
- because only four get to win.
- The others will receive a penalty.

1174
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,200
(Glancing)

1175
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,390
(Jae Suk keeps
glancing to the side.)

1176
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,140
(Boxes in the corner)

1177
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,800
(They heard of items in the lounge
that could help them win.)

1178
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,410
(Those boxes were there
since lunch.)

1179
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,240
(Eugene was also
suspicious of them at one point.)

1180
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,510
Hold on.

1181
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,280
I'm starving. Se Chan?

1182
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,450
- I want a latte.
- A latte?

1183
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,050
(Jae Suk spotted the same boxes
in the top club lounge as well.)

1184
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,550
(Will those boxes
help them get into the penthouse?)

1185
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,390
What are these?

1186
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,990
What are those?

1187
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,120
(Something's on them.)

1188
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,160
They're empty boxes.

1189
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,330
(He chooses to lie for now.)

1190
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,890
(He then hides one in his jacket.)

1191
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,030
(Jae Suk discreetly
brings out a box...)

1192
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,030
(that obviously seems
like a clue to the race.)

1193
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,080
(What is the box
that Jae Suk spotted?)

1194
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,080
A cell phone for
the penthouse resident.

1195
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,410
(A box sent from the penthouse?)

1196
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,450
(He urgently opens the box.)

1197
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,390
(In the box are 3 phones
for penthouse residents.)

1198
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,510
What's this?

1199
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,830
(In the box are 3 phones
for penthouse residents.)

1200
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,160
"Bring two others
to the waiting room."

1201
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,260
(The 3 of you must come discreetly
with these phones.)

1202
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,370
(He's to form a group of 3
and go to the waiting room.)

1203
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:37,010
(He must bring 2 members
without the others knowing.)

1204
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,700
Where is everyone?

1205
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,470
- Our team's a mess.
- Right?

1206
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,470
- You don't have enough money.
- Right.

1207
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,800
- So why don't you...
- Hey.

1208
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,680
If someone was to use yours...
My gosh.

1209
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,870
- What is it?
- Let's go.

1210
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,220
- Where?
- There's no time. Hurry.

1211
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,490
- Where are we going?
- Hurry up.

1212
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,620
Why? What is it?

1213
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,820
(He runs off without explaining.)

1214
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,680
(Kwang Soo)

1215
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,760
Jae Suk?

1216
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,720
(Kwang Soo spots
the 3 of them running.)

1217
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,530
(So Min sees them too.)

1218
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,160
Give me the money.

1219
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,370
(The 3 enter,
heads filled with doubt.)

1220
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:05,390
Give me the money.

1221
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,470
I want the money.

1222
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,990
- You can't.
- Give me the money, Jae Suk.

1223
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,010
Can you stay outside?

1224
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,030
- The money...
- Me too?

1225
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,330
- Just a second.
- I just want the money.

1226
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,510
What's this about?

1227
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,640
- I...
- What's going on?

1228
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,740
I just...

1229
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,080
- What's going on?
- Let me close the door for now.

1230
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,550
- Guys...
- You'll go next.

1231
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,720
- Next...
- You'll get your turn next.

1232
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,450
(What secret lies
within this container?)

1233
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,350
- What's going on?
- Congratulations.

1234
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,120
- Lock the door.
- Just a second.

1235
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,350
Did he just congratulate us?

1236
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:29,180
You see... Guys, hold on a second.

1237
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,160
What on earth?

1238
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,530
(While the staff tried
frantically to get inside...)

1239
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,700
Guys, hold on a second.

1240
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,930
(Cameraman Kwang Soo
entered without permission.)

1241
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,200
What on earth?

1242
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:41,600
Seriously?

1243
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,740
- You...
- Why?

1244
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,600
- Get out!
- What is this about?

1245
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,700
- But...
- Get out!

1246
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,700
- Get out!
- I had no idea.

1247
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,200
My gosh.

1248
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,550
- Get out.
- Get out!

1249
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,140
(Kwang Soo's left with a camera
and unresolved questions.)

1250
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,890
There was something on the door.

1251
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,620
- What's this?
- Here.

1252
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,180
Congratulations. You found the key
that is needed for the final race.

1253
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:05,530
The final race will take place
in another location.

1254
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:08,030
In order to compete,
you must go there...

1255
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,430
and submit your application.

1256
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,890
- Just the application?
- Yes.

1257
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,600
You will now be given access...

1258
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,470
to a digital key.

1259
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,030
You must work together
in order to get to the location.

1260
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,180
What you'll have access to
will be chosen randomly.

1261
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,300
You've got to be kidding me.

1262
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,140
(The 3 commands provided are
unlocking the doors,)

1263
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:31,550
(starting the car,)

1264
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:36,080
(and opening the trunk.)

1265
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,620
They will be chosen randomly.

1266
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,050
We'll each receive
access to something.

1267
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,700
Each envelope...

1268
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,200
contains a different command.

1269
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,260
Choose one each...

1270
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,890
and show me.

1271
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,470
- Can we take a look?
- Sure.

1272
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,570
I can start the car.

1273
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:53,370
Then, I'll give Jae Suk
access first.

1274
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,330
- Can't you just leave us?
- What's going on?

1275
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,470
(The two tiger moths barge in.)

1276
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,550
What is this all about?

1277
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:01,620
- Get out.
- Get out for now.

1278
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,010
- It's in turns. We go first.
- Get out for now.

1279
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,410
- What do you mean?
- Just leave for now.

1280
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,320
- You three can come back.
- You three can be a team.

1281
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,010
- The three of you are next.
- Right.

1282
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,780
We all get our turns.

1283
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,030
- Can you close the door?
- Get out.

1284
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,760
- Let me give you access.
- What did you get?

1285
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,830
I can start the car.

1286
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,070
I can unlock the doors.

1287
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,260
I can open the trunk.

1288
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,700
I'll first give Jae Suk access
to the car ignition switch.

1289
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:23,370
- Is this a digital key?
- Yes, let me send give you access.

1290
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:24,510
Can this really be done?

1291
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,530
- What on earth?
- From our smartphones?

1292
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:29,080
(Access will be granted
to the 3 smartphones in the box.)

1293
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,600
I get it now.

1294
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,410
You'll start the car,

1295
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,140
- I'll open the door and...
- What about the trunk?

1296
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,010
There must be something in it.

1297
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,680
Jae Suk, you'll be allowed
to start the car.

1298
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,550
- Is this really possible?
- It's done.

1299
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,700
You can start the car
using that phone.

1300
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,050
I get to unlock the doors.

1301
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,870
Suk Jin, you have been
given access to the door lock.

1302
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:53,930
I got the access.

1303
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,430
I get to open the trunk.

1304
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,240
(Suk Jin can unlock the door
and Se Chan can open the trunk.)

1305
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,030
You have each been given access.

1306
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,780
For your information,
the location of the race...

1307
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,370
can be found in the trunk.

1308
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,700
- Then let's go.
- Only the one who can open it...

1309
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,640
will be able to check the address.

1310
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,820
- We'll each play our role.
- Let's go.

1311
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,580
(The 3 hurry out.)

1312
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,850
(Jae Suk, Suk Jin, and Se Chan
take the first car.)

1313
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,490
Team up with the others.

1314
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,550
- Go in there.
- Get what you need in there.

1315
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,990
Team up with the others.
Go in there.

1316
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,370
(Kwang Soo goes with them.)

1317
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,390
(What's going on?)

1318
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,930
Kwang Soo, you're not with us.

1319
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,890
- Kwang Soo!
- You're not to join us.

1320
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,600
Hurry up and team up with the rest.

1321
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,910
- Why?
- Get what you need.

1322
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,370
- Let's go.
- You need access.

1323
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,300
No, you can't.

1324
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:37,010
You should get your own.

1325
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,080
Kwang Soo.

1326
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,280
- Hurry up.
- Get your own phone.

1327
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,970
Don't ruin the advertisement
unless you'll pay up yourself!

1328
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,350
(Kwang Soo isn't allowed
to access the car.)

1329
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,010
- Unlock the door.
- How do I do it?

1330
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,080
This must be it.

1331
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,950
Yes, that. Okay, we're good.

1332
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,950
Get going. I'll start the car.

1333
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:54,050
Do it.

1334
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,830
(He opens the trunk.)

1335
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,030
- I got it.
- You did?

1336
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,870
- Where's the location?
- I'll get in the car.

1337
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,640
Now, start the car.

1338
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,070
(Jae Suk gets the car running.)

1339
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,330
- We're good.
- It's done.

1340
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,830
Ilsanseo-gu, Goyang,
Gyeonggi Province.

1341
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,850
(They manage to get in the car
by teaming up.)

1342
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,870
Ilsanseo-gu, Goyang,
Gyeonggi Province.

1343
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,140
- I'll get going for now.
- Sure.

1344
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,950
We got lucky.

1345
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,490
- Because we...
- I happened to run into you two.

1346
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,780
Will there be a mission
at the location?

1347
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,910
- Probably.
- Right.

1348
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:23,450
Getting there first
will give us an advantage.

1349
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,120
(What'll be the final race
that they'll face?)

1350
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,700
I wouldn't have known
had it not been for Jae Suk.

1351
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,850
- I know.
- Goyang.

1352
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,800
What's going on?

1353
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,700
I was on my way back
from the restroom.

1354
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,100
You need to find the clue first.

1355
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,530
- The clue? Where?
- Yes.

1356
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:39,030
You need to meet
the conditions first.

1357
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,200
You must find the clue.

1358
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,200
That's not it.

1359
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,050
(She tries to reuse
the card the others left behind.)

1360
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,010
What...

1361
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,220
I mean...

1362
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:51,850
Are you kidding me?

1363
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,510
I mean...

1364
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,820
(Frustration sweeps over
those left behind.)

1365
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,930
We need to get in this car.

1366
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,450
I'm sure there's a hint somewhere.

1367
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:02,970
(The top club can't even hear
the commotion outside.)

1368
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:05,070
- There's a lot.
- We probably all have enough.

1369
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,660
(They're just satisfied
with what they earned.)

1370
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,510
(Kwang Soo enters.)

1371
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,700
Kwang Soo's here.

1372
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:13,240
Kwang Soo's here.

1373
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,430
- What's wrong?
- What's the matter?

1374
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,350
- What?
- You hid money here.

1375
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:18,550
- Did you hide your money here?
- No, that's not it...

1376
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,010
You must've hidden your money here.

1377
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,580
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

1378
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,850
Did you hide your money here?

1379
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,280
Did you hide your money here?

1380
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,910
- No, that's not it.
- Yes?

1381
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,010
Let me see. Then what?

1382
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,720
(What is he looking for?)

1383
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,350
The treasure hunt begins.

1384
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:34,990
- What's going on?
- What is it?

1385
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,260
What are you looking for?

1386
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,430
(The ladies of the top club
are still clueless.)

1387
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,030
(They've come to search for the clue
that's obviously here too.)

1388
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,410
Should we get looking too?

1389
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,330
Is something here?
What's he looking for?

1390
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,800
(Did he find the box?)

1391
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:55,850
(Jong Kook found...)

1392
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,640
(the delivery boxes!)

1393
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,430
(He takes all three
without getting caught.)

1394
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,490
(However...)

1395
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,350
(Kwang Soo finds him.)

1396
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,870
What am I supposed to do with these?

1397
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,570
What am I supposed to do?

1398
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,300
- Hold on.
- Give me that!

1399
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,600
(Kwang Soo manages to secure a box.)

1400
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,740
Kwang Soo...

1401
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,330
What on earth...

1402
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,510
What's going on?

1403
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,970
What is it? What's going on?

1404
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,100
Hold on a second.
What just happened?

1405
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,050
Why did Kwang Soo
take it away from me?

1406
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:28,410
Give it to me. What is it?

1407
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,890
I don't understand.

1408
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:34,050
I've been meaning to open this box.

1409
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:37,990
"Bring two others
to the waiting room."

1410
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,200
"Bring the phone in the box."

1411
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,450
"The three of you must come
discreetly with these phones."

1412
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,300
- To go there secretly...
- It's too late for that.

1413
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,570
- You already revealed it.
- I read it out loud. What do I do?

1414
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:47,970
"Bring two others..."

1415
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,410
What was that?
"Bring two others..."

1416
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:53,010
(He overheard the hidden mission
and became taken aback.)

1417
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,870
A box?

1418
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,080
- Let's hurry up and go.
- To where?

1419
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,140
Where is
the container waiting room?

1420
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,680
(The 3 actresses teamed up at once
thanks to Eugene.)

1421
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,120
Where is it?

1422
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,990
Where is the container?

1423
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:09,390
I think this is it.

1424
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,050
(The actresses entered
the container.)

1425
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,080
What is this?

1426
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,530
- Oh, my.
- Please close the door.

1427
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,620
Congratulations. You obtained
the keys for the final mission.

1428
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,600
We'll give the three of you
the access...

1429
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,430
to digital keys you'll need
to move to another location.

1430
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,160
- I see.
- "Unlock the doors".

1431
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,410
- "Open the trunk".
- Kim So Yeon.

1432
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,410
Okay. Thanks.

1433
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:26,780
What's this?

1434
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,640
They really don't tell us anything.

1435
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,850
Exactly. I mean,

1436
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,970
we could've done nothing
if we hadn't found this.

1437
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,370
True. We owe it all to you, Eugene.

1438
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:35,950
- We made it to this container.
- Thank you, Eugene.

1439
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,620
I wasn't thinking about anything
while eating jellies.

1440
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:39,950
I was eating cookies too.

1441
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,080
(Overwhelmingly excited)

1442
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,220
Now...

1443
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,330
(They use the access
to move to the final race location.)

1444
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,450
9.9km.

1445
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,370
Oh, wow. This is amazing.

1446
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:52,370
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo hasn't
teamed up yet.)

1447
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,740
- So Min...
- Don't bring her onto our team.

1448
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,600
Wouldn't it be better
if she was on our team?

1449
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,570
- Would it be better?
- Please take me with you.

1450
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,600
Wouldn't it be better with her?

1451
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,080
- Don't you think?
- So Min?

1452
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,030
Oh, with this?

1453
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,550
We can start the car
using this application?

1454
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,050
You can unlock the doors with this?

1455
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:07,850
- We don't need a key?
- I can open the trunk with this?

1456
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,740
I won't believe it
until I see it with my own eyes.

1457
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,450
When you're on Running Man,

1458
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:14,620
you must not trust anyone
to the last minute.

1459
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,490
You're not disappointed, right?

1460
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,660
Of course, I'm not.
I should get used to it.

1461
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,720
In the world
with people with one eye,

1462
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,450
- a person with two eyes is odd.
- Exactly.

1463
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,220
(Team Jae Suk, Team So Yeon,
Team So Min, Team Haha)

1464
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,660
The teams that left earlier
have an advantage.

1465
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,200
I think we left much earlier
than the other teams.

1466
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,740
I saw you as soon as I got out.
Suk Jin, you got so lucky.

1467
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,300
- I know, right?
- You were the first one I saw.

1468
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,240
We got so lucky.

1469
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,280
All the comedians gathered.

1470
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,890
- Exactly.
- You're right.

1471
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,050
- It's about time the comedians...
- We were the first team to leave.

1472
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,160
joined our forces.

1473
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,830
- Exactly.
- It's been a long time.

1474
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,930
Oh, right. We're the only comedians
among the cast members.

1475
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,490
- Exactly.
- I feel so confident with you two.

1476
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:54,830
I didn't realize that.

1477
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,570
By the way, I don't know
what we'll do later,

1478
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:01,740
- we don't have much money now.
- True.

1479
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,760
- We don't have much money.
- We can't beat the other teams.

1480
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,600
We can't beat them with our money.

1481
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,870
We just have to find the penthouse
before the other teams do, right?

1482
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:08,870
Yes.

1483
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,450
- This is it.
- Right. I see the camera.

1484
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,640
- We're here. Are we the first?
- We're the first to arrive.

1485
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,640
Okay. Let's go.

1486
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:16,580
(The application submission table
is right in front of them.)

1487
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,640
We're here.

1488
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,180
(They're rushing into the building
as the other teams are coming too.)

1489
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,760
(But at that moment)

1490
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,450
(Se Chan took off
Suk Jin's name tag.)

1491
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:28,330
Suk Jin, you can't move
for three minutes.

1492
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,390
Why did you do that?

1493
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,470
It wasn't like that.

1494
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,260
Why did you do that?

1495
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:36,140
- Hey.
- There was a hidden rule for me.

1496
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,030
(There was a hidden rule
for Se Chan?)

1497
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,580
Okay. It's open.

1498
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,700
(Se Chan opened the trunk
to check the address.)

1499
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,700
(He found 2 cards in the trunk!)

1500
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,140
(Only 2 of each team can submit
the application.)

1501
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,620
(Take off the name tag of 1 person
after you arrive at the location.)

1502
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,680
"Take off the name tag
of one person..."

1503
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,010
"after you arrive at the location."

1504
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,680
(Only the people in charge
of the trunk know about this rule.)

1505
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,890
(Se Chan read the address,
not the hidden mission card.)

1506
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:57,990
- That's it?
- Yes.

1507
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,660
Okay. We're ready.

1508
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,760
(Se Chan understood
the hidden mission at once.)

1509
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,120
(He distracted them saying
they should join their forces...)

1510
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:08,260
(while making a plan
to eliminate Suk Jin.)

1511
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,530
My gosh, Yangsebari.

1512
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:12,910
The hidden mission card was
in the trunk?

1513
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,080
I'll write down my name.

1514
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,970
Jae Suk and Se Chan,
you may move into the penthouse...

1515
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,120
40 minutes later.

1516
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,490
Two members on the team can
submit the application.

1517
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,820
And you may move
into the penthouse...

1518
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,450
exactly 40 minutes
after you submit the application.

1519
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:32,850
That means members from each team
will move in at different hours.

1520
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,530
However, if you try to enter
the penthouse...

1521
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,390
before the time comes,

1522
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:39,870
you may be eliminated
by the security guards.

1523
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:41,930
The four people
who enter the penthouse...

1524
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:45,030
at the right time
before the others will win.

1525
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,100
And the bottom four
among the ones who failed...

1526
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,530
to move into the penthouse will be
the candidates for the penalty.

1527
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,780
(The bottom 4 will be
the candidates for the penalty.)

1528
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,680
You can take off the name tag
of another member...

1529
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,470
to send the person to the prison.

1530
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,180
The person who is sent
to the prison...

1531
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:59,010
can revive using his or her
mission fund,

1532
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,820
but the move-in time will be
delayed 10 minutes.

1533
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,930
You can't revive if you don't have
enough mission fund,

1534
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,620
and you'll be eliminated
from the race.

1535
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,870
- Check the time on the clock.
- Yes.

1536
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,660
Write down
the time of submission too.

1537
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,490
5:57 p.m.

1538
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:18,300
(Jae Suk and Se Chan's move-in time
is 6:37 p.m.)

1539
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:21,080
- Three minutes have passed, right?
- Yes.

1540
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,140
I'll wait here.

1541
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,200
(He has no choice but to wait
for the next team to come.)

1542
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,280
Until someone arrives.

1543
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:29,180
- Where are we going in the dark?
- Exactly.

1544
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,640
I didn't know everyone would be
this enthusiastic.

1545
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,910
(She respects
their professionalism.)

1546
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,760
They all seemed so serious.

1547
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,080
All of them are so good at this.

1548
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,600
- I think you're the best, So Yeon.
- That's not true.

1549
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,160
I think you and Eugene are
better than me.

1550
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,700
Don't you think we've been doing...

1551
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,470
- a lot of unusually tiring things?
- I think so.

1552
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:50,760
I think so too.

1553
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,740
I feel like I'm going to faint.

1554
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,100
I'm mentally exhausted.

1555
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,370
(She feels like she'll get sick
in 5 seconds.)

1556
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:56,510
I feel like having a drink.

1557
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,640
(The true charm of Running Man,
it makes you crave alcohol.)

1558
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,050
I think I'll sleep deeply tonight.

1559
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,780
(They're on their way
while trying to keep it together.)

1560
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,010
Ji Ah, you shouldn't have
eaten those cookies earlier.

1561
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,550
- Cookies?
- Yes. The cookies you ate.

1562
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,850
- Oh, that.
- Could you turn off the music?

1563
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,180
- What?
- She asked to turn off the music.

1564
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,280
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1565
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,890
They must be listening to us.

1566
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,620
They must be listening to us.
That's scary.

1567
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,370
- Where are they?
- Oh, my. How?

1568
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:18,930
Oh, we're wearing microphones.

1569
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:21,300
Oh, I remember.
When I was on "We Got Married",

1570
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:24,010
there was always a van
in front of us whenever we drove.

1571
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,970
Are you saying they're watching us
in the van?

1572
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,080
I think that's the case.

1573
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,280
(Surprised)

1574
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,300
Hello.

1575
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,600
None of us knows anything
about a variety show.

1576
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,580
What should we do in the car?

1577
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,580
(They've been learning a lot
on Running Man.)

1578
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,680
(Meanwhile, Suk Jin is waiting
hopelessly.)

1579
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,120
One of them will take off
the name tag of someone else.

1580
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,830
So I can just take off that person's
name tag when he or she does that.

1581
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,800
(It's a keen analysis as he majored
in business management in college.)

1582
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,950
Please come out.
Yes, you can come out.

1583
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:50,660
- We're not shooting right now.
- Why haven't you been eliminated?

1584
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,970
- Pardon me?
- Why haven't you been eliminated?

1585
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,070
- I'll be out later.
- Really?

1586
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,260
I got eliminated and then revived.

1587
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:57,760
(Giggling)

1588
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,010
(While Suk Jin is meeting
his fans unexpectedly...)

1589
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:01,240
There they come. That's it.

1590
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,680
(They're arriving peacefully
without knowing what will happen.)

1591
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,700
Hey!

1592
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,780
- Hi.
- He must've recognized me.

1593
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,370
- He could've said hi to me.
- Who is he?

1594
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:11,410
He wants us to stop here?
He's one the cast members.

1595
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:14,260
(Suk Jin is approaching them
calmly.)

1596
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:15,660
The three of you came together.

1597
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,620
- Who started the car?
- I did.

1598
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,950
Who opened the trunk? You did?

1599
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,100
- What else?
- I opened the doors.

1600
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,700
- You opened the doors.
- Shouldn't we bring the phones too?

1601
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,970
We should bring our phones.

1602
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,700
(The signal is being transmitted.)

1603
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,970
(He's giving a signal to Eugene
who knows about the hidden mission.)

1604
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,330
(They exchanged signals secretly.)

1605
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:33,370
Let's go.

1606
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,800
You came later than I thought.

1607
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,550
- They told us to follow them.
- The traffic was bad.

1608
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,180
I used to come here
to shoot a drama.

1609
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,780
(Eugene, take off Ji Ah's name tag.)

1610
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,850
Ji Ah, you're very tired, right?

1611
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,760
- Here... I'm fine.
- You're very tired, right?

1612
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,550
- You want to go home, don't you?
- No.

1613
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,220
(Taking off the name tag)

1614
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,450
What's going on?

1615
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,470
(But Suk Jin eliminated Eugene
at the same time!)

1616
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:59,070
- What's going on?
- Come here. Hurry up.

1617
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,240
- Wait.
- You can come with me.

1618
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,530
Why is this allowed?

1619
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,660
Come on. Hurry up. Don't worry.

1620
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,030
Are we allowed to eliminate...

1621
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,530
- other teams' member?
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1622
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,080
You can just wait here and eliminate
another team's member.

1623
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,600
- What?
- Just like I did.

1624
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,850
- I got eliminated just like you.
- Gosh. This is unfair.

1625
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,720
- This is so unfair.
- Okay.

1626
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,820
- I have no idea.
- Sorry.

1627
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,410
Can we take off
others' name tags now?

1628
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,050
Please write down
the arrival time here.

1629
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,330
(3 minutes later, Eugene and Ji Ah
submitted the application too.)

1630
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:24,550
(Ji Ah and Eugene's move-in time is
6:58 p.m.)

1631
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,990
I can't keep it together.

1632
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,550
Maybe I should walk backward.

1633
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,160
What should I do?
Should I wear the jacket backward?

1634
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,570
(She's extremely nervous as this is
her 1st name tag elimination.)

1635
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,530
I'm so nervous.

1636
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,970
(Ji Ah is as nervous as So Yeon.)

1637
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:44,280
I feel as if someone is
following me.

1638
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:47,180
It's scary.

1639
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,970
- Is that Eugene?
- After getting eliminated once...

1640
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,320
Is that Ji Ah? Oh, my goodness.

1641
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,820
There's no way they will
eliminate me.

1642
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,080
They won't do that
since I was on their team.

1643
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,260
My goodness. Ji Ah.

1644
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,580
(Ji Ah found So Yeon!)

1645
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,220
Ji Ah, stop. What's wrong with you?

1646
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,390
Ji Ah. Ji Ah, come on.

1647
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,760
Shim Su Ryeon. Shim Su Ryeon!

1648
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,330
(The war to move into the penthouse
has begun.)

1649
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:10,410
Ji Ah, don't do that.
Don't take off my name tag.

1650
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:12,530
No, you can't do that. No.

1651
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,910
(Take off others' name tags
to delay their move-in time!)

1652
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,760
Stop it.

1653
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:33,570
Ji Ah, please.

1654
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:34,640
(Ji Ah, calm down.)

1655
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,110
Hold on. There will be other people.

1656
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:40,410
I will rip off your name tag.

1657
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,840
Hold on, Ji Ah.

1658
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:46,470
Let's not betray each other
when we get there.

1659
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:47,470
Of course not.

1660
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:51,510
We should join forces until the end.

1661
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:52,910
Let's do that.

1662
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,510
Seriously.
Let's do that until the end.

1663
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,360
- I trust you guys.
- I trust you guys.

1664
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,390
Let's trust each other
for coexistence.

1665
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,760
(So Yeon becomes even more nervous
after a crisis.)

1666
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,700
(Startled)

1667
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,870
My gosh.

1668
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:08,590
(She spots Se Chan.)

1669
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,870
Hello.

1670
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,070
(Suk Jin, So Yeon, and Se Chan meet
with a wall between them.)

1671
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,780
When did you get here?

1672
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,470
- When did you get here?
- I got here the second.

1673
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,410
- The second?
- Yes. When did you get here?

1674
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,780
- What?
- When did you get here?

1675
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,280
- Us?
- Yes.

1676
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,240
We got here the third.

1677
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,090
- Did you just get here?
- Yes.

1678
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,090
(He is like a lynx.)

1679
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,820
There is no one behind you.

1680
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,320
Really?

1681
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:32,220
In that case...

1682
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:35,300
(At that moment, Suk Jin attacks!)

1683
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,260
(Screaming)

1684
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:40,200
(Ripping off)

1685
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,910
(Professional name tag hunters
took out So Yeon.)

1686
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,470
- Out?
- Yes.

1687
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:48,510
Look at her reactions.

1688
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:49,870
I had to buy time.

1689
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:51,610
I am sorry. I had to buy time.

1690
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,110
I had to buy time.

1691
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:54,780
- Where do I go? Here?
- Yes. Please go inside.

1692
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,820
Okay.

1693
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:57,840
- I am sorry.
- For goodness' sake.

1694
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,010
My wish came true today.

1695
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,180
I should stay here.

1696
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,030
That's hilarious.

1697
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,780
I mean...

1698
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:09,090
All three of us got
our name tags removed by Suk Jin.

1699
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:10,200
What should I do?

1700
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:14,030
All right.

1701
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:16,490
What could it be?

1702
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,800
When you are in jail,

1703
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,680
you can use the mission fund
to purchase a revival pass.

1704
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,110
I see.

1705
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,740
A revival pass costs 300 dollars.

1706
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,740
My goodness.

1707
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,740
Every time you use a revival pass,

1708
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,990
the price increases by 50 dollars.

1709
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:33,860
Then I will end up using
all of my mission funds.

1710
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:35,680
A revival pass.

1711
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,680
(Thankfully, she could purchase
a revival pass!)

1712
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,890
Thank you.

1713
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,490
I will be back. "I will be back"?

1714
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,300
(So Yeon's move-in time
got pushed back by 10 minutes.)

1715
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,760
Gosh, the time is...

1716
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,240
Why is the time passing so slowly?

1717
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,240
Someone is here. Who is it?

1718
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,870
It's me, Jae Suk.
A member of Team Comedians.

1719
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,840
All right.

1720
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:02,640
The three of us should join forces
and enter together.

1721
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,780
- Jae Suk.
- What do you think?

1722
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:05,780
(Suk Jin suggests
that the comedians win together.)

1723
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,160
- What should we do?
- What?

1724
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,280
Should we take out Jae Suk?

1725
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,360
Let's take out Jae Suk once.

1726
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,780
- Let's do a cheer first.
- Okay.

1727
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,950
Let's take out Jae Suk.

1728
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:13,950
Let's do that.

1729
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,950
- The 3 of us...
- We can move in 1st.

1730
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:17,970
can join forces
and take out anyone who comes near.

1731
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:18,970
Then we can win.

1732
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:21,490
In terms of the move-in time,
we are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

1733
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:22,990
- I know.
- Are you first?

1734
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,140
- We are.
- The two of you are the same.

1735
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,240
- We are the same.
- We are first.

1736
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,470
Ripping off someone's name tag
delays him or her by 10 minutes.

1737
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:31,410
- 10 minutes?
- We can continue to do that...

1738
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,970
and move in together
at the perfect timing.

1739
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:36,780
We had a heartwarming conversation
in the car.

1740
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,890
It's the first time
the comedians came together.

1741
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:40,280
Let's do this.

1742
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,860
We should keep a safe distance.

1743
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,530
- Give me your hand.
- Seriously.

1744
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,280
- The first time on Running Man.
- That's right.

1745
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,890
- That's right.
- I learned when we came together...

1746
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:49,390
that there are three comedians
on the show.

1747
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:51,430
- I had no idea.
- Suk Jin.

1748
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:53,530
- The seniors and a junior.
- Haha is a singer.

1749
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:55,760
We should have a gathering.

1750
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,300
- Yes.
- We should really do that.

1751
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,800
Suk Jin, you should figure out
a time to meet.

1752
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,200
Please do that.

1753
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,280
You should do it
since you are the youngest.

1754
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,780
Shall we put our arms
around each other?

1755
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,570
(He makes a sudden suggestion.)

1756
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:08,840
- Hold on.
- This time...

1757
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,780
It sounds like he wants to betray
the comedians.

1758
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,890
Suk Jin, is your bad habit
getting the better of you?

1759
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:16,950
It's a trust exercise.
I can show my back to you.

1760
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:19,180
- But it's too...
- I can do it.

1761
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,890
Suk Jin. It's too much.

1762
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:21,890
- I can do it.
- Putting arms around each other...

1763
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:23,320
- As a sign of trust,
- Team Comedians.

1764
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,370
let's put arms around each other
and hold for five seconds.

1765
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,590
- Really?
- Let's do it.

1766
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,490
- Aren't you planning something?
- We will keep our palms open.

1767
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,030
- Okay.
- Like this?

1768
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,300
- Let's put arms around each other.
- I held his arm.

1769
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,370
I will have to do the same.

1770
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:35,470
(Grabbing)

1771
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:37,410
- Suk Jin.
- Don't do that.

1772
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:39,280
Why do you want to put your hand
on my back?

1773
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,410
(The tables are turned.)

1774
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:44,490
Rip it off.

1775
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:45,490
(Ripping)

1776
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,050
(He gets punished mercilessly.)

1777
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:50,090
I can't believe them.

1778
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,680
- My goodness.
- What is your problem?

1779
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,090
- What is your problem?
- The two of you...

1780
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:55,860
No. We were trying...

1781
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,590
- to join forces.
- Seriously.

1782
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:58,660
- Why did you do that?
- You made us suspicious.

1783
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,800
It wasn't like that.
It was a trust exercise.

1784
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,070
For goodness' sake.

1785
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,200
Suk Jin, you are out.

1786
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,340
All right. For goodness' sake.
What is up with the alarm?

1787
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:08,140
It's time for me to go.

1788
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,370
- You guys...
- Suk Jin, we are sorry.

1789
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:12,070
- It's time for us to go.
- It's time for us to go.

1790
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:13,780
(We will get going now.)

1791
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,220
- Already?
- We will get going.

1792
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,280
- Comedians 1 and 2 will get going.
- Guys.

1793
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:19,990
- Don't trust each other.
- Let's go.

1794
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:22,280
Let's go. For goodness' sake.

1795
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,890
Who are there? Suk Jin and...

1796
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,430
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

1797
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:28,220
- Se Chan? Hey,
- Yes.

1798
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:31,800
let's make a promise
although it's pretty meaningless.

1799
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,070
Jong Kook, don't say that.

1800
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,300
We should come together this time,
Kwang Soo.

1801
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,800
- Seriously.
- That's right.

1802
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,260
The three of us should go together.

1803
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,470
Make Kwang Soo promise.

1804
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,200
- I have a lot of money.
- Give me the address.

1805
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:45,610
Kwang Soo, you...

1806
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,340
Hold on.

1807
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:48,780
Why do you need the address?

1808
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,970
It's nothing.

1809
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,640
(Jong Kook gives Kwang Soo
the hidden mission.)

1810
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,490
You can keep a promise, right?

1811
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:54,860
Seriously, this is...

1812
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,680
This is...

1813
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,890
(He spots something!)

1814
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:00,280
I am serious. So Min.

1815
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,300
(He quickly scans
the hidden mission.)

1816
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:04,700
Me? I will do anything.
What should I do?

1817
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:06,700
(Haha, Ji Hyo, and Do Kwon
arrive first.)

1818
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,200
I guess other teams are behind.

1819
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:10,160
Aren't we the last team?

1820
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,430
Please enter the building.

1821
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:13,430
Okay.

1822
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,240
- What was that?
- I am sorry, Haha.

1823
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,680
- Haha, you are on pause.
- I am sorry.

1824
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,070
Haha, it's not like that.
I had a hidden mission.

1825
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,890
We are here.

1826
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:25,220
What do we do?

1827
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:28,050
Can we enter 40 minutes
after we fill in the application?

1828
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,280
What is it?

1829
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,530
So Min, hurry up
and get out of the car.

1830
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:32,860
- What is it?
- Hurry up.

1831
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,120
(Haha decides to enter with So Min.)

1832
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,120
- Hurry up.
- What is it?

1833
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,590
- Hurry up and run!
- Why?

1834
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,120
- Hurry up and run!
- Why?

1835
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,700
- We should go together.
- Hurry up.

1836
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,490
- Why are we running?
- That team needs to be the last.

1837
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:44,510
Why?

1838
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,510
What are you doing?
Go and rip off her name tag.

1839
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,780
Hurry up.

1840
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:50,240
(He runs after So Min
with his long legs.)

1841
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,240
What is going on?

1842
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,280
All right.

1843
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:54,870
- What is this?
- Why...

1844
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:56,180
(As he planned,
Kwang Soo removes her name tag.)

1845
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,590
So Min, you need to pause
for three minutes.

1846
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,590
What is going on?

1847
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:02,010
- Three minutes?
- Anyone can...

1848
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:03,090
(Ripping off)

1849
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,260
- Three minutes?
- Anyone can... Kwang Soo.

1850
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,390
You are with me now.
He needs to pause for three minutes.

1851
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:09,260
Please fill out the application.

1852
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:12,220
You aren't even looking at me.

1853
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:13,840
It's not like that.

1854
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:15,970
How could you be like that?
You aren't even looking at me.

1855
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:17,700
- He suddenly...
- Okay.

1856
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:18,740
Hey.

1857
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:21,640
You... Do you know what's funny?

1858
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,180
- What?
- Kwang Soo knew the plan.

1859
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,950
You should have acted quickly.

1860
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,220
For your information,
two people moved in already.

1861
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:29,470
- What?
- There isn't much time.

1862
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:30,490
(Did people move in already?)

1863
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,280
Is it 6:35 p.m?

1864
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,950
- That's right.
- 6:35 p.m.

1865
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:35,180
(Jae Suk and Se Chan waited
one floor below the penthouse.)

1866
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,320
- Let's go!
- We need to go.

1867
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,160
My goodness.

1868
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,160
- There it is.
- Let's hurry up.

1869
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,120
(They entered the penthouse
before anyone.)

1870
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,430
Don't do it! Don't do it!
It's meaningless!

1871
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:48,660
The two of you won.

1872
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:51,030
(Comedians 1 and 2 won.)

1873
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,840
- It was the perfect scenario!
- Okay. We did it.

1874
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,180
(The competition turned fiercer.)

1875
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:01,640
Jae Suk and Se Chan entered
the penthouse.

1876
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,010
- Really? Already?
- Yes.

1877
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,240
I didn't get to rip off
their name tags.

1878
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,280
Did they move in?

1879
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,950
Did they move in already?

1880
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:07,950
(Haha's move-in time is 7:18 p.m.)

1881
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:09,180
(The limited spots
make the others anxious.)

1882
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,220
This is ridiculous.

1883
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:13,590
We need to hurry up and take off
people's name tags, Kwang Soo.

1884
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:15,050
- Hey.
- Right now...

1885
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,390
(The member at the bottom
is anxious beyond belief.)

1886
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,490
(He spots his target!)

1887
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,090
Don't do that.

1888
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:23,390
- Listen.
- Let's not do that.

1889
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:28,240
We promised not to do that.

1890
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,740
Hold on.

1891
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,370
We promised not to do that.

1892
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,370
It's only a 10-minute delay.

1893
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:36,970
We promised not to do that.
I will tell Jong Kook.

1894
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,240
This is how you begin.

1895
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:43,510
I need to find Suk Jin.
He hasn't moved in yet.

1896
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,990
(He spots another target.)

1897
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,590
(He runs at full speed.)

1898
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,240
(A crazy man runs after Ji Hyo.)

1899
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:59,200
Gosh, why is he running after me?

1900
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:02,140
I got here after you did.

1901
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,840
I got here after you did.
What are you doing?

1902
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:08,370
What are you doing?

1903
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,140
(Ripping)

1904
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:11,240
What was that?

1905
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:12,990
I need to rip off the name tags.

1906
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,760
Give me the reason.
Why did you rip off my name tag?

1907
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:18,950
- Are you insane?
- I need to delay the time.

1908
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:20,360
Is he insane?

1909
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,090
(The monster of the penthouse
seeks the next target.)

1910
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:23,870
- We can't trust anyone.
- Seriously.

1911
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,120
You are walking sideways.

1912
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:27,590
I can't walk straight.

1913
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,530
Maybe I should do the moonwalk.

1914
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,260
(Boo!)

1915
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:35,470
Oh Yoon Hee is scary.

1916
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,570
Stop it.

1917
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:39,800
So Yeon, don't let your guard down.

1918
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,140
Ta-da!

1919
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:42,950
- "The Penthouse".
- "The Penthouse".

1920
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:44,820
(They spot the drama poster.)

1921
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,890
In front of the poster...

1922
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:48,050
Shall we strike a pose?

1923
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:49,590
- Let's do that.
- Let's do that.

1924
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:50,620
My goodness.

1925
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,660
Here.

1926
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,660
(They move over to the poster
while covering their backs.)

1927
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,950
Here.

1928
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,260
(They promote the drama.)

1929
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,800
(At Running Man, a show
that is worse than "The Penthouse")

1930
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:01,870
- We are so funny.
- This is insane.

1931
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,510
All right. Let's keep going.

1932
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:06,200
(As soon as they are done,
they become wary again.)

1933
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,610
We are wary of each other.

1934
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:09,740
What are we doing?

1935
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:12,370
(The newbies have a war of nerves
for no reason.)

1936
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,470
(She gets startled on her own.)

1937
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,280
I shouldn't be too trusting.

1938
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,050
We should meet someone.

1939
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,720
- Let's go downstairs.
- Downstairs?

1940
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,950
We should join forces.

1941
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:26,120
For goodness' sake.

1942
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,050
Seriously.

1943
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:29,860
Let's take out anyone we see.

1944
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,300
Seriously.

1945
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,800
(Since they arrived late,
they have no time to rest.)

1946
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,590
- We need to go to the fourth floor.
- Where are they?

1947
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,640
The stairs.

1948
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,740
(They hear Eugene's voice.)

1949
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,410
They are coming upstairs.

1950
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:42,930
(They meet in the end.)

1951
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,280
(Rushing down)

1952
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:50,510
(She responds calmly
to Kwang Soo's attack.)

1953
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:53,120
(Eugene is a strong candidate
everyone is wary of.)

1954
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,860
Eugene. Eugene.

1955
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,410
Get off! Get off!

1956
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,530
(Eugene is out.)

1957
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:03,590
I did it. I ripped off her name tag.

1958
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,200
What? Eugene!

1959
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,300
Eugene!

1960
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,300
(So Yeon runs over to help Eugene
upon hearing her scream.)

1961
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:13,160
No! Don't come!

1962
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,430
(Kwang Soo appears.)

1963
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,800
Don't come!

1964
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,050
(The next target walked over
of her own volition.)

1965
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,240
No!

1966
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,570
(So Yeon gets eliminated
without much of a fight.)

1967
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:23,910
So Yeon is out.

1968
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:26,180
So Yeon is out.
Let's move to the prison.

1969
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:28,720
(She is out for the 2nd time
in 20 minutes.)

1970
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,860
Am I out?

1971
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:32,760
I didn't get to do anything.

1972
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,320
Where is it? Here?

1973
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,530
(She enters the prison.)

1974
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:37,570
Eugene!

1975
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,220
I should have known.

1976
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,070
Are you guys in a line?

1977
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:42,200
(Running Man's prison
is full of stories.)

1978
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,240
Who ripped off your name tag?

1979
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:44,870
Kwang Soo did.

1980
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:46,410
Kwang Soo is running around wildly.

1981
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,840
It's rare to see the prison so full.

1982
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,970
The atmosphere is nice.

1983
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,140
(So Min is disheartened.)

1984
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:54,340
I don't have it.

1985
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:56,050
I don't have 500 dollars.

1986
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:58,990
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

1987
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,320
- Did he rip off your name tag?
- Kwang Soo!

1988
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,260
I will buy it
since I have the money.

1989
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,680
(The rich girl is ready to flex.)

1990
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,050
Eugene.

1991
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:06,950
Eugene,

1992
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:09,160
would you lend me...

1993
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,430
(I am sorry to ask when we met
for the first time today.)

1994
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:11,820
some money?

1995
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,800
(So Min asks for a private loan.)

1996
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:15,090
I didn't get to rip off
anyone's name tag.

1997
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:18,740
(So Yeon rips off the name tag
in prison.)

1998
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:21,340
(Suk Jin is at home,
So Min refuses to give up,)

1999
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,280
(and So Yeon is full of resentment.)

2000
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:27,110
(With three members behind,)

2001
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:29,950
(Eugene finishes purchasing
a revival pass.)

2002
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:31,680
What time is it?

2003
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:34,760
I can enter the penthouse
if I hold out for nine minutes.

2004
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,410
Let's go up.

2005
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:37,760
Let's go up.

2006
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,780
That's a life lesson.

2007
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:42,320
Money is nothing but paper.

2008
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,160
If you can get out with real money,
you would do it, right?

2009
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,090
- I can pay 1,200 dollars.
- Would you...

2010
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,490
Transfer the money.

2011
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,410
- I can pay 1,200 dollars.
- Would you...

2012
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:52,670
(So Yeon is hesitant.)

2013
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,500
Would you give me one?

2014
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:56,780
I want to give it to my nephew.

2015
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,280
You can take all the game money.

2016
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,710
- One is enough.
- Take it.

2017
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,640
So Yeon, take a name tag.

2018
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:02,970
- It's a souvenir.
- Take a name tag.

2019
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,320
- Here you go.
- Take my name tag as well.

2020
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:07,340
No, no. It's okay.

2021
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,710
That's enough.

2022
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,360
- I mean...
- The game money.

2023
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,460
- The game money is enough.
- You prefer the game money.

2024
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,720
- Your nephew will like this too.
- He is a fan, of course.

2025
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,830
But...

2026
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,220
(He is a fan,)

2027
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:19,530
(but you should keep it.)

2028
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:21,070
- I guess he doesn't like me.
- No, no.

2029
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:22,260
- I guess so.
- He is a big fan.

2030
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,590
Take the top.

2031
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,930
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

2032
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,710
- Thank you.
- All right.

2033
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:27,830
Take mine as well.

2034
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:28,970
- You don't have a name tag.
- You don't have it.

2035
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,110
I don't have it.

2036
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:31,800
(His back is empty.)

2037
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,670
He insisted
when he didn't have a name tag.

2038
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,280
- I don't know where Ji Ah is.
- Jong Kook.

2039
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,580
I swear you can trust me.

2040
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,920
Jong Kook, you have no reason
to remove my name tag.

2041
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,880
You should take him out
and go after the others.

2042
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,660
- This is the only path.
- Time is ticking.

2043
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:47,380
Eugene and the others are close
to their move-in time.

2044
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,960
- I ripped off her name tag earlier.
- Where is Eugene?

2045
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,960
Aren't you intimidated
because she kicked you earlier?

2046
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:53,790
To be honest,
I am a bit intimidated.

2047
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,500
(To be honest,
I am a bit intimidated.)

2048
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,540
Go and rip off her name tag.

2049
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:58,760
I did it earlier.

2050
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,830
Think about the conversation we had
on our way here.

2051
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:01,930
Hurry up and go.

2052
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:02,930
(At that moment)

2053
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:05,280
(Eugene appears
at the perfect timing.)

2054
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,340
- Is it Eugene?
- Yes.

2055
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:07,450
- We...
- Go.

2056
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,640
Where is the staircase?

2057
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,120
(Eugene was looking for a way
to the penthouse.)

2058
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,490
Hurry up and go. Go.

2059
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:15,550
It's your last chance. Go.

2060
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:16,620
Are they guarding the staircase?

2061
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:18,080
I mean...

2062
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,790
(He approaches Eugene
with a scared facial expression.)

2063
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:22,830
Eugene, you don't have much time.

2064
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,420
(The 1st candidate for moving in,
Eugene runs away.)

2065
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:29,070
(She suddenly changes direction.)

2066
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,000
(She loses Kwang Soo.)

2067
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,460
Jong Kook! Get her!

2068
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:34,110
Get her!

2069
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,130
- Jong Kook!
- No!

2070
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,110
(It's Kwang Soo's turn.)

2071
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:41,450
- Hey.
- What's the time now?

2072
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:43,670
- There isn't much time.
- It will her move-in time soon.

2073
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,490
- Help me. I will do it.
- Come here. Don't be like that.

2074
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,250
- Help me.
- Come here.

2075
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,750
- I will do it.
- Don't be like that.

2076
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,630
- I mean...
- There is no other way.

2077
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:53,290
- Hold on.
- No funny business.

2078
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:54,590
Hold on.

2079
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:55,890
Come on. Come on.

2080
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,590
(Biting)

2081
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,870
(Screaming)

2082
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,630
(The former fairy
succeeded to bite him.)

2083
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:03,460
- Did you really have to do that?
- She bit him!

2084
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:05,170
Did you really have to do that?

2085
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:06,260
She bit him!

2086
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:07,830
(Annoyed)

2087
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,210
Kwang Soo is annoyed.

2088
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,470
He is annoyed.

2089
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:13,210
(Are they practicing taekkyeon?)

2090
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,620
(Kwang Soo only kicks
because he is intimidated.)

2091
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:15,670
My legs...

2092
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,180
(Kicking for the 2nd time)

2093
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:23,250
- Hold on.
- Get her.

2094
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,380
My goodness.

2095
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,550
(Eugene gets caught by Haha
in the end.)

2096
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:26,660
My goodness.

2097
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,330
This is wrong.

2098
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:29,390
(Ripping off)

2099
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,700
(Eugene is out.)

2100
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:34,740
Did he rip it off?

2101
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:36,070
I did it! I did it!

2102
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,370
He did it.

2103
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:38,960
I should run away now.

2104
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,300
Thank you.

2105
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,210
(They used up their energy.)

2106
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,610
I need to enter the penthouse.

2107
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,210
Do Kwon.

2108
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,620
- Do Kwon.
- Do Kwon.

2109
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,790
She is out. Don't annoy her further.

2110
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:55,550
- She is out.
- I am out already.

2111
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:56,660
- Really?
- Yes.

2112
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,130
Eugene, please go to the prison.

2113
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:00,290
(Eugene goes back to prison!)

2114
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:01,830
I don't have a chance anymore.

2115
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:04,200
(She doesn't know if she can buy
another revival pass.)

2116
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,070
- Eugene, a revival pass...
- Don't go that way.

2117
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:07,790
All the male members are there.

2118
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,430
You will get your name tag
ripped off.

2119
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,070
Instead of the security,

2120
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:14,580
- they are blocking the path.
- Seriously.

2121
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:17,970
2 spots remain. 2 spots.

2122
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:20,140
Two spots remain at the penthouse.

2123
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:21,320
I know that, Do Kwon.

2124
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:24,290
Do Kwon, it will be
your move-in time soon, right?

2125
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:26,180
Do Kwon's move-in time
is the closest.

2126
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,880
- That's right.
- That's right. It's the closest.

2127
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,210
(Jong Kook's move-in time is
the closest at 7:18 p.m.)

2128
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:31,580
In any case,

2129
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:32,990
you can't enter
without taking me on.

2130
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,920
You will have to negotiate
with me...

2131
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:37,250
or take me on.

2132
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:39,260
You will stop us?

2133
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:40,330
I will stop you.

2134
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,500
What? How?

2135
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,700
I will stop you.

2136
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,460
I am sorry,
but who do you think you are?

2137
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:45,910
- Seriously.
- How will you stop us?

2138
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,130
It's a touch-and-go situation.

2139
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:50,300
Haha, if your time is approaching,
go up.

2140
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,410
I will stop them.

2141
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,880
- What?
- What is going on?

2142
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,250
- Me?
- Yes. I will stop them.

2143
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:56,170
We formed an alliance in the car.

2144
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:58,540
- Then I will pass.
- Okay.

2145
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,420
Pass. You can pass.

2146
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:02,160
Jong Kook, they formed an alliance.

2147
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,530
Two spots remain, right?

2148
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:06,160
- You and I could go together.
- You are right.

2149
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,290
There are four people here.

2150
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:09,250
- I have no reason to betray you.
- Wait. We should attack together.

2151
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,590
I will collapse.

2152
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:15,760
- I will collapse.
- Don't be absurd.

2153
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,430
Don't rip off my clothes.

2154
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:18,540
- My son...
- This top doesn't rip easily.

2155
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,830
My son will be heartbroken.

2156
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:21,880
(He pleads with father's love.)

2157
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,580
- Your son will be heartbroken?
- My son will be heartbroken.

2158
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,380
You shouldn't say
something like that.

2159
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,580
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

2160
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:28,710
Time out.

2161
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,750
He is buying time.

2162
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,180
- We don't have much time.
- No, no.

2163
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,880
- Come here.
- Come on.

2164
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,160
- Come on.
- Come here.

2165
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,460
- Get him instead.
- Hold on.

2166
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:38,790
Hey.

2167
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:44,220
(Do Kwon has a face-off
for the 1st time in 10 hours.)

2168
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:45,630
Can we go up here?

2169
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:46,890
If we go against each other,

2170
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:47,930
both of us might get eliminated.

2171
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,000
- Okay.
- You know that, right?

2172
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,130
Okay. Let go of me then.

2173
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:51,710
- Okay. I let go of you.
- Okay.

2174
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:52,910
- Let go of me.
- I let go of you.

2175
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:54,500
What?

2176
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,110
- Let go of me then.
- Okay. I let go of you.

2177
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:57,430
Okay.

2178
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:58,780
(Jong Kook runs away.)

2179
01:15:58,780 --> 01:15:59,800
What?

2180
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,580
(Jong Kook's move-in time is
7:18 p.m.)

2181
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,250
- Get him!
- Is it your move-in time?

2182
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:05,250
- It's my move-in time?
- Is it your move-in time?

2183
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:06,840
Is it your move-in time?
I know it isn't!

2184
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,550
- It isn't your move-in time yet!
- Really?

2185
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:09,660
(The security runs after Do Kwon.)

2186
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,010
Where do I go?
I can enter now, right?

2187
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:13,030
(Jong Kook arrives at the entrance.)

2188
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:14,080
Someone is coming.

2189
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:15,630
- It's Jong Kook.
- Okay, okay.

2190
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:16,860
(Jong Kook is
the third person to move in.)

2191
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,170
- Did you pass?
- My goodness.

2192
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:20,460
What a grand entrance!

2193
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,040
Do Kwon entered...

2194
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,090
before his time.
He is getting chased.

2195
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:25,240
- By whom?
- By whom?

2196
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:27,780
(Do Kwon runs all the way...)

2197
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,880
(to the 1st floor.)

2198
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:33,280
(The remaining members
go against each other.)

2199
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:37,840
(Haha is out.)

2200
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,420
Haha, please go to the prison.

2201
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,840
You are out.

2202
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:44,420
(Then Kwang Soo took on Do Kwon.)

2203
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:46,630
Out!

2204
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:48,460
(He made Do Kwon lose
for the 2nd time.)

2205
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,530
I am sorry.

2206
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,070
- It was about my time.
- Do Kwon.

2207
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:54,330
- I had two minutes to go.
- Do Kwon.

2208
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:57,700
(Kwang Soo is the only one
at the staircase.)

2209
01:16:57,930 --> 01:16:59,740
Hello. I will be moving in soon.

2210
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,610
Hello.

2211
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:04,240
When I move in,
I will send rice cakes to everyone.

2212
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,970
My goodness.

2213
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,920
After 37 years,

2214
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,450
I ended up moving into
the penthouse.

2215
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,820
I also had a lot of hardships.

2216
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:16,580
I ended up moving into
the penthouse...

2217
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,920
because I didn't give up and
I saved up money little by little.

2218
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:23,360
(I look forward to
your kind cooperation.)

2219
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:27,260
I'm starting to get excited.
I'm moving into the penthouse.

2220
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:33,330
(Someone's on the penthouse floor?)

2221
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:36,740
(Someone made an appearance
on the penthouse floor silently.)

2222
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,670
- Someone is here.
- Who is it?

2223
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,620
- Ji Hyo?
- What happened?

2224
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:44,710
(Song Ji Hyo)

2225
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,420
(Is Ji Hyo the fourth person
to move in?)

2226
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:47,710
- Ji Hyo?
- Ji Hyo?

2227
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:49,490
- Is time up?
- Ji Hyo.

2228
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,160
You moved in?

2229
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,490
- Jae Suk.
- How did you survive?

2230
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:54,830
(Everyone is surprised.)

2231
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,550
(How did Ji Hyo get past Kwang Soo?)

2232
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:59,630
- So...
- Ji Hyo.

2233
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:01,200
The men are all gathered over there.

2234
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:05,260
There's 1 over here,
and there another 1 in the end.

2235
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,540
(She went round and entered
a course that made a long detour.)

2236
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:11,170
- I can go in from now on, right?
- Yes, you can.

2237
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:13,340
I also had a lot of hardships.

2238
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,780
That's right, this is it.

2239
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:16,750
(She hid behind the staff
right next to Kwang Soo.)

2240
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,820
Excuse me.

2241
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,460
- They're right there. Thank you.
- Someone is here.

2242
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,990
(She succeeded in dramatically
moving into the penthouse.)

2243
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,160
Okay, four people moved in...

2244
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:28,220
to the penthouse,
so the race is over now.

2245
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:36,760
Who moved in?

2246
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:39,000
You can go there and check.

2247
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,930
The race is over.

2248
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:44,950
- Really?
- The race is over.

2249
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:47,800
(Kwang Soo's moving-in speech really
ended up being meaningless words.)

2250
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,040
I'm sorry, I ended up
not being able to move in.

2251
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:53,640
Who is it? Did Ji Hyo survive?

2252
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,360
- Ji Hyo survived.
- Ji Hyo came in.

2253
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,360
- Kwang Soo, what happened?
- How did you come in?

2254
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,460
I took another path.

2255
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:00,990
There was another path?

2256
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:02,000
- Of course.
- Which path?

2257
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,090
How many paths
does the penthouse have?

2258
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:07,390
It's over? I just escaped right now.

2259
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:08,930
I just came right now.

2260
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:11,200
- I barely escaped.
- So Min, what happened?

2261
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,040
- What happened?
- I just barely saved money.

2262
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,170
So Min, isn't it my first time to
see you after we got out of the car?

2263
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:18,140
- So Min, what happened?
- At the comedian meeting...

2264
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,140
- Junior Ji.
- He's coming.

2265
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:21,170
Be quiet.

2266
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:23,470
I'm telling you to be quiet.

2267
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:24,950
(He's really upset.)

2268
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:26,580
Okay, everyone.

2269
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:29,180
The four people who won
by moving into the penthouse are...

2270
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:32,630
Yoo Jae Suk, Yang Se Chan,
Kim Jong Kook, and Song Ji Hyo.

2271
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:34,380
(Yoo Jae Suk, Yang Se Chan,
Kim Jong Kook, and Song Ji Hyo)

2272
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,660
- That's unbelievable.
- Yes.

2273
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:38,700
These are Korean beef sets
for the winners.

2274
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:41,070
- They prepared these for us.
- Korean beef was good today.

2275
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:42,590
There were five candidates
for a penalty...

2276
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:44,370
that were eliminated.

2277
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:45,740
Only 2 people will receive
a penalty among the 5.

2278
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,670
Okay, that's enough.
I can just get out from that.

2279
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:49,110
- Am I also not included?
- You're not.

2280
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:51,130
- I'm not?
- I told you I won't let you...

2281
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:52,500
receive a penalty.

2282
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,840
The penalty is...

2283
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,510
eating patbingsu while soaking
your feet in an ice basin.

2284
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:57,780
- That sounds good.
- That sounds good.

2285
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,710
The five people should come here.

2286
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:00,820
1, 2, 3.

2287
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:02,120
(The result of drawing spoons to
select people to receive penalties)

2288
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:05,250
(Suk Jin and Eugene
ended up being selected.)

2289
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,290
Kwang Soo...

2290
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,200
(Surprised)

2291
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,590
Kwang Soo...

2292
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:14,390
Suk Jin and Eugene
will soak their feet...

2293
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,760
I feel very awkward eating
patbingsu with Eugene.

2294
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:21,110
Suk Jin was the first to come here.

2295
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:22,610
I was the first to come.

2296
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:25,210
These punks eliminated me.

2297
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:26,280
(He was the first one to come,
but he will be the last to go.)

2298
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,950
Gosh, I can't believe it.

2299
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,710
The first comedian meeting is
a failure.

2300
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:30,840
- That was so funny.
- Gosh.

2301
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,710
Please give a round of applause to
the four leads of "The Penthouse".

2302
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:34,990
- Thank you. You did a good job.
- Thank you.

2303
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:36,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2304
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:38,720
- They're receiving a penalty here.
- We must put our feet in.

2305
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,720
(Suk Jin and Eugene stay behind
to receive the penalty.)

2306
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,790
- It's so cold.
- Oh, my.

2307
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,590
That's intense.

2308
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,290
- Oh, my.
- That's intense.

2309
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:46,220
(They can feel the cold
from the tip of their toes.)

2310
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:51,330
This is intense. It's smarting.

2311
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:54,070
Gosh, this is...

2312
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:55,910
This is...

2313
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,500
- I can't do it.
- Good job.

2314
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,780
(We'd like to thank Ji Ah, So Yeon,
Eugene, and Do Kwon.)

2315
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,040
(We wish for your drama's
continuous success.)

2316
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:05,080
(At one point,)

2317
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:10,010
(all the doors of the room closed.)

2318
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:11,050
We must escape from here, right?

2319
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:13,880
(A mysterious confinement case,
How did it begin?)

2320
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:16,090

(The premiere of
the 1st Friendship Awards)

2322
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:20,460
(Jong Kook's best friend Tae Hyun
joined the show for the first time.)

2323
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,070
(He can't hide his smile because
his best friend made an appearance.)

2324

(Celebrity best friends,
Yang Dong Geun and Jang Dong Min)

2325
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,070
(So Min's friend Mi Joo,
Huening Kai, and Yeon Jun)

2326
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
(What does Jong Kook
mean to Tae Hyun?)

2327
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:30,110
(He's like protein to me.)

01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:33,080
(A proper friendship fight
among celebrity best friends)

2329
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:35,380
(I heard you are on bad terms
with Son Ye Jin.)

2330
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,320
(Son Ye Jin didn't even appear
in the movie.)

2331
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:39,950
(The string of friendship was
cut off mercilessly.)

2332
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:41,120
(I will do everything I can
for my friend.)

2333

for my gain.)
