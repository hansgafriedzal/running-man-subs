1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,820
(A wedding hall
with fancy chandeliers)

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,110
- It's 36.1℃.
- Hello.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,510
- Hello.
- This place is lovely.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,560
This is pretty.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,720
This is where we did
the card shark thing before.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,090
Is it okay to have
a low temperature?

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,760
- I'm 34℃.
- I'm 33℃.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,960
You're cold-blooded.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,100
I'm 36.4℃.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,000
It's not just body temperature.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,500
It's the temperature of your heart.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,390
- I see.
- He has a frozen heart.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,510
Whatever.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,100
- You have a low temperature, right?
- Exactly.

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,530
- No.
- You're right about that.

17
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,510
If that's the case,
it should be 99℃.

18
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,510
That's the temperature of my heart.

19
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,300
He's starting it again.

20
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,510
(He's trying to look humane.)

21
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,720
Things seem quite heartwarming
this morning.

22
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,050
- What's heartwarming?
- What do you mean?

23
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,740
- They always try to get on my case.
- You sound like a machine.

24
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,120
- You just say that mechanically.
- What's heartwarming here?

25
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,590
- What was that?
- You don't sound sincere at all.

26
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,950
I mean it.

27
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,360
Today, as the beginning of
the 2020 Year-End Award Ceremonies,

28
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,520
we will have
the first Friendship Award.

29
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,990
- It's an award ceremony.
- The Friendship Award?

30
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,990
- Friendship?
- First, let me introduce...

31
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,560
- your best friends.
- Okay.

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,510
Jae Suk's best friend.

33
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,730
Who's my best friend?

34
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,040
(Yoo Jae Suk's best friend)

35
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,150
(Jae Suk has a lot of friends
who are famous celebrities.)

36
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,180
(Which one of them
will join Running Man today?)

37
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,040
Jae Suk's best friend.

38
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,120
Who's my best friend?

39
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,150
Lee Kwang Soo.

40
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,380
- What?
- What?

41
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,380
(Lee Kwang Soo)

42
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,380
(What?)

43
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,050
- What?
- What?

44
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,230
He's my close friend,
but he's younger than me.

45
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,600
- Is Kwang Soo a guest?
- Is Kwang Soo my best friend?

46
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,130
- Yes.
- Who's a guest?

47
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,320
Is Kwang Soo a guest?

48
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,270
So he's our guest for today.

49
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,270
Why am I a guest?

50
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,340
You're a guest.

51
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,990
Today, we should
treat him like an actor.

52
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,630
- Okay. Let's do that.
- He's a guest.

53
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,900
What is going on?

54
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,800
- We have a guest today.
- It's Lee Kwang Soo.

55
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,900
Mr. Lee Kwang Soo.

56
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,240
You look handsome.

57
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,710
(Lee Kwang Soo, a comedian and
actor with 10 years of experience)

58
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,520
- He looks cool.
- We have Lee Kwang Soo here today?

59
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,290
- He's cool.
- He does the chicken foot greeting.

60
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,760
- Next is Haha's best friend.
- Okay.

61
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,290
It's Ji Suk Jin.

62
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,730
(Haha's best friend
is Ji Suk Jin.)

63
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,020
It's Ji Suk Jin.

64
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,960
- What? Why?
- I like that.

65
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,100
- I like it too.
- It's good for me.

66
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,320
We've been doing a lot of things
together on YouTube.

67
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,020
Haha and Suk Jin
aren't best friends.

68
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,370
They are not that close.

69
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,840
- No, we work together a lot.
- We get along well these days.

70
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,270
- They are incompatible.
- We do a lot of things together.

71
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,960
They're just trying
to get more subscribers.

72
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,710
- And Song Ji Hyo's best friend...
- They are not best friends.

73
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,580
- is Yang Se Chan.
- Okay.

74
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,950
- Best friends?
- Yang Se Chan.

75
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,740
(What?)

76
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,240
Is it because of Hyochang Park?

77
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,550
- It's just...
- Hyochang Park.

78
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,920
It's just a business relationship.

79
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,020
- Ji Hyo's friend?
- You must've gone crazy.

80
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,280
(The pairs of best friends
are not convincing at all.)

81
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
You are insane.

82
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,960
They don't even know
each other's number.

83
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,120
- We're just...
- Hyochang Park.

84
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,430
It's just business.

85
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,460
And Jong Kook's best friend.

86
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,900
- Is it So Min?
- Please come on out.

87
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,270
- What?
- Isn't it me?

88
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,930
(Isn't it me?)

89
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,240
- Isn't it me?
- What do you mean?

90
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,740
(Who's Jong Kook's best friend
coming down the stairs?)

91
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,530
- What's going on?
- Jong Kook.

92
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,430
- It's Tae Hyun.
- What? Cha Tae Hyun.

93
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,430
Is it Tae Hyun?

94
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,050
- He's Tae Hyun.
- My gosh.

95
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,120
(Real reactions)

96
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,450
- He's his best friend.
- He's Jong Kook's real friend.

97
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,950
- Hey.
- He's...

98
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,150
- He has his real best friend.
- What is he doing here?

99
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,330
(Cha Tae Hyun,
an ace variety show marksman)

100
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,460
Director!

101
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,220
(Tae Hyun calls the director first.)

102
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,700
- Is this his first time here?
- Is it?

103
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm not sure.

104
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,090
- What? Hey.
- Have you been doing well?

105
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,640
- Hello.
- He's going to Chan Hee.

106
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,140
Mr. Kang.

107
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,740
(He just walks past the members.)

108
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,110
(And he greets
Director Kang Chan Hee.)

109
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,470
- You didn't say hello to us.
- Hey.

110
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,110
- Mr. Kang.
- My gosh.

111
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,110
- You should talk to me first.
- Who do you think is...

112
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,550
your best friend here?
Why did you go to Chan Hee?

113
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,650
We met again after two years.

114
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,020
I saw the rest of you before.

115
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,620
You should look at me. But you...

116
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,550
We talked on the phone two days ago.
Why did you not tell me about this?

117
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,090
You didn't ask.

118
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,220
He's funny.

119
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,890
Why would I tell you that
when you didn't even ask?

120
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,460
Hey, is your new movie coming out?

121
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,830
I'll start a movie.

122
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,120
So you came here for no reason?

123
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,300
I'm on a variety show tour.

124
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,740
- It's a variety show tour.
- Is he serious?

125
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,490
What is he doing here?

126
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,960
There was an article
that said this about me.

127
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,900
- What?
- A variety show hitchhiker.

128
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,180
(A variety show hitchhiker)

129
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,450
A hitchhiker?

130
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,340
I love that nickname.

131
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,450
He just appears in variety shows
for no reason once in a while.

132
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,180
I said this about Tae Hyun before.

133
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,590
He suddenly texted me and asked
"When should I join your show?"

134
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,990
This is what he does.

135
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,830
- He was drunk.
- That's not true.

136
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,930
- No?
- I was asked to join this show.

137
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,050
He was asked to come.

138
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,490
I was asked to join Running Man.

139
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,960
I was like, "Running Man"?

140
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,070
- Out of the blue?
- I had no excuse to refuse it.

141
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,340
(I had no excuse to refuse it.)

142
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,230
(He decided to join our show
as he had no excuse to refuse it.)

143
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,030
Ji Hyo thinks this is
Tae Hyun's first time in our show.

144
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,710
- She thinks she's never met you.
- He's been here before.

145
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,840
Tae Hyun was in our show
a lot when we started it.

146
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,650
(10 years ago, he was
in the 10th episode.)

147
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,750
(He was once on the same team
with Ji Hyo.)

148
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,210
(Embarrassed)

149
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,520
We met many times.

150
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,420
That's because
when Tae Hyun was here...

151
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,500
Just stay quiet.

152
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,520
It was a very interesting story!

153
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,000
- Just stay quiet.
- He's right.

154
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,020
He's right.

155
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,420
- Was she sleep?
- When Tae Hyun was here,

156
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,340
- She slept a lot.
- Ji Hyo kept sleeping.

157
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,860
- Oh, right.
- She slept in the car.

158
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,140
So Tae Hyun asked me carefully.

159
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,100
"Is it okay to sleep like that?"

160
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,380
(So Tae Hyun asked me carefully.
Is it okay to sleep like that?)

161
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,510
Hey, you should tell us interesting
stories like that with confidence.

162
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,080
I was going to, but you stopped me.

163
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,520
- You should speak with confidence.
- Right.

164
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,610
She was shooting a drama back then.

165
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,650
She was sleeping
with the drama script.

166
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,750
So I understood her.

167
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,650
- I thought she'd be very tired.
- Right.

168
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,890
- You didn't.
- You talked behind her back a lot.

169
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,060
Was it on TV?

170
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,330
(Was it on TV?)

171
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,090
(He fails to talk her up
because of the witnesses.)

172
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,130
It wasn't.

173
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,330
Didn't Tae Hyun say this?

174
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,340
"Does she always sleep like this
shooting a TV show?"

175
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,960
Exactly.

176
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,530
(Jong Kook's best friend Tae Hyun is
back in Running Man after 9 years.)

177
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,880
Then So Min has no friend?

178
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,230
- What about me?
- Who's So Min's friend?

179
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,970
All right. Next is...

180
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,250
So Min's best friend.

181
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,340
- I know who it is.
- Please come on out.

182
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
Who is it?

183
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,340
(Who is it?)

184
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,710
- It's Mi Joo.
- Mi Joo.

185
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,560
She's Mi Joo.

186
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,060
(Welcome, Mi Joo.)

187
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,090
(Mi Joo, a variety blue chip
with cheerful charm)

188
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,590
Mi Joo is here.

189
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,590
So it's like crazy plus crazy.

190
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,590
(So it's like crazy plus crazy.)

191
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,090
Hello.

192
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,090
She's Mi Joo.

193
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,070
- She's a rising variety star.
- I know.

194
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,070
Sure.

195
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,230
- From what I heard,
- Yes?

196
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,230
before Mi Joo was invited,

197
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,640
she got a call from So Min.

198
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,450
Right. I suddenly
got a call from So Min.

199
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,840
"Hello, So Min."

200
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,340
"Mi Joo, I'm calling you
to get credit for something."

201
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,710
"Really? What is it?"

202
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,910
"I got you in Running Man."

203
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,460
- That's the worst.
- "Hey."

204
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,650
(I got you in Running Man.)

205
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
(She sounds like an old fossil.)

206
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,220
- That's the worst.
- That's horrible.

207
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,220
You can't be like that.

208
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,090
You picked up only bad things here.

209
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,420
It's the worst.

210
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,130
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

211
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,900
We have five teams
for The first Friendship Awards.

212
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,230
So we all are teamed up.

213
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,270
We have the sixth team here.
Please come on out.

214
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,970
- There's another team of friends?
- They are a team.

215
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,340
- Hey, he's my friend.
- Yang Dong Geun?

216
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,450
Yang Dong Geun and Jang Dong Min.

217
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,450
Dong Geun is my friend.

218
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,390
You got to make money somehow.

219
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,190
(Startled)

220
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,090
- Hey.
- How are you?

221
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,090
- Hello.
- Dong Min.

222
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,330
- Hey.
- Hello, Dong Min.

223
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,000
Dong Min and Dong Geun
are Haha's close friends.

224
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,360
- They are very close.
- They're my friends.

225
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,220
You did a TV show together.

226
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,530
- As friends.
- Right.

227
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,000
And we've known each other
for a long time.

228
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,140
Here's the thing.

229
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,860
They were thinking of
pairing me up with Haha,

230
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,340
but it didn't seem good,
so they paired us up together.

231
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,810
That's what happened.

232
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,170
So we should make sure...

233
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,950
to ruin this episode today.

234
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,450
Let's do that.

235
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,110
They will ruin our show for sure.

236
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,250
All our guests for today
can ruin this show.

237
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,320
Hang on.
Should I break a camera first?

238
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,890
(Hang on. Should I
break a camera first?)

239
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,920
Now we have one team left.

240
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,020
- There's more?
- There's another team.

241
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,150
- There's more?
- One more team?

242
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,960
- They're here.
- Hello.

243
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,070
- Welcome.
- Hello.

244
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,360
(Yeon Jun and Huening Kai
of TOMORROW X TOGETHER)

245
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,010
(TOMORROW X TOGETHER
with versatile charms)

246
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,730
(With their fascinating looks
and refreshing beauty,)

247
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,810
(Yeon Jun and Huening Kai are here.)

248
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,640
They're TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

249
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,150
- My gosh.
- Hello.

250
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,150
Welcome.

251
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,340
They are Yeon Jun...

252
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,020
- and Huening Kai.
- They're from BTS's agency.

253
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,260
- That's right.
- That's true.

254
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,780
They're like BTS's
younger brothers.

255
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,110
Let us introduce ourselves.
One Dream.

256
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,260
- Hello, we're TOMORROW X TOGETHER.
- Hello, we're TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

257
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,420
I haven't seen them for a long time.

258
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,220
Now it feels like we have guests.

259
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,720
Right.

260
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,840
We are having more guests
than I thought today.

261
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,340
- We have a lot.
- This is a lot.

262
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,710
Are we going to have 100 guests
like we did before?

263
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,860
Let's introduce ourselves then.

264
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,140
Tae Hyun, this year marks
our 10th anniversary.

265
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,040
And he was in our show
nine years ago.

266
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,540
- Nine years?
- That's unbelievable.

267
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,610
I didn't know you'd come.

268
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,090
Me neither. I had no idea.

269
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,190
I talked to him on the phone
for about 30 minutes.

270
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,020
- And?
- He could've told me about this.

271
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,710
- Why did you not tell him?
- He didn't ask.

272
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,930
I mean...

273
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,120
You didn't ask what I would
do on Monday.

274
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,490
You usually say
things like this in advance.

275
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,890
- What do you think?
- You didn't ask me.

276
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,990
You would understand me
if you were married.

277
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,960
I don't say anything
unless I'm asked.

278
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,760
(All married men
relate to what he says.)

279
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,960
Why would I tell you that
when you didn't even ask?

280
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,540
- You're right.
- Okay.

281
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,630
- I should learn from you.
- I get it.

282
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,100
You don't answer questions
that people don't ask.

283
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
I won't say anything
unless it's needed.

284
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,950
Right. And we have...

285
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,500
TOMORROW X TOGETHER here.
This is your first time here.

286
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,050
- Right.
- How would you describe...

287
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,010
your friend Yeon Jun with one word?

288
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,610
Well, I'd say he's my treasure.

289
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,920
Your treasure.
What about you, Yeon Jun?

290
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,430
(What does Huening Kai mean
to Yeon Jun?)

291
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,720
He's a cute friend.

292
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,930
A cute friend?

293
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,800
- A cute friend.
- All right then.

294
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,350
I should ask this question to them.

295
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,120
What does Jong Kook
mean to you, Tae Hyun?

296
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,490
- What?
- Protein.

297
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,130
(Protein)

298
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,630
- My gosh.
- Good.

299
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,810
That's what I mean to him.

300
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,230
- What about you, Jong Kook?
- That's what I mean.

301
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,730
- What does Tae Hyun mean to you?
- Just protein?

302
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,100
What does Tae Hyun mean to you?

303
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,280
- To me?
- Yes.

304
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
(What does Tae Hyun mean
to Jong Kook?)

305
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Real estate.

306
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,380
He shares information
about real estate with me.

307
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,980
He gives me a lot of information.

308
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,350
Tae Hyun is real estate
to Jong Kook,

309
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,350
And tax.

310
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,330
and Jong Kook means protein
to Tae Hyun.

311
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,350
Good.

312
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,090
And we have Yang Dong Geun and
Jang Dong Min who are best friends.

313
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,760
Dong and Dong!

314
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,430
- Dong and Dong!
- Dong and Dong.

315
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,800
Do you two
get along with each other?

316
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,440
- I don't think they do.
- Do you even have things in common?

317
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,340
- They're really close.
- Are you judging our relationship?

318
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
I'm not judging.

319
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,370
- They don't match.
- You're right.

320
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,500
- That's why we get along well.
- I see.

321
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,740
We are very
different from each other.

322
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,710
- But we respect the difference.
- Is that so?

323
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,280
- They're very close.
- Yes.

324
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,550
Dong Geun, what can you
tell us about Dong Min?

325
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,050
He can't say anything.
You may ask me questions.

326
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,290
What are you talking about?

327
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,960
He can't say anything.
You may ask me questions.

328
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,190
What are you talking about?

329
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,720
He was going to speak.

330
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,300
He wanted to say something
but you stopped him.

331
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,220
- I'm sorry.
- He was about to say something.

332
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,350
I'm sorry.

333
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,890
He doesn't like people
asking him questions...

334
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,670
- or being with many people.
- Is that right?

335
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,170
But let us hear him say something.

336
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,710
This is for his own good.

337
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,130
- I'm protecting him.
- All right then.

338
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,280
It seems to me
that you two haven't been close...

339
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,870
for a very long time.

340
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,370
You're right. When I first saw him,

341
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,740
I was in my 20s.

342
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,690
- Remember how he used to look like?
- Sure I do.

343
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,420
(He swaggered in his walk.)

344
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,550
This is how he walked.

345
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,880
- And you didn't like it, right?
- No.

346
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,160
You must've hated it.

347
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
The first thing that popped
into my head as I saw him was,

348
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,350
"I will never
be friends with that guy."

349
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,070
(I will never
be friends with that guy.)

350
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,800
(He closed his mind
the first time he saw Dong Geun.)

351
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,540
- "What's up, what's up?"
- That's enough.

352
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,730
Then I had several chances
to film shows with him.

353
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,910
But the first impression
was too strong...

354
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,950
- that I couldn't get closer to him.
- I know what you mean.

355
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,970
- You hated him.
- Whenever I see him, he was like...

356
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,110
(Whenever I see him, he was like...)

357
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,370
(Swaggering slowly)

358
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,950
- I knew it.
- He walked like this.

359
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,010
- So you got closer recently.
- Yes, it seems like it.

360
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,960
But as I got to know him...

361
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,120
- I could understand him.
- So you got to know him.

362
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,800
They have a very special
bond with each other.

363
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,120
- When Dong Min films a show...
- So we were...

364
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,330
Hey, stop talking.

365
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,990
Let him talk.

366
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,260
Why are you stopping him?

367
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,860
- You can't stop him.
- Hey.

368
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,040
- I want to hear him.
- He talks well.

369
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,540
- No, he's not going to talk.
- Really?

370
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,040
This is like a funny skit.

371
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,710
It's rude to make someone
speak so suddenly.

372
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,240
(Thanks to his friend, he's
meditating silently from the start.)

373
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,320
Today, we are going to pick the best
couple with perfect chemistry.

374
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,640
It's the first Friendship Awards.

375
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,960
Each two best friends will team up.

376
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Coins will be given, according
to the result of your mission.

377
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,530
At the end of the mission,
prizes will be given accordingly...

378
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,530
only to the top three teams
with the most coins.

379
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,990
And today,
a penalty will also be given.

380
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,860
The penalty will be
given to individuals, not to teams.

381
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,960
The penalty will be given to the top
three with the most penalty badges.

382
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,230
But in my case, teaming up...

383
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,600
- with Kwang Soo is bad for me.
- It doesn't matter, right?

384
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,710
Penalty will be
given to individuals.

385
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,140
Then you should've
said that earlier.

386
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,280
Now I'll explain
about penalty badges.

387
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,210
You can buy a penalty badge
with three coins.

388
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,660
Write down the name that you want
to give a penalty to on the coin.

389
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,880
Then give it to the PDs
who are wearing red caps.

390
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,160
You have to hand them
three coins secretly.

391
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,030
Then a penalty badge
will be given to that person.

392
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,120
- Secretly.
- So...

393
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,170
So I should earn coins
to get rid of someone else.

394
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,440
And not to get a penalty myself.

395
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,490
(Collect coins
for prizes and penalties)

396
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,570
But you need to collect
coins to receive prizes.

397
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We won't reveal to you
how many penalty badges you have.

398
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,600
But we will inform you how many
penalty badges the top three got...

399
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,230
at the end of every mission.

400
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,140
But if you wish to know
how many penalty badges you got,

401
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,970
you should give a coin to us.

402
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,180
Then we'll let you know.

403
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,340
- It cost a coin?
- Yes.

404
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,010
What's more important is this.

405
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,610
You use three coins
to give a penalty badge...

406
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,090
and a coin to know your number.

407
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,790
So it's important
who's holding the coin bag.

408
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,880
- You're right.
- I'll get that.

409
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,060
- Come on. I'll hold it.
- Why are you making them fight?

410
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,350
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
- Wait.

411
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,590
Let's do rock, paper, scissors
to decide.

412
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,830
- Come on.
- Let's do it.

413
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,120
- No way.
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

414
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,260
Come on. Do rock, paper, scissors.

415
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,390
There's no way you're holding this.
Just stay still.

416
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,360
- Let's do this fair and square.
- Stay still.

417
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,730
- Let's count first.
- Just wait.

418
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,960
You can't use them as you want.

419
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm telling you. You don't
have to worry about a thing.

420
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,910
(Each team gets 20 R coins)

421
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,110
Gosh, what is that?

422
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,140
- I think it's hopscotch.
- This feels bad.

423
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,590
I think it's hopscotch.

424
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,980
- Gosh, there are balloons.
- My goodness.

425
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,420
Yes, there are balloons.

426
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,090
- This feels really bad.
- It looks like tofu.

427
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,090
(Two pieces of paper barely hold
the balloons from each side.)

428
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,220
- What is this?
- It's that rope game.

429
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,880
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

430
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,890
It looks fun.

431
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,660
You are allowed to
give coins to us now.

432
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,830
- Let me explain the rules again.
- I can give you coins now?

433
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,840
Write the name you want
on the coin and give it to us.

434
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,410
Then a penalty badge
will be given to that person.

435
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,410
- You have one, right?
- Yes.

436
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,570
I can write down a name?

437
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,910
Hey, you can't let
anyone see the name.

438
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,940
Is that so?

439
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,470
So we're supposed to
write the name on the coin?

440
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,780
Why did you write my name down?

441
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,510
Why did you write down my name?

442
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,370
- I wanted to write it on each coin.
- You do that.

443
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,420
You can't do that.

444
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,480
Tae Hyun, why are you
writing Kwang Soo's name down?

445
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Because I want him
to get a penalty.

446
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,850
Then I'll write down your name too.

447
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,720
If you write his name down,
he could write down our names.

448
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,530
- You can't let him see it.
- Come to think of it,

449
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,200
members of TOMORROW X TOGETHER
are here with us today.

450
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,860
- Why don't we watch them perform?
- Yes.

451
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,670
- We should listen to their song.
- Right.

452
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,300
- Come on out.
- I can't wait.

453
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,570
Go for it.

454
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,040
TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

455
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,730
("Blue Hour"
by TOMORROW X TOGETHER)

456
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,750
(The older sister loves it.)

457
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,290
(My goodness!)

458
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,390
(TOMORROW X TOGETHER
is so cool!)

459
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,350
(Increasing the tension
with their brilliant performance.)

460
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,330
("Blue Hour"
by TOMORROW X TOGETHER)

461
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,860
(Flapping)

462
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,540
Don't do that.

463
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,710
They're amazing.

464
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,810
- That's not how they did it.
- They are so good.

465
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,540
We would've been sorry
if we didn't see this. Gosh.

466
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,970
By the way,

467
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,240
- Dong Geun.
- Yes?

468
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,740
Sing "Alleyway" for us.

469
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,710
(Everyone's cheering for him.)

470
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,090
Dong Geun.

471
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,290
I love "Alleyway".

472
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,820
- Here he goes.
- "Alleyway" and his friend.

473
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,660
- I love it.
- Perform with your friend.

474
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,330
(His mega-hit K-pop song in 2002
is a remake of Lee Jae Min’s song.)

475
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,090
(The song features YDG's
robot dance and addictive melody.)

476
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,000
(Everyone sang along at least once.
"Alleyway" with his charming tone)

477
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,340
(Can't wait!)

478
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,370
(They still remember the move!)

479
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,600
The robot dance.

480
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,840
(They were teenagers back then
so they're excited.)

481
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,180
You're right.

482
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,970
- He's a good dancer.
- None stop.

483
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,980
(Brings back memories of 2002!)

484
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,320
Come on, louder!

485
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,510
YDG!

486
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,120
1, 2, 3!

487
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,750
Come on, twins' dad!

488
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,750
Gosh, you're cool!

489
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,850
Here he goes!

490
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,030
Let's go!

491
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,730
(He's popping his joints
just like he did 18 years ago.)

492
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,840
He's good!

493
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,140
(A song from the early 2000s
still sounds exciting.)

494
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,210
Amazing.

495
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,840
(Folding and unfolding dance)

496
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,050
I haven't seen this in a long time.

497
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,140
(Finishing a performance
from old memories.)

498
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,660
(Great satisfaction)

499
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,980
- That's my friend!
- YDG!

500
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,060
Tae Hyun's "I Love You"!

501
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,620
Sing "I Love You".

502
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,660
Tae Hyun's "I Love You"!

503
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,490
- "I Love You"!
- Sing it for us.

504
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,930
- Sing "I Love You."
- "I Love You."

505
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,860
- Come on, sing it.
- "I Love You."

506
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,070
(The friends' talent show
is getting bigger and bigger.)

507
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,710
- I love this song.
- Me too.

508
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,040
Tae Hyun, we really love this song.

509
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,000
You must remember
the song very well.

510
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,730
- Yes, we love it.
- You're right.

511
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,740
(Mega-hit title song of
Cha Tae Hyun's...)

512
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,820
(first full-length album
released in 2001)

513
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,510
(The song features addictive
beats and his Eagle Dance.)

514
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,710
(Tae Hyun was 26 back then.)

515
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,530
(I love you!)

516
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,700
- I love the song.
- Wasn't it popular back then?

517
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,700
I recorded
the guide track for this song.

518
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,670
- You worked on the guide track?
- Yes.

519
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,800
- Seriously?
- Yes.

520
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
(He's genuinely surprised.)

521
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,930
Here he goes. Cha Tae Hyun!

522
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,040
- Cha Tae Hyun!
- I can't believe I'm watching this.

523
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,370
- I love you, Cha Tae Hyun!
- Cha Tae Hyun!

524
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,440
(Starting the engine
of the eagle from the 2000s.)

525
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,520
Here it is.

526
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,410
(Ecstatic)

527
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,820
Here he goes!

528
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,660
(The eagle from 19 years ago)

529
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,620
(Ready to fly high gorgeously)

530
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,160
<i>I regret my love</i>

531
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,430
- Cha Tae Hyun!
- Cha Tae Hyun!

532
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,860
(Singing "I Love You"
just like he did in the old days)

533
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,370
Gosh, this is it?

534
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,670
(The talent show
just seems so funny to his friend.)

535
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,280
(This is the sophistication
of the 2000s.)

536
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,820
(I think it's enough.)

537
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,220
You did well.

538
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,440
(Finishing Tae Hyun's performance
from the old days.)

539
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,520
Great.

540
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,050
Gosh, I loved it.

541
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,260
He was so popular
when he released this song.

542
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,790
- You're right.
- It topped the charts.

543
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,620
Mi Joo is here with us
in a long time.

544
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,650
I'd like her to perform
one of Lovelyz's songs.

545
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,920
- "Hi."
- "Hi"?

546
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,330
- I want to listen to "Hi".
- Destiny?

547
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,730
She's a goddess from Okchon.

548
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,270
Yes, a goddess from Okchon!

549
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,430
- She's Ok-Mi-Goddess.
- Ok-Joo-Goddess.

550
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,400
- Ok-Goddess.
- Ok-Goddess.

551
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,040
("Hi" by Lovelyz, 2015
Mi Joo's Solo version)

552
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,370
Look at her jump.

553
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,670
(Today, she turns into
an innocent girl group member.)

554
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,840
(She's good.)

555
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,290
- Look at her.
- She's good.

556
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,520
We needed this.

557
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,490
She sure is a goddess from Okchon.

558
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,490
Mi Joo, lift the spirit
up to the highlight!

559
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,150
(A die-hard fan requested her
to lift her spirit up!)

560
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,530
(Here goes the highlight.)

561
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,530
(Dimly)

562
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,860
Now say "Hi".

563
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,090
(Changing abruptly)

564
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,700
(Hi?)

565
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,470
(Bouncy Mi Joo is up!)

566
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,700
(The goddess is saying hi
using every bone in her body.)

567
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,200
You're amazing!

568
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,670
You're good!

569
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,640
You're amazing, goddess from Okchon.

570
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,750
I love you!

571
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,640
She's really amazing.

572
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,880
She's so good.

573
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,180
Everyone, give her a big hand!

574
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,610
Okay, okay!

575
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,560
- You're the best.
- So good.

576
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,120
- She's the best.
- Goddess from Okchon.

577
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,180
She is the best.

578
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,500
Mi Joo is the best.

579
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,300
- She really is bouncy.
- Yes, she is.

580
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,620
I thought she was
on the hot sand in the beach.

581
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,500
I thought she was jumping like that
because the sand was hot.

582
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,840
- She was lovely.
- She's really good.

583
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,700
- You were...
- Gosh.

584
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,970
- pretty.
- She's good.

585
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,840
- I was?
- Yes, you were.

586
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,050
Kwang Soo.

587
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,820
Kwang Soo, sing "Mosquito" for us.

588
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
"Mosquito"?

589
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,550
- Yes, "Mosquito".
- What's "Mosquito"?

590
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,550
He likes it.

591
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,720
- They know it.
- "Mosquito."

592
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,450
He likes it. They know it.

593
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,680
- Yes, I know it.
- They love "Mosquito".

594
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,290
- "It was itchy."
- "It bit my foot."

595
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,390
- Sing it for them. They love it.
- Yes, you should.

596
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,850
Come on. They love it.

597
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,800
The kids love it, so do it.
Show them.

598
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,620
Why do I have to do this
standing out in front?

599
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,630
- Do it for us.
- Please.

600
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,400
Yeon Jun seems excited.
They'll enjoy it.

601
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,700
A giant mosquito bit my foot.

602
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,980
(A giant mosquito bit my foot.)

603
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,100
It was itchy.

604
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,170
(He shows off
his 10-year-old talent.)

605
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,480
That was awesome.

606
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,700
It was the best.

607
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,980
I've never seen this before.

608
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,320
Gosh, this is...

609
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,220
(He's excited to see it in person.)

610
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,020
I just did it because
they'd like it.

611
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,610
He just did it for you guys.

612
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,060
They really like it.

613
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,490
- It was the best.
- He did it for you guys.

614
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,790
They really like it.

615
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,880
It was really good.

616
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,620
This is the first mission
for the Friendship Awards.

617
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,770
It's called Torn Friendship.

618
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,890
Torn Friendship?

619
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,770
One member of each team
will sit under the water balloon.

620
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,010
And the other member will sit
in the question seat.

621
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,700
They will ask each other questions,

622
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,900
and they must give
irrelevant answers.

623
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,250
If you give a relevant answer,

624
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,370
your opponent will pour
a spoonful of water on your paper.

625
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,480
- On the paper.
- On the paper.

626
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,790
If you keep pouring water on it,
the paper will get wet and cut off.

627
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,990
So the balloon will fall.

628
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,180
It's a tournament.

629
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,920
This is how it goes.

630
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,760
Okay.

631
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,850
Round One is Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
versus Jong Kook and Tae Hyun.

632
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,660
If we win this game,
will we get coins?

633
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,770
Sure. But you move on
to the next round.

634
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,190
- Kwang Soo, you know what to do.
- Sure. I do.

635
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,200
You can't say anything
about my wife.

636
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,630
- What? My gosh.
- What was that?

637
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,340
That's what this game is all about.

638
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,870
I'm not good at games like this,
but I'll give it a try.

639
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,870
Okay.

640
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,410
Kwang Soo, I heard you didn't
want to film "The Pirates".

641
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,220
Purple.

642
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,020
(He gets flustered
by the sudden slander...)

643
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,990
(and barely gives an answer.)

644
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,990
It's not like that.

645
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,260
He's flustered.

646
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm working on the movie now.

647
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,090
(He embarrasses him by talking
about the movie he's filming.)

648
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,830
I heard that a lot.

649
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,500
- Well done.
- What are you talking about?

650
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,590
Don't think about it.

651
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,270
- It's going well.
- Don't think about it.

652
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,840
- When did I say that?
- Stop thinking about it.

653
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,010
Don't answer it.

654
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,130
It's stranger when you get upset.
Don't answer it.

655
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,040
- Shall I begin?
- He's not good. Go easy on him.

656
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,170
What do you think of Jong Kook?

657
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,370
- I'm so sleepy.
- Good.

658
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,480
Did he get it wrong?

659
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,080
- He succeeded.
- He did?

660
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,820
Tae Hyun is good at playing games.

661
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,680
I heard you don't get along with
Son Ye Jin in "The Pirates".

662
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,450
- I heard that.
- Hey, just say something.

663
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,990
- That's what I heard.
- Kimchi.

664
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,120
(He just listens
to the question silently.)

665
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,620
(Time's up.)

666
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,070
He didn't finish his question.

667
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,570
- And that's not true.
- Why did you not say anything?

668
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,930
Son Ye Jin doesn't even
appear in the movie.

669
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,010
You should talk
about something else.

670
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,740
- She doesn't?
- She's not even in the movie.

671
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,870
Then you could've just said
something else.

672
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,080
So you fell for that.

673
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,720
- You shouldn't care about it.
- Okay.

674
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,020
- Where should I pour it?
- On the left.

675
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
Look.

676
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,990
- You should do it in the middle.
- In the middle?

677
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,410
Sure.

678
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,560
(He pours water in the middle.)

679
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,590
I'll pour it on one spot
to make it weak.

680
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,590
Kwang Soo.

681
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,060
I don't care about the water
balloon. Don't worry.

682
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,420
- Just do it at ease.
- Okay.

683
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,850
Trust me. Okay?

684
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,230
- Is it my turn?
- You should ask a question.

685
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,270
You should ask a question.

686
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,890
The water...

687
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,040
- It's melting.
- I'll go next.

688
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,190
- There's a hole.
- Oh no.

689
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,690
It's melting.

690
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,040
- It's melting.
- We should hurry.

691
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,130
We should've poured it on one side.

692
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,780
- To make it long.
- It spreads faster that way.

693
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,980
You should hurry. It's melting.

694
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,080
Just do it.

695
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,200
How are you feeling now?

696
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,940
Gosh, I'm sleepy.

697
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,410
Oh, okay!

698
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,820
(Tae Hyun said something about
his condition, so it's wrong.)

699
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,520
- He said he's sleepy.
- This is hard.

700
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,220
- He's caught.
- Hey, make it long.

701
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,990
- Long.
- Don't spread it.

702
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,680
- Make it long.
- If you do it well,

703
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,530
- you can turn the game around.
- You should make it the same.

704
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,300
- What if...
- This is dangerous.

705
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,920
My gosh.

706
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,500
(He shakes it to the last drop.)

707
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,690
We have to hurry.

708
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,270
It will be ripped soon.

709
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,510
- Hurry.
- My turn.

710
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,600
Do you like Yoo Jae Suk
or Zo In Sung?

711
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,370
Choi Bo Pil.

712
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,670
(He named the main director.)

713
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,370
(Wrong)

714
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,080
(He tried to evade the question by
calling the main director's name.)

715
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,220
- How cowardly.
- Hey.

716
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,990
- Let's hurry and continue.
- What was that?

717
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,150
You could've said anything else.

718
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,060
Why did you say
Choi Bo Pil all of a sudden?

719
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,260
My gosh.

720
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,290
Good.

721
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,690
- That's going to rip soon.
- Hurry.

722
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,150
On the other side. Good.

723
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,120
- It will break.
- Good.

724
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,500
That's going to rip soon.

725
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,160
- All right. I'll do it now.
- Hurry.

726
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,270
- All right. I'll do it now.
- Hurry.

727
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,660
- This is...
- You did your job.

728
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,930
Look at this.

729
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,430
- I'll do it.
- Look at this.

730
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,580
I can do this.

731
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,980
It's okay. Let me take it over.

732
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,110
You've done your job. Well done.

733
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,840
- That's not what I meant.
- Jae Suk.

734
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,490
- Let's continue.
- We should hurry.

735
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,490
- Ask a sharp question.
- Okay.

736
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,560
There's a bad rumor
going around our neighborhood.

737
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,420
- They live in the same town.
- I like Jang Hyuk.

738
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,830
Look at him.

739
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,420
(Sulky)

740
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,090
- Was it a sharp question?
- He's not good at asking questions.

741
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,120
The question was...

742
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,570
- He's not good at this.
- It's just one step back.

743
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,630
I just take 1 step back
to take 10 steps forward.

744
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,510
We live in the same neighborhood,

745
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,930
and there's a bad rumor about you.

746
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
That can't be right.

747
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,510
(He denies it shaking his head.)

748
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,440
What are you doing?

749
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,720
He got me.

750
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,110
What was that?

751
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,340
(The nation's beloved MC is
sensitive about his reputation.)

752
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,020
"That can't be right."

753
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,850
- "That can't be right."
- He said "That can't be right."

754
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,530
Oh no.

755
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,380
- Okay.
- He's really bad at games.

756
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,300
- "That can't be right."
- Don't worry.

757
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,330
- "That can't be right."
- Don't take it seriously.

758
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,470
He said "That can't be right."

759
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,690
He wants to explain.

760
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,040
He has to explain.

761
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,660
- What was that?
- Don't worry.

762
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,070
(The balloon bursts.)

763
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,070
Okay.

764
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,870
(The paper was barely holding out.)

765
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,170
(It burst.)

766
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,640
(It burst above Kwang Soo's head
as soon as they switched seats.)

767
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,840
He said that can't be right.

768
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,520
Gosh, Jae Suk is so funny.

769
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,720
You are so weak-minded.

770
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,790
You're unbelievable.

771
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,650
Tae Hyun is really good.

772
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,090
How could he say that?

773
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,350
He's so good at playing games.

774
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,880
Next teams.

775
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,830
Suk Jin and Haha versus
Dong Geun and Dong Min.

776
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,830
Dong Min is really good at games.

777
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,770
- He's really good.
- He's the master of games.

778
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,070
- He's a genius.
- A genius.

779
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,360
- We have experience though.
- Okay.

780
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,740
We've done this a lot before.

781
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,570
(The veteran player Suk Jin is
fighting against the game master.)

782
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,010
Isn't Wonju far from here?

783
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,370
I ate two days ago.

784
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,340
He's different. You can't do this.

785
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,370
He's no match.

786
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,670
You invested in something
without telling your wife.

787
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,840
Stir-fried frog.

788
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,820
You invested in stir-fried frog?

789
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,220
- Does it make sense?
- It makes sense.

790
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,650
- How does it make sense?
- It does.

791
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,350
- Does it?
- You invested in stir-fried frog.

792
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,880
Who would invest in stir-fried frog?

793
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,260
That's not a good idea.

794
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,650
Who would invest in stir-fried frog?

795
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,070
People in my neighborhood
are investing a lot of money in it.

796
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,390
In stir-fried frog?

797
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,190
Who didn't invest
in stir-fried frog here?

798
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,190
- I did.
- Me too.

799
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,040
I also invested in seasoned frogs.

800
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,810
Sure. I did it too.

801
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,010
Just a little.

802
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,250
- I see.
- I didn't put a lot of money in it.

803
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,550
So you invest in stir-fried frog.

804
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,110
- You should do it too.
- I see.

805
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,670
Okay.

806
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,020
Go easy on us
so we can play this for a long time.

807
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,910
- Let's play this for a long time.
- Hey.

808
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,650
Don't be so cheap.

809
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,620
It will be ripped right away.
You should hurry.

810
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,380
- You can't touch the paper.
- They have to hurry.

811
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,620
- Don't touch the paper with it.
- Let's hurry.

812
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,000
Hurry and ask a question.

813
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,890
- Hurry.
- Go ahead and ask.

814
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,690
Is your stock investment going well?

815
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,040
I'll be a member
of the national team.

816
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,590
It makes sense.

817
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,160
- Why?
- He can be in the national team...

818
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,860
- Why?
- for stock investment.

819
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,480
There's no national team
for stock investment.

820
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,140
- I know.
- That darn...

821
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,670
(The promising stock investor,
Dong Min, is short-tempered.)

822
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,990
- You can be on the national team.
- That's true.

823
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,680
You'll be on the national team
for stock investment.

824
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,850
- It makes sense.
- It totally makes sense.

825
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,150
Why did you give a relevant answer?

826
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,450
- Okay.
- Let's continue.

827
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,620
He's not so good.

828
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,920
What did you eat this morning?

829
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,650
I sleep.

830
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,690
You slept in the morning.

831
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,770
- So you didn't eat?
- Yes!

832
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,030
Why?

833
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,630
- That's not it.
- You slept instead of eating.

834
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,270
You slept in the morning.

835
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,900
- You didn't eat.
- No.

836
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,700
That's just an assumption.

837
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,510
- You sleep in the morning.
- It's an assumption.

838
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,050
"What did you eat in the morning?"

839
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,700
"I didn't eat anything."
That's an answer about food.

840
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,840
What kind of director is he?

841
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,790
(He even questions
the qualification of the director.)

842
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,090
He's not good at Korean language.

843
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,410
- Continue.
- No, it makes sense.

844
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,220
You should hurry.

845
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,560
You hope the price of your land
in Wonju will go up, right?

846
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,850
I hope it will go down... Darn.

847
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,060
(While Suk Jin struggles,)

848
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,730
(the balloon bursts.)

849
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,730
It burst.

850
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,430
- Well done.
- You keep doing things like that.

851
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,740
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.

852
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,770
Next up is So Min and Mi Joo
versus Ji Hyo and Se Chan.

853
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,310
You shouldn't think a lot
before answering.

854
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,400
You shouldn't ask
if she likes something.

855
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,670
"Where is good?"

856
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,250
"What do you think of this?"

857
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,510
It's very moist in here.

858
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,440
I think Ji Hyo is good at this.

859
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,290
- You should empty your head.
- She's always like that.

860
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,590
She often gives irrelevant answers.

861
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,520
Ji Hyo seems to have
something else on her mind.

862
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,450
Ji Hyo can be really good at this.

863
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,760
I'm scared.

864
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,890
Writer Jeon.

865
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,500
How are you feeling now?

866
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,120
So Min...

867
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,740
(Time's up.)

868
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,840
(Hesitant)

869
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,130
(What?)

870
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,200
- Hey.
- My gosh.

871
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,740
- It was too late.
- You should answer quickly.

872
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,540
She always answers
after two seconds.

873
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,310
It was too late.

874
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,980
I always think before I talk.

875
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,590
- She pours water there.
- There?

876
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,640
You poured it here?

877
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,520
Hey, that will rip right away.

878
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,950
- She's really mean.
- Let's make it quick.

879
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,090
My gosh.

880
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,920
(Devastated)

881
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,300
Let's end it quickly.

882
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,850
We don't have to make it long.

883
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,920
(However...)

884
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,070
(It's ripping already.)

885
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,000
No, wait.

886
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,690
Hang on.

887
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,900
Wait. Just a moment.

888
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,160
What was that?

889
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,200
Wait.

890
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,750
(The balloon threatens
Se Chan to death.)

891
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,750
What do we do?

892
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,670
- What do I do?
- Come here.

893
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,080
Why didn't it burst?

894
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,440
We didn't get to ask a question.

895
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,820
What was that? Hey.

896
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,760
- What was that?
- What's wrong?

897
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,260
- It wasn't even a sharp question.
- It was funny anyway.

898
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,690
You can't pour it there from now on.

899
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,890
- From now on?
- Why not?

900
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,500
- Why not?
- From now on?

901
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,890
- Se Chan.
- Kwang Soo and I were...

902
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,300
- Hang on.
- I'm sorry.

903
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,200
You can't say he's handsome.

904
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,160
Tell me three reasons
why you love your wife.

905
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,870
She's pretty, nice, and rich.

906
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,750
(I love you, honey.)

907
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,170
- This is good.
- She's a perfect wife.

908
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,610
Tell me three occupations
of the men you dated.

909
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,320
Idol artist, actor, and news anchor.

910
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,150
(Idol artist, actor,
and news anchor)

911
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,590
- Good. This is Mi Joo.
- Well done.

912
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,450
- Good.
- This is Mi Joo.

913
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,300
- Okay!
- You did a good job.

914
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,860
- She did a good job.
- It's a shame.

915
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,230
In the order of the ranking,

916
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,360
Jong Kook and Tae Hyun who came in
1st will receive 15 coins.

917
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,400
15 coins?

918
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,660
- Okay.
- 15 coins?

919
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,580
So Min and Mi Joo will receive
12 coins.

920
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,480
Team Dong Geun and Team Yeon Jun
will receive nine coins.

921
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,840
The rest teams will receive
six coins.

922
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,750
- That's quite a lot.
- Six coins?

923
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,840
(The bottom 3 teams obtained
6 coins.)

924
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,790
I'll announce the three people...

925
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,260
who got the most penalty badges
so far and how many badges they got.

926
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,850
- Already?
- Is there any?

927
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,760
- None of us has any enemies here.
- That's not possible.

928
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,230
(Some of us already got
penalty badges?)

929
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,390
That's not possible.

930
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,470
(Some of them went to the staff
to give others penalty badges.)

931
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,360
Two of you are in first place.

932
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,070
- Already?
- Two of us?

933
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,090
Each of them received
one penalty badge.

934
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,270
- What?
- So soon?

935
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,040
(Who purchased 1 penalty badge
for 3 coins already?)

936
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,170
(Before the mission began...)

937
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,050
Why would you talk to them
when you have seniority over them?

938
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,870
I'll sort things out by myself.

939
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,050
- So don't talk to them.
- Then...

940
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,170
- Then I'll give you a mission.
- Okay.

941
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,940
(After Dong Min gave him a mission,)

942
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,950
(Se Chan quietly came up to
a staff member in a red cap.)

943
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,950
I just hate her.
She was so mean in the game.

944
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,490
(He turned in 3 coins to give So Min
1 penalty badge.)

945
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,060
- One badge?
- Yes.

946
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,300
For one coin, we'll tell you
who they are via text message.

947
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,190
No one would do that
when they have only one badge.

948
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,130
We would want to know
when we have at least five.

949
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,570
Someone turned three coins in.

950
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,770
- 3 coins for each badge.
- Yes, to give someone 1 badge.

951
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,780
- 3 coins for each badge.
- You need 3 coins...

952
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,630
- to give 1 person 1 penalty badge.
- Each of them got 1 badge.

953
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,840
Who received it?

954
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,640
Kwang Soo, you got one badge.

955
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,670
(Kwang Soo, you got one badge.)

956
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,020
- Did you turn your coins in?
- Yes.

957
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,340
- Earlier...
- When did you do that?

958
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,110
What's wrong with him?
Why would say that to Kwang Soo?

959
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,910
- I wrote your name on it.
- You're not supposed to say it.

960
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,760
- Don't let him sway you.
- He might give you a penalty badge.

961
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,330
- Don't let him sway you.
- Is what he said true?

962
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,850
I turned three coins in
as soon as I received the coins.

963
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,470
- Don't let him sway you.
- I said, don't say it to him.

964
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,470
- Why would he do that to me?
- Don't tell others.

965
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,770
- You shouldn't.
- Don't speak to Tae Hyun today.

966
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,270
- What he said about the movie...
- Calm down.

967
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,770
- Don't speak to Tae Hyun.
- It wasn't true.

968
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,470
- Don't talk to him today.
- I'm happy that I got the part.

969
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,360
Hey, listen to me.
Don't speak to Tae Hyun.

970
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,080
- Did he really write my name?
- Stop it.

971
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,670
I turned in the coins
because I didn't know.

972
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,700
- I won't talk about it anymore.
- They won 15 coins.

973
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,580
Everyone, you're hungry, aren't you?

974
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,580
- Yes!
- Yes!

975
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,550
- We'll have a lunch break now.
- Okay.

976
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,990
Come with your partner
to receive a lunchbox.

977
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,320
You can eat at 1 of the 3 places
we prepared.

978
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,830
2 teams will team up
for the 2nd mission.

979
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,560
- Really?
- So you should talk...

980
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,760
to the team you want
and get an agreement.

981
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,160
- Okay. I see.
- Okay.

982
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,770
Good. There are six seats here.

983
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,800
Dong Min.

984
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,400
You know us.

985
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,400
You should team up with us.

986
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,580
No, he should team up with us.

987
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,630
Dong Geun.

988
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,780
- But...
- Come on. Dong Min.

989
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,780
Team Dong-Dong,
enjoy your lunch.

990
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,340
- Enjoy your lunch.
- We'll always be polite.

991
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,020
- You too.
- We want to team up with you two.

992
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,550
- I'm glad you're my friend.
- Look at them.

993
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,720
- Look how rude they are.
- Hey.

994
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,560
- Don't try so hard to please him.
- Are you his minion or what?

995
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,380
- I feel a little uncomfortable.
- It's good to be treated nicely.

996
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,490
- That sounds amazing.
- Of course.

997
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,730
I want to drink some water
before I start eating.

998
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,160
- Water? Just a moment.
- Yes.

999
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,270
Good. Se Chan is so thoughtful.

1000
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,660
- Hey, think about it.
- We don't do that.

1001
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,630
Suk Jin wouldn't go
and fetch you water.

1002
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,860
- Hey, bring it here.
- Here you go.

1003
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,470
- I'll open it for him.
- Bring it here.

1004
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,980
You don't have to open it for him.

1005
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,040
Dong Min says he's thirsty!

1006
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,940
- I can do this much for him.
- Thanks.

1007
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,480
- You didn't have to do this.
- You don't have soup. Here you go.

1008
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,490
- But first,
- Yes?

1009
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,020
each team must be clear
about their goal...

1010
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,560
in this race.

1011
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,790
- Suk Jin, is your team's goal...
- Yes?

1012
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,230
to win or to avoid the penalty?
What is your goal?

1013
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,970
- To win.
- Our goal is to avoid the penalty.

1014
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,660
- No, to avoid the penalty.
- I want to win.

1015
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,240
- You two must come to an agreement.
- I know.

1016
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,840
Suk Jin, why do you have
no desire to win?

1017
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,130
- Gosh.
- It's not like that.

1018
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,930
They don't agree with each other
when they're on the same team.

1019
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,670
- I'm too uncomfortable to eat.
- Calm down.

1020
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,670
We'll come to an agreement soon.

1021
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,100
- We share the same goal.
- It won't take long.

1022
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,510
- What is it?
- 1, 2, 3.

1023
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,520
- 1, 2, 3. Avoiding the penalty.
- Avoiding the penalty.

1024
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,640
(Avoiding the penalty
is their goal.)

1025
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,940
- Good. That's more like it.
- Absolutely.

1026
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,180
A band of misfits like them...

1027
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
- Our goal is...
- 1, 2, 3.

1028
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,720
- Team Dong-Dong's win.
- Team Dong-Dong's win.

1029
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,850
- That's our goal.
- Oh, my.

1030
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,420
That means they'll betray you.

1031
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,450
I mean,

1032
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,390
saying such a thing in front of
the cameras makes me uncomfortable.

1033
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,470
(He's acting prissy.)

1034
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,240
Gosh, seriously.

1035
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,190
I'll explain our first strategy.

1036
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,240
Let's call us good teams.

1037
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,930
- Okay.
- And the other teams are...

1038
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,370
bad teams, for example.

1039
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,480
Our first strategy is to make
the bad teams use a lot of coins.

1040
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,080
- I see.
- How are we going to do that?

1041
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,050
Each of us will have to get
one penalty badge.

1042
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,090
- 1 penalty badge?
- 1 badge costs 3 coins, right?

1043
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,390
So they'll have to spend 18 coins.
Got it?

1044
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:16,550
Meanwhile... For example, everyone
except for Ji Hyo gets one badge,

1045
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,220
- and Ji Hyo gets two.
- Okay.

1046
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,620
Then we make sure the other team's
members get more than two badges,

1047
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,160
so she can avoid coming in last.

1048
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,340
- She can avoid coming in last.
- Exactly.

1049
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,510
- He sure is so smart.
- You understand what I said, right?

1050
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,370
He's saying that we all are on
the same team from this moment on.

1051
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,300
We're eating together.
What does it mean?

1052
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,510
- It means that we're a family now.
- Yes.

1053
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,780
Have you ever heard
the oath of the peach garden?

1054
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,240
Do you know what "oath" means?

1055
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,490
- Pardon?
- What does "oath" mean?

1056
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,180
I think it means to go back.

1057
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
- "To go back"?
- Yes.

1058
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,490
It means there's no turning back.
That's what it means.

1059
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,160
The three of them swore they won't
go back on their promises...

1060
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,120
and be loyal to one another
for the rest of their lives.

1061
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,620
(While they're forming an alliance
under Dong Min's lead...)

1062
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,300
Kwang Soo,
you won't betray us, right?

1063
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,570
- Of course, I won't.
- Don't worry.

1064
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,140
There's no reason
for betraying each other.

1065
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,760
We must do well
at the next mission...

1066
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,010
and gain as many coins as possible.

1067
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,140
We don't have so many coins
now either.

1068
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,570
(Setting up a camera)

1069
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,220
(Staring)

1070
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,390
How many coins do you two have?

1071
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,350
Only three of us are in the frame.
Is that okay?

1072
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,550
(The screen of the camera
that was just set up)

1073
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,550
- There's...
- It's okay.

1074
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,820
I'm sorry, but can you
move your soup aside?

1075
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,370
(I'm sorry, but can you
move your soup aside?)

1076
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,970
- Sure. I'll move it, but...
- Listen to me.

1077
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,100
I might dump the soup on you.

1078
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,390
(I'll move it,
but I might dump the soup on you.)

1079
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,870
Don't worry about it.
I'm filming you right now.

1080
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,240
What do you mean by that?

1081
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,870
I was asked to film you secretly.

1082
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,840
- Seriously...
- Look. There's a camera here.

1083
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,550
- I'm filming you right now.
- I guess it's true.

1084
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,280
By the way, why did he set up
the camera like that?

1085
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,550
We would all in the frame
if he put it in the middle.

1086
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,550
Exactly.

1087
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,390
But he put it in the corner,
and Kwang Soo is out of the frame.

1088
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,120
He even hit me with the elbow
to make me move to the side.

1089
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,760
Don't worry about it.
That's not a problem.

1090
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,030
You should worry about Tae Hyun.
He's trying to...

1091
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,120
Could it be true?
Should I check if it's true?

1092
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,530
If he really gave me a badge,
I won't let it slide.

1093
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,260
- If he did what?
- If he gave me a badge,

1094
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,030
I'll get back at him right away.

1095
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,840
- By any means...
- That's your problem.

1096
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,070
You don't have many coins,
but he has a lot.

1097
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,780
(Before the 1st mission began...)

1098
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,780
- No one is around us, right?
- Yes.

1099
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,320
Here you go. I want to give a badge
to Kwang Soo.

1100
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,950
- You're turning in 3 coins.
- Yes, for 1 penalty badge.

1101
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,760
(Huening Kai gave a penalty badge
to Kwang Soo!)

1102
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,390
I'm absolutely sure that Tae Hyun
gave you a badge.

1103
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,120
I think so too.

1104
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,200
There's no way...

1105
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,450
(He has no idea
that Huening Kai gave him a badge.)

1106
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,030
that we both got a badge, right?
That can't be.

1107
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,930
(The lunch break ended when they
only became more suspicious.)

1108
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,840
- She'll probably get the penalty.
- You shouldn't do that.

1109
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,410
Who on earth spent
so many coins already?

1110
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,660
- Right?
- I'd spend my coins all at once.

1111
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,780
Who were they?

1112
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,370
What's wrong with him?

1113
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,550
This is not how it works, Tae Hyun.

1114
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,780
- You shouldn't let others know.
- This isn't how it works.

1115
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,350
- Come on, Tae Hyun.
- Hey, since I got...

1116
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,180
more coins, I'll spend
as many as I want.

1117
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,490
Where did all your coins go?

1118
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,490
(Where did all your coins go?)

1119
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,620
(Dong Min is happy that Tae Hyun is
spending coins thoughtlessly.)

1120
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,820
- Are you serious?
- Hey.

1121
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,990
I don't know either.
I gave him all the coins we won.

1122
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,620
Why did you give him all of them?

1123
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,260
- I let him do whatever he wants.
- I thought I should...

1124
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,620
I want him to enjoy himself since he
came on the show after a long time.

1125
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,570
Guys, don't worry about him. I'll
give him as many badges as I can.

1126
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,870
- Okay.
- Okay.

1127
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,870
My gosh.

1128
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,510
In this mission,
two teams will pair up.

1129
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,180
Tell me which team your team
will team up with.

1130
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,240
- Is this your final decision?
- Yes.

1131
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
- The four of us.
- All right.

1132
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,200
- My team and Team Dong-Dong.
- Okay.

1133
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,370
- Each team has four members.
- With Se Chan's team?

1134
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,370
Okay. Good.

1135
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,970
- I'm happy with it.
- Me too. I feel light-hearted.

1136
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,220
You two look like
a team of old thieves.

1137
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,350
Shut it. Shut your mouth.

1138
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,550
- The two of them...
- They look like...

1139
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,280
- look like...
- a team of old thieves.

1140
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,120
- the thieves from "Home Alone".
- Exactly.

1141
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,490
- Reenact a scene from the movie.
- I said, shut it.

1142
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,120
Now, we're going to reveal
the second mission.

1143
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,570
Huening Kai and Yeon Jun, could you
please turn that around?

1144
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,990
- Yes.
- What could it be? I'm curious.

1145
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,490
- Go ahead.
- They got unlucky.

1146
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,660
Their opponent team was
too strong.

1147
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,430
- You're right.
- Of course.

1148
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,840
- What's that?
- It's a board game.

1149
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
What is it?

1150
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,050
Oh, my goodness.
We're playing this game?

1151
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,100
It looks just like the famous game.

1152
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,010
- Have you ever played this?
- They did a good job at making it.

1153
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,120
Are you good at this game?

1154
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,550
I'm so good at it.

1155
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,740
For the second mission,

1156
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,090
we changed a few things of
the world travel board game...

1157
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,930
we all played with friends.
It's Into the World with Friends.

1158
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,850
You will be divided into four teams.

1159
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,160
This game has similar basic rules.

1160
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,870
The 4 teams will take turns
rolling 2 dice,

1161
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,990
and move your marker
according to the result.

1162
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,260
Build a hotel or a villa
in the ownerless city...

1163
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,160
and receive a fee from other teams
that stop there.

1164
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,600
- Can you see the prices?
- Yes.

1165
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,240
That's the amount you pay
for building a villa or a hotel.

1166
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,470
You have to pay double the amount
when you stop there.

1167
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,970
- Understood.
- It's simple, right?

1168
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,450
- Okay.
- I think...

1169
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,550
I told you that there are
two dice, right?

1170
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,850
One has numbers,
and the other has go, back,

1171
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,010
- and go double.
- Oh, I see.

1172
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,390
- 3 and double means 6 moves?
- Exactly.

1173
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,300
The game ends in 30 minutes.

1174
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,490
The team
with the most game money...

1175
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,800
- will receive the most coins.
- Right.

1176
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,930
This is too easy.

1177
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,240
They're the two bossiest members
on Running Man.

1178
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,260
This is too easy.

1179
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,340
- Let's do this!
- All right.

1180
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,470
I've never tried this before.

1181
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,280
- What should we get?
- "Jiseokjin World"!

1182
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,970
- What was your channel?
- It's "Haha PD".

1183
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,200
Oh, right. "Haha PD".

1184
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,910
He doesn't know.

1185
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,010
What should we do to win?

1186
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,280
- Getting a higher number?
- Yes, that'd be great.

1187
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,240
- Okay. Let's begin.
- You need to stop at a good city.

1188
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,950
- Here we go.
- You get paid when you pass Go.

1189
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,680
- Go to the deserted island.
- 2, 3.

1190
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,280
I hope they stop
at the deserted island.

1191
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,720
- 2 and go.
- Oh, we got 2.

1192
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,850
- They got two. It's Beijing.
- It's Beijing.

1193
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,620
Pay 80 dollars for a villa
or 160 dollars for a hotel.

1194
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,120
- You should build one.
- How much do we start with?

1195
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,390
Hey, let's just build a hotel.

1196
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,240
- Let's build a hotel.
- That's good.

1197
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,100
- You should buy it no matter what.
- Exactly.

1198
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,870
We don't have much time,
so you should buy it no matter what.

1199
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,870
Every city you can buy.

1200
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,740
- What's "back"?
- We just have to avoid number two.

1201
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,870
Anything else would be okay.

1202
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,740
- Roll the dice.
- You should move backward.

1203
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,740
Getting a back would be great now.

1204
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,570
- We got a go.
- Nice.

1205
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,370
- Jakarta!
- Buy it.

1206
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,820
- Buy it.
- It's 200 dollars.

1207
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,120
(They're building a hotel.)

1208
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,220
- We're in trouble.
- Director.

1209
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,550
What happens if we get
a back from the start?

1210
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,090
You can't move.

1211
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,450
- Oh, we can't move at all.
- I see.

1212
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,850
- We can't move?
- Shouldn't we move backward?

1213
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,220
- We don't move backward?
- You have to go back.

1214
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,350
You have to let us move backward.

1215
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,990
That's how we can buy
the expensive land.

1216
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,220
We should be allowed to do that.

1217
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,530
Why are you angry, Mr. Jang?

1218
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,340
- It should be allowed.
- This is just a game.

1219
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,800
Why write "back" on the dice then?

1220
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,510
- Write "stay" instead.
- It's just for the first roll.

1221
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,640
(It only applies to the first roll.)

1222
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,700
You know,

1223
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,680
Bo Pil has met
his fair share of celebrities,

1224
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,280
but none like Dong Min.

1225
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,780
Someone who complains directly.

1226
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,740
- He's the first since Jessi.
- Since Jessi.

1227
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,350
Team Dong-Dong will go next.

1228
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,490
Sure, okay.

1229
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,890
- We need a double, Dong Min.
- A double.

1230
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,090
Roll a six.

1231
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,390
- A double.
- 1, 2, 3.

1232
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,530
- No way.
- That'd be really lucky.

1233
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,550
I bet we'll roll a "back".

1234
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,050
- Back.
- Hold on.

1235
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,320
- Move them backward.
- You can't.

1236
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,200
- Hold on.
- We go four steps back.

1237
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,840
- You have to stay where you are.
- They can't move yet.

1238
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,700
You're off to a tough start.

1239
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,340
They're both bad
at rolling good numbers.

1240
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,870
What you least want
is a 2 or a 6.

1241
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,910
- Okay!
- Roll "back" instead.

1242
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,370
- Let's go.
- Roll two.

1243
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,870
1, 2, 3.

1244
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,320
Don't worry.
We'll end up winning anyway.

1245
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,370
Back?

1246
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,510
- Two!
- All right!

1247
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,620
Yes!

1248
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,620
Okay.

1249
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,820
- Pay up 320 dollars.
- What did I tell you?

1250
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,850
We have to pay?

1251
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,320
Pay us 320 dollars.

1252
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,390
That was the cheaper one,
so we're fine.

1253
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,160
Pay up if you booked a room
at our hotel.

1254
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,320
That'll be 320 dollars.

1255
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,160
- We need to pay them.
- What's funny though...

1256
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,260
that constructing the hotel
is 160 dollars,

1257
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,320
but a room is 320 dollars a night.

1258
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,720
Okay.

1259
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,390
- I'll roll this one.
- Sure.

1260
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,030
- Roll a four.
- Here we go.

1261
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,240
- Roll a 4.
- 1.

1262
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,340
- 1, 2...
- 4, 4...

1263
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,470
4, 4, 4...

1264
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,640
Two and go.

1265
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,350
Two and go.

1266
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,470
(Golden Key card)

1267
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,300
- Wait.
- The Golden Key card!

1268
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,620
- What's our card?
- "Sell at half the price."

1269
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,950
- "To your friends..."
- "Give them money."

1270
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,620
- I'd like that one.
- 100 dollars each.

1271
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,350
- "Sell at half the price."
- "Go to the deserted island."

1272
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,820
You can show them.

1273
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,430
(They pick a card from the stack.)

1274
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,430
Darn.

1275
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,550
- It's actually beneficial.
- No way!

1276
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,100
- Gosh.
- If only someone else chose it.

1277
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,870
- What is it?
- Darn.

1278
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,470
"The old-age pension has been paid."

1279
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,160
"Suk Jin, the eldest, will receive
200 dollars from the bank."

1280
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,930
Nice.

1281
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,930
- You're receiving a pension?
- It's so fitting.

1282
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,010
- This...
- You're receiving a pension?

1283
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,640
I would've received it
regardless of who picked the card.

1284
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,240
What a waste.

1285
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,180
- If only someone else chose it.
- Exactly.

1286
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,620
Isn't it fitting?

1287
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,090
- Suk Jin...
- You're being treated well.

1288
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,410
- You're being treated well.
- You are.

1289
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,120
- Roll a 5.
- No, roll a 6.

1290
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,390
- 6 and go.
- 6.

1291
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,760
- Back.
- It's "back".

1292
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Okay, you still can't move yet.

1293
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,820
We'll be at the starting line
forever at this rate.

1294
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,990
Why can't you get going?

1295
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,070
- Dong Min...
- It's all right.

1296
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,470
It's fine. It's all right.

1297
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,300
- Go ahead.
- Let's land on Seoul.

1298
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,640
- 1, 2, 3.
- 3.

1299
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,100
- Roll a four.
- Back.

1300
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,470
- Back. Okay, that's good.
- Nice.

1301
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,240
- It's not bad.
- Taipei.

1302
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,370
- Let's buy it.
- I thought we moved forward.

1303
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,450
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1304
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,870
- Is that 100 dollars?
- Yes.

1305
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,780
I'm better at this back home.

1306
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,590
- Let's do this.
- And go.

1307
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,780
We're currently the richest.

1308
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,950
- Go.
- Five.

1309
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,950
1, 2, 3, 4.

1310
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,760
- Buy Athens. We have the money.
- Of course.

1311
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,120
Buy a hotel.

1312
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,530
- 280 dollars.
- 280.

1313
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,760
- It's not even a lot.
- 30 minutes.

1314
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,620
- Land on Athens and we'll see.
- Don't roll a "back".

1315
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,930
That's 28 times...

1316
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,570
- Can we roll one at a time?
- You can.

1317
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,570
Six.

1318
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,800
- Go.
- One at a time...

1319
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,970
Can we construct another?

1320
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,570
- Yes.
- You can construct a villa.

1321
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,700
Then construct one.

1322
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,970
- Okay.
- Roll a "back".

1323
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,700
- Dong Geun, roll a "back".
- Back!

1324
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,050
- Back.
- Back.

1325
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,140
Go!

1326
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,450
- He rolled a "go".
- Go...

1327
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,140
- Roll 3, 4, or 5.
- You guys...

1328
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,620
- 3, 4, or 5.
- Roll a 2.

1329
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,450
- 2.
- 3, 4, or 5.

1330
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,660
- Roll a 1.
- 3, 4, or 5.

1331
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,280
- 2.
- 3, 4, or 5.

1332
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
3, 4, or 5.

1333
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,760
- A three!
- Nice.

1334
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,890
- Three.
- That's Manila.

1335
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,990
Three. All right!

1336
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,570
- Buy the darn thing.
- Get us a hotel.

1337
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,260
- That's right.
- Get a hotel.

1338
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,370
- A hotel.
- Buy a hotel.

1339
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,490
Dong Geun, nice.

1340
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,070
(They celebrate by dancing
to "Alleyway".)

1341
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,200
Nice.

1342
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,800
- Do this to collect money.
- Sure.

1343
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,680
(They can annoy the others
while doing so.)

1344
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,140
A double.

1345
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,780
- A double is good.
- Roll a "back".

1346
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,120
- Back.
- Then...

1347
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,320
- Back.
- A double.

1348
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,740
- Back!
- Back.

1349
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,320
Roll a six.

1350
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,990
- Roll a six.
- Get ready to collect.

1351
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,090
Roll a six.

1352
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,320
- Roll a six.
- Get ready to collect.

1353
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,590
- 1 and 2 are fine.
- 5 or 2.

1354
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,950
5 or 2.

1355
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,490
- 5 or 2.
- Yes, 5 or 2.

1356
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,700
- Roll a 3.
- 6.

1357
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,760
- 3.
- 5 or 2.

1358
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,820
1 or 4.

1359
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,370
- One.
- The deserted island.

1360
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,760
- The deserted island.
- We're on the deserted island.

1361
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,570
The deserted island!

1362
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,870
That's not so bad.

1363
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,370
At least we don't
have to pay anyone.

1364
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,410
I guess.

1365
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,780
You have to skip a turn
while on the deserted island...

1366
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,510
and draw on a beard
since you can't shave.

1367
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,570
Nice!

1368
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,300
A beard. Good.

1369
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,350
You'll both draw on a beard.

1370
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,640
Turn into Woong's father.

1371
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,680
Woong's father.

1372
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,550
- Is this a permanent marker?
- Of course not.

1373
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,220
- What the...
- Hold on a second.

1374
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,050
Are you kidding me?

1375
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,620
(He looks sly.)

1376
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,160
- It looks perfect on him.
- A beard...

1377
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,300
Is that allowed?

1378
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,200
- Couldn't you give me a beard...
- It's done.

1379
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,320
that makes me look like a gentleman?

1380
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,640
This isn't friendly in any way.

1381
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,990
I'd like those Groucho glasses.

1382
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,160
It suits you so well.

1383
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,340
- No way.
- I wanted to look like a gentleman.

1384
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,570
(Painter Yoo is satisfied
by his masterpiece.)

1385
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,510
- It suits you.
- Let's keep going.

1386
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,350
- Roll a four.
- Here we go.

1387
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,780
- 1 would be great.
- Roll a 4.

1388
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,140
Four and go.

1389
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,240
- Roll 1.
- 4.

1390
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,590
(Please roll a 1.)

1391
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,820
- 4.
- 1.

1392
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,990
(They roll a 1.)

1393
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,590
(Team Red has a villa and hotel
and will collect 600 dollars.)

1394
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,530
(They end up staying at a place
that costs 600 dollars.)

1395
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:51,600
Nice.

1396
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,700
They're so annoying.

1397
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,390
Can they be more annoying?

1398
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,390
(They can't contain their joy.)

1399
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,760
Didn't you land on it earlier?

1400
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,030
They're raking in the cash.

1401
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,340
They're suddenly collecting.

1402
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,470
- How much is it?
- 600 dollars.

1403
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,280
Answer quicker, darn it.

1404
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,410
He's so on edge.

1405
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,470
Answer quicker.

1406
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,780
- This is just a game.
- Let's speed things up.

1407
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,220
It's just supposed to be a fun game.

1408
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,410
- Don't be like that.
- Let's speed things up!

1409
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,850
Shove that in there.

1410
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,590
Hold on a second.
You didn't pay the full amount.

1411
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,350
- Wait.
- We did!

1412
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,590
I only received 400 dollars.

1413
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,660
- We paid up.
- 200 dollars is missing.

1414
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,850
- We paid 600.
- We paid up.

1415
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,820
- Hand the rest over.
- We paid it all.

1416
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,950
The 200 dollars...

1417
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,300
We paid!

1418
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,430
We paid the whole amount.

1419
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,490
- What do you mean we paid less?
- Pay the rest.

1420
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,240
- Pay up.
- We paid 600 dollars.

1421
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,300
We missed the transaction.

1422
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,600
- Pay up the rest.
- We paid 600 dollars.

1423
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,300
You didn't see the transaction?

1424
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,800
- Hey.
- We paid up.

1425
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,930
Pay up the rest.

1426
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,470
Get lost!

1427
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,510
- What...
- Who plays board games this way?

1428
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,280
How does this make sense?

1429
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,640
They should pay up.

1430
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,680
This goes against international law.

1431
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,050
We paid the whole amount too.

1432
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,090
- Guys.
- That's right!

1433
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,160
From now on,
you'll pay right in front of us.

1434
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,720
"From now on"?

1435
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,430
- "From now on"?
- Sure.

1436
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,200
Just because he's strong...

1437
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,430
- Why you...
- No way.

1438
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,030
Kwang Soo, darn it.

1439
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,370
Yeon Jun, go ahead.

1440
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,660
Kwang Soo, darn it.

1441
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:09,530
Kwang Soo...

1442
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,700
Kwang Soo!

1443
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,070
(I'll submit penalty badges.)

1444
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,200
I'm sorry!

1445
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,350
(He suddenly becomes polite.)

1446
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,510
- What's wrong with you?
- I was only joking.

1447
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,370
- Are you kidding me?
- Why are you doing this?

1448
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,680
- Why...
- I gave you 100 dollars.

1449
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,120
Our team paid up.

1450
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,180
- He gave Tae Hyun money.
- Unbelievable.

1451
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,390
Why did you give him 100 dollars?

1452
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:26,450
Whatever...

1453
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,950
(What's good is good, right?)

1454
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,220
Give back the 100 dollars.

1455
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,160
- Give it back.
- You can't take it back.

1456
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,530
You can't take it back.

1457
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,820
- Give it back.
- Are you kidding me?

1458
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,260
Why would you bribe him?

1459
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:37,300
- We barely have money ourselves.
- Tae Hyun,

1460
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,430
write down Jae Suk's name instead.
Go and hand it in.

1461
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,470
- Hey!
- Should I?

1462
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,010
- You can change your target.
- Got it.

1463
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,800
- Write his name instead.
- Unbelievable.

1464
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,930
Here you go.

1465
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,700
What are you doing?

1466
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,780
That's from our team's fund.

1467
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,100
- Fine. Tae Hyun?
- Hey.

1468
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,410
That's enough, okay?

1469
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,870
They're unbelievable.

1470
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:53,970
This is hilarious.

1471
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,120
Get back here.

1472
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,410
We can roll anything but a three.

1473
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:57,640
- A three.
- Right.

1474
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,280
- Dong Min.
- Roll a three!

1475
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,450
(Please roll a 3!)

1476
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,660
- Roll a three!
- Double...

1477
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,780
- Go and three.
- Go and three.

1478
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,160
- Roll a 3.
- Roll a 2.

1479
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,320
- A three.
- The deserted island.

1480
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,390
- 3.
- 3!

1481
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,570
(Did they roll a 3
like Team Yellow wanted?)

1482
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,390
(It rolled over to a 6
at the last second!)

1483
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:12,660
It's a six!

1484
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,870
We're on London.

1485
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,530
- Let's buy.
- Yes, buy it.

1486
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,600
Buy it.

1487
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,840
But a hotel.

1488
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,800
- This must be right up your alley.
- It is.

1489
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,780
Roll a 2, 4, or 5.

1490
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,870
Make sure it's a "go" first.

1491
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,680
- A go.
- Roll a 2, 4, or 5.

1492
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,850
- Go and 3.
- Roll a 6.

1493
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,010
- 3.
- 6.

1494
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,740
(6: Team Green's land,
3: Team Yellow's land)

1495
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,510
- Roll a 2, 4, or 5.
- 6!

1496
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,120
Darn!

1497
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,720
(Darn!)

1498
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,050
The deserted island
is better I guess.

1499
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,220
We're good.

1500
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,600
The deserted island.

1501
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,100
We'll take a break.

1502
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,570
(Instead, a beard
must be drawn on them.)

1503
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,200
Nose hairs?

1504
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:45,930
(Blowing)

1505
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,430
(Nose hair flew out
after sneezing.)

1506
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,660
Black snot.

1507
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,870
- That's cute.
- It's not bad.

1508
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,030
Face this way.

1509
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,180
(Her facial muscles
are free-spirited.)

1510
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,180
- What on earth?
- Can you stay still?

1511
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,850
This isn't a photo shoot, you know.

1512
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,140
- All right.
- Draw it all around her mouth.

1513
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,550
What the...

1514
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,990
(Pointillism)

1515
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,850
I can't look. I have trypophobia!

1516
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,490
I can't look!

1517
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,430
This is the beard I wanted.

1518
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:11,620
She looks like a geezer.

1519
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,600
It's the worst beard I've ever seen.

1520
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,600
(How do I look?)

1521
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,300
(Startled)

1522
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,430
(Even Team Yellow
is shocked by her beard.)

1523
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,800
- Not like that.
- I can't see it.

1524
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,300
At least we get to take a break.

1525
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,010
We just need to avoid
rolling a three.

1526
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,340
- Sure, a three.
- No one's rolled a double, right?

1527
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,870
- Roll a one.
- Give me a double.

1528
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:30,950
- Go.
- Roll a four.

1529
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,510
- 4.
- Just avoid rolling a 4.

1530
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,910
(Roll a 4, and they'll end up
at Team Green's London hotel.)

1531
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,910
- Just avoid rolling a 4.
- 4.

1532
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,820
- 1.
- Just avoid rolling a 4.

1533
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,850
- Keep rolling.
- Four!

1534
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:39,050
- Keep rolling.
- Four!

1535
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,410
(It's a 4!)

1536
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:41,450
A four!

1537
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,680
(They collect 680 dollars
while dancing to "Alleyway".)

1538
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,550
(The old thieves lose 680 dollars.)

1539
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,300
(We're here to collect!)

1540
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,570
- That'll be 680 dollars.
- 680?

1541
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,740
680 dollars?

1542
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,260
It serves you right
for being so cocky.

1543
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,010
1, 2, 3, 4,

1544
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,570
- 5, 6.
- Good luck never lasts.

1545
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,470
Yes, let's collect.

1546
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,950
This is great.

1547
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,200
- All right.
- Nice.

1548
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,410
Roll a "back".

1549
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,870
You're a master at this,
so roll a go or a back.

1550
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,950
- Go.
- Go.

1551
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,550
- Go.
- That's it.

1552
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,850
- 4.
- 6.

1553
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,450
(They'll be in danger
if they roll above a 4.)

1554
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:18,260
- 4.
- 5.

1555
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,800
- 6.
- 4, 5, or 6.

1556
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,430
(They'll be on Team Yellow's land
if they roll a 5.)

1557
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,070
- 4, 5, or 6.
- 4, 5, or 6.

1558
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,470
(The cheer captain
appears out of nowhere.)

1559
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:28,510
(4, 5, and 6 bring them together.)

1560
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,640
- Off it goes.
- Keep rolling.

1561
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,140
- 6!
- 6!

1562
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,870
(Six!)

1563
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,350
(Let's collect!)

1564
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,570
(We're doomed.)

1565
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,720
- Six.
- Bring on the money.

1566
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,090
- That's right.
- Give us the money.

1567
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,320
How much is it?
That'll be 320 dollars.

1568
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,660
- Okay!
- 320 dollars.

1569
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,620
(Why did we have to roll a 6?)

1570
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,390
- 2, 5, or 6.
- It's our turn now.

1571
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,930
- 2, 5, or 6.
- 1, 2...

1572
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,350
- Let's do it.
- It belongs to Team Blue, right?

1573
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,720
Tae Hyun, let's roll the dice.

1574
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,200
I hope they get a go. Get a go.

1575
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,370
- Nice.
- A back is better.

1576
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,640
- A back is better at this point.
- You're right.

1577
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,840
(They have to pay a fee
if they get 2, 5, or 6.)

1578
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,200
- Get a 5.
- 4. 4.

1579
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,570
- 5.
- 1 or 3.

1580
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:10,370
- Play the music right away.
- Get a 2. Please. 2. 2.

1581
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,370
(If they get a 5,
they'll go to Team Green's land.)

1582
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,620
(What number could Team Blue get?)

1583
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,720
- 2.
- 5.

1584
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,950
- It's a five!
- Yes!

1585
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,850
(Five!)

1586
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,910
(Disappointed)

1587
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,600
(They're collecting a fee
for the 3rd time in a row.)

1588
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,430
(Give us money.)

1589
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,470
Gosh. This is ridiculous.

1590
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,070
What's this?

1591
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,760
How much do we owe you?

1592
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:33,890
How much is it?

1593
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,370
It's not very expensive.

1594
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:36,660
It's 320 dollars.

1595
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,570
They've received a lot of money.

1596
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,180
320 dollars. Okay.

1597
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,680
Gosh. Why did we stop there?

1598
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,180
Let's go. Where are we?
We're the yellow one, right?

1599
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,240
We're in London.

1600
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,410
(Next up is Team Yellow
who haven't made much progress.)

1601
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,620
- I want to buy that city.
- Roll it.

1602
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,180
- I want a back.
- Let's get a double go.

1603
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:49,680
- They'll move forward.
- Let's keep moving.

1604
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,660
- Let's go as far as we can.
- 4. 4.

1605
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,120
- One? Good.
- Let's go. Let's go far away.

1606
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,850
(They moved only 1 step.)

1607
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,450
- Golden Key card? Okay.
- Golden Key card!

1608
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:57,550
- I'll pick the card.
- I'm excited.

1609
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,120
- It should've been a four.
- I hope it's something good for us.

1610
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,430
I hope they have to perform
in front of us.

1611
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,820
- Performing a funny act.
- Something good for us.

1612
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,300
"While walking down the street,"
Darn it.

1613
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,660
What is it? Let me see.

1614
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,990
What is it? What does it say?

1615
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,410
Let me see. What is it?

1616
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,200
- Gosh. This is driving me nuts.
- It must be a bad one.

1617
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,800
"While walking down the street,"

1618
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,200
"you ran into Jong Kook
who is a gangster."

1619
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,280
- "Give him 100 dollars."
- Okay!

1620
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,950
(My gangster friend is the best.)

1621
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,370
- Okay!
- Give me 100 dollars.

1622
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,850
You call this a Golden Key card?

1623
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,140
That's just ridiculous!

1624
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,850
(Team Yellow got robbed
when they don't have much money.)

1625
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,450
This is not a Golden Key card.

1626
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,050
So there are bad ones too.

1627
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,180
Really?

1628
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,390
(Team Green's hotel in Manila)

1629
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,090
- Yeon Jun, I'm counting on you.
- Yes?

1630
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,030
- Huening Kai.
- Any number or word would be fine.

1631
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,390
You just have to avoid
getting a go and a 2 or 5.

1632
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,430
- Get a two.
- Get a two.

1633
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,370
- Get a two.
- Get a go.

1634
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,870
Go and number two.

1635
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,030
(Finally, they landed on our land.)

1636
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:46,010
(They keep getting involved
with Team Blue in bad ways.)

1637
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,430
- 400 dollars?
- 400 dollars.

1638
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,280
- We were on the deserted island.
- How much?

1639
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,600
- 400 dollars.
- I'm so happy.

1640
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,470
You didn't pay us 200 dollars.

1641
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:53,620
- That's not true.
- Yes, exactly 200 dollars.

1642
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,680
You didn't pay us 200 dollars.

1643
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,320
- He looks so upset.
- What are you talking about?

1644
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,550
You're wrong. We paid you.

1645
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,010
- Kwang Soo...
- We paid you.

1646
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:00,160
Gosh, you.

1647
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,530
- Why...
- Come on. Give us the money.

1648
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,350
- Why would you write my name...
- Pay us 400 dollars right now.

1649
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,390
Come on, Jae Suk. Pay us.

1650
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,820
You and your nose hairs...

1651
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,720
- Pay us now.
- I'm going to pull it all out.

1652
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,470
- Pay us 400 dollars now.
- You shouldn't be like this.

1653
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,240
Why would you threaten me
by writing my name on the coin?

1654
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,070
- You owe us 400 dollars.
- Look at him.

1655
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,430
What are you trying to do?

1656
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,200
- Give us 200 dollars more.
- Come on. Pay us now.

1657
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,410
The bank should say something
to him.

1658
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:20,840
You earned a lot of money.

1659
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,700
Roll your dice without any pressure.

1660
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,800
We'll win if one more team
pays us a fee.

1661
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,240
Hold the corners. That's good.

1662
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,740
Go and 3 or 4.

1663
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,740
- Go and 3 or 4.
- Go.

1664
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,850
- 3 or 4.
- That's good.

1665
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,140
- 1, 2, or 5.
- 3 or 4.

1666
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,550
- 1, 2, or 5.
- 1, 2, or 5.

1667
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,950
- 3 or 4.
- 1, 2, or 5.

1668
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,510
- 1, 2, or 5.
- 3 or 4.

1669
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:35,760
- 3 or 4.
- 1, 2, or 5.

1670
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,550
Five!

1671
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,320
- The deserted island?
- A beard.

1672
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,850
- Hey, Mi Joo.
- A beard.

1673
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,660
- A beard again.
- It's okay.

1674
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,320
- Draw a beard.
- Not again.

1675
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:45,490
Come on.

1676
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,140
- Draw an eye on her forehead.
- Draw between her eyebrows.

1677
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,410
- Draw an eye.
- Yes, on the forehead.

1678
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,470
That's awesome.
You look so cool, Mi Joo.

1679
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,300
That's cool, Mi Joo.
How many fingers do I have?

1680
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,910
- That's awesome.
- How many?

1681
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:55,100
- 1, 2, 3.
- Hey.

1682
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:56,410
(That feels so good.)

1683
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,450
That sly brat...

1684
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,820
- So Min doesn't look likable.
- Look at So Min.

1685
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,910
My gosh.

1686
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,090
(She looks like a 3-eyed man.)

1687
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,820
- Look at that. Gosh.
- You two have a staring contest.

1688
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,260
You two have a staring contest.

1689
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,010
(Neck and neck)

1690
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,990
- It's a never-ending match.
- Yes.

1691
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,720
- Until one of them washes her face.
- She looks so cute.

1692
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,620
- It's a never-ending match.
- Gosh. They won't give up.

1693
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,760
- Until one of them washes her face.
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1694
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,620
We have to pay if we get a six.
We must avoid it.

1695
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,620
- Okay.
- Really?

1696
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,700
- We must not get a six.
- Suk Jin.

1697
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,070
You should get a six
so you can go bankrupt.

1698
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,640
- Get a 6 and get some rest.
- We go bankrupt if we get a 6?

1699
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,600
- It belongs to your team, right?
- 6, okay? Yes. They should get a 6.

1700
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,030
Throw it like this. That's good.

1701
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,200
You're nervous, aren't you?

1702
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,700
- Go.
- That's great. Get a six.

1703
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,300
- Let's get ready.
- Get a six.

1704
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,620
- Six.
- They'll go bankrupt.

1705
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,850
- Not yet.
- Six.

1706
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,570
- They'll go bankrupt.
- Not yet.

1707
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:35,640
- 6.
- 6!

1708
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,240
(They got a 6!)

1709
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,820
(Shocked)

1710
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,260
(Six!)

1711
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,850
(They have to pay 1,040 dollars.)

1712
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:45,430
<i>Bankrupt, bankrupt</i>

1713
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,850
(The owners are announcing
Team Yellow's bankruptcy.)

1714
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,070
(Out of all cities, they landed
on the most expensive city.)

1715
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,570
<i>- 1,000 dollars, 1,000 dollars</i>
- 1,040 dollars.

1716
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,260
- 1,040 dollars.
<i>- 1,040 dollars</i>

1717
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,200
- We're not bankrupt yet.
<i>- 1,040 dollars</i>

1718
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,300
Give us the money.

1719
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,410
Here's 240 dollars.

1720
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:00,530
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Here's 300 dollars.

1721
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,850
10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Here you go.

1722
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:03,950
That's 1040 dollars.

1723
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,140
We had exactly 1,040 dollars left.

1724
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,240
- That's amazing.
- We need to get paid.

1725
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,740
They knew they'd go to that city
and saved the exact amount.

1726
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,550
They're house poor.

1727
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,450
- They're house poor.
- We had the exact amount left.

1728
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,510
1,040 dollars.

1729
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,220
- We'll go to Athens if we get a 2.
- 2.

1730
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,780
- That's our land.
- We can get back up again.

1731
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,260
- I hope they get a 2.
- Get a 2, so we get back up again.

1732
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,800
- 4 or 5.
- Don't you worry.

1733
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,390
- I think our team will do well.
- Go.

1734
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,870
- Great!
- Good.

1735
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,370
- 2. 2.
- 4 or 5.

1736
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,160
- 4 or 5. 4 or 5.
- 2. 2.

1737
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,660
- 4 or 5.
- 3.

1738
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,740
A Golden Key card.

1739
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,680
- We got a Golden Key card.
- Good job.

1740
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,470
- A Golden Key card.
- A Golden Key card.

1741
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,740
Good.

1742
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,320
- We're safe.
- I hope you run into a gangster.

1743
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:39,970
Run into a gangster.

1744
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,010
- I hope so too.
- What is it?

1745
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,850
- That might be better.
- "You got hired for a commercial."

1746
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,090
"Make delicious stir-fried ramyeon."
What does this mean?

1747
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,590
We have to cook ramyeon?

1748
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,260
You have to cook ramyeon.

1749
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,050
You've been chosen as the models
for an indirect advertisement.

1750
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,720
That looks so delicious.

1751
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,530
But you know...

1752
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,660
- You should pay us for that.
- Why won't we get paid?

1753
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,700
- We deserve a modeling fee.
- I've never seen that before.

1754
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,160
- I'm sorry.
- Please cook at the back.

1755
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,800
Go and eat up.

1756
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,760
Gosh. This isn't a Golden Key card.

1757
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,570
Why must we cook ramyeon
while playing the game?

1758
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,740
You should do it.

1759
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,100
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1760
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,300
(They'll decide the chef
by playing rock-paper-scissors.)

1761
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,740
Rock-paper-scissors

1762
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,120
- You lost.
- Yeon Jun, cook it.

1763
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,890
Yeon Jun, make it delicious.

1764
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:17,140
It's our turn.

1765
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,180
(The game continues.)

1766
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,390
- It's our turn.
- If we get lucky.

1767
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,550
Haha, what are you doing?
It's our turn.

1768
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,990
What was that?

1769
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,930
- They have no money.
- Is it our turn?

1770
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,300
- It's not our turn.
- 40 dollars and...

1771
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,390
- We're in Paris, right?
- They have no enthusiasm.

1772
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,200
Hey, why aren't you enthusiastic?

1773
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,300
I don't know why.

1774
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,260
- You should get a double 2 or 4.
- I'm running out of energy.

1775
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,600
It's okay. Hey, don't give up.

1776
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,840
Okay. I'll go first.

1777
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,600
They've lasted longer than expected.

1778
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,640
- Go.
- Go.

1779
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,140
- Go and 6.
- 6.

1780
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,180
- 1, 2, 3, 4,
- That's us.

1781
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,180
- 5, 6.
- They'll lose money again.

1782
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,470
- 1 R coin.
- 1 R coin.

1783
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,280
(Friendship Development Fund,
Pay 1 R coin at the information.)

1784
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,850
Things aren't going well for them.

1785
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:51,950
They lost everything.

1786
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,510
They got the bad one
they had to avoid.

1787
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:54,590
How did that happen?

1788
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:55,890
- Out of everything...
- They got unlucky.

1789
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,780
- Why did you take the coins?
- I didn't.

1790
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,760
Who stole our coins?
Gosh, you thieves.

1791
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,030
- What's wrong?
- Who stole our coins?

1792
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,970
(Who stole my coins?)

1793
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,800
- Why would anyone do that?
- What?

1794
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,990
- Are you serious?
- So Min.

1795
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,970
- It wasn't me. I swear.
- Gosh, seriously.

1796
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,070
No wonder why my bag
was moved here.

1797
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,510
But Haha, you know how things work
on Running Man.

1798
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,430
You shouldn't have left your bag
lying around.

1799
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:16,240
Why did you say you'd keep them?
You're so sloppy.

1800
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,970
But... This is different.

1801
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,970
I said we should never
steal what's in each other's bag.

1802
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:21,240
- We all are carrying our bags.
- Exactly.

1803
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,640
Why did you leave it
when everyone else was carrying it?

1804
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,050
- What were you thinking?
- Who did it?

1805
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,050
- You practically give it away.
- Fine.

1806
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,320
- You're so bold.
- Okay.

1807
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,530
- Gosh.
- Mi Joo.

1808
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,780
- He lost his coins?
- Well...

1809
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,990
(Why bother talking?)

1810
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,850
Hey, give me back my phone.

1811
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,570
(Hey, give me back my phone.)

1812
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,640
You mean jerks!

1813
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,200
Give me back my phone.

1814
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,240
(They steal everything
when you let your guard down.)

1815
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,930
How could you steal my phone?

1816
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,370
Who did that?

1817
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,240
Director, is this reasonable?

1818
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,950
How could anyone steal my phone?

1819
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,740
Haha, this is a good thing.

1820
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,590
Call your phone now. The one
whose phone rings is the thief.

1821
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:58,450
- Right? I'll call your phone.
- You're right. Let's try that.

1822
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,390
Let's make it clear. This is theft.

1823
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,990
This is theft. It's theft.

1824
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,720
- Gosh, seriously.
- Everyone...

1825
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,160
Everyone, be quiet.

1826
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,530
My phone is here.

1827
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,470
- Is it on vibrate mode?
- Who took it? Call his phone.

1828
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,800
- Hello?
- That's my phone.

1829
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,900
Hello?

1830
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,960
- Hello? We found the thief.
- Who is this?

1831
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,670
- Hey, the thief is right here.
- Who is this?

1832
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:33,460
- We found the thief.
- Really?

1833
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,500
- Yes.
- Who is this?

1834
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,340
- Haha.
- Who is this?

1835
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,730
- Isn't that Haha's phone?
- Oh, this wasn't my phone.

1836
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,210
- You had it.
- Tae Hyun, I liked you so much.

1837
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:43,780
I can't believe you!

1838
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,280
You should be careful.

1839
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,280
(Tae Hyun helped him become
more alert.)

1840
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,210
Be careful.
You must look after your belongings.

1841
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,550
Seriously.

1842
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,320
(Meanwhile, Yeon Jun works hard
with product placement.)

1843
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,150
(He pours the sauce...)

1844
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:58,780
(and mixes the sauce well.)

1845
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,500
The noodles are ready.

1846
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,800
- Really?
- Let's go and eat them.

1847
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,420
- Yeon Jun.
- They look delicious.

1848
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,960
The smell is incredible.

1849
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,360
The smell drives me crazy.

1850
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,960
It's good to see
the whole family eating together.

1851
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,070
Seriously.

1852
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,460
It's really spicy.

1853
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,130
It's really chewy.

1854
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,380
- It's spicy in a tasty way.
- That's right.

1855
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,300
Who took it?

1856
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,380
(Who took it?)

1857
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,070
Who took it?

1858
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,480
(His bag disappeared.)

1859
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,590
(Only the strap is dangling.)

1860
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:30,380
You guys are too much!

1861
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,320
You guys are too much!

1862
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,320
(You guys are too much!)

1863
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,260
He was wearing a seat belt.

1864
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,900
(The seat belt couldn't protect
his bag.)

1865
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,170
He was wearing a seat belt.

1866
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,730
- Only the strap remained.
- That's so funny.

1867
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,030
That's so funny.

1868
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,210
I was wearing it like this.

1869
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,880
(They are learning the importance
of keeping the items close.)

1870
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,900
This show...

1871
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,550
Someone with that technique
should go to jail!

1872
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,980
That technique doesn't belong
to a celebrity!

1873
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:55,840
- It's here.
- The R coins...

1874
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:57,750
Bring my R coins.

1875
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,280
It's here.

1876
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,980
Look inside the bag.

1877
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,030
He lost everything.
For goodness' sake.

1878
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,230
(The old thieves became dirt poor.)

1879
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,900
Hold on. My right kidney...

1880
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,170
Come on.

1881
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,860
(When you are on Running Man,
look after your own body.)

1882
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,190
I feel like something is missing.

1883
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,170
That was so funny.

1884
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,340
Listen.

1885
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:22,010
While the matter
doesn't concern my team,

1886
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,210
the two of them lost everything.

1887
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,510
Seriously.

1888
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,980
To tell you the truth...

1889
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,550
Do you know how sad it was?

1890
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:32,110
I stood for five minutes...

1891
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:33,690
with nothing but the strap
around my body.

1892
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,190
I am serious.

1893
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:37,820
This is too much.

1894
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,320
(While everyone was enjoying
the noodles)

1895
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:43,000
That's right.

1896
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,920
Did you take it?

1897
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:47,840
- It's tasty.
- I like it.

1898
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,840
It's tasty.

1899
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,030
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

1900
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,030
It's tasty.

1901
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,440
I know.

1902
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,630
It's spicy,
but I can't stop eating it.

1903
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,210
(He finished removing the bag
from the strap.)

1904
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:59,550
(While committed the perfect crime,)

1905
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,590
(he focused on Ji Hyo's bag
without a clue.)

1906
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,750
Suk Jin.

1907
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:08,010
(Then he took a sip of coffee
while feeling proud of himself.)

1908
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,280
This is so annoying.

1909
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,030
I am sorry, but something like this
has always happened.

1910
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,420
- You should be more careful.
- Okay.

1911
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,760
- You know,
- Look after your items.

1912
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,530
it was the 1st time in 10 years
to have nothing but the strap.

1913
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,960
(Always keep your bag on the front.)

1914
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,300
I have never seen
this kind of technique before.

1915
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,360
I saw him from afar...

1916
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,610
and thought,
"Why is he wearing a seat belt?"

1917
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,980
- That was so funny.
- It was the first time.

1918
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,780
Let's resume. All right.

1919
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,050
I will get back at those thieves.

1920
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,010
- Let's go.
- It needs to be three or higher.

1921
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,590
It needs to be three or higher.

1922
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:41,380
- There you go.
- Any number is fine.

1923
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,780
That team always gets good numbers.

1924
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,860
- Just don't get one.
- They always get good numbers.

1925
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,320
- There you go.
- The deserted island. That's good.

1926
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,320
We are done.

1927
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,900
- We are done, right?
- Let's finalize this.

1928
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,130
All right.

1929
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:54,090
(Team Green gets a mustache
on the deserted island.)

1930
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,090
Everyone is wearing the bag
on the front.

1931
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,170
Did you lose everything?

1932
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,460
(Look over there.)

1933
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,010
That's so funny.

1934
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,840
(The owner of the bag
is preoccupied.)

1935
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,880
(The thought of getting some R coins
makes him excited.)

1936
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,170
Are you looking for these?

1937
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,280
(They are here.)

1938
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,010
I took them out just in case.

1939
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,190
(Huening Kai took out the R coins.)

1940
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,860
There is nothing in the bag.

1941
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,030
(Suk Jin's heart beats fast
for no reason.)

1942
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:20,550
Are you making fun of me?

1943
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,400
It's not like that.

1944
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,170
I left it on the floor
to find the thief.

1945
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:27,170
Suk Jin, you are too much.

1946
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:28,730
I should have known.

1947
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,070
The yellow pouch caught my eyes,

1948
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:32,510
but it was empty.

1949
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,130
What he said was so funny.

1950
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:36,550
- "Are you looking for these?"
- "Are you looking for these?"

1951
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,400
(Even the 19-year-old boy knows
how scary it is at Running Man.)

1952
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,750
We will get the results now.

1953
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,840
Okay.

1954
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,940
(The final rankings
of R-Blue Marble)

1955
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,340
The results are out.

1956
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,550
- The team in the first place...
- It must be Team Green.

1957
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:48,480
- The 1st place gets 30 R coins.
- This team gets 30 R coins.

1958
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,090
Dong Geun, Dong Min,
Se Chan, and Ji Hyo.

1959
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:52,090
(Team Green places 1st
with 4,220 dollars.)

1960
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:53,550
We made over 2,000 dollars.

1961
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,130
30 R coins.

1962
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,400
- 30 R coins?
- Yes.

1963
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,760
We need to divide them. Come here.

1964
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,860
In second place are
Jae Suk, Kwang Soo,

1965
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,190
Yeon Jun, and Huening Kai.

1966
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,800
The 3rd place gets 20 R coins.

1967
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,570
Before we move on to
the final mission,

1968
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:09,230
we will share the current status
regarding the penalty badges.

1969
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,300
In the first place...

1970
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,570
(1st place)

1971
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,050
is a member
with three penalty badges.

1972
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:15,280
- That's not a lot.
- Three.

1973
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,010
- 3 penalty badges are a lot.
- That means 9 R coins got spent.

1974
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,690
That's right. Someone bought
3 penalty badges with 9 R coins.

1975
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:20,880
Three penalty badges.

1976
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,280
Then there are 2 members
with 2 penalty badges.

1977
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:27,590
They are the candidates
for the penalty.

1978
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,690
I need proof to...

1979
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:31,400
For the final mission,

1980
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,840
we will play the Escape Room Game.

1981
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,940
It will be fun!

1982
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:37,460
You can rearrange your group
for this game.

1983
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,570
Please decide on the team now.

1984
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:41,400
Okay. Shall we play the game
with So Min and Mi Joo?

1985
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,630
- Let's go!
- Okay.

1986
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:45,150
Play with Dong Min and Haha.

1987
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,150
All right.

1988
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,150
(Dong Min and Dong Geun rescue
Suk Jin and Haha.)

1989
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,210
All right.

1990
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:49,750
Shall we play the game together?

1991
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,090
Okay, okay.

1992
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:52,280
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo
get left behind.)

1993
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,380
I am sorry,

1994
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:57,090
but if Ji Hyo and I play
by ourselves,

1995
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,590
we won't be able to escape
even after 10 hours.

1996
01:02:58,590 --> 01:02:59,960
They won't be able to escape.

1997
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,590
We will need to use English letters.

1998
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:04,590
- Let's move.
- Okay.

1999
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:06,000
(They set out to play
the Escape Room Game.)

2000
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:08,530
- The R coins...
- Let me check how many I have.

2001
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,710
My goodness.

2002
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,570
- What?
- It was so scary.

2003
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:14,980
I don't have any left.

2004
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,070
Hey.

2005
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:18,280
(They didn't expect to be leading.)

2006
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,380
Let's use our coins.

2007
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:20,670
Kwang Soo,
whose name will you write?

2008
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:21,670
Tae Hyun.

2009
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,980
That's a good idea.

2010
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,650
Okay? Nine R coins.

2011
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:28,380
Se Chan.

2012
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,150
Two for Se Chan.

2013
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,030
(Glancing over)

2014
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:33,500
(Kwang Soo has other plans.)

2015
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,590
(He is writing down
Jae Suk's name.)

2016
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,760
(He puts 2 penalty badges
under Jae Suk's name.)

2017
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,260
Thank you.

2018
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,260
(Thus, Jae Suk has 4 badges
and Kwang Soo has 3 badges.)

2019
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,570
You can pay one coin and see
how many badges you have, right?

2020
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,670
- Let's check.
- Okay.

2021
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,670
Let's check.

2022
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,550
(Tae Hyun has 5 penalty badges.)

2023
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,210
(Look at this.)

2024
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,250
Did you get the result? Let's see.

2025
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:57,010
How many R coins did they use on me?

2026
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,880
- I guess he has penalty badges.
- I know.

2027
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,880
Right?

2028
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,590
Hey.

2029
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:05,780
I think it's Kwang Soo's doing.

2030
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,150
That caught me by surprise.

2031
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,920
(I let down my guard for a second.)

2032
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,760
- All right.
- You need to attack.

2033
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,630
Otherwise, you will get the penalty.

2034
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:17,070
Someone will get the penalty.

2035
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,940
(They became the 4 strong candidates
for a penalty.)

2036
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,480
We should finish Tae Hyun off.

2037
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,280
This won't do.
Let's finish Tae Hyun off.

2038
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,570
The final race
of the Friendship Awards is...

2039
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,070
Shoot for the Grand Prize.

2040
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:31,780
You will play the Escape Room Game
and receive R coins...

2041
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,920
- in the order of escape.
- Okay, okay.

2042
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:38,190
If you need a hint in the room,

2043
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:40,650
you can buy it with two coins.

2044
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,630
- The R coins?
- That's nice.

2045
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:45,230
You can purchase and check
the penalty badges...

2046
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:48,170
until you arrive
at the final location.

2047
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,570
Ji Hyo, do you know
what our best option is?

2048
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:51,940
We won't be able to finish first
anyway.

2049
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,800
Do you know what our best option is?

2050
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:56,210
- We hang in there.
- That's right. Let's make sure...

2051
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,170
we use as few R coins as possible.

2052
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,420
- Okay.
- That would be our best option.

2053
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,980
Otherwise, we will waste R coins
and fail to place first.

2054
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,920
We might end up escaping next week.
Would that be okay?

2055
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,920
- Next week?
- Yes.

2056
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,010
That would be okay.

2057
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,710
Of course.

2058
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,590
We arrived at the location.

2059
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,380
- Do you see the blindfold?
- Yes.

2060
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:13,500
Please put it on.

2061
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,630
- Now?
- Yes.

2062
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,050
Put it on.

2063
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,670
(They must wear a blindfold
for the Escape Room Game.)

2064
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:21,130
(Glancing over)

2065
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,940
(Jae Suk glances over
at blindfolded Kwang Soo.)

2066
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:28,300
(Then his eyes move to the bag.)

2067
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,900
For goodness' sake.

2068
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:31,900
(The war of nerves began.)

2069
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,550
- Kwang Soo.
- Come on.

2070
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,110
- Let's put on the blindfold.
- Let's not do this.

2071
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:38,840
How am I supposed to cover my eyes
when Kwang Soo is on the team?

2072
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,590
- My eyes are covered.
- I am scared.

2073
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:41,690
I am nervous.

2074
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:42,690
We can do it, Ji Hyo.

2075
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:43,690
(They are ready
for the Escape Room Game.)

2076
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,760
(The place where they took off
their blindfolds is...)

2077
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,590
- That startled me.
- I feel dizzy.

2078
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,760
- This is driving me crazy.
- I am scared.

2079
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,030
What is going on?

2080
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,170
It's a horror theme.

2081
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:54,960
- I am scared.
- You said it won't be scary.

2082
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,530
(The atmosphere is tense
in the cramped room.)

2083
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,570
(Nervous and anxious)

2084
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:00,110
- You said it won't be scary.
- Is it a horror theme?

2085
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,380
Please wait. I am receiving a call.

2086
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:03,380
Where are you going?

2087
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,150
It's a horror theme. Look at this.

2088
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:09,010
Look at this. He will lock us in.

2089
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,320
(Screaming)

2090
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:13,150
(Closing shut)

2091
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,480
Hey!

2092
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,190
(Making a fuss)

2093
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:17,380
For goodness' sake!

2094
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,760
(Jae Suk, Kwang Soo,
So Min, and Mi Joo's room)

2095
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,590
(The story takes place
at a doll maker's studio.)

2096
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:24,130
(The cowards of Running Man...)

2097
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:25,420
(got stranded
in a doll-making studio.)

2098
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,400
(You will become beautiful.)

2099
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:31,530
(The locked room is filled
with dolls and photos.)

2100
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,900
(To escape,
you must open all the locks.)

2101
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:36,480
- Hold on.
- What is this?

2102
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,670
My goodness.

2103
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:39,210
Do we need to escape from this room?

2104
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:40,570
What do we do?

2105
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:41,880
- We need to find the clues.
- Hold on.

2106
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,940
- "You will become beautiful."
- We need to find the clues.

2107
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:45,550
They said the theme isn't horror.

2108
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:47,320
I can't deal with the horror.

2109
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,050
That's it, right?
Nothing scary will happen, right?

2110
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,030
That's it, right?

2111
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:52,690
(Rattling)

2112
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,760
- For goodness' sake.
- That startled me.

2113
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,400
Be quiet, okay?

2114
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,030
- Gosh.
- Be quiet, okay?

2115
01:06:58,030 --> 01:06:59,170
Why did it fall?

2116
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,230
It just fell on its own...

2117
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:03,260
due to the magnet.

2118
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:05,130
For goodness' sake.

2119
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:07,280
We need to solve this first.

2120
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,130
- We need to solve this first.
- Look at this.

2121
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:12,170
Here it is.
"You will become beautiful."

2122
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:13,170
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

2123
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,280
(It's the same sentence
that is written on the iron gate.)

2124
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,420
Hold on. The missing letters are
ieung, ieung,

2125
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:22,090
- Rieul...
- Ieung, and rieul.

2126
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:23,190
(Do the missing letters give
a hint?)

2127
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,480
- Ieung and i.
- Ieung and i.

2128
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:26,690
Giyeok.

2129
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:27,690
What does this mean?

2130
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:29,030
(Rieul, ieung, i, and giyeok)

2131
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:30,500
Do they correspond
with the alphabet letters?

2132
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:33,230
The alphabet letters?
How does that work?

2133
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,670
- Like this.
- Eric?

2134
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:37,840
- Hold on.
- Do they spell "Eric"?

2135
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,170
Rieul.

2136
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:41,380
- Ieung.
- Ieung.

2137
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,400
- I...
- I...

2138
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,980
(Screaming)

2139
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:46,380
I can't do this.

2140
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,510
Stop it!

2141
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:48,650
My goodness.

2142
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:50,170
(Kwang Soo disappeared
with a shout.)

2143
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,190
Kwang Soo.

2144
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:53,010
- I...
- Stop collapsing to the floor!

2145
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:54,610
Go on without me.

2146
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:55,820
I can't do this.

2147
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,480
I don't think I can do this.

2148
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:00,300
A, ya, eo, yeo, o, yo...

2149
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,550
- What could this mean?
- This must mean seven.

2150
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,530
I don't know
what the other letters mean.

2151
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:08,960
(Rieul, ieung, i, and giyeok)

2152
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:13,400
(The answer is 2017,
the number that looks the same.)

2153
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:19,050
(So Min got 7,
but she can't get the rest.)

2154
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,610
- Come on.
- 2, 7...

2155
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:23,070
- Try 2017.
- 2017. 2017.

2156
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:24,110
2017.

2157
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,510
- It worked!
- All right!

2158
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:26,840
- It worked, Jae Suk.
- Is it 2017?

2159
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,150
So Min is so funny.

2160
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,280
Despite being over the place,
she is really bad at this.

2161
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,460
- Seriously.
- What is she doing?

2162
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,260
- She isn't good at this.
- She isn't good at this.

2163
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,300
I gave you all the hints.

2164
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,560
You said you love
the Escape Room Game.

2165
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,800
I gave you all the hints.

2166
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,840
I mean...

2167
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,170
You didn't solve anything.

2168
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,560
- Hold on.
- You just shouted.

2169
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,230
But this... What do we do with this?

2170
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,340
When will it fall?

2171
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,310
(Meanwhile,
Ji Hyo and Se Chan's room)

2172
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:55,350
(It's the museum-themed room
for beginners.)

2173
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:58,780
(When you go out the first door,)

2174
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:01,110
(three more rooms exist.)

2175
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,350
(You need to go back and forth)

2176
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,680
(and exchange fake items
with genuine items.)

2177
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:06,260
I see.

2178
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,300
(They enter the first room.)

2179
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,890
Is it over if we escape this room?

2180
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,300
That sounds easy.

2181
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,430
(Of course not.)

2182
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:15,300
(Dazed)

2183
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,360
We began, Ji Hyo.

2184
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:17,840
Did we begin?

2185
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,930
We need to find the clues.

2186
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:21,770
There will be things here.

2187
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,750
We need to find the clues.

2188
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:25,680
We need to open the doors.

2189
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,850
(He keeps stating the obvious.)

2190
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:28,850
We need to open this lock.

2191
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:30,390
Will that lead us to the door?

2192
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,920
Once we open it,
we will find something.

2193
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,920
I think I will be
the brain of the team.

2194
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:36,460
You?

2195
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,590
You haven't done anything.

2196
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,150
There could be a hint here.

2197
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:41,630
Look at this.

2198
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,360
(If you look at the exit sign
above the door,)

2199
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:49,190
(you can clearly see
the number 117.)

2200
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,840
(You just need to enter the number
into the keypad.)

2201
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:54,840
(Difficulty level: Very easy)

2202
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,680
(They just need to see
the exit sign.)

2203
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,440
This is so annoying.

2204
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:05,720
(At that moment)

2205
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:08,150
(117 is clearly visible.)

2206
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,350
(He passes by it.)

2207
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:10,480
Are we doing this right?

2208
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,780
(What?)

2209
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,130
Se Chan, this is fun.

2210
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,820
We aren't solving anything!

2211
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,300
This isn't fun at all.

2212
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,930
I think this is fun.
It's so fascinating.

2213
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,800
- Let's think.
- This is comb-pattern pottery.

2214
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:25,030
This is "Principles and Practice
of Eastern Medicine".

2215
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:26,060
Who wrote it?

2216
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,430
- Heo Jun.
- Heo Jun, right?

2217
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,770
How old is Heo Jun?

2218
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,030
Do you know his birthday?

2219
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:31,570
- His birthday?
- Yes.

2220
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:33,100
I don't even know how old he is.
How would I know his birthday?

2221
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,440
(I don't know
when Heo Jun's birthday is.)

2222
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:36,110
Heo Jun... Hold on.

2223
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,750
"Heo Jun" was an MBC drama
that aired on channel 11.

2224
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:40,310
Hey.

2225
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,560
You went too far.

2226
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,680
(They think about everything
they know about Heo Jun.)

2227
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,480
(After struggling with Heo Jun,)

2228
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,720
(they purchase their 1st hint
with 2 R coins.)

2229
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,460
"If you look at the exit sign,
you will see a number."

2230
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,560
- 1117.
- 1117.

2231
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,300
What?

2232
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:54,890
- What?
- That startled me.

2233
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,730
Are we done?

2234
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,340
Oh, this is the beginning.
Ji Hyo, this is the beginning.

2235
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:01,430
This is the beginning.

2236
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:03,940
This is so much fun.

2237
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:07,310
(There are many rooms
they need to escape from.)

2238
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:08,570
What is this? There is a box.

2239
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,090
This is driving me crazy.

2240
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,310
It's from Jin Beom.

2241
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,480
Let's open it.

2242
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,850
(The parcel from Jin Beom
contains a hint for the next room.)

2243
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:18,980
(Jin Beom)

2244
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:23,350
(They have already seen
Jin Beom's phone number.)

2245
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,500
(Jin Beom's phone number
is the password.)

2246
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:30,300
(However,)

2247
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,360
(they are opening the parcel.)

2248
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,900
(They get a cushion
that has no meaning whatsoever.)

2249
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:36,970
What is this?

2250
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:38,570
Are we being fooled?

2251
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:40,400
There are English words on it.

2252
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,750
They might be a hint.

2253
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:45,050
(They forget about the parcel...)

2254
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,480
They might be a hint.

2255
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,060
(with Jin Beom's name.)

2256
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:50,960
- This is it.
- Guys.

2257
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,430
Let's do this. Happy Cookie.

2258
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:53,460
Let's go.

2259
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,020
This must be the first hint.

2260
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,470
Except for One Cake...

2261
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,300
One Cake.

2262
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:03,390
Except for One Cake,
everything is sold out.

2263
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:04,470
One Cake.

2264
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:06,230
"One Cake" must hold a key.

2265
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:07,400
Then there is an arrow...

2266
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,070
that is coming out of "One Cake".

2267
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,550
This picture means something.

2268
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,810
It's in English.

2269
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:19,280
(The 5-letter lock
has the same cake picture.)

2270
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:23,890
The poster has the same picture.

2271
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,980
They must be connected.

2272
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,460
This picture means something.

2273
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:31,300
"Ok new cat keep"
doesn't make sense.

2274
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,600
(Except for One Cake,
everything is sold out.)

2275
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,710
Hey, look at this.

2276
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:42,770
- Hey.
- What?

2277
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:44,880
One Cake.

2278
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,070
- Right?
- You are right.

2279
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:47,970
One Cake.

2280
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:50,750
If we remove the letters,
we get K, W, T, E, and P.

2281
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:51,810
Try the lock.

2282
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:53,110
K, W, T, E, and P.

2283
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:56,060
- This is incredible.
- Try the lock.

2284
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,630
- You are right.
- Try the lock.

2285
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,430
- K.
- K.

2286
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:00,960
- W.
- T.

2287
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,130
- It worked.
- Did it work?

2288
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,360
- Okay.
- My goodness.

2289
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,520
- That was incredible.
- We did it.

2290
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,000
We did it.

2291
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,730
- Take it out.
- Look at this.

2292
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:10,970
(They passed the 1st stage
in less than 5 minutes.)

2293
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:12,430
(They make a good team.)

2294
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,530
All right.

2295
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:14,970
We will be done in no time.

2296
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:16,100
Hey.

2297
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,470
Had I been here alone,
I would have gotten stuck.

2298
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,250
In that case,

2299
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,920
I don't need to help.

2300
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,110
- I will just write the names.
- Try it.

2301
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,110
(Tae Hyun decided what to do
in 5 minutes.)

2302
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,960
- This is R.
- You are right.

2303
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,590
R, A.

2304
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,220
Three...

2305
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:32,850
(He writes names on the coins
with his back to the members.)

2306
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:34,650
(He writes Kwang Soo endlessly.)

2307
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:36,020
Hold on. Let's do this again.

2308
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,520
This is wrong.

2309
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,130
They are so smart.

2310
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,500
H and U.

2311
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,400
(Kwang Soo, So Min,
Kwang Soo, So Min)

2312
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,340
(Tae Hyun makes the penalty badges
like a factory worker.)

2313
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,570
We need to go out this way.

2314
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:51,180
That's the next step, right?

2315
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,640
From here...

2316
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:54,750
I feel dizzy.

2317
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,570
I am not that brave.

2318
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,810
You are braver than us.

2319
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,680
- I feel dizzy.
- Me too.

2320
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,150
(Jae Suk looks
particularly brave among them.)

2321
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,020
- Where was it?
- Hold on.

2322
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:06,480
"The scent of moth balls
and bleach pierced the nose."

2323
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,890
"The restroom seemed to be empty."

2324
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:09,960
"That was when I felt
a sense of presence."

2325
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:12,670
"A feeling of unease
took over my body."

2326
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:15,340
Shouldn't we work on the lock?

2327
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,310
- That could be it.
- Hold on.

2328
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,560
The lock...

2329
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,070
Hey!

2330
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:22,970
- Open the door!
- Hey!

2331
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,680
Open the door!

2332
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,470
- Open the door!
- We need to look at that.

2333
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,720
(Kwang Soo was trying
to steal from So Min.)

2334
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,750
Hey!

2335
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:29,920
Who turned off the light?

2336
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,390
So Min, why did you turn off
the light?

2337
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:33,920
You should pull it.
I am stepping out.

2338
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,020
I will look for more clues.

2339
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,390
- Gosh! Gosh!
- What is it?

2340
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,390
I will look for more clues.

2341
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,690
(She freaks out
after stepping on the cloth.)

2342
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,800
That startled me.

2343
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,270
(Didn't So Min say that she likes
the Escape Room Game?)

2344
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:45,360
- Gosh.
- That startled me.

2345
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:46,820
There is something here.

2346
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:49,800
(Jae Suk and kids, 35 percent done,
Jong Kook and kids, 30 percent done)

2347
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,640
(Ji Hyo and kids, 2 percent done,
Dong Geun and kids, 45 percent done)

2348
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,340
We need to take a look
at everything...

2349
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:55,640
inside the room.

2350
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,250
1, 0... You see this
on the top, right?

2351
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:01,180
- It's open.
- It was written backward.

2352
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:03,020
(Opening)

2353
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,050
- It's open.
- It's open.

2354
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:05,480
I did it. I solved it.

2355
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,980
- What? How did you do it?
- No way.

2356
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,560
What did you do?

2357
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:10,960
We are moving fast
since a genius is on our team.

2358
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,720
What do I do?

2359
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,390
(This team is showing the suspense
of the Escape Room Game.)

2360
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,930
(They are still fixed
on the cushion.)

2361
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:18,060
My goodness.

2362
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,730
- What?
- I tried to get it over there.

2363
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:25,400
You know,

2364
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:29,030
we are thinking about
breaking things, not deducing.

2365
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:30,070
(They give up and try to leave.)

2366
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:31,440
Do you know what's funny?

2367
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:33,680
(Beeping)

2368
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:36,610
What?

2369
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:39,750
(The door got locked.)

2370
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:41,980
It's locked.

2371
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,180
(They continue to play
the Locked in the Room Game.)

2372
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,590
Please...

2373
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,800
Please open the door for us.

2374
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,430
Hey!

2375
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,130
We will get angry.

2376
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:54,190
(Angry)

2377
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,730
We are sorry.

2378
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:57,730
(They plead
with the production crew.)

2379
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,510
We did everything we can.

2380
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:01,510
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan
looked back on their lives.)

2381
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:04,380
(49 minutes have passed.)

2382
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,380
My goodness.

2383
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,180
(It sounds like
a team managed to escape!)

2384
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,280
Seriously.

2385
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:14,260
- We did it.
- Yes!

2386
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,280
(Suk Jin and the kids
managed to escape.)

2387
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,280
- Gosh.
- We finished first.

2388
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,680
We did it.

2389
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,390
We finished first.

2390
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,890
We are the best.

2391
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:23,460
- We are the best.
- We are so cool.

2392
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,560
Did we finish first?

2393
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,560
- We did it.
- That's right.

2394
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,430
- How many?
- You get 30 R coins per team.

2395
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:30,970
(30 R coins per team)

2396
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:32,100
This is good.

2397
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,310
Let's move.

2398
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:34,880
Zero...

2399
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:37,900
(Team Cowards
heard the other team cheer.)

2400
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:41,220
(So Min, the professional escapist,
feels bad.)

2401
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,680
(They finish 2nd.)

2402
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,310
- My goodness.
- It was so scary.

2403
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:47,020
We still finished second.

2404
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:48,460
Second! Get the flag.

2405
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,220
Two teams haven't finished yet.

2406
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,090
- We took too much time.
- It seems that way.

2407
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,020
- We came out too late.
- Okay. We finished third.

2408
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,690
- We finished third.
- That's too bad.

2409
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:58,020
That's too bad.

2410
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,220
That's too bad.

2411
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,630
(Tae Hyun places 1st
in terms of badge production.)

2412
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:03,190
We can't do anything!

2413
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:05,400
We can't escape!

2414
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:07,030
This is the worst game!

2415
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:08,570
I would rather get...

2416
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:09,840
the water bomb.

2417
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,970
(I would rather get
the water bomb.)

2418
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:12,270
I would rather get the paint bomb.

2419
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:13,350
(While Se Chan is crying)

2420
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:14,420
Everyone,

2421
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:16,470
the last team is taking a while.

2422
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,750
Let's move on.

2423
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,020
When will they come?

2424
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:20,520
- They won't be able to escape.
- What's going on?

2425
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,460
- We opened the door.
- Really?

2426
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,650
The two of them...

2427
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,260
solved one puzzle.

2428
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,960
Really?

2429
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,020
They solved one puzzle.

2430
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:31,500
We will show the prizes first.

2431
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,670
Prizes.

2432
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:34,100
(The prizes will be revealed first.)

2433
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,970
The first place gets
the Friendship gold rings.

2434
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:37,170
The second place gets
the Korean pork set.

2435
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:38,560
The third place gets
the vitamin gift set.

2436
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:43,710
We actually didn't total
Se Chan and Ji Hyo's coins yet.

2437
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:45,010
But we don't think they are
in the top ranking anyway.

2438
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:46,140
- They're not.
- Should we wait for them?

2439
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:47,440
- We can go home, right?
- Yes.

2440
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:48,720
Hey...

2441
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:50,550
- Oh, my.
- Did you come?

2442
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,750
I almost died from stress.

2443
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:55,260
- Did you take it?
- We...

2444
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:58,350
We only solved one question
after getting a hint from the coins.

2445
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:01,350
We went to a doll and talked to it.

2446
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,520
We talked to the doll.

2447
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,470
We were saying that the door would
open if we pressed the doll's eyes.

2448
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:07,530
We were shining the flashlight
all day like this.

2449
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:08,970
Nothing happened.

2450
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:10,340
Did you come?

2451
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:12,060
Are you done?

2452
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:13,670
Okay, this is third place.

2453
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,070
(We will start by announcing
3rd place right away.)

2454
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:16,470
- Huening Kai and Yeon Jun.
- Oh, my.

2455
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:17,750
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

2456
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:18,850
- You're in third place?
- Gosh.

2457
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:20,400
- They have 73 coins.
- Didn't you only win a little?

2458
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,350
The Korean pork set for second place
is for Jeon So Min and Mi Joo.

2459
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:24,610
- What happened?
- I can't believe it.

2460
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:26,750
- I can't believe it.
- They have 79 coins.

2461
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:27,850
I can't believe it.

2462
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,890
The long-awaited first place has...

2463
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:32,820
- a whopping number of 85 coins.
- Of course.

2464
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,090
They are Yang Dong Geun
and Jang Dong Min.

2465
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:36,150
(Yang Dong Geun
and Jang Dong Min have 85 coins.)

2466
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,470
We did it.

2467
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:39,520
(They won the Grand Award of
the 1st Friendship Award.)

2468
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,560
- Look at Suk Jin.
- That's amazing.

2469
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:44,140
Dong Min, we were on the same team.

2470
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,100
There are three people
who will receive a penalty today.

2471
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:47,730
- Yes.
- The penalty.

2472
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:50,030
- I only have to avoid this.
- Please...

2473
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:51,180
I don't think we'll get it.

2474
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:53,970
They have a total of 53 badges.

2475
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:56,420
- No way.
- 53 badges?

2476
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,550
- That's amazing.
- That happened.

2477
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,680
- Do they have 53 badges?
- Yes, badges.

2478
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,180
- How many coins did they use?
- That's 180 coins.

2479
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:05,320
1st place has 20 badges.

2480
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:08,890
(1st place has 20 penalty badges.)

2481
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:10,220
- It's Lee Kwang Soo.
- Really?

2482
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:12,770
Me? Why?

2483
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,130
(Kwang Soo who received love
equally...)

2484
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:15,470
(from the youngest to the oldest
is 1st place from behind.)

2485
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:18,340
60 coins? Do people have
a grudge against him?

2486
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:19,560
Next.

2487
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:22,100
Jeon So Min is in 2nd place
with 14 badges.

2488
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,770
- Me?
- Oh, my.

2489
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:26,140
Why me? I did my best today.

2490
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,850
- Why Jeon So Min?
- Why me?

2491
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:29,640
- I gave them to her.
- Why?

2492
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:30,880
Why me?

2493
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,590
I wrote your name
on all of the badges.

2494
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:34,650
Why me? Tae Hyun...

2495
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:35,890
- Third place is...
- Why me?

2496
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:36,960
He wrote your name on all of them.

2497
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,630
For 3rd place, 1 person got 8
and 1 person got 7.

2498
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:41,800
The person who got seven
won't receive the penalty.

2499
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,890
- It's either me or Tae Hyun.
- It's you or Tae Hyun.

2500
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:44,890
- If so...
- It's either me or Tae Hyun.

2501
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:46,220
That's right.
It's 1 between the 2 of you.

2502
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,320
It's either me or Tae Hyun.

2503
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,100
The 3rd place who will receive
the penalty with 8 badges is...

2504
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,010
- It's Tae Hyun.
- It might not be me?

2505
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:53,860
(Is it Tae Hyun who made
indiscriminate attacks...)

2506
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:56,470
(or Jae Suk who was
even killed by his team members?)

2507
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:57,530
Eight badges.

2508
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:58,970
It's Cha Tae Hyun.

2509
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,270
(Cha Tae Hyun will
receive the penalty.)

2510
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,350
- In the end...
- It's Cha Tae Hyun.

2511
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,640
- In the end...
- I thought it was me.

2512
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,890
(It was still an amazing match.)

2513
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:06,180
- This is unbelievable.
- This is unbelievable.

2514
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,610
- This is really unbelievable.
- Jae Suk...

2515
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:10,110
How many did you write
for Jae Suk?

2516
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,350
- This is really unbelievable.
- That's right.

2517
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:13,260
- I can't believe it.
- It was close.

2518
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,190
- The penalty is...
- We have to eat something.

2519
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,520
(Kwang Soo, So Min,
and Tae Hyun's penalty is...)

2520
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,060
- the Vinegar Friendship game.
- Gosh.

2521
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,970
The 3 of you only have
to share drinking 1L of vinegar.

2522
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:22,100
- That's nice.
- Seriously.

2523
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:25,430
A lot of children watch
this program, right?

2524
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,970
I would like to make
a public apology.

2525
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:28,880
(A public apology?)

2526
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:31,680
Ji Suk Jin's bag...

2527
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:33,680
- Was it you?
- Was it you?

2528
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,640
(He revealed the truth of the seat
belt incident with his own words.)

2529
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,640
- I...
- He's a professional.

2530
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,390
did it for entertainment.

2531
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:41,680
- Yes, you must apologize for it.
- But...

2532
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,760
- you completely fooled us.
- I must have...

2533
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,920
lost my mind for a moment.

2534
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,480
I will also make a public apology.

2535
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,480
- Why?
- You shouldn't do it.

2536
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,960
- Whose is it?
- Whose is it?

2537
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,460
Is it Haha's?

2538
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,800
(She bows to Haha.)

2539
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,000
You're the worst.

2540
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:56,640
- Wait, what about Ji Hyo's?
- What about mine?

2541
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,510
- Who stole Ji Hyo's?
- Who did it?

2542
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:00,230
(I'm sorry.)

2543
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,530
It's him.

2544
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,430
(They went round and round.)

2545
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:04,750
- Everyone...
- Earlier, I saw that...

2546
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:06,210
I had fun here.

2547
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:10,180
I hope this never happens again
on Running Man.

2548
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,610
- We won't do it again.
- No.

2549
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,420
1st place and 2nd place are
meaningless.

2550
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:15,650
It's a friendship game.

2551
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:16,980
We should drink a moderate amount.

2552
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,520
- The smell is...
- Is it okay?

2553
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,890
(She unexpectedly drinks a lot to
set an example to children.)

2554
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:23,630
- It will make your stomach hurt.
- Your stomach will ache.

2555
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,390
(You shudder since the taste feels
like it will make you healthy.)

2556
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:28,530
- Is it that bad?
- That's too bad.

2557
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:30,170
- What did I do to deserve this?
- Okay.

2558
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:32,430
Okay, let's drink
a little bit for him.

2559
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,530
Let's drink it for him.

2560
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,840
(Among peaceful residents,)

2561
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,270
(there's something that will
disturb peace.)

2562
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:44,140
(If you want to survive,)

2563
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,420
(run away right now.)

2564
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:53,390
(Running Man: Sweet Home)
