1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,050
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,090
Hello.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,650
What? Why are you
wearing denim jackets?

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,630
I don't know. I just put it on and
realized Kwang Soo's wearing it too.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,330
Are you two running
a shopping mall together?

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,690
Gosh, no.

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,860
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,690
Why do you look
so mischievous today?

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,740
What did you say?

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,100
Hello, Suk Jin.

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,540
You guys go ahead and talk.

12
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,970
I'm putting on the microphone now.

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,610
Why are you yelling at us?

14
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,810
- Why are you so upset?
- What's so upsetting?

15
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,540
- We were complimenting your outfit.
- What made you upset?

16
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,310
He wouldn't even say hello to us
without a microphone.

17
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,170
He's really ridiculous.

18
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,880
Once I put on the microphone,
my work begins.

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,990
(His work hour begins
with the microphone.)

20
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,620
Suk Jin wants to join us,

21
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,920
so he keeps leaning forward.
He can't wait to talk.

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,130
It's not done,
but he wants to talk already.

23
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,630
- I know.
- He can't wait to come here.

24
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,020
Dogs find it hard to wait.

25
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,600
Jong Kook, isn't that
what you wore last week?

26
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,700
These are my own clothes.

27
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,240
It's cold outside.

28
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,370
Why are you
wearing your own clothes?

29
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,440
Why do you have your stylist then?

30
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,240
Why is she coming with you?

31
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,810
Just to show off.

32
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,500
I see.

33
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,600
That's 1 of the 5 world's
greatest mysteries.

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
You got your hair done.

35
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,770
- Why did you not change?
- Why is Ji Seon here as a stylist?

36
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,280
Just to show off.

37
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,890
Suk Jin, you are wearing
Cheon Young Rock's glasses.

38
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,520
- It's from the 1980s.
- He looks young, right?

39
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,220
- The glasses...
- He looks younger.

40
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,280
I wore them the other day,
and people liked them.

41
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,780
- You look a lot younger.
- I see.

42
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,530
- You look younger.
- That's not why I'm wearing them.

43
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,450
There is a limit
to how much younger he can get.

44
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,300
What limit?

45
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,390
You look like 54.

46
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,530
There is a limit
to how much younger he can get.

47
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,500
It's just a couple of years at most.

48
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm healthier than you, though.

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,110
It's not like he looks younger.
He looks less old.

50
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,610
- Exactly.
- Hey.

51
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,000
- He can't look young.
- That's...

52
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,110
the best we can do.

53
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,140
Hey.

54
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,610
My friends my age
are going to kill you.

55
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,720
- Who's going to kill us?
- My friends my age.

56
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,310
Do you think my friends
will let it happen?

57
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,310
Do you want to fight?

58
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,910
- You're no match for them.
- My friends born in 1972...

59
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,360
My friends won't let this slide.

60
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,530
I will bring my friends together.

61
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,690
Seriously...

62
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,720
It will be hard for Suk Jin
to bring his friends together.

63
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,000
- It's hard.
- They rarely get together.

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,300
For Suk Jin,

65
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,860
I think four would grab him
by the collar, to begin with.

66
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,470
Why would they grab me
by the collar?

67
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,160
- They will.
- No, no. Why?

68
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,300
Why would they?
We're having a conversation.

69
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,780
He's not a good fighter.

70
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,640
But he's wiry.

71
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,000
- And he's resilient.
- Right.

72
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,580
Do you want to know how he fights?

73
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,350
He just lets his opponent
hit one side of his face.

74
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,120
He just offers them
to hit his cheek.

75
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
- His cheek.
- I say, "Just hit me."

76
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,280
But I never pass out.

77
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,350
He says he never passes out.

78
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,690
I never pass out.

79
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,980
- I feel bad for him.
- You know what?

80
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,190
It's like we're
on "Lee Suk Jin Show".

81
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,290
What? Why would you say that?

82
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,790
Can we just hit you
and wrap this up?

83
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,430
- No way.
- Come on. Just one punch.

84
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,130
- Why would you hit me?
- By the way...

85
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,500
- I should hit you and wrap this up.
- Stop it already.

86
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,190
Your face turned red.

87
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,130
It's because it's hot in here.

88
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,880
Now Suk Jin's all warmed up.

89
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,500
We can finally begin now.

90
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,630
- Let's do this.
- Yes, let's do this.

91
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,910
- This feels good.
- Hello, everyone.

92
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,970
Hello!

93
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,120
Hello, everyone.

94
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,250
Let's do this.

95
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,750
This is our last episode this year.

96
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,850
- Is that so?
- Really?

97
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,960
Really?

98
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,410
I just hope this year ends soon.

99
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,510
Yes, I hate this year.

100
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,560
It was the worst.

101
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,190
- Yes, it should end soon.
- Yes.

102
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,190
I would rather turn 50. My goodness.

103
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,690
- You're right.
- You're 50 soon.

104
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,290
- Yes.
- You'll be 50.

105
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,760
We'll enjoy the year-end
with some chips.

106
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,000
It's red chili flavor.

107
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,530
(Product placement advertisement
is on.)

108
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,030
It goes better with Coke.

109
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,710
Is it crisp both
on the inside and outside?

110
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,070
Stupid both
on the inside and outside.

111
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,810
Come on. This is an ad.

112
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,880
How could you say that?

113
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,280
- You are...
- How could you...

114
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,980
- How could you say that?
- You said so yourself.

115
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,010
I said it's crisp
both on the inside and outside.

116
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,250
Yes, stupid
both on the inside and outside.

117
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,910
Can I take this home with me?

118
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,480
Just taste it first.

119
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,530
(Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo!)

120
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,000
We're doing the ad on condition
that you don't talk about this.

121
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,690
What are you talking about?

122
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,400
Please enjoy.

123
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,430
- Can someone take this card?
- All right.

124
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,440
"Running Man Year-End
Feelings Settlement".

125
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,410
"This is the last episode of 2020."

126
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,280
"Go into each booth that has
each member's name tag on it..."

127
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,940
"and write what you were upset about
each member this year."

128
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,440
- Gosh.
- What I was upset about them?

129
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,040
I wasn't much upset about anything.

130
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,540
Do we have to write it
in every booth?

131
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,880
No, you don't have to.

132
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,410
- Only a few?
- For the ones you were upset with.

133
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,880
- Only for those I was upset with?
- You're right.

134
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,010
What should I write about?

135
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,010
Well, there's nothing much...

136
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,220
(Heartwarming)

137
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,530
- Right, there is nothing much.
- There's nothing much.

138
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,320
- There's nothing to write about.
- Right. Because...

139
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,060
everything is understandable.

140
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,370
(Jae Suk is not upset, but he
goes into Suk Jin's booth.)

141
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,870
- Gosh.
- What are you going to write about?

142
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,630
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

143
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,660
Excuse me.

144
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,940
- Is someone in there?
- What will you write about?

145
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,440
- Someone is in here.
- Oh, I see.

146
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,170
- Someone's in here.
- I should write something.

147
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,710
My goodness.

148
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,850
(It looks like Suk Jin's booth
will be packed.)

149
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,580
I have some things
to say to Se Chan.

150
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,240
I have some things to say
to you too.

151
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,410
I have something for Se Chan.

152
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,150
Really?

153
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,660
(Already very scared)

154
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,090
I even have something
for Jae Suk too.

155
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,220
- What?
- Me? What is it?

156
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,120
- I'm upset because of you.
- Why?

157
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,220
Then I should write one for you too.
What am I upset about?

158
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,530
(Remembering the grudges
they have against each other)

159
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,700
What is it, Jae Suk?

160
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,100
What is it?

161
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,340
I can't believe it. I just can't.

162
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,710
It's anonymous, right?

163
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,100
- Yes, just write down the content.
- Kwang Soo.

164
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,670
Right. There's one for Ji Hyo too.

165
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,040
(As they hear it's anonymous,
they all get up.)

166
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,170
Gosh, my legs.

167
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,950
I'm remembering things
now that I've started.

168
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,780
My goodness. People are lined up.

169
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,410
Wait a minute. Is that my booth?

170
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,920
- You can't line up there.
- I'm just here like everyone else.

171
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,620
- Then what should I do?
- All right then.

172
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,700
- Someone's in there?
- Yes.

173
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,120
I wrote for Haha.

174
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,220
(What is he so upset about Se Chan
that he had to wait in line?)

175
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,340
(Ji Hyo said she's not upset
about anything, but...)

176
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,990
I don't have to write one
if there's nothing, right?

177
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,710
(But she's writing something down.)

178
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,080
Gosh, I don't have anything
to write about.

179
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,430
Ji Hyo, were you upset with So Min?

180
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,580
What are you doing?

181
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,170
- Were you spying on me?
- Why were you in there?

182
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,110
- I did nothing.
- Ji Hyo, what were you doing?

183
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,220
I did nothing.

184
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,950
Why would you go in there?

185
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,220
No, I'm just checking something.

186
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,720
I mean, why would you go in there?

187
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,280
I wrote something for Se Chan and...

188
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,660
They're writing
all sorts of stuff now.

189
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,220
They're writing about their flaws.

190
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,290
They are...

191
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,600
Maybe there's nothing else
to write about.

192
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,270
They're all writing
about the members' flaws.

193
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,360
Not what they're upset about.

194
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,200
It's just a slander.

195
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,860
That's so funny. Our flaws?

196
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,230
It's not what they're upset about.

197
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,930
- Excuse me.
- Now everyone should come out.

198
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,970
(Finishing it
before they hurt their feelings)

199
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,280
All right.

200
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,910
- It's what you wrote for Jong Kook.
- All right.

201
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,370
I wonder what you're upset about me.

202
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,040
Here it goes.

203
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,610
- It's completely anonymous.
- All right.

204
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,220
"He doesn't know
how to control his strength."

205
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,020
- It's something to be upset about.
- I'm sure.

206
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,890
- It's possible.
- Yes, everyone will agree.

207
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,160
I recognize the handwriting.

208
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,960
- I know who wrote that.
- Really?

209
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,490
I'm not so sure though.

210
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,790
- Why are you nervous?
- You're not sure?

211
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,830
Why are you so nervous?

212
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,530
- Are you really sure?
- Next.

213
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,360
"He gets dubious without thinking."

214
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,410
"I'm sick of it."

215
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,360
- This person's sick of it.
- Sick of it?

216
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,930
I understand.

217
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,970
Yes, it's understandable.

218
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,910
"Whenever I'm the spy,"

219
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,150
"I want to get rid of him."

220
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,580
It's getting dubious too.

221
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,590
He doubts too much.

222
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,590
It's not me.

223
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,910
- It's Haha.
- It wasn't me.

224
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,320
Next.

225
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,850
"He only likes his daughter."

226
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,350
What's that?

227
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,420
Here we go.

228
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,850
This person wrote without thinking.

229
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,350
"He only spends money
on his daughter."

230
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,830
(He only spends money
on his daughter.)

231
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,700
People will think it's true.

232
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,840
The next one says,

233
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,840
"Se Chan speaks ill of you
behind your back."

234
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,910
What?

235
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,970
What is this?

236
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,800
- It's so obvious who wrote it.
- It's So Min.

237
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,230
I think it's So Min.

238
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,240
Next says... This is funny.

239
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,540
"When he's the spy,"

240
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,670
"he uses his strength
to prove otherwise."

241
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,370
(Everyone has an experience of it.)

242
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,780
- This is so true.
- It's something to be upset about.

243
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,850
- He really does that.
- So you've all been upset.

244
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,180
Here are the things Suk Jin did
that made us upset.

245
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,390
"He doesn't speak to us
unless the camera..."

246
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,030
"or the microphone is on."

247
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,030
(He doesn't speak to us unless
the camera or the mic is on.)

248
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,220
- "Even if we say hello,"
- It's something to be upset about.

249
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,420
"he doesn't speak to us."

250
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,530
- I'm really upset about it too.
- Yes, you're right.

251
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,100
- It's so true.
- Do I really do that?

252
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,530
Once I knocked on his car window
to say hi,

253
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,660
but he didn't even lower the window.

254
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,410
- I guess he's a professional.
- Yes, he's a pro.

255
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,510
- He's a professional.
- He acts when the camera rolls.

256
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,970
(Laughing)

257
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,580
- This is the worst.
- What is it?

258
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,240
"He pretends his family's precious."

259
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,740
(He pretends
his family is precious.)

260
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,280
- Of course this upsets us.
- Yes.

261
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,680
- It's the worst.
- The worst.

262
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,460
- And it upsets us.
- Gosh.

263
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,660
- So Min, you did this.
- It wasn't me.

264
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,720
- You wrote all three comments.
- This is funny too.

265
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,030
"He pulls a string of hair
that grows on his ear."

266
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,720
(He pulls a string of hair
that grows on his ear.)

267
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,830
What was that again?

268
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,490
"He pulls a string of hair
that grows on his ear."

269
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,700
Don't pull it.

270
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,530
I don't have
hair growing on my ear!

271
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,730
- Yes, you do.
- Let me see.

272
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,730
I don't!

273
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,010
You should water it.

274
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,450
- You wrote it, right?
- I didn't.

275
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,870
I don't have hair on the ear.

276
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,970
- Water the hair.
- This is so funny.

277
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,670
Now, here are the things
that Kwang Soo did that upset us.

278
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,680
- "He's gotten ugly."
- What?

279
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,220
- "His fashion sense is excessive."
- Right, people ask me this a lot.

280
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,410
They ask me why you're getting ugly.

281
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,090
"He contacts me
only when he's drunk."

282
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,160
"His back hair is too long."

283
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
"His forelock is too short
compared to the back hair."

284
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,330
It's not like I can grow
my forelock down here.

285
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,600
Isn't it natural to have...

286
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,570
- longer back hair?
- Is it something to be upset about?

287
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,940
Of course the forelock
is shorter than the back hair.

288
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,040
I was serious,
but this person wasn't.

289
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,800
Why is this person
upset about my hair?

290
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,340
This is just a malicious comment.

291
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,230
Okay, next.

292
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,210
"I don't like his face
especially when he smiles."

293
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,710
"His face is crooked."

294
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,270
(I don't like his face especially
when he smiles. It is crooked.)

295
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,580
- Wait a minute.
- It's nothing to be upset about.

296
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,580
This person's upset
because my face is crooked?

297
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,920
- This is too much.
- Why does it make you upset?

298
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,850
- What if that's my weak point?
- This is...

299
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,980
- So funny.
- Because my face isn't symmetrical,

300
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,090
this person is upset?

301
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,150
"He's gotten even taller."

302
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,190
"I think he's as tall as
a two-story apartment."

303
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,560
"I think he can grow as high as 3m,"

304
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,830
"but he's not trying much."

305
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,760
(I think he can grow as high as
3m, but he's not trying much.)

306
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,860
Who wrote this?

307
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,860
What's this? This is ridiculous.

308
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,170
- This is so funny.
- How can this person say that?

309
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,500
Yes, you can be upset about it.

310
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,810
- You can grow up to 3m.
- That's right.

311
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,600
- You can, so why aren't you trying?
- We're upset about it.

312
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,810
How should I try harder?

313
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,140
We're upset, so work harder.

314
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,350
Why aren't you trying harder?
You can be taller.

315
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,240
- Why should I be taller?
- Work harder.

316
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,420
Okay, next.

317
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,420
"When you had drinks
with the younger members,"

318
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,190
"you hesitated to pay for it."

319
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,790
Seriously, he makes it too obvious.

320
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,800
(It was you, wasn't it?)

321
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,060
- Come on. It wasn't me.
- Hey, hey.

322
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,200
It wasn't like that.

323
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,390
- I had my reasons.
- Hey, you're so stingy.

324
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,940
- I didn't hesitate.
- He never spends money.

325
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,200
- Seriously.
- I didn't hesitate.

326
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,970
I do spend money.
And I didn't hesitate.

327
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,770
- Things you're upset with me.
- All right.

328
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,040
"You always try to
hang up the phone."

329
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,970
"I'm bored of your hairstyle."
"Your mouth protruded even more."

330
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,450
"Too bad you're not
handsome enough."

331
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,640
- Gosh.
- What is this?

332
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,920
Too bad that I'm not
handsome enough?

333
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,350
You could be upset about it.

334
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,790
"I'm upset that
your teeth aren't even."

335
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,350
Yes, I'm also upset
that your teeth aren't even.

336
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,150
- This person really meant it.
- Yes, you could be upset.

337
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,350
This upsets me.
My teeth aren't even?

338
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,570
- Yes, it upsets me.
- Right.

339
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,330
It'd be funnier
if I get some braces.

340
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,100
- No, you'll look better.
- My goodness.

341
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,390
Look at Se Chan.

342
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,890
- He straightened his teeth.
- Yes.

343
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,470
You'll look better.

344
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,970
Well, I don't look better though.

345
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,100
Yours are straightened,
but they're still protruding.

346
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,310
- Yes, they're protruding.
- Right.

347
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,950
- Straightened but protruding.
- Yes, straightened but protruding.

348
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,610
- Straightened but protruding.
- Gosh.

349
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,050
Gosh, straightened but protruding.

350
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,850
- Both on the outside and inside?
- Yes, stupid on the inside.

351
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,140
Next is Song Ji Hyo.

352
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,750
"After my first filming,
I texted that she did a good job..."

353
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,320
"and that I hope to be good friends
with her."

354
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,650
"But she still hasn't replied."

355
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,480
Since the first filming?

356
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,720
- You should reply to people.
- Isn't that 10 years ago?

357
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,460
- Ji Hyo.
- Gosh, this is upsetting.

358
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,720
No, Jae Suk. That's not true.

359
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,200
"I can never reach her."

360
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,700
"I want to see your clear eyes
at least once."

361
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,100
It's because she's Song Sleepy.

362
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,040
"An ad to shoot together. But she
wrote her name first on the card."

363
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,130
What does this mean?

364
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,850
It's nothing. Just pass.

365
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,950
- What is it?
- What does it mean?

366
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,950
Well, it's...

367
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,110
This is no fun.

368
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,240
- What is it?
- Gosh.

369
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,740
(Dozing off)

370
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,850
- What is it?
- It's nothing. Let's move on.

371
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,690
- Really?
- It's a joke. It means nothing.

372
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,960
It's a joke,
but it's not funny at all.

373
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,650
(Straightforward)

374
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,890
Be easy on him.

375
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,720
- Don't be so mean. Be easy on him.
- Hey.

376
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,720
- Are you upset?
- You don't know what's it about.

377
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,800
Are you upset?

378
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,230
I'm not upset, but you don't
even know what it's about.

379
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,360
You're not upset, right?

380
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,810
You don't know what it's about.

381
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,860
It sure isn't funny.

382
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,770
What we're upset with Haha.

383
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,370
"He said we should
get together sometime,"

384
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,680
"but he never called.
I guess it was a formality."

385
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,370
(Embarrassed)

386
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,580
Yes, that's what he does.

387
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,610
- He does that.
- Hey, let's get together sometime.

388
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,110
- He asks to have a drink.
- Hey.

389
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,290
- It's been years.
- Let's have a drink.

390
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,190
- I've never had a drink with him.
- Yes, he does that.

391
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,690
- He asks to have a drink.
- He does that all the time.

392
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,650
- Why would he ask then?
- So don't ask us.

393
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,090
- A drink and half-dried herring?
- He does that all the time.

394
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,430
- He wasn't like that in the past.
- Seriously.

395
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,100
- Come on, Haha.
- You can't help it.

396
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,360
He doesn't talk casually
on the phone.

397
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,700
He always says this when I answer.
"Hello, Mr. Lee Kwang Soo."

398
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,230
It's just business.

399
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,400
It's all about work.

400
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,230
"Mr. Lee Kwang Soo, please
say hello to our viewers."

401
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,940
- He's always like that.
- Seriously.

402
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,470
"When I was a spy, he said he'd let
me off if I told him the truth..."

403
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,400
"when there was no camera around."

404
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,680
"So I told him, but he spread it
everywhere and removed my name tag."

405
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,790
That's so pathetic.

406
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,240
He's unbelievable.

407
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,980
- We should have a drink together.
- It's not me.

408
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
There he goes again.

409
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,790
- This is the worst part.
- He just opens a group chat room.

410
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,560
This is for Se Chan.

411
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,120
"He says he's at a meeting
for 'Comedy Big League'..."

412
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,930
"and never calls me back
for over two hours."

413
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,490
He's being strange these days.
I think he's seeing someone.

414
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,700
- I know.
- Exactly.

415
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,670
"When we went climbing together,"

416
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,440
"he obviously gave me
the wrong directions..."

417
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,000
"and told me to go before him."

418
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,970
Isn't it that he tried to kill you?

419
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,500
I bet it's So Min.

420
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,600
- Really?
- He tried to kill you.

421
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,220
It was really close.
It could've been dangerous.

422
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,470
"He looks like cuttlefish."

423
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,640
Hey, what's that? Cuttlefish?

424
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,820
- Cuttlefish.
- This is just a slander.

425
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,880
Cuttlefish is expensive.

426
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,850
Gosh, this one is
quite straightforward.

427
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,380
"He likes So Min, but he never
tells her about his feelings."

428
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,120
I'm sure it's Haha.
It's definitely him.

429
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,700
I was very disappointed.

430
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,390
- Why?
- Why didn't you tell her?

431
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,940
This is why I come to Running Man.

432
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,040
Okay.

433
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,340
This is about So Min.

434
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,710
"She lies a lot."

435
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,130
- Who wrote that?
- "She doesn't trust me."

436
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,630
She keeps questioning me.

437
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,970
I think this is Haha.

438
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,310
- It's Haha.
- I really meant it.

439
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,610
- Because you always lie to me.
- That's not true.

440
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,010
"She promised not to do it,"

441
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,350
"but she doubts me every time
we get a new mission."

442
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,590
Why do you keep doubting me?

443
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,220
"It's been six months since the
promise, but she hasn't changed."

444
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,930
"I will never trust you again."
Isn't this a letter to her?

445
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,990
Is that from one person?

446
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,650
"She keeps trying to make
things look romantic."

447
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,340
- You spelled it wrong though.
- Se Chan.

448
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,840
- It's wrong.
- Did you write it?

449
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,500
- Se Chan.
- You spelled it wrong.

450
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,840
It's really embarrassing.

451
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,940
(Ji Hyo is the one
who spelled it wrong.)

452
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,810
There's a hidden secret...

453
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,550
- behind those messages.
- What?

454
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,870
Each message you got today...

455
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,270
is converted to minus 100 points.

456
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,590
What are you doing?

457
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,450
And your scores will be accumulated.

458
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,290
Kwang Soo got a lot of messages.

459
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,510
We all wrote a message to him.

460
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,290
The more messages you have,

461
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,850
the more points you will lose.

462
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,470
(The results of 2020
Year-End Feelings Settlement)

463
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,470
(So Min: Minus 800,
Ji Hyo: Minus 900)

464
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,470
(Jae Suk: Minus 1,000,
Haha: Minus 1,000)

465
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,540
(Se Chan: Minus 1,100,
Suk Jin: Minus 1,200)

466
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,630
(Jong Kook: Minus 1,400,
Kwang Soo: Minus 1,400)

467
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,170
But members who lost a lot of points
still can turn the game around.

468
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,230
- I see.
- That's good.

469
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,500
While you were writing
down your complaints,

470
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,580
- our guests for today wrote down...
- Guests?

471
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,640
good things about you.

472
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,920
Good things about us?

473
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,140
I guess they are someone we know.

474
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,220
(And each message will be
converted to 100 points.)

475
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,750
- This is hard. What should I say?
- What should I say?

476
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,110
- Their merits?
- Their merits.

477
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,880
(Back on Running Man after 7 years,
Lee Yeon Hee)

478
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,090
(Kwang Soo's close friend,
Yoo Yeon Seok)

479
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,930
We should be honest.

480
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,120
Right.

481
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,830
(New on a variety show, Yoo Teo,
A variety show pro, Choi Sooyoung)

482
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,220
Kwang Soo?

483
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,430
(What does Kwang Soo's best friend
think Kwang Soo's merit is?)

484
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,630
He's tall.

485
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,970
(What are the merits of the members
that the four guests think?)

486
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,000
He's tall.

487
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,710
Everyone, we will bring in
our guests...

488
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,550
who wrote about your merits.

489
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,350
Please come on in.

490
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,850
Who are they?

491
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,110
(The 4 special actors are
here on Running Man.)

492
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,850
- Oh, hello.
- Hey.

493
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,190
(Their entrance gives an impression
of a warm year-end party.)

494
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,220
There's Sooyoung.

495
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,480
(They are glad to see the guests.)

496
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,960
- What?
- Hello.

497
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,330
(They're here to introduce their new
movie for 2021, "New Year Blues".)

498
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,490
(The movie is about four couples...)

499
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,490
Have you never dated anyone?

500
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,930
(who want to be happier
in the coming new year.)

501
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,470
When I'm with you, I feel so small.

502
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,990
Have you been feeling
that way the whole time?

503
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,130
(Today's special guests, Yeon Seok,
Yeon Hee, Sooyoung, and Teo)

504
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,870
We have four actors
from the movie, "New Year Blues".

505
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,710
- It's "New Year Blues".
- "New Year Blues".

506
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,180
Are you starring in the movie?

507
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,870
- No.
- How do you know it then?

508
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,350
Then stay quiet.

509
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,920
What did I do?

510
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,320
People would think
you starred in the movie too.

511
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
Kwang Soo knows the movie.

512
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,980
Yeon Seok, this is
your first time...

513
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,790
to join our show officially, right?

514
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,220
This is my first
official appearance.

515
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,250
- With Haha...
- He was Kwang Soo's...

516
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,330
That's right.

517
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,490
I had to shave my beard
as soon as I met him.

518
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,340
(Running Man Episode 293 in 2016)

519
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,310
(He asked Haha to shave his beard
on their first meeting.)

520
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,440
(You're bleeding!)

521
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
(He even saw Haha's blood
on their first meeting.)

522
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,600
Right.

523
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,210
- But...
- Kwang Soo made me do it back then.

524
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,350
- Right. He did.
- I did.

525
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,850
On our first meeting.

526
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,950
He just shaved my beard
while laughing.

527
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,510
I even bled.

528
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
He was bleeding here.

529
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
- Right.
- Now I remember that.

530
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,120
(And he's back on Running Man
after 4 years.)

531
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,190
It was really...

532
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:23,300
What? Did Yeon Seok and Yeon Hee
prepare a tango performance?

533
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,700
- Are we doing it already?
- Really?

534
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
- Is it from your movie?
- Are they dancing the tango?

535
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,760
- Are we doing it already?
- Really?

536
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
(Wait. Are we doing it already?)

537
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,730
- No.
- This is crazy.

538
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,000
Did you prepare a tango performance?

539
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,130
Why are you being like this?

540
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,500
The tango I know?

541
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,270
No, in our movie...

542
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,470
- Thank you for doing this.
- It's not like that.

543
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,610
We should watch it then.

544
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,380
- No, it's just...
- Go ahead and show us.

545
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,320
- We prepared...
- Show us what you prepared.

546
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
I'm so grateful that
they want to perform for us.

547
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,350
Go ahead and do it.

548
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,590
- They did it in the movie.
- I've never seen tango before.

549
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,620
All of a sudden?

550
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,520
Actually, this is what we thought.

551
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,650
"Did Yeon Hee and Yeon Seok dance
tango in the movie?"

552
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,890
"Then can you show us a little?"
I thought it would go like this.

553
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,020
- We wouldn't do that.
- That's not what we do.

554
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,940
We don't say things like that.

555
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,390
- We get to the point right away.
- To the point.

556
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,570
Do you dance the tango? Show us.

557
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,760
- Right away?
- Yes.

558
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,840
So this is Yeon Seok
and Yeon Hee's tango performance.

559
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,870
Hang on.

560
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,510
This is...

561
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,610
- Can you make it look less abrupt?
- So...

562
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,940
The thing is,
they really want to show us.

563
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,440
- It's not like that.
- You want to talk more.

564
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,820
Let me tell you. In Argentina...

565
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,680
Boo, just go ahead and dance.

566
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,350
Just show us.

567
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,650
Let's just do it.

568
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,330
We will make it short.

569
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,530
- Then we can talk about it.
- Just dance first.

570
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,530
We'll talk after you dance.

571
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,000
With no explanation.

572
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,070
- I want you to lead.
- I don't know what to do.

573
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,740
- Let's go.
- But...

574
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,340
They strike the pose right away.

575
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,040
Gosh, this is tango.

576
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,510
But Yeon Hee...

577
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,930
(What would
their tango dance look like?)

578
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,100
(Wriggling)

579
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,110
(They wriggle together for a while.)

580
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,520
(Then they start to dance.)

581
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,650
(It's just the basic steps
from the beginner's tango class.)

582
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,060
(They don't know how to react.)

583
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,620
(But the two actors
are dancing seriously.)

584
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,800
(Crossing at a crosswalk?)

585
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,800
(Laughing)

586
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,540
(What is this?)

587
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,840
(A sudden finish)

588
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,810
Oh, no.

589
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,630
(They clap their hands anyway.)

590
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,980
You haven't done this
for a long time, right?

591
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,850
I just told you.

592
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,410
It's not that we prepared this.

593
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,110
- I can tell it's been a long time.
- We didn't prepare it.

594
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,170
I get it.

595
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,750
It's not that they were
unbelievably good.

596
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,090
They looked good together though.

597
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,530
The movie has a scene
where we dance the tango together.

598
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,120
We did it a year ago.

599
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,150
Ask him this question.

600
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,600
Why did he want to dance?

601
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,420
(Why did you want
to show us the dance?)

602
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,600
Will you stay quiet?

603
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,930
- I'm just curious.
- Will you stay quiet?

604
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,300
I'm just curious.
Aren't you curious?

605
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,860
- I didn't want to dance.
- So this is...

606
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,240
an important scene. I see.

607
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,340
But why?

608
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,130
Why did you want that so much?

609
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,870
Gosh, no one would
want to watch our movie.

610
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,480
So you wanted to dance.

611
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,550
- So it has the tango scene.
- I see.

612
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,580
I bet it looks different
in the movie.

613
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,410
It's not easy to show something
that you did a year ago.

614
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,650
- I know.
- But why did you want to do it?

615
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,760
(Why did you still want to try it?)

616
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,030
- I was...
- I guess he was really determined.

617
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,950
Yeon Seok, you must
love tango a lot.

618
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,120
He loves to tango.

619
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,500
I heard you are still
taking tango lessons.

620
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,950
Next up is Yoo Teo.

621
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,960
(Next up is an actor
of proven ability, Yoo Teo.)

622
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,030
He looks amazing.

623
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,660
I heard you were born in Germany.

624
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,340
- He was born in Germany too.
- Really?

625
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,860
- Were you born in Germany?
- Yes.

626
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,930
- In Stuttgart.
- Really?

627
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,430
- Which part?
- Cologne.

628
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,740
- Where?
- Cologne.

629
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,840
- He doesn't know it.
- Really?

630
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,130
So Cologne is in Germany.

631
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,050
- You don't know where it is.
- Speak some German.

632
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,600
Do you speak German?

633
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,170
I'm fluent.

634
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,320
You should ask Haha
some questions then.

635
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,550
- Ask him questions.
- You're from the same country.

636
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,550
(Have a talk in German.)

637
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,110
- Say things like this.
- Ask him a question.

638
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,330
(Speaking German)

639
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,680
He's really good.

640
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,260
(The German kid answers
with his body language.)

641
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,760
- What? Why?
- Answer the question.

642
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
I know.

643
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,070
What do you know?

644
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,300
His German is really good.

645
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,660
So he's from Germany.

646
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,540
I lived in Germany until I was 21.

647
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,740
- His German is really good.
- He's a native.

648
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,100
That's why you have an accent.

649
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,240
I see.

650
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,370
He speaks good English too.

651
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,540
- Does he speak English as well?
- English?

652
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,250
Gosh.

653
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,480
Stop asking me
to speak foreign languages.

654
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,170
- They weren't going to ask you.
- There's more.

655
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,440
Stop asking me
to speak foreign languages.

656
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,050
(We weren't going to ask you
to speak more.)

657
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,710
- No one was going to.
- Because we don't...

658
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,880
get to see someone
who speaks German a lot.

659
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,090
Right. This is my first time.

660
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,880
Please give the four actors
a big hand then.

661
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,730
It's so good to see you.

662
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,160
As I told you before,

663
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,830
the guests wrote down your merits.

664
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,740
They wrote about our merits.

665
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,540
Those who know you
wrote the merits they know.

666
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,200
And those who don't know you
just wrote what they thought.

667
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,600
- I might not have anything.
- It's 100 points per merit.

668
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
- 100 points.
- We wrote about flaws.

669
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,850
Let's see what they wrote.

670
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,670
I don't think they wrote about me
because we're not acquainted.

671
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,820
- Right. We're not acquainted.
- Me neither.

672
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,050
This is empty.

673
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,290
- Right? This is...
- Gosh.

674
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,210
Hang on. What is this?

675
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,790
What does this mean?

676
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,910
"It hurts"?

677
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,120
Please read it for us.

678
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,290
I often spell things wrong.

679
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,560
- I got it wrong again.
- I know what it means.

680
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Okay.

681
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
This is for me.

682
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,920
"He's always thoughtful
and considerate toward his guests."

683
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,160
- "He's the best."
- My gosh.

684
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,770
"He takes good care of himself."

685
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,540
"He's the best variety show host.
He's cool."

686
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,580
Jong Kook.
"He's very thrifty and frugal,"

687
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,480
"so he makes me reflect on myself."

688
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,550
"He looks scary even when he's
standing still during a race."

689
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,320
"He seems to be good at sports."

690
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,370
- "Will you be my training partner?"
- I know who wrote it.

691
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,440
One of the messages sounds
like it's automatically translated.

692
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,640
- This is Suk Jin's.
- Like a translation device.

693
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,710
This is for Suk Jin.

694
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,410
"He's an experienced veteran."

695
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,620
- "He's warm."
- "He's warm."

696
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,680
(It's obviously Teo's message.)

697
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Yeon Seok.

698
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,150
"I worry about him
both when I see him on TV..."

699
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,920
"and when I shoot
a TV show with him."

700
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,570
(He's worried about shooting
a TV show with Suk Jin.)

701
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,690
Who was that?

702
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,800
It's supposed to be a compliment.

703
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,570
Who was that? Is that a compliment?

704
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,930
- He worries about you.
- I guess it's Sooyoung.

705
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,670
Haha's. "He greets me
with excessive reactions,"

706
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,080
"but I'm not sure
if he really means it."

707
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,480
Why would you say that?

708
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,370
It must be someone you know.

709
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,750
We should have a drink together.
Who is it?

710
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,780
You should reflect on yourself.

711
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,670
- It's someone who knows Haha.
- Let's drink together.

712
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,590
There you go again.

713
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,650
"He has a loud voice,
so I can hear him well."

714
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,710
Who is it?

715
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,560
They are forcing themselves
to say something good.

716
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,180
Gosh, this feels really good.

717
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,530
The compliments...

718
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,920
You all will end up in paradise.

719
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,960
I guess it was really hard for them
to find something meritorious.

720
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,330
- Someone squeezed out the comment.
- It's easy to hear his voice.

721
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,300
- They reluctantly wrote these.
- They had no choice.

722
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,930
- They saw us on TV...
- The compliments of Ji Hyo.

723
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,700
"She's so good at games.
She's both charismatic and pretty."

724
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,630
These also sound...

725
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,080
- half-hearted. Don't you think?
- Absolutely.

726
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,140
- Because they don't know us well.
- They were just being polite.

727
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,020
- It means they're not close to us.
- Exactly.

728
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,480
Right? Let's move on to Kwang Soo.

729
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,380
"He's a superstar
in Southeast Asia."

730
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,250
- In Southeast Asia?
- Yes.

731
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,650
- Who wrote that?
- Specifically in Southeast Asia?

732
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,230
I suppose this person saw Kwang Soo
only on TV.

733
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,760
- But... Why...
- So they're not acquainted.

734
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,690
- Why am I disappointed?
- Not a superstar in Asia?

735
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,450
- Let's move on to So Min.
- That's weird.

736
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,030
"I found out that she goes to
the same beauty parlor as me."

737
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,240
"I guess she has good taste."

738
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,690
Is this supposed to be sarcastic?

739
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,400
It sounds a little sarcastic.

740
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,960
- Is it sarcasm?
- It means they have similar tastes.

741
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,270
- It sounds like...
- Oh, I see.

742
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,810
He's just not good
at writing Korean.

743
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,370
These are about Se Chan.
"He's as funny as his teeth."

744
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,100
- "I don't know him. Who is he?"
- "I don't know him. Who is he?"

745
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,940
(I don't know him. Who is he?")

746
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,250
- That's so funny.
- It sounds so half-hearted.

747
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,090
- There was nothing to write.
- None whatsoever.

748
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,450
- Okay. I won't forget this.
- Jae Suk...

749
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,830
It seems to me that they wrote
in this order from here.

750
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,920
- So they were tired at the end.
- They got tired.

751
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,230
- Their comments got much shorter.
- They still had to write something.

752
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,330
- Okay.
- The handwriting...

753
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,100
But he's getting more famous
as So Min's boyfriend.

754
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,860
He's getting more famous
as So Min's boyfriend.

755
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,100
Today, it's the 2020 Year-End
Feelings Settlement Race.

756
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,130
We tallied the scores you received
from the other members and guests...

757
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,750
from the complaint and compliment
surveys.

758
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,940
- I'll announce your scores now.
- Okay.

759
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,350
The members
in the first place are...

760
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,490
Ji Hyo and So Min with 500 points.

761
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,940
- Really?
- Nice.

762
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,180
Kwang Soo's score is
minus 1,100 points.

763
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,260
Minus 1,100 points?

764
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,380
Now, you'll be divided into
4 teams of 3 people.

765
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,230
The tallied score of team members
will be your team score.

766
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,730
You will receive scores according to
the result of the mission.

767
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,840
The 1st 2 teams that gain
2,020 points will win.

768
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,240
- 2,020 points?
- Yes.

769
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,240
If 2 members have minus 100
and minus 300 points,

770
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,840
their team score is
minus 400 points.

771
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,580
When your team score is
2,020 points, the race ends.

772
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,580
Oh, 2,020 points. I see.

773
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,870
The 2 winning teams will receive
1,000 dollars as New Year's gift.

774
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,520
- Really?
- 1,000 dollars?

775
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,550
And the team with the lowest score
will receive a penalty.

776
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,380
Let's decide teams now.
Bring the gifts here.

777
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,350
We'll begin the first mission
after you change your clothes.

778
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,950
- Okay.
- Okay.

779
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,830
(They're gathering at the place
for the 1st mission 1 by 1.)

780
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,890
- Gosh. It's so cold.
- It's really cold here.

781
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,130
You're shaking because of
the mere cold.

782
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,770
- Jae Suk.
- You're cringing your fingers.

783
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,460
You seem to be feeling very cold.

784
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,460
He's so cool. He looks cool
even when doing his warm-ups.

785
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,480
You can tell he works out regularly.

786
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,670
- Whom are you talking about?
- Teo.

787
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,580
I didn't realize earlier, but he...

788
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,850
He has such a muscular body.

789
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,170
Teo, how old are you?

790
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,850
- I'm 40.
- I'm sorry.

791
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,940
Are you serious?

792
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,450
He's 40.

793
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,650
- Teo, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- My goodness.

794
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,830
I'm sorry. I thought you were
younger than me. I'm sorry.

795
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,260
- Why?
- I didn't know.

796
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,350
I asked him, "How old are you?"

797
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,300
Teo, I'm really sorry.

798
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,830
- Pardon me?
- I apologize.

799
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,570
- He thought he was older than you.
- I thought I was older than you.

800
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,040
- That's why talked like that.
- That's okay. Don't worry.

801
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,270
- It's a good thing.
- I thought he was younger than you.

802
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,270
He looks much younger than
his actual age.

803
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,570
- Teo is 40.
- I thought he was younger than me.

804
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,040
- He's 40.
- He has a babyface.

805
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,870
- I thought the same as Se Chan.
- Me too.

806
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,170
- Right?
- Please sit down.

807
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,050
This will be fun.

808
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,480
- Yutnori is easy.
- We'll play yutnori.

809
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,550
- Okay. One of them is different.
- Yutnori!

810
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,910
Yutnori requires some skills.

811
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,490
- I'm good at yutnori.
- You need good sense.

812
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,560
Exactly.

813
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,490
- The first mission is...
- I'm really good at this.

814
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,450
Bomb Yutnori, the upgraded yutnori.

815
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,500
- What is it?
- It sounds fun.

816
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,000
It has the same basic rules
as regular yutnori.

817
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,270
However, each team will receive
one normal piece...

818
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,240
and one bomb piece.

819
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,570
When your normal piece is back
at the starting point, you're done.

820
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,630
And you'll receive different scores
according to the result of the game.

821
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,100
As you can see,
we have five yut-sticks.

822
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,580
- What's the extra stick?
- The dark brown stick is...

823
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,250
the bomb yut-stick.

824
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,780
There are bombs drawn
on the other side.

825
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,550
- So?
- If that side is up,

826
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,560
you get to place your bomb piece
anywhere you want.

827
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,380
- Anywhere we want?
- It's like a landmine.

828
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,230
- It explodes when we stop there.
- It's like a landmine.

829
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,380
The bomb explodes,

830
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,560
and the team that placed the bomb
gains 100 points.

831
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,260
(The team that stops at the bomb
goes back to the starting point.)

832
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,070
- We should place it wisely.
- Okay.

833
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,070
- It's good.
- It's like the famous board game.

834
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,740
Instead, you can't catch other
teams' pieces with your piece.

835
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,930
You can only catch them
with your bomb.

836
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,130
- Even if you stop at the same spot.
- Okay.

837
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,740
When you get yut or mo,
you get to throw sticks again.

838
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,940
But you must move your piece
before throwing the sticks again.

839
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,580
If you stop where there's
a bomb is, you lose the chance.

840
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,980
- Okay.
- We must move our piece first?

841
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,670
Correct. You can't move your piece
after throwing the sticks again.

842
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,380
- We can't add the moves later.
- We must stick to the order, right?

843
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,750
- You must move it right away.
- Okay.

844
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,820
Yeon Seok stands out so much.

845
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,620
Come on. Don't be like that.

846
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,180
It's not because of me.

847
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,120
- It's not just Yeon Seok.
- It's not because of me.

848
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,650
(Yeon Seok stands out,
and Kwang Soo denies it.)

849
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,760
- I think...
- Jae Suk,

850
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,360
Yeon Seok stands out among them,

851
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,920
but Suk Jin also stands out.

852
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,040
He stands out so much.

853
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,430
He's our grandfather.

854
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Team Green.

855
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,460
He wants to blend in by any means.

856
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,810
He put on a pink cap
to blend in with his team members.

857
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,870
He looks like an old man
with his grandchildren.

858
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,110
- In my entire life...
- Grandpa, happy New Year.

859
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,280
Stop it. Gosh.

860
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,750
- I wish you a long, healthy life.
- They look like good grandchildren.

861
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
He stands out too.

862
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,750
The same goes for your team.

863
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,850
Teo stands out so much.

864
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,910
- Who?
- Teo.

865
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,150
- Teo looks even more handsome.
- Teo stands out?

866
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,590
He looks even younger.

867
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,650
Jae Suk, don't act like
you didn't expect that answer.

868
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,850
Did you think she referred to you?

869
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,420
Okay. I admit it.

870
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,120
He became so shameless.

871
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,070
- Okay.
- Shall we decide the order?

872
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,100
Let's do that.

873
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,160
Let's sit in the order. 1, 2, 3, 4.

874
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,660
How about you sit in the order?
The first team should sit here.

875
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,160
- We're the 3rd team.
- The 1st team should sit there.

876
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,170
The first team is here.

877
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,780
The first team, sit over there.
Team Mint Green.

878
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
This is the worst.

879
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,870
That side...

880
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,480
- looks so gloomy.
- The atmosphere is so bad.

881
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Hey, you look like braised monkfish.

882
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
- Braised monkfish?
- Yes, braised monkfish.

883
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,940
- You look just like it.
- I have all sorts of nicknames.

884
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,440
That's too mean.

885
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,850
- He looks like braised monkfish.
- Father, that's enough.

886
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,380
You look like braised monkfish,
not even monkfish soup.

887
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,450
Stop it.

888
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,560
I can see how different we all look.

889
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,920
Now that I saw you closely,

890
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,300
I realized your gums are
so pink and pretty.

891
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,570
- I can't believe him.
- He has pretty pink gums.

892
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,000
- I'm surprised.
- It's pretty pink.

893
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,130
- It's the color of pork belly.
- The color is so pretty.

894
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,770
I know, right?
I'll give you some later.

895
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,370
No wonder why I craved soju
when I saw his face.

896
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,740
His gums are pretty pink.

897
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,010
- Let's begin.
- This team goes first.

898
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,870
- Okay.
- Sooyoung, throw the sticks.

899
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,940
- Me?
- The yut-sticks.

900
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,020
- Team Mint Green will go first.
- Go ahead.

901
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,210
- Shouldn't we spread it properly?
- He's right.

902
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,710
Is it out if only part of a stick
goes out of the mat?

903
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,850
Of course, it's out.

904
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,060
- No.
- Isn't it okay to be partially out?

905
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,380
It's in as long as a part of it is
on the mat.

906
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,030
- It's in if a part of it is on it.
- Like this?

907
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,650
- Well...
- We can stand in the front.

908
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,730
You can throw the sticks over there.

909
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,000
No. Let's draw a line here.

910
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,070
- Everyone should stand here.
- She sounded so firm.

911
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,230
- We should throw the sticks there?
- No.

912
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,460
- It's too far.
- I can't throw them there.

913
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,770
- All of them will go out.
- That's not necessary.

914
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,360
- But... I mean...
- Don't people...

915
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
throw the sticks over the mat?

916
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,630
- You don't know the rules, do you?
- Listen.

917
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,480
- I mean...
- The game won't end that way.

918
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,100
- We draw a line in my neighborhood.
- Where is it?

919
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,370
Cheongdam-dong.

920
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,640
Do they have such a rule
in Cheongdam-dong?

921
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,250
- Many of us live there.
- There's no such rule there.

922
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,370
Is that how they play this
in Cheongdam-dong?

923
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,140
Everyone throws
from a different distance.

924
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,490
- That's up to you.
- That doesn't matter.

925
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,290
What if I throw them
right in front of the mat?

926
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,850
- That's okay.
- That's how it's done.

927
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,150
- Really? Is it okay?
- But you must throw them high.

928
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,920
- You shouldn't roll the sticks.
- Above your head.

929
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,390
- When you're in a sitting position.
- Above your head.

930
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,030
Then the lower your body is,
the easier it gets.

931
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,360
- Go ahead and try it.
- Why must this be so complicated?

932
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,660
- Have you never played it before?
- Just try it.

933
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,930
That's not the point of the game,
Sooyoung.

934
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,930
Just relax.

935
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,240
I was afraid you might complain
about how I throw them.

936
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,480
- We won't.
- I promise we won't.

937
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,780
- Okay. I'll do it as I want.
- Yes. Go ahead.

938
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,400
What if it falls like this?

939
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,520
- It's in.
- That's okay.

940
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
- It's in?
- Yes, it's in.

941
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,940
- Okay.
- It's out if more than half is out.

942
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,490
- You're quite meticulous.
- More than half?

943
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,020
Whom have you been playing
this game with?

944
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,110
It always causes a fight
in my family.

945
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,290
- It happens a lot.
- Exactly.

946
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,150
- Your family fights over this?
- It happens a lot.

947
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,180
You're taking too much time.

948
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,560
Okay. I'll do it now. 1, 2, 3.

949
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,190
- Good.
- That's good.

950
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,420
- It's out.
- It's out.

951
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,770
- It's out.
- Look at Jong Kook's face.

952
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,660
Look at Jong Kook's face.

953
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,570
(It went out?)

954
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,480
- It's out.
- He's so excited.

955
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,930
Jong Kook is in shock.

956
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,010
You're so cheeky.
I hate you the most.

957
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,250
- Jong Kook is shocked.
- I'm happy.

958
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,640
- Good job, Sooyoung.
- Yeon Hee.

959
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,250
- Gosh. She wouldn't stop talking.
- Yeon Hee.

960
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,110
That stick went completely out
of the mat.

961
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,760
Hey, Yeon Hee. Yeon Hee.

962
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,650
You should throw them high
so we can see your hands move.

963
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,620
- I'll throw them like this.
- Good. That's acceptable.

964
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,650
- That's how it should be done.
- That's good.

965
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,850
- It's out.
- I knew it.

966
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,860
- It's quite hard.
- Move.

967
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,570
- Come on out.
- It goes out if you throw high.

968
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,860
Both of them failed. I get it now.

969
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,930
Here comes a handsome man.

970
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,240
We just have to move our piece.

971
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,510
- That's right.
- Because they all failed.

972
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,740
- Let's see.
- Anything would do.

973
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,050
- Can I begin now?
- Of course. Go ahead.

974
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,670
- Let's move our piece.
- Throw them high.

975
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,050
- It's out.
- It's out.

976
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,870
(He can't move the piece
as it went out.)

977
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,350
- What was that?
- This is a mess.

978
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,320
- Why did you throw them there?
- Why did you do that?

979
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,060
- Why did everyone fail?
- I don't believe this.

980
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,560
He practically threw the sticks
on the floor.

981
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,350
- I didn't know it was so hard.
- I think the mat should be larger.

982
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,760
- Let's spread it a little.
- Is it hard?

983
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,300
Let's spread the blanket
a little wider.

984
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,330
Yeon Seok came out,

985
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,600
and confidently said,
"We just have to move our piece."

986
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,340
You shouldn't have been
so confident.

987
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,740
What they did wrong was...

988
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,900
- You should throw from a distance.
- Exactly.

989
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,360
Don't act like you're good at it.

990
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,240
You failed so many times
the last time we played this game.

991
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,580
- Shut it.
- You failed so many times.

992
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,940
You just have to throw as high as
your eyes lying on the side.

993
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,370
- Good. That's a good stance.
- Like this.

994
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,050
He reminds me of an uncle
who hasn't gotten married...

995
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,520
that you meet when your relatives
gather on holidays.

996
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,110
- Wearing sweatpants...
- Exactly.

997
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,180
- It's the only time they can brag.
- and picking a fight with everyone.

998
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,490
Watch me.

999
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,490
- Only on holidays,
- What are you doing?

1000
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,850
- they meet other people.
- Shut it, will you?

1001
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,030
- Watch me.
- It's the only time they show off.

1002
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,000
- Just as high as your eyes.
- I'm 100 percent sure it'll be out.

1003
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,570
- Out.
- It's out.

1004
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,000
- It's still in. Oh, gosh.
- It's out.

1005
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,070
The mat is too small.

1006
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,740
- No one got them on the mat.
- It's too small.

1007
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,370
- It's out.
- Let's spread it.

1008
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,870
- Shall we?
- Let's spread it.

1009
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,670
- Okay.
- It's too small.

1010
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,010
- It's too small.
- Why can't we do this?

1011
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,580
Hey, we can discuss things
and move on like this.

1012
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,870
This is why...
Can I say something?

1013
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,880
- Go ahead.
- It's too small.

1014
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,350
- I told you earlier.
- About what?

1015
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,910
If we draw a line and...

1016
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,350
- We already refused to do that.
- We won't do it in your style.

1017
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,850
- Why would you do it like that?
- Let's just do it normally.

1018
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,030
- Wait. I'll show you.
- Let's just follow normal rules.

1019
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,030
If we throw the sticks here,
we'll keep failing.

1020
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,500
- It'll be out.
- Okay. Show us.

1021
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,570
- We draw a line and throw them...
- Here?

1022
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,300
- The tone of your voice...
- in our own ways.

1023
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,860
- I see.
- In our own ways?

1024
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,600
- Just as you want to do it.
- Okay. I like it.

1025
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,240
- It seems better.
- Shall we fold a little?

1026
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,780
- Yes, just a little.
- Okay.

1027
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,370
- And then...
- Wait. You should flip it over.

1028
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,100
- If it goes out of here, it's out.
- Flip it over.

1029
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,940
- Fold it and flip it over.
- Fold it and flip it over.

1030
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,410
- Gosh. Why is this...
- When are we going to begin?

1031
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,670
Gosh, seriously.

1032
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,590
(He kicked the blanket.)

1033
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,940
Go. Get out.

1034
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,760
- Everyone, just go home.
- Leave. Get lost.

1035
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,020
- You go first.
- Get out of my house.

1036
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,330
- This is my house.
- You go first.

1037
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,180
I'll watch a movie,
so all of you, get out.

1038
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,180
(I'll watch "New Year Blues",
so get out.)

1039
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,850
It might take us three hours
to set up the rules.

1040
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,390
- As expected...
- Gosh. This is just a game.

1041
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,190
- The couple...
- We're good.

1042
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,300
- And now...
- Just do as Sooyoung says.

1043
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,660
- Right.
- She'll state the rules.

1044
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,570
We'll follow Sooyoung's
Cheongdam-dong Rule.

1045
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,700
- Right.
- Of course.

1046
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,310
Okay, 1, 2, 3.

1047
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,340
Okay, good.

1048
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,870
- Geol.
- It's a geol.

1049
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,580
- Geol with no bomb.
- Geol.

1050
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,550
- Here.
- Geol.

1051
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,050
Let's go catch that.

1052
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,020
Yeon Hee, let's get them.

1053
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,210
Hey, look.

1054
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,250
- Nice one.
- Nice.

1055
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,450
We caught that team.

1056
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,560
- No.
- It's not like regular yutnori.

1057
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,850
- You'll be placing a bomb.
- We can't catch the others?

1058
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,890
- So we move alongside them?
- We occupy the same spot?

1059
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,150
- The bomb.
- Where should we place it?

1060
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,420
It should be where they might land.

1061
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,920
How about here?

1062
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,160
That's not a bad idea.

1063
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,100
- Yeon Seok, don't roll a gae.
- Don't roll a gae.

1064
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,360
- Because of the bomb?
- Just don't roll a gae.

1065
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,130
- Geol would be ideal.
- You'll roll a gae.

1066
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,200
A gae, gae, gae...

1067
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,840
- Hold on a second.
- Gae, gae, gae...

1068
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,600
You're Yoo Yeon Gae.

1069
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,280
- Yoo Yeon Gae?
- Seriously?

1070
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
- Then Gae Yeon Seok.
- Are you kidding me?

1071
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,750
Gae Yeon Seok?

1072
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,910
I'm wishing for him to roll a gae.

1073
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,520
- Don't mind him.
- Gae...

1074
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,150
- I mean...
- Suk Jin even shocked himself.

1075
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,730
- He keeps saying "gae."
- Gae Yeon Seok.

1076
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,880
- Gae Yeon Seok.
- Gosh.

1077
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,030
Yoo Yeon Gae.

1078
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,230
Roll a gae. Come on.

1079
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,120
- Geol.
- Gosh.

1080
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,500
- And a bomb.
- It's a gae!

1081
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,070
- It's a gae.
- No, a geol.

1082
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,430
Gae. How is this a geol?

1083
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,600
- Of course, it's a geol.
- It's a geol.

1084
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
This should be ignored.

1085
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,660
- What do you mean?
- Just look at it.

1086
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,840
- It's a geol.
- Shouldn't this be ignored?

1087
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,200
- It's a geol.
- Do, gae, geol.

1088
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,840
- How is this a geol?
- How is it not?

1089
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,700
- It's a geol for sure.
- Unbelievable.

1090
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,870
My eyes have been
deceiving me lately.

1091
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,870
So do, gae, geol.

1092
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,550
- This is the turning point.
- It's easy to land here.

1093
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,710
- Like this.
- See?

1094
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,760
- But we could land on it too.
- A turning point.

1095
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,680
- Is it possible to set off ours?
- Of course.

1096
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,850
So we shouldn't do that.

1097
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,990
Since it's your turn,
you choose where to put it.

1098
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,060
Sure.

1099
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,350
(They let Yeon Seok decide
where to place the bomb.)

1100
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,160
But...

1101
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,770
- Hurry up.
- You're placing it up there?

1102
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,930
(Yeon Seok places the bomb
ahead of his team's piece.)

1103
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,160
- He placed it.
- You're placing it up there?

1104
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,930
(Yeon Seok decided
to block all 3 teams.)

1105
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,310
- You can't move it.
- But what about us?

1106
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,600
You can't take it back.

1107
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,670
But we could land on it instead.

1108
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,600
- We'll just not land there.
- We're doomed.

1109
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,010
Let's roll a geol!

1110
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,750
Can you move? It's our turn now.

1111
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,910
Gae Teo.

1112
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,050
- Gae Teo.
- No, Geol Teo.

1113
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,440
- Gae Teo.
- Just roll them.

1114
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,350
- Don't mind him.
- Gae Teo.

1115
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,990
He rolled a gae!

1116
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,830
- It's a gae.
- A gae.

1117
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,060
- Gae.
- Yes, this is a gae.

1118
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,650
We're the only team
still at the starting line.

1119
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,570
- Nice.
- Okay.

1120
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,500
- So we get 100 points?
- Let's speed things up.

1121
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Is this allowed?

1122
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,130
- Next is So Min.
- So Min!

1123
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,630
Gosh.

1124
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,770
- It's a gae.
- A gae.

1125
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,830
Okay, that's good.

1126
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,080
(So Min rolled a gae.)

1127
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,380
- Okay, that's good.
- I didn't roll a bomb though.

1128
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,710
We made it.

1129
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,900
- Where do we go?
- No, we landed on a bomb.

1130
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,040
You landed on a bomb.

1131
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,310
(They landed on a bomb.)

1132
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,110
Nice, it's our bomb!

1133
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,610
(Team Yeon Seok
receives 100 points.)

1134
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,860
It's the bomb that I placed.

1135
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,880
Right.

1136
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,290
- It was a great choice.
- Geol and gae mostly get rolled.

1137
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,750
- Right.
- Okay.

1138
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,790
Gae... We can roll
just about anything.

1139
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,020
- Another bomb would be nice.
- Life's all about one lucky punch.

1140
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,270
A bomb and a geol.

1141
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,330
- No, a gae.
- A gae.

1142
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,000
We'll move two steps.

1143
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,170
- Today...
- They get to turn directions.

1144
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,770
Let's place it here.

1145
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,080
They could make a run for it.

1146
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,670
Just don't roll a do.

1147
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,610
- Braised monkfish.
- Just don't roll a do.

1148
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,380
- Go for it.
- Roll a do.

1149
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,540
Nice!

1150
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,210
- Nice!
- One rolled out.

1151
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,350
It doesn't count.

1152
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,250
- Kwang Soo...
- You just killed our momentum.

1153
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,060
- I'm sorry.
- Haha.

1154
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,290
- Are you kidding me?
- Haha.

1155
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,790
- What now?
- That's what he rolled.

1156
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,150
Let's do this!

1157
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,730
You just killed our momentum.

1158
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,190
- A gae.
- Gae!

1159
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,020
Nice one. It's not bad.

1160
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,330
- Darn it.
- Here.

1161
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,040
- We were on a roll.
- Is ours in black?

1162
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,900
- Next is...
- Jong Kook.

1163
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,460
- Jong Kook.
- There are bombs everywhere.

1164
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,770
If only we were able
to place a bomb.

1165
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,940
- There...
- You get your wish.

1166
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,130
I know, you're getting your wish.

1167
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,710
- What do we need?
- A yut.

1168
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,380
- Anything will be great.
- Except a yut?

1169
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,650
- Right.
- Roll a yut.

1170
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,650
It's a yut!

1171
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,850
He rolled a yut!

1172
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,040
(Back to the starting line,
Plus 100 points)

1173
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,810
- Nice!
- He rolled a yut.

1174
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,290
- Everyone, he rolled a yut.
- A yut!

1175
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,560
- Yut, yut.
- Yut, yut.

1176
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,920
(Let's celebrate.)

1177
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,460
It's a yut.

1178
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,330
You can still place a bomb though.

1179
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,520
- Can we place a bomb though?
- Yes, you can.

1180
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,770
So much for rolling a big one.

1181
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,130
(They must place it
where it'll hurt the others most.)

1182
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,730
This line wouldn't be bad.

1183
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,830
- How about right here?
- Okay.

1184
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,310
- So Min, good choice.
- If they roll a geol...

1185
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,000
- That's right.
- We can roll anything but that.

1186
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,980
How about we place it at the center?

1187
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,310
Sure, the center.

1188
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,420
Sure, roll a geol.

1189
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,650
I can roll anything but that.

1190
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,290
Geol Suk Jin.

1191
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,190
- Roll a geol.
- Geol Suk Jin.

1192
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,880
Geol Suk Jin.

1193
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,580
(The chant's childish
but addictive.)

1194
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,860
Does the "geol" mean beggar
in his case?

1195
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,790
- Geol Suk Jin.
- Geol Suk Jin.

1196
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,360
- Ji Seok Geol.
- Geol Suk Jin.

1197
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,960
- Ji Seok Geol.
- Okay!

1198
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,100
- It's a do.
- A do.

1199
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,690
- Do.
- A do at this part of the game?

1200
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,230
Do.

1201
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,860
They just have to roll a gae next.

1202
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,440
You're right. It's better this way.

1203
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,040
We'll place bombs in its path.

1204
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,110
- They could still roll a geol.
- Go, go!

1205
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,880
(They'll target Team Yeon Hee
by making a minefield.)

1206
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,080
- Let's do this.
- Gae.

1207
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,170
You...

1208
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,170
- Roll a gae.
- Just roll a bomb.

1209
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,150
You talk a lot for someone
who only rolled a gae.

1210
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,150
- You are so talkative.
- I've been the best on this team.

1211
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,190
Are you good at yutnori?

1212
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,860
- Yes, I'm a professional.
- Get back here.

1213
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,790
The Young Master of Mapo-gu.

1214
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,130
- Just don't let it roll out.
- Come on!

1215
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,290
- Nice!
- One rolled off!

1216
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,750
(One rolled off the mat once again.)

1217
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,020
- Move.
- It doesn't count.

1218
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,170
- Nice!
- Seriously?

1219
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,190
- The mat's not even far away.
- Kwang Soo failed!

1220
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,190
- Kwang Soo Out!
- I didn't mean to.

1221
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,610
- Kwang Soo Out!
- Just watch.

1222
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,270
- Watch how I get it done.
- Okay.

1223
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,380
Okay.

1224
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,440
- He tossed them forward.
- Nice!

1225
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,000
- A yut.
- I rolled a yut!

1226
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,540
- Okay.
- You get another roll.

1227
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,710
Does he get another roll?

1228
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,350
- Give me a yut.
- Must he be so sly?

1229
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,150
- Good.
- Nice one!

1230
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,520
- Gae.
- Gae and a bomb.

1231
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,210
- Gae and a bomb.
- Right, a gae and a bomb.

1232
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,380
We need to catch this team,
so this is where it should go.

1233
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,560
- Do, gae, geol.
- Target the team in the lead.

1234
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,080
They'll land on a bomb
if they roll a gae or a geol.

1235
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,100
- Gae.
- Darn, we're doomed this time.

1236
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,290
They're doomed.

1237
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,560
We're in big trouble.

1238
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,830
(They make a minefield
that blocks Team Yeon Hee's way.)

1239
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,040
- Let's do this!
- It's a minefield.

1240
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,710
Yeon Hee, you're next.

1241
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,000
- No...
- The bombs are in one line.

1242
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,480
No, you should do it...

1243
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,610
- since this is an important moment.
- Look at all those bombs.

1244
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,900
Yeon Hee.

1245
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,750
Yeon Hee, look.

1246
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,250
You can't roll a gae or a geol.

1247
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,850
All right, a gae or a geol.

1248
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,020
(Will they be able
to avoid the bombs?)

1249
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,080
One rolled out!

1250
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,650
- Gae or geol.
- Gae or geol.

1251
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,690
- What on earth?
- It's a yut!

1252
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,380
(A yut!)

1253
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,360
- Seriously?
- It's a yut.

1254
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,630
- It's a yut.
- How is she so good at this?

1255
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,170
(They jump over the bombs
thanks to Yeon Hee.)

1256
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,860
- How can this be?
- It's a yut.

1257
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,670
- They jumped over them.
- All of them.

1258
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,940
- No way.
- You get another roll.

1259
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,540
The game's nearly over then.

1260
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,940
- No way.
- Go ahead.

1261
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,230
They're masters at this.

1262
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,480
- Please go out.
- One went out!

1263
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,770
- Okay.
- One went out.

1264
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,880
One rolled out.

1265
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,040
It would've been another yut.

1266
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,770
Yeon Seok, we need to block them
by placing a bomb.

1267
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,210
- What...
- This is our last chance.

1268
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,310
- Come on.
- We need to move forward too.

1269
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,810
- We mostly need a bomb.
- Right, we need a bomb.

1270
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,480
We need to stop the other team.

1271
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,360
I bet one will roll out.

1272
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,520
- I'm sure of it.
- Please roll a gae.

1273
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,830
- One will go out.
- I agree.

1274
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,000
One will roll off the mat!

1275
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,060
(It's their 4th time already.)

1276
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,100
You guys are good
at missing the mat.

1277
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,170
Seriously?

1278
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,270
- Yeon Seok.
- You're the worst.

1279
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,230
- Yutnori...
- He's the weakest link.

1280
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,830
- He's terrible at this.
- It isn't even funny anymore.

1281
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,940
- Yeon Seok's the weakest link.
- It's our third time already.

1282
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,130
It's their third time.

1283
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,580
- It doesn't matter though.
- It's their third time.

1284
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,480
- Lower your torso.
- Get out of his way!

1285
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,670
Lower your torso.

1286
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,270
- What do they need?
- Just throw them.

1287
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,880
- Let's go.
- Let it roll off the mat.

1288
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,350
- Geol. No, it's a yut.
- It's a yut!

1289
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,440
(They roll a yut with no bomb.)

1290
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,920
- Yut pops up often.
- It's a yut.

1291
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,750
(They already make it past
Team Sooyoung.)

1292
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,560
We'll be strict with the rules
from now on.

1293
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,750
Okay, I'm loving the stance.

1294
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,750
- Good.
- That's how we all do it.

1295
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,830
Go ahead.

1296
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,130
- Let's see.
- All right.

1297
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,190
- It's not bad.
- A gae and a bomb.

1298
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,420
This is actually better.

1299
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,860
A gae and a bomb.

1300
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,960
Where...

1301
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,940
Let's make sure
they won't follow us.

1302
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,610
Following us along this line
will lead to their demise.

1303
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,710
Do, gae...

1304
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,170
We're not your enemy at the moment!

1305
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,380
Guys, just look.

1306
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,040
- Take a look at this.
- We rolled a gae.

1307
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,650
Nice. No one's bothering
to block our way.

1308
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,750
Let's just stay quiet.

1309
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,980
It might end up
blocking their way too.

1310
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,650
That team will roll
before you do, right?

1311
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,380
It's better to target them first.

1312
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,420
Sooyoung's right.

1313
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,650
- What if we land on it?
- Yes, I'm right.

1314
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,920
Still...

1315
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,560
- A gae?
- Yes.

1316
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,060
- Let's roll a geol.
- It's all right.

1317
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,230
- Geol.
- Gae is rolled most often.

1318
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,900
- Gae.
- Gae is rolled most often.

1319
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,500
We can't even
take part in the conversation.

1320
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,810
- We are not even close to them.
- How many times has he done this?

1321
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,500
It's like we're invisible.

1322
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,110
I've lost interest in the game.

1323
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,270
(Team Yeon Seok
seems to be on the sidelines.)

1324
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,310
- Gae.
- Roll a gae!

1325
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,210
- Gae So Min.
- Gae So Min.

1326
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,250
- Roll gae and you're done for.
- Gae So Min.

1327
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,580
- Woof, woof!
- Did you hear that?

1328
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,980
Why on earth are you
excited by that nickname?

1329
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,080
Being so will prevent me
from rolling a gae.

1330
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,980
- Woof.
- Jeon So Gae.

1331
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,690
- Get a bomb too while you're at it.
- Jeon So Gae.

1332
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,000
At least set up a bomb.

1333
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,520
<i>- Out, out, out, out
- Out!</i>

1334
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,860
(She lets the rhythm sink in.)

1335
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,400
- Hold on a second.
- Out, out, out, out

1336
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,230
Just keep quiet
so that she can roll them.

1337
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,770
- All right.
- I'm begging you.

1338
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,770
- Don't excite her like this.
- Got it.

1339
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,670
- But I want to have fun.
- All right.

1340
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,080
- But you...
- I can't believe Yeon Seok sang it.

1341
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,440
Out, out, out.

1342
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,850
I want one to roll off the mat!

1343
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,610
- Just let her be.
- I want one to roll off the mat!

1344
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,790
Don't provoke her.

1345
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,290
Out So Min.

1346
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,520
- Jeon So Out.
- Stay put, will you?

1347
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,080
Why can't I do what I want?

1348
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,880
I just...

1349
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,190
- They're at it again.
- It's just something I want to do.

1350
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,500
- Suk Jin's upset.
- Their show has begun.

1351
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,170
- But So Min was enjoying it.
- Still...

1352
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,630
She was having fun,

1353
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,130
but so was I.

1354
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,270
We were all having fun, right?

1355
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,810
Jong Kook, just let the two
have some fun.

1356
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,770
- He's right.
- <i>Roll a gae</i>

1357
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,270
<i>Gae So Min rolls a gae</i>

1358
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,920
A bomb and a geol.

1359
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,750
- A geol!
- A bomb and a geol.

1360
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,350
- Okay, good.
- She rolled a bomb.

1361
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,360
I said we should assume
that they'd roll a geol.

1362
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,520
(They jump past Team Teo's bomb.)

1363
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,150
- Nicely done.
- Nice!

1364
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,460
- Is it good for us?
- Of course.

1365
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,830
Geol or a gae?

1366
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,190
- What do we do next?
- A gae or...

1367
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,290
- What's better for us?
- A gae.

1368
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,560
- Exactly.
- So here.

1369
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,690
- I agree.
- Me too.

1370
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,100
We're finally joining
the game, right?

1371
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,940
- Let's move forward now.
- At least roll a bomb.

1372
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,810
- You can do it.
- Yeon Seok, don't worry.

1373
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,130
- We need to roll a bomb at least.
- Right.

1374
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,630
We at least need a bomb.

1375
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,080
Just make sure they stay on the mat.

1376
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,350
(Yeon Seok solemnly
straightens out the mat.)

1377
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,480
Look at Yeon Seok.

1378
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,250
You're straightening out the mat.

1379
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,540
I'll just make sure
none rolls out of the mat.

1380
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,520
- It's actually our turn.
- What?

1381
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,860
Our team's next.

1382
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,730
I see.

1383
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,880
- What...
- Yeon Seok, it's not our turn.

1384
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,960
(He's straightening out the mat.)

1385
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,630
- It's not our turn.
- It isn't?

1386
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,360
- It's not our turn yet.
- It isn't?

1387
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,130
- It's not our turn?
- Yeon Hee said...

1388
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,040
- Yeon Hee said...
- Get it together.

1389
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
When will our turn come?

1390
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,670
- Let's keep it together.
- Is it Yeon Hee's turn?

1391
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,170
- I see.
- It's not hers either.

1392
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,210
- Okay.
- Where's Ji Hyo?

1393
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,940
<i>Here comes Jeoktoma</i>

1394
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,310
- <i>She'll crush you all</i>
- Jeoktoma! Jeoktoma!

1395
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,400
- No!
- It's out.

1396
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,500
- It's in.
- It's on the mat.

1397
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,520
We'll call this as out.

1398
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,770
- Okay. It's out.
- It's out.

1399
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,250
- Me?
- Yes.

1400
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,850
- If it goes out this time...
- Make sure it won't happen.

1401
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,380
- I'll do that.
- Just avoid getting out.

1402
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,920
- Stay focused.
- Okay.

1403
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,190
- <i>Out, out, out</i>
- Team Gray is still there?

1404
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,690
The sticks rolled out of the mat
repeatedly.

1405
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,730
- We couldn't move our piece.
- We never got a bomb.

1406
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,960
- <i>Out, out, out</i>
- Earlier...

1407
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,290
<i>Out Se Chan, Out Se Chan</i>

1408
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,270
<i>Out Se Chan</i>

1409
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,210
<i>- Out Se Chan!
- I am braised monkfish</i>

1410
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,310
Gosh, seriously.

1411
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,500
<i>The small serving, 25 dollars</i>

1412
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,610
<i>I am braised monkfish,
monkfish, monkfish</i>

1413
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,080
- All right.
- "The small serving, 25 dollars"?

1414
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,110
<i>- Out Se Chan ate an octopus again
- Out Se Chan</i>

1415
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,040
<i>- I hope the sticks will slide out
- Out Se Chan</i>

1416
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,480
<i>- I just have to avoid getting out.
- Out Se Chan</i>

1417
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,750
Se Chan never let any sticks
roll off the mat.

1418
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,150
<i>- Out Se Chan
- Out, out, out, out, out</i>

1419
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,060
- <i>Out Se Chan</i>
- Focus.

1420
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,480
<i>- Out Se Chan
- Throw them high</i>

1421
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,190
- <i>It'll go out</i>
- It's out!

1422
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,190
(It's out!)

1423
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,690
(The team failed to move forward
for the 5th time in a row.)

1424
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,600
- It's out, it's out, it's out
- Gosh.

1425
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,290
- I'm sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

1426
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,040
- I don't know. I couldn't do it.
- I know you can do better.

1427
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,210
- They keep getting out.
- I'm sorry.

1428
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,580
- Move.
- Okay!

1429
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,880
Gosh. This is annoying.

1430
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,980
- That was...
- Even I'm annoyed too.

1431
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,150
- This is so boring.
- They're really bad at this.

1432
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,150
- It's not fun anymore.
- It's not fun at all.

1433
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,520
- I'm frustrated. What are we doing?
- My gosh.

1434
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,020
I hope we get 1 yut. No, 2 yut.

1435
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,860
- Yut, yut.
- It doesn't match the drawing.

1436
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,150
- Geol, geol.
- Yut, yut.

1437
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,080
- Geol, geol, geol.
- Please stop there.

1438
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,130
- Geolster, Geolster.
- Geolster.

1439
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,020
- Geolster.
- Hey.

1440
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,130
- I thought I misheard it.
- I didn't know you'd say that.

1441
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,360
- It sounds fun.
- That was unexpected.

1442
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,900
- It suits him.
- It suits him well.

1443
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,040
- Geolster?
- Haha.

1444
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,940
- Geolster.
- Yut.

1445
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,000
- Yut, yut.
- Geolster, Geolster.

1446
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,170
- Please get a geol.
- Geol.

1447
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,210
- Get a geol.
- Geol.

1448
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,270
(Haha's team will lead the game
if he gets anything but a geol.)

1449
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,210
- Geol.
- Geolster.

1450
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,250
- It's a geol.
- It's out.

1451
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,690
(Swarming)

1452
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,150
- It's a geol.
- No, it's not.

1453
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,420
- It's a geol.
- It's out.

1454
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,380
- You're wrong. It's a geol.
- It's a geol.

1455
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,830
- It's a geol.
- It's a geol.

1456
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,100
- It's a geol.
- It's out.

1457
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,020
- It's out. It's out. Say it.
- It's definitely a geol.

1458
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,290
- It's out.
- No, it's a geol.

1459
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,520
- Check the camera.
- It's definitely out.

1460
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,270
- We came to a conclusion.
- We discussed it.

1461
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,670
- It's in.
- We concluded it's in.

1462
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,860
- It's a geol.
- All right.

1463
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,900
- It's a geol.
- Okay.

1464
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,170
- They stopped here.
- They landed on the bomb.

1465
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,580
(They landed on a bomb and went back
to the starting point.)

1466
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,310
There's a team behind us now.

1467
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,170
- There's a team behind us.
- Let's stay alert.

1468
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,610
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1469
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,110
We still have a chance.

1470
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,250
Gosh, that brat.

1471
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:34,790
Jae Suk.

1472
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,020
- They don't jibe with each other.
- It's not like you did well.

1473
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,560
- They can't be on the same team.
- Did you do well?

1474
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,520
- Just break up already.
- You didn't do well either.

1475
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,420
- We're back at the starting point.
- You didn't do well either.

1476
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,690
- They never jibe with each other.
- Gosh, that brat.

1477
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,500
- They never jibe with each other.
- I've been too nice to you.

1478
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,790
We never jibe with each other.

1479
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,440
She knows much about variety shows
as she has a lot of experience.

1480
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,500
She knows much about variety shows.

1481
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,330
- Good.
- It's a yut.

1482
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:54,540
- Let's move our piece.
- It's a yut.

1483
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,710
- How does she throw the sticks?
- It's a yut.

1484
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,000
- We can move four steps.
- We're almost there.

1485
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,380
That team is almost done.

1486
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,350
- They're almost done.
- We're done for.

1487
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,650
- We're done for.
- Okay.

1488
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,880
- Wait. She just put them down.
- What?

1489
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,580
She just put them down
instead of throwing them.

1490
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,250
- This doesn't count.
- People at Cheongdam-dong are...

1491
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,460
- so underhanded.
- Fine.

1492
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,750
- She didn't throw them.
- She never throw them properly.

1493
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,920
I'll throw them properly this time.

1494
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,420
- I guess after the shoot,
- Make sure to bend your arm.

1495
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,920
we won't see each other
for a while.

1496
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,290
- I'm so upset right now.
- Bend your arm.

1497
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,290
This will be my last appearance
on Running Man.

1498
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,190
- So I'll throw them hard.
- Sounds good.

1499
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,190
- That's good enough.
- It's a yut.

1500
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,310
It's a yut!

1501
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,400
- That's great.
- Oh, yes.

1502
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,540
Didn't she throw them too lightly?

1503
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,080
- Go ahead.
- She threw them properly.

1504
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,040
- They're almost there.
- We'll end it.

1505
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,500
- It was acceptable.
- We'll end it.

1506
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,610
- It's a do.
- It's a do.

1507
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,750
- Do and a bomb.
- We got a do and a bomb.

1508
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:34,980
- We passed the finishing point.
- Okay.

1509
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,080
And then...

1510
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,650
- They passed it.
- Where should we place the bomb?

1511
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:39,750
Where shall we place it?

1512
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,850
(The other teams will fight
for the 2nd place.)

1513
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:42,580
- We finished it.
- We won fairly.

1514
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,380
- Fair and square.
- I've never won fairly before.

1515
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,400
Fair and square.

1516
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,750
Let's get 2 yut and 3 mo.

1517
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,770
- Let's move on.
- Okay.

1518
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,020
- Yang Gae Chan.
- You can do it.

1519
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,060
Yang Gae Chan.

1520
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,230
- It's a yut!
- Yut!

1521
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,630
(Finally, they got their 1st yut.)

1522
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,940
- Let's go.
- It's a yut.

1523
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,770
- They might land on a bomb.
- Exactly.

1524
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:01,880
You can land on a bomb anytime.

1525
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,610
- A do would be perfect.
- Right.

1526
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:04,650
A bomb would be nice too.

1527
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,880
- Where is it?
- A bomb, please.

1528
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,880
- A bomb! And a yut!
- It's a yut! It's a yut!

1529
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,980
(They got 2 yut and 1 bomb
in 2 attempts.)

1530
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,080
- It's a yut.
- He just drooled.

1531
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,610
Yeon Seok drooled.

1532
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,230
(After he checked the result,)

1533
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,130
(he got so excited he drooled.)

1534
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,560
- He drooled.
- Yeon Seok.

1535
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,730
Yeon Seok.

1536
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,100
- He drooled.
- Yeon Seok.

1537
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,830
- My gosh.
- Stop it already.

1538
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,060
- I'm so happy.
- He drooled!

1539
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,170
- Yeon Seok, are you that excited?
- Hey, pretend you didn't see it.

1540
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,630
Pretend you didn't see it!

1541
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,310
- Yeon Seok just drooled.
- I'm so happy.

1542
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,310
This is so sweet.

1543
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,980
- Getting 2 yut is so sweet.
- He got too excited.

1544
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,040
- Drooling Yeon Seok.
- My gosh.

1545
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,710
- I can't believe he drooled.
- Drooling Yeon Seok.

1546
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,020
- Are you that happy?
- Yes.

1547
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,310
- Yeon Seok is so funny.
- Are you excited?

1548
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,560
This is so sweet.

1549
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,710
- He's so down-to-earth.
- My goodness.

1550
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,830
- We should avoid a geol.
- I hope you get a geol.

1551
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,500
- Is it Yeon Seok's turn?
- Yes, he'll throw them.

1552
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,630
- Throw them hard.
- Geol, geol.

1553
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,230
-<i> It will be a disaster</i>
- Geol, geol.

1554
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,900
(It will be a disaster, my darling)

1555
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,940
- What's that song?
- It's "Girl" by Aspirin.

1556
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,000
(They're getting better at choosing
a song to distract another team.)

1557
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,860
(Team Yeon Seok can avoid a bomb
if he avoids a geol.)

1558
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,170
- Geol, geol, geol.
- Mo, mo.

1559
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,230
- Geol.
- Good.

1560
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,580
- Geol, geol, geol.
- Mo, mo.

1561
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,610
- Geol.
- Good.

1562
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,000
- Oh, yes!
- It's a geol.

1563
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,080
(They got a geol.)

1564
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,650
- Oh, yes!
- It's a geol.

1565
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:16,770
Oh, yes.

1566
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,190
What is wrong with him?

1567
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:19,310
(Team Yeon Seok landed on a bomb and
went back to the starting point.)

1568
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,750
- He's so bad at this.
- We were so close.

1569
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,790
He made me lose interest
in the game.

1570
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:23,960
We were so close.

1571
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,150
- Yeon Seok is so bad at this.
- Okay.

1572
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,900
We could be in second place.

1573
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,060
- You see...
- Save it.

1574
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,230
I don't know
what the penalty will be.

1575
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,420
You'll most likely receive
the penalty.

1576
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,770
Anyway, you will...

1577
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,170
get the penalty.

1578
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,540
(Because of Yeon Seok's
terrible mistakes...)

1579
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,940
- We won!
- Oh, yes!

1580
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,360
- My goodness.
- We're in second place.

1581
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,770
(Team Yeon Hee came in 2nd place
10 minutes later.)

1582
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,810
Gosh. It's not working out
well for us.

1583
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:44,810
It's okay.

1584
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,980
- I'll announce your scores.
- Okay.

1585
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,810
The team in first place received
1,000 points.

1586
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:49,980
(Team Sooyoung
gained 1,000 points!)

1587
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,440
- And the 2nd place?
- The team in 2nd place gained 500,

1588
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,350
the 3rd place gained 300,
and the 4th place gained 100 points.

1589
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,650
- We gained 300 points.
- We gained 100 points.

1590
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,650
500, 300, and 100 points?

1591
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:56,920
- There aren't large differences.
- Okay.

1592
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,380
- We'll move to the next location.
- Okay.

1593
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,630
Gosh. I'm so upset.

1594
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,360
(Team Sooyoung: Minus 400 points,
Team Yeon Hee: Minus 400 points,)

1595
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,000
(Team Teo: Minus 900 points,)

1596
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,100
(Team Yeon Seok: Minus 1,200 points)

1597
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,600
I didn't know Yeon Seok was
so bad at the game.

1598
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,400
It turns out he's not good
at yutnori.

1599
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,830
He was so bad at it.

1600
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,270
He did even worse than we did.

1601
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:15,670
I shouldn't have teased Kwang Soo...

1602
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,380
for being lousy at games.

1603
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,210
I only got humiliated.

1604
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,440
Yeon Seok got so excited
that he drooled.

1605
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,670
Yeon Seok got so excited
that he drooled.

1606
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,520
- Just because we got a yut...
- That was unforgettable.

1607
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,110
- We got 2 yut in a row.
- He drooled...

1608
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,420
I got so excited
when we got our second yut.

1609
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,860
- He was exhilarated.
- He rarely drools like that.

1610
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:32,920
Exactly.

1611
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,960
(He was overly excited
and saliva came out of his mouth.)

1612
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,190
- Everyone.
- Yes?

1613
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,360
- We'll do the last mission shortly.
- Yes.

1614
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,860
- And we'll play a simple game now.
- Okay.

1615
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,900
To celebrate the year-end,
we'll reflect upon ourselves...

1616
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,940
at the age of 20 when we were
full of hopes and dreams.

1617
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,380
It's When I Was 20 Years Old.

1618
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,480
When I Was 20 Years Old.

1619
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,170
- It makes me tear up.
- Okay.

1620
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:55,350
We prepared the 10 songs that were
popular when you were 20.

1621
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,380
(The top 10 hit songs
when they were 20 are prepared!)

1622
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,980
And we'll play one of the songs
randomly.

1623
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,250
You'll listen to the song
for three seconds,

1624
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,980
and guess who was 20
when the song was popular,

1625
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,190
- the song title, and the singer.
- Okay.

1626
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,750
For example, you can say, "Jae Suk,
the singer, the song title".

1627
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,790
- I see.
- I feel emotional.

1628
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,860
- It's touching.
- I get it.

1629
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,520
How do we know the songs that were
popular when Suk Jin was 20?

1630
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,130
- It's Suk Jin if it's a folk song.
- Exactly.

1631
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,000
I think it's disadvantageous to you.

1632
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,440
Se Chan, are you and Kwang Soo
the same age?

1633
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,830
- I don't remember.
- He's the same age as So Min.

1634
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,040
I'm one year younger than Kwang Soo.

1635
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,540
- You're one year younger than him?
- Yes.

1636
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,670
You appeared
on many variety shows, right?

1637
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,880
- It's because you're rude.
- No, that's not it.

1638
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,210
When people who don't know us
see us, they think...

1639
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,040
It's because I look older
than my age.

1640
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,250
Kwang Soo is one year
younger than me.

1641
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,650
- You were born in 1984.
- Yes.

1642
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,750
How much older are you
than me, Yeon Hee?

1643
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,580
- I was born in 1988.
- She's younger than you.

1644
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,750
(He thought she was older than him.)

1645
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,130
- She's younger than you.
- Really?

1646
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:41,750
You speak casually to people
who are older than you.

1647
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,960
- I thought she was older than me.
- You talk formally to younger ones.

1648
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,290
That was discourteous of you.

1649
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,460
- I thought she was older than me.
- Right. It was so rude of you.

1650
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,770
- I'm sorry.
- Se Chan.

1651
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:50,670
- Earlier, you asked Teo...
- I did the same thing Teo.

1652
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:51,940
- "Teo, how old are you?"
- "Teo, how old are you?"

1653
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,540
And he said, "I'm 40."

1654
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,900
Teo, I'm sorry again.

1655
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,170
- What's with you?
- I keep guessing wrong.

1656
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,400
- "How much older are you than me?"
- Exactly.

1657
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,540
Yeon Hee looks like she's only 23.

1658
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,440
- Suk Jin, that's enough.
- That's enough.

1659
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,650
- Suk Jin must feel uncomfortable.
- You're making her uncomfortable.

1660
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,190
- You should know when to stop.
- She's on my team.

1661
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,580
They're arguing again.

1662
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,150
I'll meet Jong Kook privately later.

1663
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,230
I've been waiting for the day
when you call me out.

1664
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,860
Suk Jin, if you are to roll
on the ground, go to a snowy field.

1665
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,830
- After it snowed a lot.
- I'll treat him to a nice meal.

1666
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,230
Let's hear from our correspondent.
Se Chan.

1667
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,460
Yes, this is Yang Se Chan.

1668
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,540
Tell us what happened.

1669
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,860
Something absolutely shocking
happened here.

1670
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,830
- He's good at it.
- Comedian Ji Suk Jin...

1671
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:32,880
was rolling on the ground
without wearing trousers.

1672
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,250
in the snowy field.

1673
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,440
He wasn't wearing trousers?

1674
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,480
- He wasn't wearing trousers?
- No, he wasn't.

1675
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,580
It doesn't seem like
he did it of his own accord.

1676
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,080
It seems that someone else
robbed them from him.

1677
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,190
That's all.

1678
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,880
(The prime suspect for stealing
his trousers is Mr. Kim.)

1679
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,960
All right. Here's your
first question. Cue.

1680
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:48,500
Cue.

1681
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,520
(The 1st song will be played.)

1682
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,690
- Haha.
- So Min.

1683
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,230
(As they heard the familiar intro,)

1684
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,000
(everyone got excited.)

1685
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,190
- So Min.
- Haha, say the answer.

1686
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,770
So Min, S.E.S, "Dreams Come True".

1687
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:00,960
She wasn't 20 at the time.

1688
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,380
- Wrong.
- Let me answer.

1689
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,110
Yeon Seong...

1690
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,270
- "Yeon Seong"?
- Wrong.

1691
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,980
- Wrong.
- That's wrong.

1692
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,520
- What was that?
- Let me answer.

1693
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,520
- Go ahead.
- How could you not know his name?

1694
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,150
Ji Hyo, S.E.S, "Dreams Come True".

1695
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,420
- Wrong.
- Let me answer.

1696
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,080
- Kwang Soo was faster.
- Kwang Soo, go ahead.

1697
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,080
Haha, S.E.S, "Dreams Come True".

1698
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,020
- Correct.
- Okay!

1699
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,520
- Really? I didn't realize it.
- Haha.

1700
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,860
- "Dreams Come True".
- My gosh.

1701
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,060
What a shame.

1702
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,170
- It was when you were 20.
- <i>Dreams come true</i>

1703
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,500
Was he exactly 20 years old?

1704
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,500
("Dreams Come True" by S.E.S
was a hit song of 1998.)

1705
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,670
(The song made the hearts of
all men flutter including Haha.)

1706
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:37,170
So it was when Haha was 20.

1707
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,770
- What a shame.
- The song was very popular.

1708
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,580
- Here's the second question.
- It was Haha.

1709
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,650
Cue.

1710
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,710
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1711
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:44,850
The answer is...

1712
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,250
- Suk Jin...
- Oh, right.

1713
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,750
- Suk Jin, Kim Wan Sun...
- That's correct.

1714
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,310
- Wait.
- 3, 2, 1.

1715
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,250
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer.

1716
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,020
- I said it first.
- So Min, go ahead.

1717
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,250
Suk Jin, Kim Wan Sun,
"The Pierrot Smiles at Us".

1718
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,420
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1719
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,960
(She was certain,
but her answer was incorrect.)

1720
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,190
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1721
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,210
- Go ahead.
- Suk Jin,

1722
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:07,440
Kim Wan Sun,
"The Piroro Always Smiles at Us".

1723
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,270
- Piroro?
- Let me answer.

1724
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,330
(What? Piroro?)

1725
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,000
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1726
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,170
- Piroro?
- Let me answer.

1727
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,080
- What is Piroro?
- Let me answer.

1728
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,380
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1729
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,980
Suk Jin, Kim Wan Sun,
"The Pierrot Smiles at Us".

1730
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,290
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1731
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,250
- The answer was correct.
- Is it me?

1732
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,080
- It must be you.
- Jae Suk,

1733
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,920
Kim Wan Sun,
"The Pierrot Smiles at Us".

1734
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,330
- Correct.
- Okay!

1735
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,960
(Team Yeon Seok
got 2 questions right in a row!)

1736
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,730
- Whose song is it?
- Yours.

1737
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:34,860
Is it mine?

1738
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,540
Is it his? Isn't it mine?

1739
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,000
- You were 20 years old.
- Did the song come out in 1991?

1740
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,750
(The masterpiece caused a sensation
when Jae Suk was 20 years old.)

1741
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,000
Team Yeon Seok
got two questions right.

1742
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,540
This is a team competition, right?

1743
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,650
- Yes, it is.
- All right.

1744
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:51,650
Good job. Yeon Seok.

1745
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,290
- They got two questions right.
- Good job.

1746
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:55,210
Kwang Soo keeps stealing answers.

1747
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:56,420
Here comes the next question.

1748
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,520
(It's the third question.)

1749
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,420
Se Chan!

1750
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,970
Se Chan!

1751
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,470
What is this song?

1752
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:12,220
Se Chan, Buzz, "Coward".

1753
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,620
(Se Chan, Buzz, "Coward")

1754
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,970
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1755
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:16,350
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1756
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,510
- So Min.
- You are right.

1757
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:21,720
- Kwang Soo, Buzz, "Thorn".
- It must be Kwang Soo.

1758
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:22,950
No.

1759
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,030
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1760
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,300
Yeon Seok.

1761
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,700
- 5, 4,
- Buzz,

1762
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,600
- three...
- "Coward"...

1763
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,120
- Is it Yeon Seok?
- So Min.

1764
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,600
- Incorrect.
- I told you it's incorrect!

1765
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,740
(He explodes.)

1766
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,810
What is wrong with him?

1767
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:37,310
- He drives me crazy.
- What are you doing?

1768
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,910
Did you tell me it's incorrect?

1769
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,200
- Ji Hyo.
- Yeon Seok,

1770
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,140
- Buzz, "Coward".
- Is it me?

1771
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,010
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1772
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,510
Yeon Seok, Buzz, "Coward".

1773
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,350
- Incorrect.
- Is it wrong?

1774
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,850
Let's listen to the song a bit more.

1775
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,120
It's "Coward".

1776
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,120
Maybe it isn't Yeon Seok.

1777
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,580
- It's a song by Buzz.
- That's right.

1778
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,780
Yes.

1779
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,850
(Everyone sings along naturally.)

1780
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,620
Let me answer.

1781
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,490
Kwang Soo, Buzz, "Thorn".

1782
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,160
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1783
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,910
Kwang Soo, Buzz, "Thorn".
It's correct, isn't it?

1784
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:09,910
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1785
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,560
- I tried that answer.
- Jae Suk tried that answer.

1786
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,830
Is it "Thorn"?

1787
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,680
- He gave the exact same answer.
- Se Chan, did you try "Thorn"?

1788
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,010
I tried "Thorn".

1789
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,680
(This song is...)

1790
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,740
("Thorn" by Buzz
which was released in 2005.)

1791
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,950
(Every man must have copied
Min Kyung Hoon's head voice.)

1792
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,950
The right combination
hasn't come up yet.

1793
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,720
- Really?
- Let me answer.

1794
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,620
- Jong Kook, Buzz, "Thorn".
- No.

1795
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,490
- Incorrect.
- Yeon Seok, Buzz, "Thorn".

1796
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,700
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1797
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,490
Yeon Seok, Buzz, "Coward".

1798
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,990
- Incorrect.
- It isn't "Coward".

1799
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:37,120
Maybe it isn't "Coward" or "Thorn".

1800
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,530
- Isn't it "Thorn"?
- "Thorn".

1801
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,100
- Is it a song by Buzz?
- Let me answer.

1802
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,240
- Jae Suk.
- Is it "Thorn"?

1803
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,970
- Yeon Seok.
- So Min, Buzz, "Thorn".

1804
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,930
- Correct.
- What?

1805
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,240
- No one said it.
- Didn't someone say my name?

1806
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,410
No one said it
with Buzz and "Thorn".

1807
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,310
Did no one say
"Se Chan, Buzz, 'Thorn'"?

1808
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:52,140
- Didn't you say it?
- I thought I did.

1809
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,370
- "Thorn".
- I thought it was "Coward".

1810
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,410
"Thorn".

1811
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,620
(Suk Jin is singing "Coward".)

1812
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,490
(This is the answer.)

1813
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,850
(They loudly sing the song
everyone sang at the karaoke.)

1814
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:03,950
- Next question, cue.
- Okay.

1815
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,600
- I will answer it.
- Let me answer.

1816
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,390
- 3, 2.

1817
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:10,830
Teo, Uhm Jung Hwa, "Pupil".

1818
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,200
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1819
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,100
Ji Hyo, Uhm Jung Hwa, "Poison".

1820
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,810
- Incorrect.
- Yeon Seok, Uhm Jung Hwa, "Poison".

1821
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:19,970
Incorrect.
Let's listen to it some more.

1822
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,740
It isn't "Poison".

1823
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:23,580
It isn't "Poison".

1824
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,780
All right.

1825
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:27,010
- Let me answer.
- I figured it out!

1826
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,680
Yeon Hee! Yeon Hee!

1827
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,510
- BoA.
- "Atlantis Princess".

1828
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,850
"Atlantis Princess".

1829
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,580
- Incorrect.
- It is a song by BoA.

1830
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,060
- Sooyoung!
- All right.

1831
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,890
Yeon Seok, BoA, "Atlantis Princess".

1832
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:40,060
- Correct!
- Yes!

1833
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,430
(Nice!)

1834
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,600
She pronounced it strangely.

1835
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,140
- No, I didn't.
- She said "Tiramisu Princess".

1836
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,140
- She said "Tiramisu Princess".
- "Tiramisu Princess".

1837
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,740
Sooyoung, say the answer clearly.

1838
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:52,140
- Atlantis.
- Atlantis.

1839
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,580
- "Atlantis Princess".
- I was so close.

1840
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,030
- It gets confusing.
- I know.

1841
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,310
- She got it right.
- "Atlantis Princess".

1842
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,410
(Yeon Seok was 20 years old
in 2003.)

1843
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:01,850
(The star of Asia,
BoA released this masterpiece.)

1844
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,780
- We will have two more questions.
- Okay.

1845
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,950
- Yeon Seok, answer one.
- Okay.

1846
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,620
- Let's go.
- Look at Yeon Seok.

1847
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,060
- I will answer.
- Yeon Seok, concentrate!

1848
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,330
Don't look outside the window.

1849
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,850
Figure out who was 20 years old.
Song title and singer too.

1850
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:14,890
Let's go.

1851
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,120
(Let me answer.)

1852
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,030
Let me answer.

1853
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,490
god, "Lies"... Hold on.
Who was 20 years old then?

1854
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,560
- 3, 2...
- So Min.

1855
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,810
- So Min.
- Incorrect.

1856
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:26,370
Let me answer.
Kwang Soo, god, "Lies".

1857
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:27,680
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1858
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,350
Yeon Seok, god, "Lies".

1859
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,850
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1860
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,240
- So Min.
- Ji Hyo, god, "Lies".

1861
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,510
- Correct.
- It was Ji Hyo.

1862
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:37,620
(Was it me?)

1863
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,310
Really?

1864
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,060
- Was it me?
- "Lies" came out a long time ago.

1865
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,030
(The song made god
the national idol group...)

1866
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,330
(and made everyone sing,
"Goodbye, don't go.")

1867
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,600
They were young back then.

1868
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,030
- I had no idea.
- god.

1869
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:52,470
- Now comes the last question.
- Okay.

1870
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:53,760
That was close.

1871
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,970
- Yeon Seok, get it right.
- Yeon Seok,

1872
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,200
just yell, "Let me answer."

1873
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,010
- Yeon Seok, help out your team.
- Okay.

1874
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:00,200
Let's go. Music, cue.

1875
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,200
(The last song plays.)

1876
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,470
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1877
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:03,680
- Okay.
- The answer is...

1878
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,580
3, 2, 1.

1879
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,720
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1880
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,410
Hold on. Yeon Hee should go first.

1881
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:11,310
Kwang Soo,
Kim Hyun Jung, "Bruise".

1882
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:12,410
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1883
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,580
- Let me answer.
- Yeon Seok.

1884
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,760
- Hold on.
- Let me answer.

1885
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,430
- "Bruise"?
- Kim Hyun Jung...

1886
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,720
Hold on. Yeon Seok said it first.

1887
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,160
- Yeon Seok.
- Okay.

1888
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,450
Jong Kook, Kim Hyun Jung,

1889
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:22,530
- "Bruise".
- "Bruise".

1890
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:23,830
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1891
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:25,160
- Let me answer.
- What?

1892
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,800
Jong Kook.

1893
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,930
I will play it again.

1894
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,760
- What is it?
- It sounds familiar.

1895
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,780
I can't hear it.

1896
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,200
- "Farewell Again".
- Let me answer.

1897
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,580
- What?
- I think it's "Tears".

1898
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,100
- Jong Kook.
- That isn't it.

1899
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,510
- R.ef...
- That isn't it.

1900
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:41,720
- 3, 2, 1.
- He only knows his songs.

1901
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,120
- Incorrect.
- It goes like this.

1902
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,410
(The song has a familiar melody.)

1903
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,580
Listen to the lyrics.

1904
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,760
How do the lyrics go?

1905
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,120
It's an old song.

1906
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,490
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

1907
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:55,530
- Haha, Kim Hyun Jung,
- Go ahead.

1908
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,720
(Haha, Kim Hyun Jung)

1909
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,430
- "Breaking up Alone".
- Incorrect.

1910
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:00,200
The lyrics contained the title.

1911
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,100
- Sooyoung.
- Go ahead.

1912
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:05,970
Who was it? Haha, Kim Hyun Jung,
"Breakup with Her".

1913
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,930
- Correct!
- That's right. "Breakup with Her"!

1914
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:08,970
(Correct!)

1915
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,510
(She succeeded to get
the last question right.)

1916
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,680
That's right.

1917
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:14,510
- "Breakup with Her".
- We were so close.

1918
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:16,410
We messed up from the start.

1919
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,410
- It was Haha.
- It was me.

1920
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,120
- "Breakup with Her".
- That's right.

1921
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,680
(People who could hit high notes
attempted to sing this song.)

1922
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,600
(The song with high notes in which
her belting cleansed the eardrums)

1923
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:30,060
"It was my fault."
That's the song, right?

1924
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,870
"I didn't forget."

1925
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,990
- Everyone...
- Here is the result.

1926
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,910
- Team Sooyoung took first place.
- Yes!

1927
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,680
- Did they take first place again?
- We got many questions right.

1928
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,950
Team Yeon Seok took 2nd place
with 2 questions right.

1929
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,140
- Okay!
- Okay!

1930
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,310
The other two teams
are at the bottom.

1931
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:48,310
We will give
500, 300, and 100 points.

1932
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:50,240
- Okay, okay.
- In that case,

1933
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,780
- we won points.
- Do we have plus 100 points now?

1934
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,620
Is there a game that uses the body?

1935
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,160
The next mission uses the body.

1936
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:59,990
Before we begin the last mission,
I will announce the current points.

1937
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,660
In first place is Team Sooyoung
with plus 100 points.

1938
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:06,030
- Plus?
- They placed first in both games.

1939
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:07,470
They placed first in both games.

1940
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,810
- Every member is good at games.
- Yes.

1941
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,930
Team Yeon Hee, minus 300 points.

1942
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,810
Team Teo, minus 800 points.

1943
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,740
Team Teo, minus 800 points.

1944
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,740
- Are we still in the last place?
- Team Yeon Seok,

1945
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,740
minus 1,100 points.

1946
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,470
- But we...
- We...

1947
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,140
- We received points.
- The current score reflects that.

1948
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,390
Are we still in the last place?

1949
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,140
- I mean...
- From minus 1,400 points...

1950
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,410
(Why are we still in the last place
when we worked so hard?)

1951
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,160
Why are we still in the last place
when we worked so hard?

1952
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,220
Do you guys keep receiving
minus points?

1953
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,120
- I don't know.
- The thing is, Yeon Seok...

1954
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,800
- isn't contributing at all.
- Seriously.

1955
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,700
(The thing is, Yeon Seok
isn't contributing at all.)

1956
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,700
Seriously.

1957
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,600
We started at minus 900 points.

1958
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,030
You should have written down
more merits.

1959
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Yeon Seok really is bad at games.

1960
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,870
- You are right.
- He is the worst.

1961
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:48,510
- I wasn't going to complain, but...
- He is suited for variety shows.

1962
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:50,140
If Yeon Seok ages well,

1963
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,280
he will become Suk Jin.

1964
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,310
- That's right.
- He hates it.

1965
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:54,950
- Yeon Seok hates it.
- He is devastated.

1966
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:56,780
- He hates it.
- It's true, Yeon Seok.

1967
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,850
Suk Jin loves games,
but he is bad at them.

1968
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,780
Oh, no.

1969
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,060
"Oh, no."

1970
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,260
I am sorry, Suk Jin.

1971
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,260
I mean...

1972
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,800
- Suk Jin became sullen for real.
- It's okay.

1973
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,370
He became sullen for real.

1974
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:11,490
It's just that I want to be
at games.

1975
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,970
Suk Jin met the right team.

1976
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,660
He didn't do anything,

1977
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,530
but his teammates saved him.
Yeon Hee was really good.

1978
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:20,600
Yeon Hee played diligently.

1979
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,100
- I didn't know she was so cheerful.
- Seriously.

1980
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,010
- She is competitive too.
- My throat hurts.

1981
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,010
The last mission...

1982
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,680
is the Push and Pull Car Racer
for 2021.

1983
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,620
(Push and Pull Car Racer)

1984
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,280
While wearing a blindfold,

1985
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,260
you will come down a slope in a car.

1986
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:38,080
You succeed...

1987
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,660
if you step on the brake
and stop the car...

1988
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:40,890
as close as you can to the edge.

1989
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:41,990
(A success)

1990
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,470
Before you go,

1991
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,140
you can bet points.

1992
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,300
- Your points?
- Yes.

1993
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,870
Let's say you bet 100 points.

1994
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,370
It can become minus 200,
minus 100 points, etc.

1995
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:54,140
You can win up to
five times the points.

1996
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:56,810
No matter how many points you bet,

1997
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,850
we will give you 300 points
if you fall into starch.

1998
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,310
We win 300 points
if we fall into starch.

1999
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,010
You can press the brake only once.

2000
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,390
(You can press the brake only once.)

2001
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:06,680
Teammates can yell, "Stop."

2002
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,890
(Teammates can yell, "Stop.")

2003
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:11,530
The 1st and 2nd teams
that get 2,020 points will win.

2004
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,220
If no team gets 2,020 points...

2005
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,200
even after the fourth round,

2006
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:18,300
the final scores
will determine the rankings.

2007
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,200
- This is our only chance.
- Okay, okay.

2008
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,430
- This is our only chance.
- Let's go.

2009
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,530
The first player of each team
should go up.

2010
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,080
(The 1st player of each team
on standby)

2011
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,310
Be careful.

2012
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,240
(The king of curiosity
checks out the cart.)

2013
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,850
- It doesn't fit.
- I see.

2014
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,180
(He gets on the cart.)

2015
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,390
You can't practice.

2016
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:37,390
You can't do it.

2017
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:38,450
- Why are you practicing?
- Catch him.

2018
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,450
(He goes down the slope.)

2019
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,030
(Flustered)

2020
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,530
- Stop.
- No, no.

2021
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:45,830
- Jae Suk, stop.
- Catch him.

2022
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,030
- He is at the bottom.
- Why are you practicing?

2023
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,990
(He fails to hit the brake.)

2024
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,640
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

2025
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,740
(He falls off the edge.)

2026
01:01:55,330 --> 01:02:00,010
(He went down unexpectedly
and dove into the starch.)

2027
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,700
- What was that?
- Why is he so flippant?

2028
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,780
What was that?

2029
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,580
Hey, hey.

2030
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:10,010
I wasn't going to go down.

2031
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,120
You are so mischievous.

2032
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,680
He always breaks the rules.

2033
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,390
He is a comedian
through and through.

2034
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,990
- It wasn't intentional.
- He is the best.

2035
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,490
- It wasn't intentional.
- Gosh.

2036
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,660
I will go fourth.

2037
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,370
Once it speeds it...

2038
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:26,760
It takes time for the cart to stop.

2039
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,930
Let's go!

2040
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,260
So Min, tell us
how many points you will bet.

2041
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,030
How many points will you bet?

2042
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:33,810
Do I choose?

2043
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:35,530
Bet 1,000 points.

2044
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,510
Shall I add 1,000 more points
to that?

2045
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:38,850
(She bets like
there is no tomorrow.)

2046
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:40,140
Get a hold of yourself, So Min.

2047
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:42,680
- Put on a blindfold.
- Let's go.

2048
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:43,890
Let's go.

2049
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,550
Let's go.

2050
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,510
(She could win 5,000 points
or lose 2,000 points.)

2051
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,390
I am so scared. Hold on.

2052
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,720
Push gently.

2053
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,080
- Let's go.
- Push gently.

2054
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,200
I'm pushing.

2055
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,990
- So Min, are you ready?
- Okay.

2056
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,970
(How will she do?)

2057
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,140
Not yet. Not yet. Not yet.

2058
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,260
(It's a tense moment.)

2059
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:07,180
It won't go down.

2060
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,010
- Did you hit the brake?
- I didn't.

2061
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,740
- Hold on, hold on.
- Oh, no. So Min.

2062
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:12,850
So Min, press it!

2063
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:16,850
(Kwang Soo pushes the cart.)

2064
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:18,810
- Hold on, hold on.
- Oh, no. So Min.

2065
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:21,120
- So Min, press it!
- Stop!

2066
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,160
(Despite her teammates' cries,)

2067
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,260
(she lands in starch.)

2068
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,660
- Hey!
- She should have pressed...

2069
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:33,970
- the brake.
- You jerk!

2070
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:35,490
- It's your fault!
- The cart had stopped.

2071
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:36,660
I only helped her.

2072
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,310
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I only helped her.

2073
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:40,180
- I only helped her.
- This is hilarious.

2074
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,280
I only helped her.

2075
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,410
So Min, are you okay?

2076
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,050
So Min, it's a ski resort.

2077
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,180
- Are you okay?
- So Min, it's a ski resort.

2078
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,450
Kwang Soo.

2079
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,620
(Sneezing)

2080
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,060
Who pushed me?

2081
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,390
- Kwang Soo.
- It wasn't like that.

2082
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:56,560
It wasn't like that.

2083
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,350
The cart had come to a full stop.

2084
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,260
- Fine.
- I had to help.

2085
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:02,700
- Kwang Soo.
- Let's go.

2086
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,300
Kwang Soo, how many points
will you bet?

2087
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,970
- I will bet 1,000 points.
- Okay.

2088
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,100
Okay. 1,000 points.

2089
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,200
Kwang Soo, we will tell you
when to stop.

2090
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,080
- Where should he stop?
- Hold on.

2091
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,310
Shall we tell him to stop at the
"multiply by minus one" mark?

2092
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:18,050
Let's tell him to stop
at the "multiply by zero" mark.

2093
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,620
1,000 points.

2094
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,010
I am in the right position, right?

2095
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,450
Okay.

2096
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,080
- Let's go.
- I am in the right position, right?

2097
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,310
- Yes.
- Am I...

2098
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:29,490
(Kwang Soo sets off with hopes
to escape from the minus points!)

2099
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,890
- Stop!
- Stop!

2100
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,490
- Stop!
- Stop!

2101
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,890
(Will Kwang Soo be able
to stop in time?)

2102
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,470
(He crashes into starch!)

2103
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:45,810
(He fiddled with the brake
belatedly...)

2104
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,700
(and crashed.)

2105
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,280
Is this how it's done?

2106
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:52,870
- No one is succeeding to stop.
- Hey.

2107
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,950
- Did you run a simulation?
- Yes.

2108
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:56,310
Were you able to stop?

2109
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,620
We were able to stop.

2110
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,410
- I don't think the brake works.
- The teammates should help.

2111
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,580
You know...

2112
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,990
The teammates should help.

2113
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:05,390
He flew off like KTX.

2114
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,100
It's impossible to stop.

2115
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,530
I don't think the brake works.

2116
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,930
- Shall we give a demonstration?
- Yes.

2117
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:13,490
Why would you give a demonstration
at this point?

2118
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,430
- You should have done it sooner.
- You are done.

2119
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:17,600
(He gets angry with a pale face.)

2120
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,580
(They put the cart back in place
for demonstration.)

2121
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,530
Suk Jin, help me with this.

2122
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,450
Don't just leave.

2123
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:25,510
Carry this with me.

2124
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:29,680
- We will give a demonstration.
- Okay.

2125
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,080
Let's see a demonstration.

2126
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,950
Let's see a demonstration.

2127
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:35,780
(The representative
of the production crew comes up.)

2128
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:36,990
- Try it.
- Okay.

2129
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,390
Try it with this cart.

2130
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:43,030
(He checks the brake expertly.)

2131
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:46,430
(The simulation team
has gone through countless games.)

2132
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:47,560
Stop before you go off the edge.

2133
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,970
(To make a safe and fun game,)

2134
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:53,510
(the best driver has ridden the cart
dozens of times.)

2135
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,080
(The ace member sets off
to quell their complaints.)

2136
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,180
Let's see it.

2137
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:57,510
Will he succeed?

2138
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:59,780
Come on. Come on!

2139
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,080
(He stops the cart in less than 1m.)

2140
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,240
Hey!

2141
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:09,080
(He should be embarrassed
about the distance.)

2142
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,260
Hey!

2143
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,120
Why did you send a coward?

2144
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:14,830
He is a coward!
He didn't even go halfway down.

2145
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,930
- He is a coward!
- This is impossible.

2146
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:18,430
Even a staff member can't do it.

2147
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:19,740
(Being under pressure made him stop
as soon as he began.)

2148
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,740
(A moment ago,)

2149
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:25,260
(the simulation team could stop
as they wanted.)

2150
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:26,330
(Proud)

2151
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:29,910
- Let's go.
- Let's bet 1,000 points.

2152
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,620
1,000 points. He is confident.

2153
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,740
1,000 points.

2154
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:37,180
- Here we go.
- Stop him.

2155
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,620
(The cart moves
before he gets into position.)

2156
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,890
Stop, stop.

2157
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:41,910
Hey.

2158
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,220
What was that?

2159
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:45,990
(He pressed the brake
as hard as he could.)

2160
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:48,660
(He got thrown into starch.)

2161
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,370
This game is no fun.

2162
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:53,430
(The flippant man had it coming.)

2163
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,430
- Hey!
- The brake is broken!

2164
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:59,200
He pressed it early on,
but it didn't stop!

2165
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,640
- Hey!
- The brake is broken!

2166
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,780
- He pressed it right away.
- It doesn't work!

2167
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,550
He pressed it right away,
but it didn't stop!

2168
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:08,350
What is this nonsense?

2169
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,140
Listen.

2170
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:11,990
After it speeds up,

2171
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,910
it should be halted
halfway down the slope.

2172
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,560
Why are you running a simulation
with us?

2173
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,030
- Why?
- We tried it many times.

2174
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:20,300
Can we take off our blindfolds?

2175
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:22,450
We did wear blindfolds, but...

2176
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,760
- Let's start over...
- From the next round,

2177
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,430
- without the blindfolds.
- we will take out the blindfolds.

2178
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:28,300
- All right.
- Teo is determined.

2179
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,410
He studied everyone carefully.

2180
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,280
He is serious.

2181
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,530
Jong Kook tends to succeed
when he plays games like this.

2182
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,550
I bet Jong Kook will succeed.
I bet Jong Kook will succeed.

2183
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,720
(He checks the cart.)

2184
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:43,310
How many points will you bet?

2185
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:46,220
- Bet 1,000 points. 1,000 points.
- 1,000 points.

2186
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,720
- 1,000 points?
- Yes.

2187
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:48,890
- Let's go.
- 1,000 points.

2188
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:49,990
- I will push you.
- Okay.

2189
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:57,060
(He refuses to be covered in
what isn't even protein powder.)

2190
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:00,200
(The protein monster sets off
with determination!)

2191
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,600
(Screeching)

2192
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,700
What?

2193
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,560
(After 2.5m,)

2194
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,100
(the cart stops.)

2195
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,240
- "Multiply by minus two".
- Okay.

2196
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:11,550
- Yes!
- Yes!

2197
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:13,350
- "Multiply by minus two".
- Minus 2,000 points.

2198
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,240
(Team Sooyoung loses 2,000 points.)

2199
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,640
- It works!
- "Multiply by minus two".

2200
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,410
- "Multiply by minus two".
- The brake works well!

2201
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:20,410
(The protein monster gets angry
when he is embarrassed.)

2202
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:22,010
- Nice!
- Okay!

2203
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:23,680
- Minus 2,000 points.
- Minus 2,000 points.

2204
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,060
(The cart halted quickly
because he used his muscles.)

2205
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,490
- Okay. This cart stops well.
- They are at the bottom now.

2206
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:28,860
- Listen.
- They are at the bottom now.

2207
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:30,620
We could wear blindfolds.
The brake works well.

2208
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,860
- Minus 2,000 points.
- We could wear blindfolds.

2209
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:34,770
We could wear blindfolds.
The brake works well.

2210
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,730
It's a party!

2211
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:38,360
Jong Kook, you are a coward.

2212
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:40,440
Had you gone off the edge,
you would have gotten 300 points.

2213
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,310
The cart moved this much
when the others hit the brake.

2214
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:43,940
- So I did it early on.
- Jong Kook, it was fun.

2215
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:46,650
- The sound was so petty.
- It was fun.

2216
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:47,870
It was fun.

2217
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:50,110
Yeon Seok, you saw how it's done.

2218
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,550
Hit the brake around here.

2219
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,410
- Let's go.
- My goodness.

2220
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:55,520
- Wear the helmet.
- Yeon Seok, you must do this.

2221
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,980
Okay. 2,000 points.

2222
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:58,950
I won't play around this time.

2223
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:00,800
- I will do it with seriousness.
- Yeon Seok.

2224
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,490
- You failed all day, okay?
- Succeed just this once.

2225
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,020
- You failed all day, okay?
- Succeed just this once.

2226
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:06,300
- Show us your cool side.
- Okay.

2227
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,940
We don't know
what the penalty will be.

2228
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,770
(I won't fail anymore!)

2229
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,360
Even if you stop at yellow,
we will be set.

2230
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,010
Okay.

2231
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,180
I will succeed.

2232
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:18,510
- I will put an end to failures.
- Okay.

2233
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,520
(He gives his words of resolution.)

2234
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:23,940
I will put an end to failures.

2235
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,580
Hold on. No!

2236
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,780
What is he doing?

2237
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:30,650
Hold on. No!

2238
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,150
- What is he doing?
- No one pushed him.

2239
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,400
(No one pushed him.)

2240
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,570
(What is he doing?)

2241
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:39,230
What is he doing? What is he doing?

2242
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:43,640
(After an unimpressive ride,
he falls in a fancy way.)

2243
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,530
- What is he doing?
- What was that?

2244
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,110
- What is up with him?
- What are you doing?

2245
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:50,650
- You're talking nonsense.
- Hey...

2246
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:51,680
What is wrong with him?

2247
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,570
Why did you look back
when no one pushed you?

2248
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:54,870
- What is wrong with him?
- What is wrong with him?

2249
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:56,150
- Did you see a ghost?
- Gosh.

2250
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,780
- What is wrong with him?
- What did he do?

2251
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,910
What are you doing?

2252
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:00,320
- What are you doing?
- What is wrong with him?

2253
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,220
- What are you doing?
- I thought someone pushed me.

2254
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:03,430
Who would push you?

2255
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:04,690
- Who would push you?
- There was no one behind you.

2256
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:06,320
- I just...
- No one paid attention to you.

2257
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,100
(He only ended up
extending his life.)

2258
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:11,860
I thought Jong Kook pushed me.

2259
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:12,900
(Failing Yeon Seok became
covered in starch.)

2260
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,440
That was so funny, Yeon Seok.

2261
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,160
Yeon Seok, it's okay
since you were funny.

2262
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,810
- Gosh.
- It's okay since you were funny.

2263
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:19,270
It's better to brush it hard.

2264
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:20,270
(Lee Kwang Soo, Starch expert,
It's better to brush it hard.)

2265
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:22,230
I brushed hard to brush
the starch off.

2266
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:24,200
(I'll also brush it off you then.)

2267
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,410
What are you doing?

2268
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:27,610
(Altruistic cheek-slapping...)

2269
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:28,770
(where the slappers are dying
to brush off the starch)

2270
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:31,580
That's heartwarming.
The year-end is so heartwarming.

2271
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,650
- Yes.
- You can help each other out.

2272
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,080
- That's right.
- Our company is running...

2273
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,430
so darn well.

2274
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,730
Yes, your company is really...

2275
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,150
(Heartwarming)

2276
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,020
Our company is running
so darn well.

2277
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,450
(The two starch King Kongs are
showing off a special friendship.)

2278
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:43,520
- Hey.
- Oh, my.

2279
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,270
(I think only good things
will happen in 2021.)

2280
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:50,310
We're starting again.

2281
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,510
- It's Teo's turn.
- Teo!

2282
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:53,900
(It's Teo's turn
to bet on 1,000 points.)

2283
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,900
- Let's go.
- You can do it.

2284
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,510
I think he can do it
for some reason.

2285
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:57,870
You only have to do it once.

2286
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:58,940
It's 10,000 dollars.

2287
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:02,520
There's a ghost next to Ji Hyo.

2288
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,440
- What?
- Me?

2289
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,980
(A 2.4m tall ghost that looks pale)

2290
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,260
- He's just standing like that.
- Me?

2291
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,980
- Yes.
- Why is he standing there?

2292
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:11,190
He's just standing like that.

2293
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:12,620
- He's scary.
- What's happening?

2294
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,900
He's taking off.
He accepted the challenge.

2295
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,150
He accepted the challenge.
Do your best.

2296
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:16,470
(Teo takes off.)

2297
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:18,990
(Think of the autobahn you
experienced when you were young.)

2298
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:20,070
Okay, go.

2299
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,470
- No way.
- Nice!

2300
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:25,810
(It's a cowardly riding...)

2301
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:26,900
(that you can't see in Germany.)

2302
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,230
- Okay!
- Okay!

2303
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:31,650
Nice! That's double minus points!

2304
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,720
- What are you...
- I'm not in last place anymore!.

2305
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,570
- He's a coward.
- He's a coward.

2306
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,720
- Gosh.
- He's a coward.

2307
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:40,360
- This is...
- Yoo Teo, "Coward" by Buzz.

2308
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,650
Teo.

2309
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:42,650
Give this to me again.

2310
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:44,650
- That's it.
- It's not locked completely.

2311
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:46,800
(They're trying hard
to fix the brake.)

2312
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:49,060
Kwang Soo, just come out
if you can't do it.

2313
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,230
It's going to break.

2314
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,400
(He succeeded at once.)

2315
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,600
- He did it.
- It's working now.

2316
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:56,330
(Oh, so that's how it's done?)

2317
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,140
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

2318
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:00,180
It's over if I just press this once.

2319
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,640
- Wait a minute.
- Just go.

2320
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,240
- Wait a minute.
- Wait a minute.

2321
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,610
What is wrong with you?

2322
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,010
What is wrong with him?

2323
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,650
- You need to take off quickly.
- I'm getting ready.

2324
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:08,910
- During the test...
- Lean to the back.

2325
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:09,940
- From here...
- No.

2326
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:11,350
I'm going to go fast.

2327
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:12,980
- He's going to go fast.
- I'm going to go fast.

2328
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:15,520
Look. I will stop when I lock
the brake around "multiply by two".

2329
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,560
- Will you speed?
- I will.

2330
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,690
- He's heavy, so...
- So now...

2331
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,400
- Let's go.
- Let go after you tell me.

2332
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,300
(The speed helper forces
a fast take off.)

2333
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:25,600
Wait, it's broken.

2334
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:29,510
(Wait, it's broken!)

2335
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,870
(He fell forward after making
a lot of noise from the brake.)

2336
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:34,510
You said you would go fast.

2337
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,680
- You...
- This is impossible.

2338
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,050
You said you would go fast.

2339
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,910
- I'm going to take off.
- Just go.

2340
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,110
- Haha. Teo.
- Do your best!

2341
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,550
I'm going to aim for 2,000 points.

2342
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,360
- 2,000 points. Deal!
- Take it and double it.

2343
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,360
He's voluntarily going to
the underworld.

2344
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,080
He's voluntarily going to
the underworld.

2345
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,400
Okay, I'll take off.

2346
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,060
(The fate of their team depends on
the fingertips of the troublemaker.)

2347
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:58,100
Good.

2348
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:00,600
(Creaking)

2349
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:03,860
He did it!

2350
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,070
- It's "multiply by one".
- Okay.

2351
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:08,180
(He successfully stopped
at "multiply by one".)

2352
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,440
(The troublemaker
who always caused trouble...)

2353
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,940
(made his teammates proud
for the first time.)

2354
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,480
- "Multiply by one".
- I should've gone a little further.

2355
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,020
(He gained 2,000 points
with an amazing control.)

2356
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,950
- You were really awesome!
- I should've gone a little further.

2357
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,520
- I should've gone a little further.
- Yes.

2358
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,760
You gained 2,000 points!

2359
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,820
- I should've gone a little further.
- We could've gotten 4,000 points.

2360
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:29,660
(Bitter)

2361
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,230
- Okay, then. This team won.
- Gosh.

2362
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,360
- We won?
- Yes.

2363
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:34,970
- We won?
- We won!

2364
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:36,730
Yes, but we will continue until
we have a team in second place.

2365
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,940
(Even the winners are
puzzled by the news of winning.)

2366
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,480
(We did it!)

2367
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,030
- What are they doing?
- I think we will be in last place.

2368
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,510
- This is unbelievable.
- After that...

2369
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,610
- This is incredible.
- Didn't they have any minus points?

2370
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:47,370
Didn't they have any minus points?

2371
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:48,850
Weren't they in last place?

2372
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,520
(Are you sure that team is
in 1st place?)

2373
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,650
They didn't win, did they?

2374
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:53,220
(Murmuring)

2375
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,320
They were?

2376
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,060
- Everyone.
- Look at this.

2377
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:57,280
I'm sorry.

2378
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,320
You have 1,820 points right now.
You need 200 more points.

2379
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,400
- Come on.
- 1,820?

2380
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,490
(They need 200 more points to get
the winning score of 2,020 points.)

2381
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:02,620
You need more points.

2382
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,100
- 1,820 points?
- You need more points.

2383
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,860
- Tell us why you did that.
- Hey.

2384
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,530
The atmosphere was nice just now.

2385
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:10,610
- We did ceremonies like crazy.
- You should've kept it going.

2386
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:11,770
(There's an exchange of joy and
sorrow because of the reversal.)

2387
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:13,830
- It's not over yet.
- We need more points.

2388
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:15,480
It's not over yet.

2389
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,510
If I just land in the starch
and receive 300 points...

2390
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:19,270
- You will succeed then.
- Okay.

2391
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,440
- Teo.
- Yes?

2392
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,270
- Just land in the starch.
- Just land in the starch.

2393
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,940
We get 300 points if we land
in there. You'll look cool.

2394
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:25,610
- Just land in the starch.
- Okay.

2395
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:28,190
(They start to murmur again.)

2396
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:31,320
Everyone, I'm really sorry,

2397
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,360
but you had minus 2,200 points.

2398
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,120
That's right. They had
a lot of minus points.

2399
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,800
So you have minus 200 points now.

2400
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:39,270
- I'm sorry.
- What is he talking about?

2401
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:41,230
I'm sorry.

2402
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,830
There's still a long way to go.

2403
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:44,010
Why are you causing such a fuss?

2404
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:45,140
Goodness.

2405
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:46,310
- I'm sorry.
- There's still a long way to go.

2406
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,700
(The staff continues to make
embarrassing calculation mistakes.)

2407
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,530
- I'm sorry.
- You should get beaten up first.

2408
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:50,610
I'm really sorry.

2409
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:51,770
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

2410
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,220
I thought the game was over.

2411
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:55,020
(He thought the game was over
because they caused such a fuss.)

2412
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:56,940
Did they just reach
minus 200 points?

2413
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:58,410
Are you kidding me?

2414
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:00,980
- You didn't win yet.
- Gosh.

2415
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,980
- Hey.
- We're even done doing ceremonies.

2416
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:05,950
- Did you just reach minus 200?
- What are you doing?

2417
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,400
- What are you doing?
- What is happening?

2418
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,300
- We're even done doing ceremonies.
- Okay.

2419
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,230
You had minus 2,200 points earlier
because of Yoo Teo.

2420
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,690
You earned 2,000 points just now.

2421
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:14,730
(His brain is in full operation.)

2422
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:16,140
We bet 2,000 points though.

2423
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,070
- So you earned that.
- And they got "multiply by one".

2424
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:19,310
- You ended up with that.
- Will we get minus zero...

2425
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:20,530
if we get "multiply by 0"?

2426
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:21,680
No, it's just zero.

2427
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,700
Just cut it out.

2428
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,550
What's the difference
between 0 and 1?

2429
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:29,780
Zero means that
you won't earn anything.

2430
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,550
- We gave you 2,000 points.
- He can't even win.

2431
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:32,720
- Hey.
- Haha.

2432
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,950
Dumb Haha, just come here.

2433
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:35,820
2,000 times 0 is 0.

2434
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,260
Why do you keep complaining to him
when he's highly educated?

2435
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,820
- He said you're highly educated.
- Why do you keep acting up?

2436
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,620
- He will lose just like that.
- Gosh.

2437
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,520
- He lost.
- He's returning.

2438
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,400
I'm sorry for the confusion.

2439
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,970
Multiplying it by zero
obviously give them zero points.

2440
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:47,270
Doesn't he know how to multiply?

2441
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,860
This is the last round.

2442
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:51,970
- It's Jae Suk's turn then.
- Will Jae Suk do it?

2443
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:53,030
- Me?
- We're in second place now.

2444
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:55,010
How many points do we have
right now?

2445
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,370
- Please tell us exactly.
- Aren't we in second place?

2446
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:58,180
(1st, Team Yeon Hee 300,
2nd, Team Yeon Seok minus 100)

2447
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,910
(3rd, Team Teo minus 200,
4th, Team Sooyoung minus 2,200)

2448
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,320
I think Jae Suk will do it.

2449
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,320
But this is...

2450
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,220
(Jae Suk aims for 1st place
while betting 1,000 points.)

2451
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,850
(Jae Suk has the highest record,
and it's his last try.)

2452
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:07,020
We will prepare a ceremony.

2453
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,080
Do your best.

2454
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:11,430
(Will Jae Suk be able to repeat
the miracle that happened earlier?)

2455
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:13,860
That's it.

2456
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:15,650
Trust your instincts.

2457
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,990
(He pushed the brake.)

2458
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,160
Trust your instincts.

2459
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,690
- It's a minus.
- It's a minus.

2460
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:23,970
It's a minus.

2461
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,730
("Multiply by minus 1" equals to
a 1,000-point deduction.)

2462
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:28,010
You're in last place then.

2463
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:29,200
- Earlier...
- You're in last place.

2464
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,570
- What happened?
- Since it's multiply by minus one.

2465
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:31,610
Jae Suk.

2466
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:32,650
(Now there's a possibility for them
to end up in last place.)

2467
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:33,720
Seriously...

2468
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,240
- Try pushing it in the beginning.
- Okay.

2469
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,890
- Will you bet 2,000 points?
- Yes.

2470
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:40,910
(She's in last place anyway.
She daringly bets 2,000 points.)

2471
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:42,480
(If she gets "multiply by 5",
her team will end up in 1st place.)

2472
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,650
(If she gets a minus,
her team will end up in last place.)

2473
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:47,230
Sooyoung, you can do it.

2474
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,260
Do your best, Sooyoung.

2475
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,730
Sooyoung, you can do it.

2476
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:52,020
You can do it.

2477
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,360
I think you should push the brake.
Push it.

2478
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,610
(Sooyoung pushes the brake after
safely passing the minus zone.)

2479
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:58,640
- Push it.
- Push it.

2480
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,870
- Gosh.
- That's it.

2481
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:02,140
Sooyoung, good job.

2482
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,240
I pushed it.

2483
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,550
- Good job.
- It was too late.

2484
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:05,810
Why do I keep going backward?

2485
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:07,050
- That's not how you do it.
- Push with one foot.

2486
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:08,650
- We will push it for you.
- Hey.

2487
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,050
No, you can't do that.

2488
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,390
- Stop.
- What happened?

2489
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:13,610
(But...)

2490
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:14,890
- It's "multiply by one"!
- What?

2491
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:15,950
Stop.

2492
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:17,230
- What happened?
- Yes!

2493
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:19,120
(She stopped for now.)

2494
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,490
It's "multiply by zero".

2495
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:21,760
(She stopped exactly in between...)

2496
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,020
("multiply by one"
and "multiply by zero".)

2497
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,300
- It's "multiply by zero"!
- No, it's "multiply by zero".

2498
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,570
- Isn't it "multiply by one"?
- No, it's "multiply by zero".

2499
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:27,730
- It's "multiply by zero".
- It's "multiply by zero".

2500
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:28,990
The front wheel is
on "multiply by zero".

2501
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,230
- I'm certain.
- It is, judging from the sideline.

2502
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,440
- Right here.
- It's "multiply by zero".

2503
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,640
- It's "multiply by zero".
- It's "multiply by zero".

2504
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,700
- "Multiply by zero".
- How is this "multiply by zero"?

2505
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:35,770
- It is "multiply by zero".
- The wheels...

2506
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:36,870
It's based on the wheels.

2507
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:39,870
Yeon Seok, just land in the starch.

2508
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,410
Yeon Seok.

2509
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,940
- Yeon Seok.
- Push it when you're here.

2510
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,610
If you succeed here, you will win.

2511
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:45,850
- If he succeeds?
- Yes.

2512
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,650
(Team Yeon Hee is currently in
1st place with 300 points.)

2513
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:49,860
(Team Sooyoung is currently in
last place with minus 1,900 points.)

2514
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:52,780
(Team Yeon Seok can also be in
1st or last place.)

2515
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:53,930
You need to go a little fast.

2516
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,730
That's good. That look
in your eyes is good.

2517
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,800
Okay, let the best man win.

2518
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:01,070
Let the best man win.

2519
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:02,270
(The last cart took off heroically.)

2520
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:03,310
- This is a match.
- He keeps asking that.

2521
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,230
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

2522
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,140
Why?

2523
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,440
- What are you doing?
- What is wrong with you?

2524
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,050
(He set off fully determined, but he
cowardly stopped after 1m.)

2525
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:15,070
- What are you doing?
- What is wrong with you?

2526
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:16,220
Hey, you...

2527
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:18,520
(His teammates
have finally exploded.)

2528
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,390
- The slope isn't even that steep.
- You should've at least come here.

2529
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,020
Hey.

2530
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:24,730
- You're in last place.
- He was so serious though.

2531
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:25,730
Gosh.

2532
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:27,800
That's what happens
when he does it seriously.

2533
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,400
You're showing a lot of
different sides of you today.

2534
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:32,800
- This stops too easily.
- Yeon Seok.

2535
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:35,190
- What is wrong with you?
- You've been doing this all day.

2536
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:36,530
I told you to push it here.

2537
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:38,860
- Everyone, we have the result.
- Yes.

2538
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,640
The team in first place is...

2539
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,480
Team Yeon Hee.

2540
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:44,110
- Yes.
- Did we win?

2541
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,680
The team in second place is
Team Teo.

2542
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,720
(Team Teo ended up in 2nd place
by luck with minus 1,200 points.)

2543
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,720
- This is unbelievable.
- Gosh.

2544
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,890
3rd place and 4th place have
a 200-point difference.

2545
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,560
200 points?
Then we still have a chance.

2546
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,320
- I think we're in last place.
- That was so close though.

2547
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,430
(With a 200-point difference,
4th place will receive the penalty.)

2548
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:01,230
Okay, third place is...

2549
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,820
Third place...

2550
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:05,860
(3rd place will avoid the penalty
with a 200-point difference.)

2551
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,990
It can't be...

2552
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:08,900
It can't be...

2553
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:09,970
Third place...

2554
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,230
- Team Sooyoung.
- Wow!

2555
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:12,660
Fourth place is Team Yeon Seok.

2556
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,230
(3rd place Team Sooyoung,
Last place Team Yeon Seok)

2557
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:16,870
(These three men will receive
the penalty.)

2558
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:18,240
Why would you make us expectant?

2559
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,020
Yoo Yeon Seok...

2560
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,480
- He made them lose at one go.
- Hey.

2561
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,580
Yeon Seok did everything today.

2562
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:26,110
Was the game turned around
because of Yeon Seok?

2563
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:28,080
- Really?
- Yes, with "multiply by minus two".

2564
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,190
That's incredible.

2565
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:31,730
It's our first time having a guest
ruin their team like this.

2566
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,800
- I'm serious.
- He's terrible at games.

2567
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,100
I've never seen anyone
this terrible at games.

2568
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,120
He's really...

2569
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,900
He even beat
Kwang Soo and Se Chan.

2570
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,660
- This is driving me crazy.
- He really...

2571
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,490
For the teams
in 1st place and 2nd place,

2572
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:42,940
we will give you gift certificates
to use at traditional markets...

2573
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,400
worth 1,000 dollars
as a new year's gift.

2574
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,510
- I can't believe it.
- You can share them now.

2575
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,770
- Take these.
- 1,000 dollars?

2576
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:51,440
- Yes.
- That's nice.

2577
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,480
They're traditional market
gift certificates.

2578
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,520
It's my 1st time being in 1st place.

2579
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,550
You can use this like cash.

2580
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:55,570
- This is like cash.
- Okay.

2581
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:57,910
Divide them among yourselves.

2582
01:19:58,410 --> 01:19:59,780
What is the penalty for today
and who is in the last place?

2583
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,080
The penalty is...

2584
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:03,480
for you to get rid of the old grime
of 2020...

2585
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,780
and have a fresh start in 2021.

2586
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:08,560
You will make a copy of your face
by applying ink on your face.

2587
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,430
- Yes, that's good.
- What are you talking about?

2588
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:12,430
- Bring in the materials.
- This is the worst.

2589
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:13,800
You must apply it completely.

2590
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,770
You forgot his nose.
Apply more on the lips.

2591
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,200
- Gosh.
- It's really...

2592
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,030
You really look like a fish.

2593
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:21,980
- It turned out well.
- What is that?

2594
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,810
- Do it for Kwang Soo too.
- It turned out well.

2595
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,370
- Right now...
- Do it now.

2596
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:26,940
- Should I press it?
- It really looks...

2597
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:29,240
(They even completed Yeon Seok's
copy that's unique for some reason.)

2598
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:32,980
2021 is the Year of the Ox.
We will see you then.

2599
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,580
- It's the Year of the Ox.
- Yes, it is.

2600
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,610
