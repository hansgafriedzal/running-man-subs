1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,900
Previously with
the Card Shark Association.

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,570
Eight card sharks
from across the country gathered...

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,780
at the first
Card Shark Association Meeting.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,010
Ji Suk Jin was elected as
the first chairperson,

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,020
and Yoo Jae Suk ousted him
and became the second chairperson.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,220
(Yoo Jae Suk ousted Big Nose
and became the 2nd chairperson.)

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,860
A few months later,

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,090
the 2021 Card Shark Association
New Year's Party was held.

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,630
(The New Year's party was held
under Chairman Yu's leadership.)

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,820
As soon as the party began,

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,660
a wind of change in leadership
began to blow among the members.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,840
(The wind of change of leadership
began to blow among the members.)

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,760
If there were more than 20 caramels
in the proposal box,

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,000
they could elect a new chairperson.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,570
(The reckless Sally threw her hat
into the ring.)

16
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,610
- Sally threw her hat into the ring.
- 19 caramels in total.

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,610
(Chairman Yoo made a plan
to prevent it.)

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,820
But she lost by one vote.
They failed to replace the chairman.

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,010
Chairman Yoo got to serve
another term as the chairman.

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,220
(Chairperson)

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,290
And then, the card sharks heard
that their rankings...

22
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,820
would determine
who gets to go home first.

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,930
Can you all step back a little?

24
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,000
The chairman was so eager
to go home early...

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,630
that he became even more underhanded
and extorted money from the members.

26
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,630
(Chairman Yoo faced a backlash
from the members in the end.)

27
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,410
As the card sharks' backlash
grew more intense,

28
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,270
he finally gets impeached...

29
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,440
and ends up
getting rolled in the snow.

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,050
The draw for the third
Card Shark Chairperson.

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,430
Kim Jong Kook becomes
the third Card Shark Chairman.

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,660
(Members on the verge of bankruptcy
get another chance.)

33
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,300
(The member who chose the room
with the least number of members...)

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,770
(will get three times
the amount of caramels they betted.)

35
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,160
(Jae Suk is granted the privilege
of his former post and goes first.)

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,970
(He thinks it over
and chooses room number 1.)

37
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,210
(Senior Card Shark Suk Jin
chooses room number 1 too.)

38
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,820
(The third member Kwang Soo...)

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,210
(chooses room number 1 as well.)

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,750
(My goodness, not you!)

41
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,020
(They feel awful
their telepathy connected.)

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,360
(They were drawn to each other.
What happened to the other members?)

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,560
How many did you bet?

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,530
- Se Chan?
- They're loaning me 20.

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,640
And I have 17 caramels
left right now.

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
- You're putting all of them in?
- All of them?

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,670
Of course, I'm going all-in.

48
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,030
All-in?

49
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,370
Yes, we should make 20.

50
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,580
- 20 caramels...
- There's no need to keep caramels.

51
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,450
- But there are three rooms.
- Are you keeping caramels?

52
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,650
- That's not it.
- That means...

53
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,210
you're planning something.

54
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,390
- That's not it.
- Maybe she's...

55
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,950
trying to overturn the election.

56
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,920
- She wants to be the chairwoman.
- Sir.

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,430
- You're the chairman, sir.
- All right.

58
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,330
- I have 50 caramels in debt, sir.
- Okay.

59
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,360
It's a slim chance
because there are three rooms.

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,620
There are so many members.

61
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,200
If you can just take 10 caramels
away from my debt...

62
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,300
So Min kept saying
she wanted to be a chairwoman.

63
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,530
I promise you that
I will choose room number three.

64
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,610
Well, I personally want to...

65
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,240
stand behind you...

66
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,680
and follow you
into the room you choose.

67
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,020
I can do that, right?

68
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,180
But then anyone could
betray me after I get in.

69
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,390
Gosh, he's so sly.

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,610
He's so sly.

71
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,460
- You're spiteful.
- Come on, it's me!

72
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,020
(Come on, it's me!)

73
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,860
(Proving how close they are
with his short and quick steps.)

74
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,050
- Are you partners?
- Jong Kook.

75
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,550
Jong Kook.

76
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,730
(Jong Kook.)

77
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,330
I wish to be in the same
room as you, Jong Kook.

78
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,400
Hey, Jong Kook doesn't like it
when people act cute.

79
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,140
Just grab her hand and twist.

80
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,740
Jong Kook,
let's have a meal together.

81
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,900
Just talk to each other...

82
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,080
and decide which room you'll choose.

83
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,680
- You may go now.
- If you just...

84
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,310
come to an agreement...

85
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,020
I went all-in.

86
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,550
Here's the proposal box.

87
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,890
I'm completely broke.

88
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,260
(There are 12 caramels in the box
thanks to Suk Jin.)

89
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,280
Thank you.

90
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
- There are three rooms upstairs.
- All right.

91
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,860
- You may choose one room.
- Okay.

92
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,830
(Se Chan doesn't put any caramels
in the box and goes upstairs.)

93
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,830
I'm totally broke now.

94
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,300
I'm coming in.

95
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,710
(The telepathic 3 are
nervous about the 4th member.)

96
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,330
I'm coming in now.

97
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,370
This is psychology.

98
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,010
Shall I go into the 1st room I see?
Room number 1.

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,650
(Will Se Chan choose
room number 1 too?)

100
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,680
No.

101
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,950
Shall I turn right and choose
room number two?

102
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,210
Gosh, room number three
is too far away.

103
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,460
(Yang Kka Chi talks to himself
while he makes a deduction.)

104
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,490
(But then he looks at
room number 1.)

105
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,550
Okay.

106
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
I made up my mind.

107
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,720
I should...

108
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,830
choose the farthest room
that no one else will choose.

109
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,070
(He's in front of room number 3 but
which room will he really go into?)

110
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,090
Here I go.

111
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,810
(He chose room number 3
with no one inside.)

112
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,210
This is it.

113
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,310
I think members
will be packed in one room.

114
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,950
I just want to hear
which room you'll choose.

115
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,580
(Haha acts cute so he can
use the chairman's authority.)

116
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,690
Gosh, this really has to work...

117
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,390
so I can pay back my debt.

118
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,460
Gosh, can't I get some information?

119
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,760
(Gosh, can't I get
some information?)

120
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,980
(He's blatantly brown-nosing
to the chairman.)

121
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,060
I have a lot of debt.

122
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,920
- The partner is sad.
- It won't be that easy.

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,130
Your partner is sad.

124
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,220
Why does this sound real to me?

125
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,330
This feels real.

126
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,310
- Like, it's not a game but reality.
- Your partner is sad.

127
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,810
It feels bad when someone
close to you is in trouble.

128
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,470
So Min, how many will you put in?

129
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,270
Well, I will...

130
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,380
put 25 caramels in.

131
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,840
- Me too.
- Jong Kook, which room?

132
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,910
(Jong Kook doesn't answer.)

133
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,080
I'm off.

134
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,750
(She gets nothing from him
and leaves.)

135
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,460
Come on. I was acting cute...

136
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,890
but Jong Kook didn't respond to it.

137
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,020
I acted cute.

138
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,890
It's so upsetting.

139
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,520
He didn't give me
any information either.

140
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,920
(There are 12 caramels
in the proposal box.)

141
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,090
(And So Min
adds another nine caramels.)

142
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5... There.

143
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,440
I have 50 caramels in debt.

144
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,510
(A total of 21 caramels means
Jong Kook will be replaced.)

145
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,440
(The room Sally chose is...)

146
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,510
This is awesome.

147
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,730
(room number 2 with no one inside!)

148
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,750
Yes!

149
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,450
Nice.

150
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,750
Let's see
how many caramels are inside.

151
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,580
There's a lot.

152
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,040
(The box is full.)

153
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,390
(Laughing)

154
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,150
(Interested in room number 2)

155
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,920
(Please don't come in here.)

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,700
(Haha chooses room number 2
and ends up with So Min.)

157
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,140
- Why did you choose this room?
- Hey, this is a good thing.

158
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,900
(Zoned-out Jeoktoma is next.)

159
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,510
(Zoned-out Jeoktoma
goes into room number 3.)

160
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,400
(2 members in room number 2,
2 members in room number 3)

161
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,750
(Only one room will be chosen.)

162
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,520
(3 in room 1, 2 in room 2,
and 2 in room 3.)

163
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,280
(Now it depends on
Jong Kook's choice.)

164
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,520
- Everyone's done. It's your turn.
- Okay.

165
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,020
You can use your chairman's chance.

166
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,150
I'll use the chance...

167
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,630
Also, for each mission,

168
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,150
(The chairperson gets one chance
for every mission.)

169
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,020
(The chance is to make a rule
and carry it out right away.)

170
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,370
(One time only chance
only the chairperson can use.)

171
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,070
You can use your chairman's chance.

172
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,160
I'll use the chance...

173
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,900
(How will he use his chance?)

174
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,080
to know which room
each member chose.

175
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,170
- Right now...
- Yes.

176
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,400
(He's planning to choose the room
with the fewest members.)

177
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,750
- In room number one, there are...
- All right.

178
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,040
- Jae Suk, Suk Jin, and Kwang Soo.
- All right.

179
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,390
So Min and Haha
are in room number two.

180
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,960
Se Chan and Ji Hyo
are in room number three.

181
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,320
- There are 3, 2, and 2 members.
- Okay, I got it.

182
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,960
So what will happen...

183
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,760
if I make it 3, 3, and 2?

184
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,920
- 3, 3, and 2?
- Two rooms fail?

185
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes, two rooms will fail.

186
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,900
- Then members in those rooms fail.
- You're right.

187
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,020
- And they get...
- Nothing.

188
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,230
- And members in the other room?
- They will be rewarded.

189
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,730
The members in the room
you didn't choose.

190
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,710
Well, then I should...
I won't make a lot of caramels.

191
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,310
Then I should
take some caramels first.

192
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,950
You may go now.

193
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,120
I only need to leave 15 caramels.

194
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,020
Give me a minute. My goodness.

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,950
(Getting ready to step down
while taking what he wants)

196
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,980
I should take some of this at least.

197
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,620
My goodness.

198
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,780
It's the worst scenario.

199
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,150
(The victory depends on his choice.
So which room will he choose?)

200
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,160
How did it go? Is it 2, 2, and 3?

201
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,570
- Is it 2, 2, and 3?
- I'm sorry.

202
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,830
(Members in room number 2 fail.)

203
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,030
I had no choice.

204
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,070
- See? I said this would happen.
- Because...

205
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,580
I could see that So Min
was waiting for revenge.

206
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,250
Gosh, how could you do this to me?

207
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,600
The game is over!

208
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,450
3 members in room number 1,
3 members in room number 2,

209
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,190
and 2 members in room number 3.

210
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,980
- Yes!
- Room number 3 wins.

211
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,390
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan
in room number 3 win!)

212
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,260
- Jong Kook saved us.
- Jong Kook!

213
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,460
- Jong Kook, thank you!
- Thank you!

214
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,650
- I'll pay you back.
- You don't have to.

215
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,020
- You're the best.
- Thank you so much.

216
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,330
- I'll repay your kindness.
- Yes, we will.

217
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,130
- We'll pay you back.
- Good luck.

218
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,330
- Okay.
- Thank you, Jong Kook.

219
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,440
Thank you!

220
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,140
Okay, let's go. It's the last round.

221
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,370
Let's play it fair and square.

222
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,970
(This game is a must
at a card sharks' gathering.)

223
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,650
(The Card Shark Association members'
favorite mission, Card Game of Wits)

224
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,380
- Won't it come off?
- Gosh, it hurts.

225
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,120
My goodness. It really hurts.

226
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,620
- Jae Suk.
- It hurts.

227
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,780
- I should pick them up.
- Jae Suk.

228
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,350
Don't.

229
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,810
- That's cheating.
- You can't do this.

230
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,050
That's cheating.

231
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,860
- Just pick them up.
- Don't.

232
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,590
- Tell them they can't do this.
- Call the police.

233
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,860
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

234
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,760
- He's crazy.
- Don't do this.

235
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,470
- Don't.
- You can't do that.

236
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,730
He goes crazy
when someone drops caramels.

237
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,030
(As he drops caramels,
beggars gather to pick them up.)

238
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,790
I can do whatever I want.

239
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,060
You should take those away.

240
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,400
- This isn't right.
- I just got one.

241
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,880
Take away one more caramel
from the ones who were greedy.

242
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,540
- That's a warning.
- Seriously.

243
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,880
Okay, let's do this.
It's the last round!

244
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,480
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

245
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,410
It's time for me
to play a remarkable part, right?

246
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,350
I'm sorry, but please
take your hand out of the pocket.

247
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,120
Just take your hand
out of the pocket.

248
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,650
How dare you tell me what to do?

249
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,890
(Punishing him right away)

250
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,150
(How dare you talk back
to the chairman?)

251
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,130
- Are you all right, sir?
- You did a good job.

252
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,870
Hey, what are you doing?

253
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,000
- What?
- Now you're...

254
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,190
- sticking to him?
- You're getting more and more...

255
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,840
(The person next to him talks
and he hits him too.)

256
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,030
- Good job.
- Are you okay, sir?

257
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,840
- I'm good. Good.
- What on earth is he doing?

258
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,480
- What's wrong with him?
- Just calm down.

259
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,030
- What's with this beggar?
- Calm down.

260
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,250
- Hey.
- Kwang Soo.

261
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,270
- What's wrong with you?
- He's gone crazy, right?

262
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,220
- Just calm down.
- He's crazy.

263
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,310
- Calm down.
- We'll see when I become the boss.

264
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,250
- Okay.
- Elect another chairperson.

265
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,910
After the meal,

266
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,720
these are the caramels
Se Chan and Ji Hyo get.

267
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,890
- Gosh.
- It was so close.

268
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,550
Se Chan gets this much.

269
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,690
- That much?
- Wait.

270
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,870
My debts are settled, right?

271
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,560
- And you still got that many?
- I get 57, right?

272
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,970
Se Chan.

273
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,430
Just give me a second.

274
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,870
- Come on.
- Se Chan?

275
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,300
Yes.

276
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,640
- Se Chan?
- Yes.

277
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,660
Jong Kook.

278
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,930
- It's a formal membership fee.
- All right.

279
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,250
It's okay to pay the fee, right?

280
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,900
- Should I...
- Yes, if you want to.

281
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,170
Well, I want to...

282
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,540
- It's not mandatory.
- But I want to...

283
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,280
- Just pay the fee.
- Yes, I want to...

284
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,390
pay the fee voluntarily.

285
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,120
I won't even count it.

286
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,620
I'll just pay without counting.

287
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,150
- But we'll change the chairperson.
- Yes, we're going to.

288
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,550
- Oh, right.
- He's not the chairman anymore.

289
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,150
- Give me five.
- Then why are you acting bossy?

290
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,230
Why did you tell him that already?

291
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,520
Wait a minute.

292
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,650
You didn't have to tell him that.

293
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,690
(Kicking)

294
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,060
(He's not the chairman anymore?)

295
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,060
(If he's not the chairman,
Kka Chi becomes merciless.)

296
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,800
(The chairman gets really mad.)

297
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,160
(He comes to being Jong Kook
and punishes Violent Kka Chi.)

298
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,340
Hey, calm down.

299
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,880
(He comes to being Jong Kook
and punishes Violent Kka Chi.)

300
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,380
Pull yourself together.

301
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,610
It doesn't matter
if I'm the chairman or not!

302
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,250
- It's me!
- I know.

303
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,070
I would've lost caramels
if I didn't know.

304
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,850
- My goodness.
- So the chairperson...

305
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,220
- has been replaced.
- All right.

306
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,360
- 21 caramels were gathered.
- Okay!

307
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,780
- There were 21 caramels?
- Yes.

308
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,890
- I understand.
- So...

309
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,260
the former chairman...

310
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,950
- will fill in the roulette.
- All right.

311
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,600
- I'll do my best if you pick me.
- Sure.

312
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,630
If you support me,

313
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,000
I won't let these beggars
bother you anymore.

314
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,430
Please write my name down.

315
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,100
(Suddenly changes
his attitude and grovels)

316
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,370
Please write my name down, sir.

317
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,870
(My back hurts
because I got hit before.)

318
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,610
(As he turns away from Kwang Soo,
Jae Suk offers him 2 caramels.)

319
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,900
- I can't believe him.
- Help me out.

320
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,980
I understand.

321
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,270
I've been holding this for you.

322
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,540
First, there are people
I made promises to.

323
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,070
Jong Kook, please write
my name on it.

324
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,620
- First, Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

325
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,490
- Song...
- Song Jeoktoma.

326
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,990
Song Jeoktoma.

327
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,450
- She accepted that nickname.
- She calls herself that now.

328
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,650
She calls herself Song Jeoktoma.

329
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,680
- "I am Song Jeoktoma."
- Write Sanchez too, please.

330
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,520
(Write Sanchez too, please.)

331
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,130
- Your name is Sanchez?
- Yes, that's my name.

332
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,320
- I didn't know your name until now.
- My name is Sanchez.

333
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,230
- Please write Jong Kook Wannabe.
- Sally too.

334
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,240
- Then I will...
- He called himself JW.

335
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,270
Jong Kook Wannabe.

336
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,870
- Call me JW.
- JW.

337
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,370
- JW.
- Can I write five names?

338
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,200
- Two spots for Yang Kka Chi.
- All right!

339
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,880
- One for Sanchez and Ji Ha Ryong.
- Sanchez.

340
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,980
- Let's go!
- All right.

341
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,980
- I'm cheering for you.
- I hope it'll be me.

342
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,310
- Let's go.
- Yang Kka Chi! Please.

343
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,350
- Let's go.
- This is our last chance.

344
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,910
- Two spots for Yang Kka Chi.
- Go, Haha!

345
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,490
- Sanchez and Ji Ha Ryong.
- Let's go!

346
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,310
- Let's go!
- I'm cheering for you.

347
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,890
I hope I'll be chosen.

348
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,990
Here we go.

349
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,180
Let's go, Mullet Gang!

350
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,760
- Are you ready?
- Yes, let's go.

351
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,290
I have no idea who will be
the chairperson.

352
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,190
- Please let it be me.
- What a shame.

353
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,270
- Yang Kka Chi. Please.
- Here we go.

354
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,060
- Sanchez.
- Go!

355
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,470
Please, please. Sanchez.

356
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,530
Haha.

357
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,970
- Yang Kka Chi.
- Haha.

358
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,140
- Ji Ha Ryong.
- I hope it won't be Se Chan.

359
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,140
- Ji Ha Ryong.
- You hope I won't be elected?

360
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,070
- Of course.
- Ji Ha Ryong.

361
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,610
One spot is enough.

362
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,610
- Is it me?
- Haha!

363
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,410
- Haha!
- Ha Dong Hoon!

364
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,910
(The new chairman is Haha!)

365
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,940
- Okay.
- Ha Dong Hoon!

366
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,720
Ha Dong Hoon!

367
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,680
(Haha became the chairman
before the final match!)

368
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,280
- Ha Dong Hoon!
- This is driving me nuts.

369
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,090
Oh, my. Haha, congratulations.

370
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,950
- Congratulations, Haha.
- Congratulations.

371
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,000
Why, at this important juncture?

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,970
- For now...
- I'm so upset.

373
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,560
- You see...
- I'm completely upset.

374
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,740
Who earned caramels
in the last game?

375
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,110
(Now that I'm wearing
the armband...)

376
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,010
- Who earned caramels?
- Ji Hyo and Se Chan.

377
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,930
But didn't I give you
five caramels earlier?

378
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,650
I know. Give me just three then.

379
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,480
- Give me just three caramels.
- Is this what this position is for?

380
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,570
- Gosh. He's practically a gangster.
- Give me now.

381
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,040
Don't call me a gangster.

382
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,280
- I mean...
- Give me three caramels now.

383
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,990
I'll give you five caramels
of my own accord.

384
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,780
- Oh, my. Jong Kook.
- Here you go.

385
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,890
I'm willing to give you this.

386
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,150
- Gosh. Those punks.
- Exactly. This is driving me crazy.

387
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,150
Spend it for your own personal use.

388
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,160
Okay. Thank you.

389
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,290
He's so annoying.

390
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,370
- Hey, that's enough.
- Gosh, he's so annoying.

391
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,600
- I think you'll go home early.
- Come on.

392
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,660
So the third chairman
has been elected.

393
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,030
Is he the last chairman
by any chance?

394
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,030
Correct.

395
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,340
- Now...
- What a shame.

396
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,340
- This is the most important time.
- I wish I was the last chairman.

397
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,440
- This is the most important time.
- I couldn't even run for chairman.

398
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,410
We'll give you additional
20 caramels for the final game.

399
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,980
- Okay.
- I'll go all-in.

400
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,090
I'll explain the final mission
to you now.

401
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,910
Only five of you can play the game,

402
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,410
and the other three
will take a number and wait.

403
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,820
- The chairman will decide it too.
- Okay.

404
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,100
When someone goes bankrupt,
that person will be replaced.

405
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,190
(When you go bankrupt,
you'll be disqualified.)

406
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,470
However,

407
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,770
after two rounds, the person with
the most caramels...

408
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,870
will receive the prize
and go home right away.

409
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,470
- Right away?
- Yes.

410
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,740
You can just pick up the envelope
and leave.

411
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
That sounds awesome.

412
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,770
(After 2 rounds, the person with
the most caramels gets to leave!)

413
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,610
(The 1st person to leave can
go home 2 hours earlier than usual!)

414
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,040
- Can that person just leave?
- Yes.

415
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,110
(The 1st person to leave can
go home 2 hours earlier than usual!)

416
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,980
After the person
in first place leaves,

417
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,520
- a new player will join the table.
- Yes.

418
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,440
Another person will leave
after two rounds.

419
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,450
Likewise, the person in first place
will leave each time.

420
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,620
It's better to play the game
from the start.

421
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,020
(The 1st place in each game will
leave and be replaced.)

422
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,520
- Can that person just leave?
- Yes.

423
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,390
Only five of you
will receive a prize.

424
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,190
- The rest three will get a penalty.
- I see.

425
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,060
When you go bankrupt...
Do you see the pawnshop over there?

426
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,660
- Yes.
- At the pawnshop,

427
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,060
you can pawn any of your belongings
including your clothes,

428
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,740
- and borrow 20 for each item.
- Got it.

429
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,930
- 20 caramels for each item.
- Okay. I think...

430
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,200
Are you saying we'll end up
wearing nothing but our underwear?

431
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,150
- Wearing nothing but underwear,
- If I take off my jacket...

432
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,650
we should continue to play the game?

433
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,910
- That's fine by me.
- It'll be inappropriate.

434
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,040
I can do it while wearing
nothing but my underwear.

435
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,910
- Nothing but underwear.
- Are you sure about this?

436
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,280
You should accept my wig, okay?

437
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,090
- I'll pawn my wig.
- No.

438
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,180
I'm wearing boxer briefs,
so it'll look like shorts.

439
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,230
- Me too.
- Okay. Let's do this.

440
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,680
- I'm wearing boxer briefs.
- Me too.

441
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,260
The chairman should choose
the 1st 5 people to play the game,

442
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,870
and the 6th, 7th, and 8th players
to join the table later.

443
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,660
The people who start the game first
will be at an advantage...

444
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,740
as they have more chances.

445
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,870
How about rock-paper-scissors?
That'd be democratic.

446
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,660
- I'll let you decide.
- Me too.

447
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,700
Of course, it's up to him.
Why does it need to be democratic?

448
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,270
- You just shut your mouth.
- Pardon?

449
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,980
You're the former chairman.

450
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,510
- What?
- Gosh, seriously. Why?

451
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,910
Did you see him?
He was like this.

452
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,720
He was taken aback.
He was surprised.

453
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,490
Why? What are you going to do?

454
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,050
He pushed Jong Kook
even before he knew it.

455
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,150
- He was flustered.
- Why?

456
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,990
He must've been really scared.

457
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,550
(As the hand moved on its own,
the owner was flustered.)

458
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,050
- What was that?
- He was...

459
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,230
He was taken aback.

460
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,730
I apologize.

461
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,160
He was taken aback.

462
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,370
Don't do that again.

463
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,400
- You know...
- He was like...

464
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,270
how I lose control sometimes, right?

465
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,430
- I know.
- You know, right?

466
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,900
A moment of courage can...

467
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,670
- I don't usually...
- He was surprised when he...

468
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,070
heard this sound.

469
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,300
(His heart rate went up
when he heard the sound.)

470
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,810
- Let's have a match.
- All right.

471
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,980
Let's play the game together.

472
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,280
There should be an easy target too.

473
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,520
- True.
- Let's do this.

474
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,360
- I'll be playing the game.
- Okay.

475
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,910
- You know me, right?
- Please pick me.

476
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,320
So will Jong Kook.

477
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,760
Thank you.

478
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,990
I knew he would choose me.

479
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,050
Next...

480
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,400
- Haha, if you...
- Kka Chi, you're in.

481
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,420
- Okay.
- Gosh.

482
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,020
- Two seats are left.
- And Ji Hyo.

483
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,400
- Okay.
- That's great.

484
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,290
It's better for me
not to join them now.

485
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,270
- You should choose 1 more person.
- Oh, 1 more?

486
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,270
And you have to decide
the 6th, 7th, and 8th players.

487
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,880
(Only 1 seat is left.
The other 3 will be waiting!)

488
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,900
(Let me think.)

489
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,110
Please let me be the sixth player.

490
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,940
Since Sanchez is good at
raising the stakes...

491
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,040
- Let me just tell you this.
- He's good at it.

492
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,380
- But Sanchez is...
- Listen to me.

493
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,090
- It'll be helpful for me.
- Don't play with amateurs.

494
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,760
- Sanchez acts recklessly sometimes.
- He's bold.

495
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,860
Don't play with amateurs.

496
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,450
- Sanchez will join us.
- Okay.

497
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,630
- I'm in.
- Who's next?

498
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,130
- Pick the sixth player.
- Haha.

499
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,820
- Haha, please.
- Kwang Soo will be the sixth.

500
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,870
- What about me?
- And next...

501
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,400
- You're the sixth player.
- When can I play?

502
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,770
- You will join later.
- Am I the last one?

503
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,600
- Then...
- I gave you a caramel too.

504
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,770
I gave you one caramel.

505
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,840
- Is So Min the last one?
- Okay.

506
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,400
- Then...
- Let them play rock-paper-scissors.

507
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,110
What? Hey, So Min, calm down.

508
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,850
(She threw her bag on the floor
as she kept being pushed back.)

509
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,800
Hey, So Min, calm down.

510
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,650
Gosh. She's actually mad.

511
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,150
Okay, So Min. I pick you.

512
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,440
- Come on.
- She's actually upset.

513
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,590
I pick you, So Min.

514
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,650
- I pick you.
- She actually got upset.

515
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,780
- How many times did I tell you?
- I know.

516
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,550
- How could you do this to me?
- I'm sorry.

517
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,730
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, no. My caramels.

518
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,950
(Whenever caramels fall
on the floor,)

519
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,450
(a gang of caramel thieves
swarms around.)

520
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,690
(They probably like caramels most
out of all adults in the country.)

521
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,960
Give me that.

522
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,800
(They probably like caramels most
out of all adults in the country.)

523
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,610
(The adults who are serious
when it comes to caramels)

524
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,500
- Give me that. Come on.
- Gosh, seriously.

525
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,970
You mean punks.

526
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,580
- They're unbelievable.
- Exactly.

527
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,700
- My gosh.
- Gosh, seriously.

528
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,710
Decide where we should sit too.

529
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,280
- I'll sit here.
- I see.

530
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,050
- Why are you wearing the armband?
- So I'm the eighth, right?

531
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,980
- Please sit here.
- Am I the eighth?

532
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,060
If you're ready...

533
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,250
All right.

534
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,480
I'm so nervous.

535
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
- The final mission is...
- I hope one of us will go bankrupt.

536
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,600
the upgraded version
of the Card Game of Wits.

537
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,720
- It's been upgraded?
- I see.

538
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,630
In front of each of you, there's
a set of blue forehead cards...

539
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,400
- numbered from 1 to 10.
- From 1 to 10.

540
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,040
And below them,
there are two sets of red cards...

541
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,870
- numbered from 1 to 10.
- 2 sets of red cards.

542
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,780
This time, you put one blue card
on your forehead.

543
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,900
You can't see the card.

544
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,940
- And then you pick two red cards.
- Okay.

545
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,150
You should put 1 of those 2 cards
in front of you...

546
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,210
- after checking the numbers.
- I see.

547
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,740
Whether the number is higher
or lower than the other,

548
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,320
you should put 1 of the 2 red cards
in front of you...

549
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,150
so that the other players
can see it.

550
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,590
- After checking the numbers...
- So if you reveal...

551
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,330
The person with the highest total
of the three cards wins.

552
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,920
If there are two winners,
they divide the caramels.

553
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,220
(The person with the highest total
of the 3 cards wins!)

554
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,630
Revealing the card with the lower
number could be your strategy...

555
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,220
- or vice versa.
- RIght.

556
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,400
So there's one card
that only the player can see.

557
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,570
All right. Let's do this.

558
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,490
It's important to decide
which card you'll show the others.

559
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,070
Before we begin, please put
one forehead card on your forehead.

560
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,110
Let's go!

561
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,110
(The player can't see
the card on his or her forehead.)

562
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,580
- This is important.
- You should choose a good one.

563
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,470
I can see who will go bankrupt
very soon.

564
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
The one sitting next to Sanchez...

565
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,170
(The players don't know the numbers
on their foreheads.)

566
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,620
- I must not see the number, right?
- That's right.

567
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,510
The highest number is...
There's no zero, right?

568
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,910
That's right.
They're numbered from 1 to 10.

569
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,590
- That's good.
- Let me see.

570
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,250
Does he have a higher number?

571
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,720
We shouldn't tell you that.

572
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,460
(The chairman picked 10
from the start.)

573
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,630
Can't we see it?

574
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,400
- Oh, this is interesting.
- They picked those numbers.

575
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,430
Is that so?

576
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,340
- Now, pick two red cards.
- It's not bad.

577
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,500
Now, pick two red cards
and check the numbers.

578
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
(They'll choose 2 red cards.)

579
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,900
- I choose these two.
- Check the numbers.

580
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,050
And show only one of them
to the other players.

581
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,080
(They'll reveal only 1
of the 2 cards they picked!)

582
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,170
- After checking the numbers.
- Gosh.

583
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,010
(Careful)

584
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,090
Can you not look at your cards
like that?

585
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,250
Why?

586
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,390
- How else should we look at them?
- I mean...

587
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,560
- But how should we look at them?
- Tell us.

588
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,830
I'm sorry, but can you tell us
the appropriate position?

589
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,190
- Like this. Do it like me.
- Pardon?

590
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,260
That's the appropriate position?

591
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,730
- Look at Se Chan.
- Like this?

592
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,040
Like this?

593
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,260
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

594
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,400
I look nice, right?

595
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,730
Don't peek.

596
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,970
Aren't we allowed to do this?

597
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,280
- Oh, gosh.
- Of course, that's not allowed.

598
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,320
It's not allowed?

599
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,410
Now, please put 1 of the 2 cards
in front of you.

600
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,010
(It's time to reveal
1 of the 2 cards!)

601
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,290
They must've put down the one
with the lower number.

602
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,210
That might be their strategy.

603
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,330
They might have put down
the higher one.

604
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,250
Oh, my. He put down that card.

605
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,690
Hey, Jong Kook.

606
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,250
That might be the higher one.

607
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,460
He might've put down the higher one
to make the others give up.

608
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,870
(The person with
the highest total wins!)

609
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,960
(The current totals)

610
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,810
You may begin betting
starting with the chairman.

611
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,110
- Bet, please.
- Go ahead.

612
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,170
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

613
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,590
(He bet only 1!)

614
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,910
- Just 1 caramel?
- Just 1?

615
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,180
You should go big
if you have a good hand.

616
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,710
- You're betting just one too?
- Yes.

617
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,250
I'll see your one...

618
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,750
- It goes on quite long.
- How many betting rounds are there?

619
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,690
- I'll raise five more.
- Until the game ends?

620
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,960
- You raise five more.
- Yes.

621
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,260
- Are you done?
- Yes.

622
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,100
I'll fold.

623
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,070
She decided to fold already?

624
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,900
She decided to fold already?

625
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,580
I would call
if my hand is not too bad.

626
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,740
You'll fold too?

627
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,710
(Even the bold Sanchez gave up.)

628
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,940
I'll fold.

629
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,550
(Sanchez and Song Jeoktoma
are out.)

630
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,240
- You should never do that.
- But it wasn't so bad.

631
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,890
Se Chan, you checked
your cards, right?

632
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,210
- Yes, I did.
- Haha, it's your turn.

633
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,290
- I'll fold too.
- Really?

634
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,190
- What?
- Why?

635
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,900
Next up is Jong Kook.

636
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,230
(As Haha gave up, Jong Kook realized
that he has a big number.)

637
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,760
- If you need more time to think...
- I'll raise 15 more.

638
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,470
- 15 more caramels.
- Really?

639
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,500
Yes.

640
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,580
20 caramels.

641
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,150
(Kim Grand Award bets
a lot of caramels from the start.)

642
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,350
(Now, what's important is
Se Chan's choice.)

643
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,620
With 15 more caramels,
the number is 20.

644
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,180
- On top of five caramels...
- That's right.

645
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,820
I added the caramels on top of them.

646
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,790
Look at Se Chan. Se Chan.

647
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,790
(Look at Se Chan.)

648
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,300
Se Chan, will you go all-in?

649
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,760
- Jong Kook.
- No takebacks.

650
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,400
I calculated wrong.

651
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,400
(I calculated wrong.)

652
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,640
(Instead of using the poker face,)

653
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,930
I calculated his numbers wrong.

654
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,930
(he calculated
the one-digit numbers wrong.)

655
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,880
I thought I had a chance of winning,

656
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,740
but my calculation
was completely off.

657
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,940
- I wondered why you didn't fold.
- Seriously.

658
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,440
I will fold.

659
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,320
- Okay.
- Jong Kook is the winner.

660
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,950
- Check the cards.
- Look at that.

661
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,530
Jong Kook did a good job.

662
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,680
(Was my number 10?)

663
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,130
- My goodness.
- Look at that.

664
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,650
For the next round...

665
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,920
(Was the number on my head also 9?)

666
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,340
Was my number nine?

667
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,490
Didn't you know? My goodness.

668
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,540
I had the best numbers.

669
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,960
I should have bet more caramels.

670
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,140
- They will have an advantage later.
- That's right.

671
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,540
They had small numbers this time.

672
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,700
It will be hard for Jong Kook
to have big numbers now.

673
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,970
It will be hard.

674
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,210
For goodness' sake.

675
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,940
It's best to get
high numbers at once...

676
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,910
and win all the caramels.

677
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,590
The first round is over.

678
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,510
One member will leave
after the next round.

679
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,630
(The winner will be decided
after the next round!)

680
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,220
(Kwang Soo volunteers to clean up.)

681
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,650
All of them are mine.

682
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,720
All of them are mine. My goodness.

683
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,600
Give them to me.

684
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,190
Jong Kook, please give me one.

685
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,040
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Jong Kook.

686
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,660
Jong Kook, please give me one.

687
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,110
(The part-timer gets a tip.)

688
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,200
- Okay.
- Let me know if you need a drink.

689
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
No, thank you.

690
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,470
- There is an ashtray too.
- Jong Kook, I am ready.

691
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,470
Hold on.

692
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,740
- I will catch it like a seal.
- I am thirsty.

693
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,780
(I am thirsty.)

694
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,240
I am thirsty.

695
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,940
- Jong Kook.
- I am thirsty.

696
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,120
Are you thirsty?

697
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,410
- Yes.
- Here you go.

698
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,890
I will get you water.

699
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,250
Come back to the table.

700
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,130
I don't have any more caramels
to give out.

701
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,300
I want to receive a caramel.

702
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,870
- Do you want to receive a caramel?
- Yes.

703
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,370
Here comes the second round.

704
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,500
I need to win this time.

705
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,870
Please let it be a good number.

706
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,540
I haven't had my lucky break yet.

707
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,040
Let's see.

708
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,000
Let's see. Let's see.

709
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,850
Jae Suk. Gosh, Jae Suk.

710
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,850
See?

711
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,680
Those who got
small numbers earlier...

712
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,250
still have big numbers
in their decks.

713
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,420
This is... Never mind.

714
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Be quiet.

715
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,300
- Shall we go?
- This is fascinating.

716
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,490
- This is incredible.
- They picked strange numbers.

717
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,030
(He is acting cool with 2
on his forehead.)

718
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,130
Okay, okay.

719
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,430
This is...

720
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,310
(He is playing mind games
by himself.)

721
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,700
(Jong Kook stifles his laughter.)

722
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,810
This is interesting.

723
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,040
The cards are interesting.

724
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,050
All right. Open a card each.

725
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,310
- This is a matter...
- I picked one.

726
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,320
of showing the bigger number
or the smaller number.

727
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,680
(He is using his poker face.)

728
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,320
In the beginning...

729
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,290
- If he does that...
- Se Chan's number is one.

730
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,150
One card.

731
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,630
Don't save up on the caramels.

732
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,490
- All right.
- Bet them.

733
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,100
(The current total)

734
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,130
Haha goes first, right?

735
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,400
(The current total)

736
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,500
(Haha bets first.)

737
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,930
Here comes one caramel.

738
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,200
Okay. One caramel.

739
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,500
Five caramels.

740
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,970
Next.

741
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,940
Are you seriously betting 5 caramels
when your number is 1?

742
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,380
Yes.

743
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,440
You did add the numbers, right?

744
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,560
I didn't subtract them, okay?

745
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,750
I can fold, right?

746
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,060
- I will fold.
- Okay.

747
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,130
Ji Hyo.

748
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,490
Will you bet on your hands?

749
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,960
All right. It has begun.

750
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,190
(He bets with a small number
on his forehead.)

751
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,500
- All right.
- I will go all-in.

752
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,140
- Really?
- It went into Ji Hyo's box.

753
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,730
- Jae Suk!
- That's Ji Hyo's box.

754
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,340
- I will go all-in.
- How many caramels are there?

755
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,640
19 caramels.

756
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,740
I feel bad for him.

757
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,780
(Sanchez bet all 19 caramels.)

758
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,150
- I go big.
- All right.

759
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,440
I feel bad for him.

760
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Right now,

761
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,120
are you okay?

762
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,320
(Right now, are you okay?)

763
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,950
- Listen.
- He will regret it.

764
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,420
I don't think about the future.

765
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,530
It could go either way.

766
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,560
- I don't think about the future.
- That's right.

767
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,720
- I don't think about the future.
- His choice will ruin the present.

768
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,960
I don't think about the future.

769
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,760
- I calculated the maximum number.
- I don't think about the future.

770
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,310
All right.

771
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,230
- Let's go.
- Listen.

772
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,880
If the card he hasn't revealed
is 10,

773
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,230
his total is 18, right?

774
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,240
- You shouldn't say that.
- You shouldn't say that.

775
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,650
(You shouldn't say that.)

776
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,850
his total is 18, right?

777
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,710
(What?)

778
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,790
Hey.

779
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,350
- Is that it?
- Listen.

780
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,890
- Hey.
- Jae Suk is flustered.

781
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,060
He went all-in anyway.

782
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,090
(He unexpectedly found out about
the small number on his forehead.)

783
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,630
I mean... How could you do that?

784
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,750
Hold on.

785
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,100
I mean... How could you do that?

786
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,630
Why did you say that?

787
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,960
What do you think you are doing?

788
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,190
- Listen.
- No, no.

789
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,840
No, no. Hold on.

790
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
Jae Suk is the most surprised.

791
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,580
He keeps tapping on the table.

792
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,700
Look at his hand.
He keeps tapping on the table.

793
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,400
- Guys.
- You saw how he was, right?

794
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,150
He was acting all haughty.

795
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,850
- He suddenly became small.
- How could you reveal the number?

796
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,510
- Seriously.
- His jaw almost hit the floor.

797
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,950
How could you reveal
that my total is 18?

798
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,590
Do I need to go into this
knowing that two is on my forehead?

799
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,330
Later...

800
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,560
Seriously.

801
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,830
Do I need to go into this
knowing that two is on my forehead?

802
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,330
Take off your clothes
and go to the pawnshop later.

803
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,570
This is ridiculous.

804
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,870
Two is on his forehead.

805
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,370
Please decide.

806
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,570
(Sanchez bet caramels
with 2 on his forehead,)

807
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,960
(so Haha raises.)

808
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,700
- I mean...
- Put them in your box.

809
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,780
- If you lose...
- I have to win no matter what.

810
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,970
Excuse me.

811
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,510
His numbers make me want to raise,

812
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,940
but I will fold
because of Haha's numbers.

813
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,240
- This is bad.
- You should have kept going.

814
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,850
Se Chan needs to win.

815
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,860
I will fold.

816
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
(Se Chan folds as well.)

817
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,950
So it's a match
between Haha and Jae Suk.

818
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,860
- Open.
- The last card must be 10.

819
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,720
- Jae Suk lost.
- He lost.

820
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,750
Four.

821
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,420
(The current total)

822
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,920
- 4 and 8.
- I saw those numbers.

823
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,960
I don't know this number.

824
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,140
- It's 8.
- 8.

825
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,190
Eight.

826
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,040
(Haha's 2 cards make 12.)

827
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,310
(What's the number
on his hidden card?)

828
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,340
- He won.
- He will get the caramels.

829
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,780
- 6?
- 18.

830
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,550
(The hidden card is 6.)

831
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,740
(Haha's total is 18!)

832
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,940
(Hidden card, opened card,
and forehead card)

833
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,890
(Jae Suk's hidden card must be 10
for it to be a tie.)

834
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,950
- 10?
- It's 8.

835
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,680
(It's 8.)

836
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,950
(With the final score of 18 to 16,
Haha wins!)

837
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,300
Bye!

838
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,460
He is broke!

839
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,430
I was so close.

840
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,040
- Jae Suk, you are out.
- He is broke.

841
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,200
That was great.

842
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,340
- I go next, right?
- Kwang Soo, go on in.

843
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,850
- I think it's my turn.
- No, it's Kwang Soo's turn.

844
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,710
Please count the caramels.

845
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,710
(The winner is the member
with the most number of caramels!)

846
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,390
The winner is the member
with the most number of caramels.

847
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,710
This is fun.
I don't want to go home.

848
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,250
I have 32 caramels.

849
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,450
63 caramels.

850
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,830
- What?
- 65 caramels.

851
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,920
65 caramels?

852
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,220
70 caramels.

853
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,830
- Jong Kook is the winner.
- Jong Kook, you won.

854
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,830
- Okay!
- 70 caramels?

855
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,830
- My goodness.
- Does he get to go home?

856
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,100
I get to go home.

857
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,760
- Do you get to go home?
- I am so annoyed.

858
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,230
I wanted to see this game through.

859
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,340
It was cool.

860
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,610
- I am so annoyed.
- You are cool.

861
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,110
Please take the envelope
for the first place.

862
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,550
Okay. Guys, use the caramels well.

863
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,350
- I am so annoyed.
- Gift certificate.

864
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,740
- Do I take it?
- It's really thick.

865
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,940
My goodness.

866
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,740
- Does he really get to go home?
- Really?

867
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,590
I will get going now.

868
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,790
Does he really get to go home?

869
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,920
- Bye, Jong Kook.
- All right.

870
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,560
Do I really get to go home?

871
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,650
(Do I really get to go home?)

872
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,400
Gosh, thank you.

873
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Can I really leave?

874
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,730
I am going.

875
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,730
So Min, sit down.
For goodness' sake.

876
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,310
- I want to leave work early.
- What time is it now?

877
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,150
I feel so antsy
now that one person has left.

878
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,150
I want to leave work.

879
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,740
- I am ready to go home!
- Seriously.

880
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,210
You know that losers will get
a penalty, right?

881
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,240
What's the penalty?

882
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,590
- But the losers leave the last.
- There is an additional penalty.

883
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,450
Then Jae Suk will get the penalty.

884
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,860
That's not true.

885
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,150
I don't have any debts.

886
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,720
He might pawn his belongings.

887
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
What will he pawn?

888
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,600
I should have worn more items.

889
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,960
Four each, right?

890
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,130
(At that moment)

891
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,660
(Rummaging)

892
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,640
(He puts a caramel in his mouth.)

893
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,730
(Humming in approval)

894
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,230
(Startled)

895
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,670
(Is it mine?)

896
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,240
Where did you get it?

897
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,440
You... You are in no position
to eat a caramel.

898
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,880
- Why not?
- You are broke.

899
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,910
It's not like
I will take these caramels home.

900
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,240
But they are cash here.

901
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,360
(He is in 1st place when it comes
to getting absorbed.)

902
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
- That's the way it is here.
- Will you use them...

903
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,480
to buy something at a mart?

904
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,720
I can't do that.

905
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,130
I can't bet...

906
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,950
If either of the cards I see
has a low number.

907
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,220
- Right?
- Me neither.

908
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,420
Do you know why that's the case?
You are cowardly.

909
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,760
- Really?
- You are weak.

910
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,640
You are small-minded.

911
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,040
Seriously.

912
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,140
- You sit there with high hopes.
- Let's see how you do later.

913
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,040
- Seriously.
- I want to see them compete.

914
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,230
I know. I want them to have
a 1-on-1 match.

915
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,470
Aren't you the one who went all-in
with two on your forehead?

916
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,350
That's me. That's me.

917
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,120
You did that with two
on your forehead.

918
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,740
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

919
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,050
You have to go strong.

920
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,590
- Let's go.
- Hurry up.

921
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,150
- The forehead card.
- Let's go.

922
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,250
(Rummaging)

923
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,330
Gosh, she is playing
a character again.

924
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,420
So Min.

925
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,570
She must have watched some movies.

926
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,400
So Min, are you getting chased?

927
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,490
(The look of a runaway)

928
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,040
- Are you getting chased?
- I am hiding my face.

929
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,200
I will do well today.

930
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,310
- Let's go.
- Do I put it on my forehead?

931
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,240
(She has the smallest number.)

932
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,240
(Let's see.)

933
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,440
(Staring)

934
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,890
Hold on. Their numbers
will be reflected.

935
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,360
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

936
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
(Their plan to see their numbers...)

937
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,750
(got busted.)

938
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,920
Gosh, it was going well.

939
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,130
I could have done this.
That's too bad.

940
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,370
The surface is reflective.

941
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,690
I can't even wear sunglasses.

942
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,070
Those were the perfect sunglasses
for pushovers.

943
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,070
- That's too bad.
- The easy target's sunglasses.

944
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,430
We would've been able
to see her cards.

945
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,760
Through the reflection.

946
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,670
Such amateurs.

947
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,900
Hold on a second.

948
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,170
Are you going to just
sit around and leave?

949
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,280
Are you here to just watch?

950
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,980
I haven't been offered
a seat at the table yet.

951
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,180
(He's only able to comment
from the sidelines.)

952
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,320
My seat won't open up.

953
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,410
- Of course.
- Honestly,

954
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,590
it's annoying.

955
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,390
- You're having fun though.
- Those clueless...

956
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,190
show their weaker card.

957
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,220
- Can you perform for us?
- How?

958
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,460
Your outfit suits the dance.

959
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,920
The one where you elevate your feet.

960
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,100
- Which one?
- The one with the feet.

961
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,490
- Should I kill some time then?
- Please go ahead.

962
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,200
- Are you up to something there?
- He'll be performing.

963
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,430
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

964
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,140
- So I walk...
- Take a look.

965
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,380
- Like this.
- Go, Suk Jin.

966
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,580
Welcome, Seok Sam.

967
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,850
(Bouncing)

968
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,510
(His triple axel)

969
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,350
(He receives caramels as payment.)

970
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,820
(While Corporal Ji
is having fun...)

971
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,410
(His vile manager
picks up the caramel.)

972
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,790
(Floundering)

973
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,830
What on earth?

974
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,090
- Wait.
- Jae Suk pocketed them all.

975
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,750
Suk Jin earned money for him.

976
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,600
They weren't mine, were they?

977
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,190
All right.

978
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,260
Ji Hyo, you're up first.

979
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,370
(The game begins!)

980
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,690
I'll fold.

981
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,070
Okay.

982
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,310
So Min, come on.

983
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,430
Is it my turn? I bet five.

984
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,000
- What?
- You should go big.

985
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,470
I'd just love to take everything.

986
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,740
- Me too.
- I want them all.

987
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,380
I'll fold too.

988
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,510
(After contemplating,
Haha also folds.)

989
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,850
You'll now open your cards.

990
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,910
- Let's do this.
- Open them.

991
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,390
- I know I at least beat you.
- Do I go first?

992
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,980
Can I take a look?

993
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,790
- Don't be alarmed.
- That's five and...

994
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,680
(Darn...)

995
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,420
(That's what she gets
for betting with the number 1 card.)

996
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,250
- I told you not to be alarmed.
- What's the other one?

997
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,400
It was nine.

998
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,130
- I told you not to be alarmed.
- Her total is 15.

999
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,370
I have six.

1000
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,930
What about this?

1001
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,660
Is this also a six?

1002
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,430
A nine, you idiot.

1003
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,230
- You're terrible with numbers.
- Seriously?

1004
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,730
How can we play...

1005
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,580
with someone
who can't even read numbers?

1006
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,880
- What's the other one?
- This is nine.

1007
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,280
- That's also 9.
- This is also 9.

1008
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,970
- Then he won.
- This is a six.

1009
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,010
9, 9, and 6.

1010
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,290
- So a total of 24?
- Yes.

1011
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,480
I lost.

1012
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,060
- What's my number?
- Eight.

1013
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,410
- So it was an eight.
- What do you have?

1014
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,450
- 10?
- Is that a 10?

1015
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,530
- No, a 1.
- A 1.

1016
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,450
(Jo Kka Chi bet
with a number 1 card.)

1017
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,650
Seriously?

1018
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,070
I thought he'd fold.

1019
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,130
- You should've bet more.
- Exactly.

1020
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,340
I can't believe it.

1021
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,640
Why am I out here
when that loser's playing?

1022
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,160
It was an eight?

1023
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,310
The pot doesn't grow
with me sitting out here.

1024
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,970
No, the game's
lacking a professional.

1025
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,470
- Let's carry on.
- The game needs a professional.

1026
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,350
(And in the next game...)

1027
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,050
Let's open our cards.

1028
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,620
So Min, you're first.

1029
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,480
- 8.
- 8, 6...

1030
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,890
- 6.
- That's 14.

1031
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,910
And eight.

1032
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,090
(Her total is 22.)

1033
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,360
- 4, 6...
- I'm glad I folded.

1034
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,400
- 4...
- That's 22.

1035
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,650
- 6, and 10.
- What if she has a 10?

1036
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,460
- 20.
- You're still in the lead.

1037
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,070
- So Min's still in the lead.
- Right.

1038
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,900
- It's 24.
- 8 times 2 equals 16.

1039
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,760
- That's 20.
- Haha, you lost.

1040
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,640
- Darn it.
- You have a three.

1041
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,730
- What?
- A three.

1042
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,930
- It's an 8.
- No, a 3.

1043
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,140
His hidden card must be a 10.

1044
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,550
3, 5, and 9.

1045
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,850
(So Min wins the next round.)

1046
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,670
(Let me collect my caramels.)

1047
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,110
The loser fights back!

1048
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,160
- All right.
- So Min, gosh.

1049
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,090
Unbelievable.

1050
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,590
So Min might end up going home next.

1051
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,220
This is a lot.
Life's all about one lucky punch.

1052
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,130
I bet you thought
I'd lose money today.

1053
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,260
(We're here to escort Ms. Jeon.)

1054
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,490
- You must be leaving.
- Can I go?

1055
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,930
- Bye.
- You're allowed to leave?

1056
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,470
- Did she finish in second place?
- That's right.

1057
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,610
- I'll get going, Chairman Ha.
- Take care.

1058
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,740
- From the ground up...
- Bye, Se Chan.

1059
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,800
- Bye.
- Take care, everyone.

1060
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,880
See you.

1061
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,110
I had no idea
I'd finish in second place.

1062
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,510
Just so you know,

1063
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,320
I can win games using my brain too.

1064
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,680
(And like that,
So Min leaves in 2nd place.)

1065
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,910
One more can join the table.

1066
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,090
- What?
- We have room for one more.

1067
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,150
- Come on.
- Suk Jin, you're up.

1068
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,320
Only one can join?

1069
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,490
So Min's seat is empty now.

1070
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,680
Why don't you join us?

1071
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,950
(I've been awaiting this moment
for an hour now.)

1072
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,180
- Join us.
- There are no vacant seats.

1073
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,630
Shall we?

1074
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,200
Let's do this!

1075
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,030
First up,

1076
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,320
choose a card
to place on your foreheads.

1077
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,760
(They choose a card
to place on their foreheads.)

1078
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,260
It's hard to guess
what's on our foreheads.

1079
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,610
I'll make a random choice.

1080
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,110
None seems to be threatening.

1081
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,430
(He waited an hour
to sit at the table.)

1082
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,700
Suk Jin's eyes are trembling.

1083
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,110
(Will Big Nose be able
to seize this opportunity?)

1084
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,610
(He cautiously checks his cards.)

1085
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,780
I'll leave it to fate.

1086
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,110
They're neither good nor bad.

1087
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,660
Will you be quiet?

1088
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,430
They're neither good nor bad.

1089
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,930
(The bankrupt player
discourages Big Nose.)

1090
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,400
Will you be quiet?

1091
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,490
(Take that!)

1092
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,840
(After what it took
for me to sit here?)

1093
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,430
Suk Jin has waited
an hour for this.

1094
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,860
- You...
- And even now...

1095
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,180
I didn't say much.

1096
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,510
Will you be quiet?

1097
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,950
You shouldn't have let me
see the cards.

1098
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,110
I was...

1099
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,740
I was going to go all-in, you know.

1100
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,180
"They're neither good nor bad."

1101
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,950
All right, let's play.

1102
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,550
Okay, I'll go first.

1103
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,860
(Total sum)

1104
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,160
- That's 34.
- 34?

1105
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,380
Seriously?

1106
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,260
(The chairperson goes big.)

1107
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,630
You're done for.

1108
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,220
- You know how I am, right?
- Of course.

1109
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,740
- Of course, I do.
- After seeing what I have?

1110
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,610
24, was it?

1111
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,510
(Fold if you're chicken.)

1112
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,110
I only have 17,

1113
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,110
- but...
- Go ahead.

1114
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,180
- Did you see that?
- Sure.

1115
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,300
I'll fold.

1116
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,410
My number isn't high enough.

1117
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,570
I'll fold too.

1118
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,470
- Then...
- Suk Jin, what will it be?

1119
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,220
- You're all-in?
- Yes.

1120
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,550
Go all-in as well.

1121
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,590
We should go big
since we still have collateral.

1122
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,930
Maybe next time.

1123
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,300
(He casually folds.)

1124
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,820
(Is he kidding me?)

1125
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,660
- He folded.
- Seriously?

1126
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,800
Your hidden number was one?

1127
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,760
- What do I have on my forehead?
- It was a high number.

1128
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,160
I had a high number.

1129
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,070
You ruined it for me!

1130
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,910
- What did I say?
- "Neither good nor bad."

1131
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,700
- I'm not wrong.
- Are you kidding me?

1132
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,970
They're neither good nor bad.

1133
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,410
I was looking forward
to a betting game.

1134
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,780
- What do you have?
- What is it?

1135
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,910
I bet he has a 10.

1136
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,340
- Really?
- He must have a 10.

1137
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,150
I bet he has a 10
which makes his total 20.

1138
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,280
(What's the number written
on Haha's hidden card?)

1139
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,340
16.

1140
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,910
How did you know I drew a 10?

1141
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,950
- That's 20.
- 20.

1142
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,030
(Haha has a total of 20.)

1143
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,360
That's a high number.

1144
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,400
(What about Kwang Soo's total then?)

1145
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,760
- 22.
- You have 22?

1146
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,700
- 22.
- You have 22?

1147
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,030
- What?
- 22.

1148
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,200
- How...
- I have 22!

1149
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,930
(22!)

1150
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,610
I have 22!

1151
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,610
- No way.
- Hold on.

1152
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,970
- How do you have 22?
- I have 22.

1153
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,300
9, 7, and 6.

1154
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,840
- No way.
- I have 22!

1155
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,650
(Sighing)

1156
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,240
Are you kidding me?

1157
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,910
- Neither good nor bad...
- I'll keep my mouth shut.

1158
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,490
This card is always the issue.

1159
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,320
(Ji Hyo chooses
the highest number in the pile.)

1160
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,030
Let me see.

1161
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,300
(He has a good number this time.)

1162
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,300
It's all about the right timing.

1163
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,570
I should go big this time.

1164
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,590
The same number.

1165
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,070
(Total sum)

1166
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,430
I'll go all-in.

1167
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,030
I'm going all-in.

1168
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,010
Me too.

1169
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,630
(You too?)

1170
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,650
Se Chan, you're next.

1171
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,970
- Aren't you going all-in?
- Five...

1172
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,880
Can I bet just five?

1173
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,110
- Of course, you can.
- Seriously?

1174
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,220
It'll be over for one of us
in this round anyway.

1175
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,780
- How many are you betting?
- Five, right?

1176
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,490
- Yes, five.
- How many do you have?

1177
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,780
I have 17.

1178
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,860
Wait.

1179
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,450
I'll bet five as well.

1180
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,660
That's five.

1181
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,200
I don't know where
his confidence comes from.

1182
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
- Which cards did they choose?
- I just don't get it.

1183
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,110
- I'll fold.
- Yes, that's better.

1184
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,430
- Then...
- I'm...

1185
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,910
(I'm...)

1186
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,340
I'm no small fish, you know.

1187
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,410
Is there more to life?

1188
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,180
Erase that mustache
if you're going to give a speech.

1189
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,650
I can't help that it grows.

1190
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,780
27. I'm going all-in.

1191
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,660
Okay. I'll call...

1192
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,110
What?

1193
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,220
And play my chance card.

1194
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,400
(The chairperson
plays his chance card.)

1195
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,990
(What will Haha ask for?)

1196
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,070
In what way?

1197
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,430
I'll swap the card on my forehead...

1198
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,430
- Yes?
- I don't know what I have.

1199
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,660
And swap it for the one
Suk Jin has.

1200
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,360
(Swapping the cards
on their foreheads?)

1201
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,930
(What?)

1202
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,150
Swap the card for what?

1203
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,200
- The one on my forehead.
- Your forehead?

1204
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,610
- What an idiot.
- With yours?

1205
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,510
- The one on my forehead...
- With the one I have?

1206
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,880
The decision has been made.

1207
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,740
A chairperson of this level?

1208
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,990
How can he be so stupid?

1209
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,160
- You...
- What's wrong?

1210
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,410
Okay, let's swap.

1211
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,680
Wait, I drew a 10?

1212
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,990
That's how one can bend the rules?

1213
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,200
Wait, I drew a 10?

1214
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,260
Unbelievable.

1215
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,900
He drew an eight, so...

1216
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,300
He drew an eight, so...

1217
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,700
(He now sees what he had.)

1218
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,930
I've never seen such
a lackluster game-changer before.

1219
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,130
He'll receive the penalty
for sure today.

1220
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,300
Haha!

1221
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,300
Why not change the cards...

1222
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,510
- presented on the table?
- How can you be so dumb?

1223
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,200
These cards aren't allowed.

1224
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,700
- Why not?
- Why aren't they allowed?

1225
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,240
It's better than taking a chance
with the one on your forehead.

1226
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,840
Of course, you're allowed
to swap these cards.

1227
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,550
You could've swapped...

1228
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,780
- all your cards with his.
- Unbelievable.

1229
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,220
You did it in the most
boring way possible.

1230
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,590
He's bad at the game
and didn't even make it funnier.

1231
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,130
Can we just give him third place
and get rid of him?

1232
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,450
Get lost, will you?

1233
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,530
Unbelievable.

1234
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,820
Let's see what he has.

1235
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,260
You never know, right?

1236
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,570
Please open your cards.

1237
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,590
- What do you have?
- Here.

1238
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,660
Darn it.

1239
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,570
- I have 20.
- 20?

1240
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,840
You have 20?

1241
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,910
The six is upside down.

1242
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,010
It's not a nine.

1243
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,410
Se Chan, are you kidding me?

1244
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,970
Can someone teach him
how to read numbers first?

1245
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,280
- I...
- Is it over for me then?

1246
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,490
I have 8, 8, and 9.

1247
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,820
(Forehead, Open, Hidden)

1248
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,010
- That's 25.
- 25.

1249
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,720
- That's 25.
- Unbelievable.

1250
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,130
Can the chairperson be any dumber?

1251
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,260
- He's out of chances now?
- See?

1252
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,360
Haha, what's your total?

1253
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,220
20.

1254
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,760
8, 2, and 10.

1255
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,590
(He would've won had he swapped
the cards on the table.)

1256
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,160
Am I allowed to leave then?

1257
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,340
- No, I am.
- No.

1258
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,430
Suk Jin, you have 36 in debt.

1259
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,700
Really?

1260
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,280
But I had 29.

1261
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,340
- You have 36 in debt.
- You owe us 36.

1262
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,700
No, wait.

1263
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,510
Who are you arguing against?

1264
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,150
So I'm supposed to pay you back?

1265
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,180
- Pay back your debt of 36.
- My debt?

1266
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,880
I should pay back my debt of 36?

1267
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,010
Why?

1268
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,450
You're pretending not to understand.

1269
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,260
(He chooses to play dumb.)

1270
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,720
- Is that with interest?
- Yes.

1271
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,050
Got it.

1272
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,200
I have 44.

1273
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,050
- Suk Jin?
- I have 37.

1274
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,430
- Then Suk Jin...
- I won.

1275
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,360
- Give us 36 first.
- Pay back your debt.

1276
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,840
Oh, I need to pay you back.

1277
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,300
He's one ridiculous debtor.

1278
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,740
I need to pay back my debt first.

1279
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,030
- How many do you have?
- 33 caramels.

1280
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,780
Se Chan, you are in third place.

1281
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,130
Okay!

1282
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,180
- I am done.
- Give me one caramel.

1283
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,280
(He is the third person
to get off work.)

1284
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,340
I escaped.

1285
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,410
I will remove the mullet now.

1286
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,510
Bye.

1287
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,550
(Haha, Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, Suk Jin,
and Jae Suk remain.)

1288
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,720
(Pawnshop)

1289
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,660
Will you pawn the hat?

1290
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,990
- And my jacket.
- Hat and jacket.

1291
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,530
Jacket and...

1292
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,490
If you can censor my lower body,

1293
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,490
I will take off my pants too.

1294
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,200
Here is a blanket.

1295
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,700
That's good.
I will cover myself with a blanket.

1296
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,970
Are you really going to do that?

1297
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,090
Of course.

1298
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,160
I refuse to stay here, okay?

1299
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,430
I can play the game, right?

1300
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,630
Hurry up.

1301
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,070
- My goodness.
- Here you go.

1302
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,180
Me?

1303
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,240
Here are my pants.

1304
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,410
May I pawn an item too?

1305
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,110
I will pawn an item.

1306
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,680
- Hold on. Hyung Gu.
- Yes?

1307
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,910
- Here are my glasses.
- I will pawn my glasses too.

1308
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,090
Okay.

1309
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,930
(Is he taking off the microphone?)

1310
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,950
Here.

1311
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,220
- You need the microphone.
- No, no. I don't need it.

1312
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,860
- You need the microphone.
- Forget it.

1313
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,430
- It's the production crew's.
- I don't need it.

1314
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,360
- Forget it.
- You can't pawn it.

1315
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,860
Two positions remain.

1316
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,470
I have 100 caramels.

1317
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,260
Jae Suk.

1318
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,740
You can't see without your glasses,
can you?

1319
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,800
- What?
- You can't see.

1320
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,240
What's the use of seeing?

1321
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,280
What's the use of seeing?

1322
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,380
(What's the use of seeing?)

1323
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,380
(He lost his pants and his reason.)

1324
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,070
What's the use of seeing?

1325
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,050
- Don't you agree?
- That's right.

1326
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,660
I will bet caramels
no matter how many I have.

1327
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,950
- Do you have 70 or 80?
- I don't know.

1328
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,550
Pick the forehead card...

1329
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,720
- right now.
- Let's do this.

1330
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,320
This is for the fourth place.

1331
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,820
We will be done
after two more people leave.

1332
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,820
(The current total)

1333
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,360
Shall I go first?

1334
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,860
- This is driving me crazy.
- Who wants to go first?

1335
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,260
I will go first.

1336
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,570
I will bet two caramels.

1337
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,660
(Suk Jin bets 2 caramels.)

1338
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,380
(Thinking)

1339
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,530
Fold.

1340
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,800
- Fold?
- Fold.

1341
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,200
Really?

1342
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,180
- Fold.
- I only bet two caramels.

1343
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,220
All right.

1344
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,820
(Sanchez is the only one left.)

1345
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,340
(Come on!)

1346
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,410
Let's go.

1347
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,760
All right. I will eat one.

1348
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,430
(For my blood sugar level,
I will eat one caramel!)

1349
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,820
(Weren't you going to bet?)

1350
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,630
- What?
- I mean...

1351
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,260
- What?
- What are you going to do?

1352
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,070
Are you going to bet or not?
Eat that caramel first.

1353
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,340
- Are you going to bet or not?
- I will think while I eat.

1354
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,700
- Sweets help you think.
- It helps you think.

1355
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,280
All right. Go ahead and eat.

1356
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,280
(He pretends to be relaxed.)

1357
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,510
Let's eat a caramel each.

1358
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,800
I can eat one too.

1359
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,800
(Don't bet any caramels.)

1360
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,820
All right. I will fold.

1361
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,720
(He gives up after replenishing
his blood sugar level.)

1362
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,380
(Unlike Suk Jin,
no one placed a bet.)

1363
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,780
What's my number?

1364
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:48,660
(With 10 and 9,
he acquired 4 caramels.)

1365
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,990
- You won those caramels.
- Seriously.

1366
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,300
I showed too big a number.

1367
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,470
- It was too big.
- It was too big.

1368
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,470
(The last round to decide
who gets 4th place)

1369
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,760
The remaining members...

1370
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,840
The usual members stayed behind.
Isn't that right?

1371
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,410
I know.

1372
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,010
(The current total)

1373
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,180
Shall we begin?

1374
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,240
All right.

1375
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,240
(Kwang Soo's cards are 9 and 9.)

1376
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,550
I will bet 10 caramels.

1377
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,380
He showed a nine.

1378
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,490
I will fold.

1379
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,990
I will fold.

1380
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,660
Should I bet?

1381
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,930
Will Song Jeoktoma bet caramels?

1382
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,160
Ji Hyo, decide in five seconds.

1383
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,070
- 5, 4...
- Hold on.

1384
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,470
Will you bet caramels?

1385
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,860
My goodness.

1386
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,090
If you want to beat me...

1387
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,130
I think your total is no match
for mine.

1388
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,570
- My goodness.
- I am sorry,

1389
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,800
but this is our match.
We aren't even looking at you.

1390
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,970
- Hey.
- Okay?

1391
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,050
- You don't know this card.
- Stay out of it.

1392
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,110
Do you know what I have?

1393
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,880
- Do you know what I have?
- I don't care.

1394
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,280
I got a glimpse of it.

1395
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,450
I saw it.

1396
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,910
I don't care.

1397
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,680
Be quiet.
This is a match between us.

1398
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,550
I don't know
where his confidence comes from.

1399
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,030
I can't believe them.

1400
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,300
What is it going to be?

1401
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,360
My goodness.

1402
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,630
What is it going to be?

1403
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,860
Go ahead.

1404
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,220
I will bet all the caramels.

1405
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,260
(The three members
have a tense moment.)

1406
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,430
Did you guys take off your socks?

1407
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:08,530
- Yes.
- Yes.

1408
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,260
Your feet stink.

1409
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,110
- I was thinking about that.
- Seriously.

1410
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,700
I was thinking about that.

1411
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,410
I couldn't help but look at Ji Hyo.

1412
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,470
It isn't me.

1413
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:18,950
- The smell is coming from there.
- But Ji Hyo...

1414
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:23,050
- It's coming from there.
- It isn't me.

1415
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,090
- It isn't me.
- Ji Hyo!

1416
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,550
- It isn't me.
- Hey!

1417
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,220
What are you doing?

1418
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,360
Hey!

1419
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,360
- Hey!
- I am sorry.

1420
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,490
- He is wearing underwear.
- For goodness' sake.

1421
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,530
Ji Hyo, decide in five seconds.

1422
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,200
- 5, 4...
- This is...

1423
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,400
I will fold.

1424
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,160
(Only Kwang Soo
and Suk Jin remain.)

1425
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:45,010
(Laughing)

1426
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,880
Stop stalling.

1427
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,280
- Stop stalling.
- Suk Jin.

1428
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,610
- Hurry up.
- I lost interest in this round.

1429
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,650
Do you know what I have?

1430
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,010
I actually do. I saw it.

1431
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,380
You got a nickname.

1432
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,990
- What is it?
- One-two-three.

1433
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,910
One-two-three.

1434
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,260
(One-two-three?)

1435
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,410
I will fold.

1436
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:03,160
(Mr. One-two-three
finally gives up.)

1437
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,700
The numbers are 1, 2, and 3.

1438
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,090
They are 1, 2, and 3.

1439
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,630
- Ji Seok Sam.
- 1, 2, 3.

1440
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,470
- Ji Seok Sam.
- Ji Seok Sam.

1441
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,860
- Ji Seok Sam.
- How did I get...

1442
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,090
1, 2, and 3?

1443
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:15,130
- That's unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

1444
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,110
Those of you who folded,
why don't you reveal the cards?

1445
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,700
You could have beaten him.

1446
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,930
- Really?
- It was seven.

1447
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,880
- 7, 2, 9.
- Your number is big.

1448
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,010
It's nine.

1449
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,110
What's this one?

1450
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,380
- She had 10!
- No way!

1451
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,550
(Was the hidden card 10?)

1452
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,050
- Why did you fold?
- Why did you fold?

1453
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,320
Our totals seemed to be
about the same.

1454
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,360
- He had one number left too.
- It's the highest total.

1455
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,780
Ji Hyo, I can't believe you.

1456
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,860
It's the highest total.

1457
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,320
- Seriously.
- 8, 9, and 10.

1458
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,360
- Was it 9?
- I didn't know the forehead card.

1459
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,360
My numbers were 9, 9, and 1.

1460
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,360
(My numbers were 9, 9, and 1.)

1461
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,030
- I can't believe you.
- Okay!

1462
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,260
I defended myself well.

1463
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,760
(Song Jeoktoma had
a humiliating defeat.)

1464
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,970
If I hadn't folded,
I would have lost by one.

1465
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,380
His numbers were 1, 2, and 3.

1466
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,450
Kwang Soo...

1467
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,910
I still wondered
if I should bet caramels.

1468
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,340
He won four caramels.

1469
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,280
Is this really the right way
to play the game?

1470
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:03,610
I am so annoyed.

1471
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,610
Kwang Soo won four caramels.

1472
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,780
When will I go home?

1473
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,660
We need to check
the number of caramels.

1474
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,700
Then I am the winner.

1475
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,430
I have 76 caramels.

1476
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,900
Ji Hyo, you are in fourth place.

1477
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,720
- Really?
- Go home, Ji Hyo.

1478
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,590
Good luck. I am going.

1479
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,930
- Bye.
- Bye.

1480
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,610
- My goodness.
- One more person will go home.

1481
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:23,660
(One spot remains.)

1482
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,510
This is the last round.
One spot remains.

1483
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,180
I will get them.

1484
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,610
- The last spot.
- Okay.

1485
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:30,880
- Now,
- Only the professionals are here.

1486
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,570
we will show you
how the professionals play.

1487
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:34,720
(The final match
between the easy targets)

1488
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,050
- All right.
- Let's pick two cards.

1489
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,380
(After 2 rounds,
only the 5th place will go home.)

1490
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,660
(He shows 10.)

1491
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,720
Okay.

1492
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,130
I don't want to waste time.

1493
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,380
What?

1494
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,400
Really?

1495
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,450
Why didn't you reveal a card?

1496
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:48,800
Should I reveal a card?

1497
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,320
What?

1498
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,430
What are you doing?

1499
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,130
Really? Do they both have 10?

1500
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,430
- Okay.
- 10 and 10.

1501
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,930
Is this the last game?

1502
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:58,530
- You will play twice.
- Twice.

1503
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,700
You will play twice.

1504
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,910
Then I will fold.

1505
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,950
Come on.

1506
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,470
(In that case...)

1507
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,410
- How many caramels are inside?
- Go ahead and count.

1508
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,510
(Go ahead and count.)

1509
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,780
(The one who is curious
should do the counting.)

1510
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,130
Tell me.

1511
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,050
The two of you should play.
I will fold as well.

1512
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,550
Life always puts you...

1513
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,970
at a crossroads.

1514
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,630
They are really cool today.

1515
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,840
- Let's go. Stop stalling.
- I think...

1516
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,110
that happened today.

1517
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,630
If he doesn't fold,
one will go home...

1518
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:34,340
and the other will get the penalty.

1519
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:37,470
- Bet, Suk Jin.
- That's a man's life.

1520
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,550
- I won't think more.
- Okay!

1521
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:39,610
- Really?
- Let's go.

1522
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,220
(They both go all-in
for this battle.)

1523
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,380
That's hot.

1524
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,610
Let's go.

1525
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,380
- The winner takes all.
- Okay.

1526
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,660
- Let's check the numbers.
- Let's go.

1527
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,930
The winner will go home.

1528
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,630
- Shall we see the forehead card?
- Shall we see?

1529
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,760
Shall we see?

1530
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,090
Both of us will stay.

1531
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,160
It's six.

1532
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,260
It's four.

1533
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:57,970
- 16.
- 14.

1534
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,240
I don't know how it will go.

1535
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,240
The last card.

1536
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,530
14 versus 16.

1537
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,570
Three.

1538
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:06,630
(Suk Jin's hidden card needs to be
bigger than Jae Suk's by 2.)

1539
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:10,180
(What's Jae Suk's hidden card?)

1540
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,050
10!

1541
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,010
(Is Jae Suk's hidden card 10?)

1542
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,680
(What?)

1543
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,950
My number is 10 too.

1544
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,180
My number is 10 too.

1545
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,280
(Is Suk Jin's number 10 as well?)

1546
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,800
- 24?
- My total is 24.

1547
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,760
- It was an amazing match.
- My number is 10 too.

1548
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,070
Suk Jin!

1549
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,240
(Speechless)

1550
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,240
All right. Life gives you...

1551
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,800
several chances.

1552
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,240
(Jae Suk takes
Suk Jin's caramels.)

1553
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,470
- I won these.
- 10?

1554
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,570
My number is 10 too.

1555
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,610
(Sanchez manages to get ahead.)

1556
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,240
I got 10 and 10 too.

1557
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,380
How did this happen?

1558
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,110
We should play one last time.

1559
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,280
A man shouldn't do that.

1560
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,450
- 80.
- Both of us...

1561
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,740
have caramels.

1562
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,280
The three of us?

1563
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,160
- Okay.
- It will be meaningless to you.

1564
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,820
This is our last chance.

1565
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,550
He will definitely get the penalty.

1566
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,360
(The 1st member
who will get the penalty)

1567
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,550
Put your clothes back on.

1568
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,930
Get out.

1569
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,090
- Hold on.
- Put your clothes back on.

1570
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,360
I need to put my clothes back on.

1571
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,590
Put your clothes back on
and lie on the snow.

1572
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,930
With 10 and 10,
he had no choice but to go all-in.

1573
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:10,470
The forehead card.

1574
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,510
- Shall we pick the forehead card?
- Shall we do that?

1575
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,110
Reveal one card.

1576
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,880
- My goodness.
- How did I get 10 and 10?

1577
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,070
Let me go and get my glasses back.

1578
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,280
- You are well off.
- Yes. I have a lot of caramels.

1579
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,880
(He retrieves his glasses
with 20 caramels.)

1580
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,930
(Haha must beat Sanchez.)

1581
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:29,930
All-in.

1582
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,260
- Me too.
- Okay.

1583
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,950
I have no choice but to fold.

1584
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,090
- What?
- Come on.

1585
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,260
I have no choice but to fold.

1586
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,660
(Fold?)

1587
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,430
My numbers are too small.

1588
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,570
Seriously.

1589
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,630
They are too small.

1590
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:43,740
- I have no choice.
- 2, 3, and 4.

1591
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,800
I got 1, 2, and 3.

1592
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,010
- You got 2, 3, and 4.
- You understand, right?

1593
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,570
- If the caramels are combined...
- The number might be higher.

1594
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,570
You never know.

1595
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,780
All right. Seven.

1596
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,340
What's your number?

1597
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,280
(Forehead card, opened card,
hidden card)

1598
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,680
- 6.
- 10.

1599
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,550
Haha is winning by one point.

1600
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,260
Please show it to the front
at the same time.

1601
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,360
- 1, 2, 3.
- I also don't know what it is.

1602
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,720
(The hidden card will decide
the outcome of these two.)

1603
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,880
(The person who wins might get
more caramels than Jae Suk.)

1604
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,690
(Haha wins with a total of 21.)

1605
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:29,970
(Haha acquired all of
Kwang Soo's caramels.)

1606
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,590
- I'm going to eat them.
- Haha won.

1607
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,990
- I don't know what will happen.
- You saw that, didn't you?

1608
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,610
- We have to count them, right?
- Yes.

1609
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,530
It wasn't time for me
to get 10 more then.

1610
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,110
Lee Kwang Soo and Ji Suk Jin are
set to get the penalty.

1611
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,170
Gosh.

1612
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,840
If I join them, it will be
a complete whole.

1613
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:47,070
- 100.
- 110.

1614
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,880
- 130.
- 130.

1615
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,590
- 140.
- 140.

1616
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,260
In my opinion, Haha won.

1617
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,960
- That's right.
- Really?

1618
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,280
- Jae Suk got his glasses back.
- I got my glasses back.

1619
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,490
20...

1620
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,220
170.

1621
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,050
170.

1622
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,360
- Do you have 170?
- 178.

1623
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,360
(I have 178.)

1624
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,400
How many do you have?

1625
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,360
I don't know.
I think it's about 150 something.

1626
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,740
Haha goes home.

1627
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,440
(159 versus 178,
Haha is confirmed as 5th place.)

1628
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,340
Gosh.

1629
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,150
Why did you get your glasses back?

1630
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,340
Why did you get them back?

1631
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,470
Why did I...

1632
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,670
(The naked chairman succeeds
in saving face with 5th place.)

1633
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,720
- Thank you.
- But...

1634
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,840
If I had won the last game,
I could have won.

1635
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,880
The penalty is to either get flogged
or get splashed by a water basin.

1636
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,190
We'll give you the penalty panel
you want at the same time.

1637
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:34,050
If only one person chooses a panel
from a team,

1638
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,630
they won't get the penalty.

1639
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,630
(The person who chooses
a different penalty will be exempt.)

1640
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,300
- That's unbelievable.
- Wait a minute.

1641
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,470
- Only one person who chooses...
- Can I ask you a question?

1642
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:41,070
Where will we get
splashed by the water basin?

1643
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,170
You will have to go outside.

1644
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,070
Flogging will be better
unconditionally.

1645
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,300
But if all three of you
choose to get flogged,

1646
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,710
you will all get flogged.

1647
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,710
If someone chooses to get splashed
by a water basin, he will be exempt.

1648
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,420
- The minority will win, right?
- Yes, the minority will win.

1649
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,150
- Earlier, I saw that...
- Room number one...

1650
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,780
- you chose room number one, right?
- Yes.

1651
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,880
- We ate lunch together.
- Yes.

1652
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,280
- Yes, lunch.
- Yes.

1653
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,090
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

1654
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,050
- We're family, right?
- Yes.

1655
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,050
- We ate lunch together, right?
- Yes.

1656
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

1657
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,400
Room number one has bad energy.

1658
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,630
Room number one's location was bad.

1659
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,340
- Did you decide?
- Yes.

1660
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,510
- I'm not going to look.
- Show it to the camera.

1661
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,630
- Turn it around.
- Let's go outside.

1662
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,010
It will be the funniest if all three
of them choose the same thing.

1663
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,970
One.

1664
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,050
- Two.
- I'm not going to look.

1665
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,050
I'm going to leave it up to luck.

1666
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,070
(Who will be the 1 person that
will be exempt from the penalty?)

1667
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,070
Three.

1668
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,670
(Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
choose the water basin.)

1669
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,510
(Big Nose is the only one
to survive.)

1670
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:33,590
(Jae Suk and Kwang Soo will
be splashed by a water basin.)

1671
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:34,780
- Yes.
- Good job.

1672
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,780
Go outside to get splashed
by a water basin and come back.

1673
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,990
Get splashed by a water basin
and cool yourselves down.

1674
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:41,090
- This is what life is about.
- I'm so dumbfounded.

1675
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,800
Turning the tables.

1676
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,090
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1677
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:46,090
(The two bottom card sharks
appear while complaining.)

1678
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,630
The penalty is simple.

1679
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,800
You just have to pour it
on each other.

1680
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,630
Let's do it toward the face.

1681
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,740
1, 2...

1682
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,150
(Kwang Soo is completely wet.)

1683
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,880
I didn't get splashed.

1684
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,240
- Good job.
- Good job.

1685
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,690
Is this the end?

1686
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,380
- Hey.
- Why didn't you get splashed?

1687
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,630
The water splashed
against each other in the air.

1688
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:14,630
And that is how the Card Shark
Association New Year's Party ended.

1689
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:16,300
(One week later)

1690
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,990
- Hello.
- Hello.

1691
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,240
- Yes.
- Hello.

1692
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,760
Gosh, what is this?

1693
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,260
- What are we doing today?
- Today, are we...

1694
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,470
- PowerPoint?
- What are we doing today?

1695
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,740
- Just sit comfortably.
- Hello, good to see you.

1696
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,740
(8 laptops are set up neatly.)

1697
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,610
Are we going to do that again?

1698
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,970
PowerPoint? I failed that time.

1699
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,570
- What?
- Can we please not do that?

1700
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,670
My PowerPoint presentation was
a mess at that time.

1701
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,050
- Everything was edited out.
- Hey.

1702
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,610
(March 2020, Episode 494,
Running Retreat Special)

1703
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:38,880
(Rich, Poor, and Fun Retreat!
Modern society is busy.)

1704
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,260
(Let's fall into old memories
outside the puzzling smart world.)

1705
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,490
(This is the place they presented
their retreat plan presentation.)

1706
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:44,720
Cry in Silence. It's the same.

1707
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,400
(He has a painful memory of being
disregarded by everyone...)

1708
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,070
(because of his elementary school
level presentation.)

1709
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,900
I'm bad at PowerPoint presentations.
I'm embarrassed.

1710
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,070
We have to use computers again.

1711
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,970
We did this when
Byeong Gyu was here.

1712
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,440
- That's right. The retreat.
- Right, the retreat.

1713
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:01,110
Byeong Gyu was cast in
lead roles after Running Man.

1714
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,510
- He's trying to force a connection.
- I really...

1715
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,010
- felt proud of him.
- He is causing such a fuss.

1716
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:07,510
How many people became popular
thanks to us?

1717
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,590
Why can't we become popular?

1718
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,840
- Why can't I become popular?
- Make me popular.

1719
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,490
When will I ever be able to act?

1720
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:13,150
Gosh, this place is strange.

1721
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,420
I'm not sure whether I can say this,

1722
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,590
but I'm popular.

1723
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,530
(They agree to this.)

1724
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,050
I agree.

1725
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,320
Do you think it's time
for you to clap?

1726
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,220
I can't help but agree to this.

1727
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,990
I'm sorry, but I'm...

1728
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:29,360
I also became popular
with Running Man.

1729
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,240
- Gosh.
- I'll go get grab Kim Muscles.

1730
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,470
- What?
- What about Kim Muscles?

1731
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,780
- Kim Grand Award.
- Go get...

1732
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,300
- our Kook Jong. Kim Muscles.
- Kim Grand Award.

1733
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:40,320
Kim Grand Award is here.

1734
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,280
(Kim Grand Award appears with
presence to a grand announcement.)

1735
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,010
- Kim Grand Award.
- Shouldn't we toss him up?

1736
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,360
Stop it.

1737
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,780
- How many weeks will you do this?
- He's so pretentious.

1738
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,650
- Let's toss you up.
- You punk!

1739
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,420
Come out, punk.

1740
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,590
Why are you doing that?

1741
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:55,970
Hello, Jong Kook.

1742
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:57,490
- Older Brother.
- Senior Grand Award.

1743
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,490
- He's Senior Grand Award.
- Yes.

1744
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,300
- Yes.
- We ended up like this.

1745
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,360
Suk Jin isn't standing up
to the end.

1746
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,710
Suk Jin isn't standing up
to the end.

1747
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,670
He didn't stand up during the awards
and he's not standing up now.

1748
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,970
- Kim Grand Award.
- You're my junior.

1749
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,780
- Junior Grand Award.
- Sit down here.

1750
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,880
Okay.

1751
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,150
I warmed it up.

1752
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,880
- I'm sorry, but...
- But...

1753
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,990
have you ever won
the grand award before?

1754
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:21,420
- What?
- The grand award.

1755
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,490
- I haven't.
- If you haven't, go away then.

1756
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,460
- I'll go that way then.
- Come here.

1757
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,990
- Come here.
- Haha got the top excellence award.

1758
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:29,900
Go away. Top Excellence Award,
please sit down here.

1759
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,470
- Please move.
- Okay.

1760
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:32,690
- You won the top excellence award?
- Yes.

1761
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:33,900
Is that so?

1762
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,510
(The top excellence award winner
of 3 years ago moved to the corner.)

1763
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,010
- Please move to the end.
- Gosh.

1764
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,170
- Yes.
- Grand Award.

1765
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,470
Haha, on your social media...

1766
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,710
- That's right.
- Why are you dressed as a prince?

1767
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:44,340
He met RISABAE.

1768
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,440
Cha Seung Won and Lee Jung Jae...

1769
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,690
- What did you do?
- Why did you do that?

1770
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:52,380
He went to Song Yi like that
and said "Hello",

1771
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,420
and she was really surprised.

1772
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,420
- That's right.
- Song Yi was really surprised.

1773
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,880
- She was so surprised, she cried.
- That's right. She cried.

1774
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,990
(Haha's youngest daughter Song Yi
cried because he looked unfamiliar.)

1775
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,800
- She was so surprised, she cried.
- That's right. She cried.

1776
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,150
Who is Song Yi?

1777
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,400
(Who is Song Yi?)

1778
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,970
- What are you doing?
- Suk Jin.

1779
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:06,800
- Suk Jin.
- He's really...

1780
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,610
- Pay some attention.
- She's his third child.

1781
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:09,900
- Gosh, he's driving me crazy.
- Hey.

1782
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,170
You should have said her full name.
How would I know?

1783
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:13,800
- Do you know my child's name?
- You should know "Song Yi".

1784
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,300
- Hyun Woo.
- Hyun Woo.

1785
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,610
- Ji Hyun Woo.
- See? You know nothing about us.

1786
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:18,970
You don't even know
my father's name.

1787
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:20,880
Do you know my father's name?

1788
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,440
- Mr. Ji Chang Gyun.
- Oh, my.

1789
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,440
What happened?

1790
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,360
(Jae Suk got the name of
Suk Jin's father right.)

1791
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,720
(His name popped out exactly
like an answering machine.)

1792
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,220
- What is with him?
- Is that right?

1793
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,820
- Really?
- Yes.

1794
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,800
- How does he know that?
- How did you know that?

1795
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,690
- He's frightening.
- How did you know that?

1796
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,300
How does he know all of that?

1797
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,470
- Oh, my.
- He's like a search engine.

1798
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:40,590
- He's frightening.
- Yes.

1799
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,170
- How does Jae Suk know that?
- How does he know that?

1800
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,840
Today's special is
Running Man Rewritten.

1801
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,170
- Yes.
- We will rewrite...

1802
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:51,650
some of the content on Running Man's
website that has stayed the same...

1803
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,880
- for 10 years now.
- Really?

1804
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,590
Isn't it originally something
like running around the city?

1805
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,990
Is it still that?

1806
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:59,360
Running around the city...

1807
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,960
- It said something like landmarks.
- Yes.

1808
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,590
Does anyone know the production
objective that Cho Hyo Jin wrote?

1809
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:05,720
Isn't it "Don't walk, run."?

1810
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,900
It's "From landmarks stuck
in the city..."

1811
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,590
Yes, "From landmarks where
the lights are turned off..."

1812
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,860
It's something like,
"Something will spread out..."

1813
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,090
We will show you the content first.

1814
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,610
- Take a look at this.
- What was it?

1815
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,570
- Strength...
- We had to escape at that time.

1816
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:21,380
"Kwon Hyeong Gu, Choi Hyung In,
Kim Nam Joong,"

1817
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,070
"Nam Joong, Sun Myung..."

1818
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,720
"Yoo Jae Suk, Ji Suk Jin,
Kim Jong Kook, Haha, Song Ji Hyo,"

1819
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,170
(They start to read the information
from the top.)

1820
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,720
I'm sorry, but is this in
the order of age or what?

1821
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,380
- What?
- "Yoo Jae Suk..."

1822
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,320
Haha, Just move on.

1823
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,190
(He's curious about the criteria
for the order of the names.)

1824
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:37,590
- Just move on.
- But...

1825
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,190
- Why would you ask whether...
- I'm so curious.

1826
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,320
- it's in the order of age?
- It's in the order of popularity.

1827
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,170
- To say it's in the order of age,
- Yes.

1828
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,490
- it's ambiguous.
- To say it's in the order of age...

1829
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,630
It's also ambiguous to say
it's in the order of popularity.

1830
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:47,630
- Haha, it's also ambiguous...
- How is this...

1831
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,030
to say it's in
the order of popularity.

1832
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,740
- It's not in the order of age.
- I guess it's like...

1833
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,630
- I guess it's like...
- Hey.

1834
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,150
- Hey.
- What is this order?

1835
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:56,610
- Don't talk about it.
- Wait a minute.

1836
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:58,420
- Just think about it in your mind.
- Is it in the order of age?

1837
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,280
- Just be quiet.
- Just think about it in your mind.

1838
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,490
- It could be the order of debuts.
- Okay.

1839
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,880
- That's right.
- The order of debuts.

1840
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,780
- But then I should go to the front.
- What?

1841
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,960
- If it's in the order of debuts...
- Just be quiet.

1842
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,960
Let's just say
it's in the order of debuts.

1843
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,820
- Let's just say that.
- It's in the order of debuts.

1844
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,130
Okay, let's wrap it up like this.

1845
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,220
It's the casting order.

1846
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,400
- Casting, okay?
- Okay.

1847
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,360
- Okay, do you get it?
- Okay.

1848
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,570
- That's right.
- That's right.

1849
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,030
- That's right.
- Okay, do you get it?

1850
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,800
"An unexpected big laughter that..."

1851
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,970
- "no one imagined."
- "No one imagined."

1852
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:27,280
"Landmarks that represent Korea."

1853
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,970
"Running Man will let you know
about them."

1854
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:30,280
"Korea's representative landmarks."

1855
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,720
"The top celebrities of Korea are
gathered there."

1856
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,320
"They will do missions everywhere
to win games..."

1857
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,650
"and escape from that place
before the next morning."

1858
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,280
It was like that in the past.

1859
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:39,190
- This really must be changed.
- Yes.

1860
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,050
- It was still like this.
- That was in the very beginning.

1861
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,960
We were like that
at the time because...

1862
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,050
We would go to
places like big shopping malls...

1863
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,030
- after business hours.
- That's right.

1864
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,530
- We had to shoot once they closed.
- It was really fun.

1865
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,690
- It was amazing.
- We went there...

1866
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:53,570
- after 10 p.m.
- That's right.

1867
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,130
- Until the next morning.
- We shot until the next morning.

1868
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:56,240
- Until the opening hours.
- Yes.

1869
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,760
- Yes, at night.
- So,

1870
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,130
our staff and everyone
went through so much trouble.

1871
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,780
Yes, but if we didn't have
those times,

1872
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,470
- Running Man won't exist now.
- Right.

1873
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,740
- The experience accumulated.
- That's right.

1874
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:06,880
- That's right.
- That's right.

1875
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,510
- But there is a need for change.
- Yes.

1876
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:10,780
The same production objective...

1877
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,610
pops up when you search for us on
search engines like the N website.

1878
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:16,490
So you can define
what kind of show...

1879
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:17,820
Running Man is like...

1880
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,550
- for people who first encounter us.
- Gosh.

1881
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,630
What should we say?

1882
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,820
There's also something else.

1883
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,690
(Is the production objective
not the only thing?)

1884
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:25,970
- Member introductions.
- Did something like that exist?

1885
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,490
- I never saw this before.
- I never saw this before.

1886
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,510
- MC Yu?
- I never saw this before.

1887
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:29,570
(You can see these member intros
on runningman.sbs.co.kr.)

1888
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:30,800
- I never saw this before.
- Where was this?

1889
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,880
- What is this?
- I never saw this before.

1890
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,880
- What is this?
- MC Yu...

1891
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,880
- "Yooruce Willis,"
- "Yooruce Willis,"

1892
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,570
- "the pride of Running Man."
- "the pride of Running Man."

1893
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:37,650
What is that?

1894
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,440
"The pride of Running Man"?
What is that?

1895
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,050
Why is he the pride of Running Man?

1896
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,150
And...

1897
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,320
everything aside,

1898
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,110
- I wore that for Episode 100.
- Hey.

1899
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,320
You were still young at that time.

1900
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,860
(You can feel that times have passed
from the old photo and intro.)

1901
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,800
"MC Yu" is the nickname,
and there's a one-sentence comment.

1902
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,670
"Yooruce Willis,
the pride of Running Man."

1903
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,030
It's my first time seeing this.
Did something like that exist?

1904
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,190
It's also my first time seeing this.

1905
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,970
- It says, "Big Brother Big Nose".
- That's right.

1906
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:02,240
"Big Brother Big Nose" is next.

1907
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,030
- "He shouts 'Start the race'..."
- What is that?

1908
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,610
- "in a cool manner."
- "Running Man's..."

1909
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,240
"big brother, Big Nose."

1910
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,650
It's like this.

1911
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,110
Honestly, he didn't shout it
in a cool manner in the beginning.

1912
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:12,570
(Honestly, he didn't shout it
in a cool manner in the beginning.)

1913
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:13,610
He's offended right now.

1914
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,440
- "Race start."
- He wasn't that cool.

1915
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:19,690
(In the beginning, he said
that comment quietly by himself.)

1916
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:24,690
(The race starter's face became
brighter and voice became louder.)

1917
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,130
("Race start")

1918
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,090
When I accepted the fact
that I had to do it,

1919
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,190
- I shouted it in a cool manner.
- That's right.

1920
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,670
But it took about a year
for me to accept that fact.

1921
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,530
- It took over a year.
- Yes, for me to accept it.

1922
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,740
Let's take a look at Jong Kook.

1923
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,360
- Jong Kook is also young.
- "All Mighty".

1924
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:38,070
- "Absolute power Kim Jong Kook."
- Gosh.

1925
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,880
"He has a charm where strength
and softness exist together."

1926
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,010
- "Strength and softness..."
- Where is his softness?

1927
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,170
- Where is his softness?
- That makes no sense.

1928
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:47,110
(Oh, my...)

1929
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,170
Where is his softness?

1930
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,590
It says "He has a strange charm."

1931
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,920
(The person who has a strange charm
doesn't know what to do.)

1932
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,090
His charm is strange.

1933
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:54,720
- It's strange.
- I have charm.

1934
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,550
- Next.
- "Haroro".

1935
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,590
It says "Haroro".

1936
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:58,800
Oh my. What is that photo?

1937
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,460
What are those glasses?

1938
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,570
"Haroro, what kind of character will
suit him besides being a playboy?"

1939
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,300
- He's not a playboy anymore.
- No.

1940
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,090
- His playboy phase has passed.
- He's not a playboy anymore.

1941
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,300
I gave my playboy attitude away.

1942
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,400
He can't be a playboy anymore.

1943
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,760
"He's the dad of three kids.
He's an old fossil now."

1944
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,970
"He's the dad of three kids.
He's an old fossil now."

1945
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:15,510
(The dad who became an old fossil)

1946
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:16,740
He's the oldest among old fossils.

1947
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:17,900
Ha Oldest Fossil.

1948
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,150
- Ha Oldest Fossil.
- Ha Oldest Fossil.

1949
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,570
- No, I'm not!
- He tries to act young.

1950
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,340
- No!
- He's the oldest among old fossils.

1951
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,340
"He tries to dress young."

1952
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,490
(Dad of three kids, An old fossil,
Tries to dress young)

1953
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:26,550
Let's change it like that, okay?

1954
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,050
That's it.
We're done with Ha Old Fossil.

1955
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,220
- "Ace".
- Let's take a look at Ji Hyo.

1956
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,530
"Ace".

1957
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:31,720
It's an old version.

1958
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,150
She isn't the only woman anymore.

1959
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,800
That expression is also
old-fashioned now.

1960
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,470
- We don't use that anymore.
- We don't use that anymore.

1961
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,990
- So...
- We have two women members.

1962
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,990
- She's not the only woman anymore.
- That's right.

1963
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,440
- We called her that in the past.
- What about this?

1964
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,170
"She builds a wall against
communicating with members,"

1965
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,970
"but she participates in the shoot
every week."

1966
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,380
(Diligent Cavewoman Ji Hyo)

1967
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,210
"Unexpectedly, she's Jeoktoma,
the King of Common Sense."

1968
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,300
- What do you think?
- "She also..."

1969
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,470
- "runs on the stage today."
- "She also runs."

1970
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:53,220
"She also runs on the stage today."

1971
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,780
- "A veteran of variety shows".
- "A veteran".

1972
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,420
- "Veteran" is nice.
- Yes, it's nice.

1973
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:57,650
- "Veteran".
- Let's change that.

1974
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,190
Okay, Kwang Soo.

1975
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,490
- "Traitor Giraffe".
- "The icon of betrayal, Kwang Soo."

1976
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:03,280
- "His betrayals will continue."
- "His betrayals will continue."

1977
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,050
(The icon of betrayal, Kwang Soo.
His betrayals will continue.)

1978
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:06,400
- "His betrayal will be continued."
- This is okay.

1979
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,090
We could continue using this.

1980
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:09,090
- This is good.
- This is...

1981
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:10,570
We could continue using this.

1982
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:11,840
- This is good.
- This is...

1983
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,590
- He likes this.
- We can continue using this.

1984
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,530
This is from 10 years ago.
This is not okay.

1985
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:16,530
This is good.

1986
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,010
A lot has changed
since it's from 10 years ago.

1987
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,300
He hasn't changed that much.

1988
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,380
- Nothing has changed.
- It's just you.

1989
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,880
This is from 10 years ago.
Please change it.

1990
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,940
- He's the same.
- Okay.

1991
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,650
- His betrayals were upgraded.
- Just copy and paste the same one.

1992
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:27,740
You have long front hair here.

1993
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,740
You should change it to a photo
where you have a mullet.

1994
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,590
- We could color it with markers.
- No,

1995
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,610
- the hair doesn't have to change.
- Your face is also...

1996
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,860
- So Min and I are also here.
- What?

1997
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:38,460
- "Whimsical charm, Jeon So Min."
- "Whimsical charm, Jeon So Min."

1998
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,960
"Variety show rising star
that's on another dimension."

1999
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,690
- They joined recently.
- That's right.

2000
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,860
That was written in the early days.

2001
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,030
- In the early days?
- Yes.

2002
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,690
I really like the part that says,
"She has talking skills."

2003
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:50,070
- I really like that.
- "Craziness" is omitted.

2004
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,710
It doesn't have "craziness" there.

2005
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:53,800
- She also has "Crazy Poet".
- Yes.

2006
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,880
- She has several nicknames.
- "Crazy Poet".

2007
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,840
- You have to add a lot.
- She also has "Crazy Poet".

2008
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,650
- Why am I...
- What is wrong with yours?

2009
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,050
Why are you called, "Unlucky"?

2010
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,940
- Why am I called, "Unlucky"?
- "Delinquent".

2011
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,550
Why are you called, "Unlucky"?

2012
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,920
"Unlucky Rising Star"?

2013
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,610
You must have not had
any nicknames.

2014
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,360
- Isn't that right?
- That's really...

2015
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,760
- written carelessly.
- That's right.

2016
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,590
- I really hate you.
- He's...

2017
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:13,490
- He's...
- You need to apologize to him.

2018
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:15,970
Honestly, he's not that unlucky.

2019
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:17,220
That's so upsetting.

2020
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,970
- He has no characters.
- He has no characters.

2021
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:21,070
Isn't "Variety Show Cheat Key"
also cheating?

2022
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:23,740
I'm not a cheat key.
I was completely stuck.

2023
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,280
What about this?
"The cuttlefish of Running Man."

2024
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,240
- He couldn't even change that.
- What is...

2025
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,380
- in front of "the youngest member"?
- What?

2026
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,470
What youngest member is it?

2027
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:32,840
- Where is "the youngest member"?
- "Running Man's..."

2028
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,050
We need to come up with
some nicknames for Se Chan.

2029
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,550
- It says "new".
- "The new youngest member"?

2030
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:39,420
(Embarrassed)

2031
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,090
- That's not it.
- So Min.

2032
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,820
- Why?
- She couldn't read...

2033
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,090
- that Chinese character.
- I couldn't see it.

2034
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:45,990
- I was wondering what it was.
- Can't you see it?

2035
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,300
I can't see it clearly, Jae Suk.

2036
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:50,400
- As you can see, it's really old.
- Yes.

2037
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,440
We didn't change it
since the early days.

2038
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:53,900
- Okay.
- So if you write...

2039
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,030
everyone's nicknames,

2040
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:57,260
one-sentence comments,

2041
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,400
and production objective
from your ideas.

2042
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,400
Okay, should we write them?

2043
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,970
We will spin a roulette
at the end of today.

2044
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:04,280
The person who wins will have
the power to change everything.

2045
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,670
(The website will be changed to
the roulette winner's content.)

2046
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:06,780
(All of the content will change
according to how the winner likes.)

2047
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,470
- Will you do it like that?
- Yes, everything will be changed.

2048
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,050
The entire website will be changed?

2049
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,690
If you search for us, the winner's
production objective will pop up.

2050
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,220
- Really?
- Will that be it?

2051
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:16,780
This is hard.

2052
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,220
(You can read the changed website
when the winner is announced...)

2053
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,820
(after next week's episode is aired
on January 17.)

2054
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:23,990
We must pay some attention
to this then.

2055
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,670
For example, it's okay to write,
"Haha's Running Man".

2056
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:28,760
- Really?
- Will you really change it to that?

2057
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:30,070
- Of course.
- Really?

2058
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,110
(Who will be the lucky winner
that will finally win?)

2059
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:34,130
We must pay attention
to write these then.

2060
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,440
We must add "Beyond Korea", right?

2061
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,010
"Beyond Korea."

2062
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:40,920
- "To the whole world."
- Yes.

2063
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:44,340
"A worldwide fandom..."

2064
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,860
Are you an AI?
Why are you making so much noise?

2065
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,920
He keeps saying it out loud
while writing.

2066
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:51,860
Do you know what
really surprised me?

2067
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:54,690
I didn't write "Type the text."

2068
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:57,170
But "Type the text."
suddenly popped up.

2069
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:58,860
- You need to delete and type.
- I was really surprised. What?

2070
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,340
- You need to delete and type.
- Do I have to delete it?

2071
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,070
"The pride of Korean variety shows."

2072
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,380
"Based on a worldwide fandom
beyond Korea..."

2073
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,610
"A giant scale."

2074
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:10,610
"A tremendous amount of
production cost."

2075
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,320
"Tom Cruise is also drooling over
this show."

2076
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,820
That's cool.
That's like a blockbuster.

2077
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,740
"Young people like this program."

2078
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,860
Why is it already bad?

2079
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,880
(Old fossils tend to obsess over
things that young people like.)

2080
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,590
- It's already bad.
- It means you're old.

2081
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:26,090
I already don't want to see it.

2082
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,820
"This variety show is a craze..."

2083
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,420
"among young people."

2084
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:31,690
Gosh, this is perfect.

2085
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,570
"Variety shows are disappearing
these days."

2086
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,240
- Gosh.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

2087
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,630
- The introduction is good, right?
- That's right.

2088
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,610
"Variety shows are disappearing
these days." That's good, Jae Suk.

2089
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:40,880
- Isn't it okay for a start?
- Yes.

2090
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,880
It's good.

2091
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,280
"Variety shows are disappearing
these days. Running Man..."

2092
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,300
"continues the life of the few
remaining variety shows"

2093
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,240
"Continues the life" looks weak.

2094
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,280
Jae Suk, write how
young people write these days.

2095
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,150
You should at least add
"It's beyond amazing".

2096
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,090
"Based on a worldwide fandom
beyond Korea,"

2097
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:54,190
- Gosh, you...
- "we became the center of..."

2098
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:56,380
Let's see what you will write
for the introduction later.

2099
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:58,030
"It's beyond amazing" is the worst.

2100
01:06:58,030 --> 01:06:59,090
Gosh, it really is the worst.

2101
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,320
"It's beyond amazing,
enough to wet my pants."

2102
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,760
"Beyond Korea" is too...

2103
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,170
It sounds too much like bragging.
Isn't that right?

2104
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,190
- But we need that.
- We need that.

2105
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,470
- We need that.
- Yes.

2106
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:11,530
- It's kind of our pride.
- Yes.

2107
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,010
- We need things like that.
- That's right.

2108
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:14,240
And we get to decide
what to say anyway.

2109
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,440
- Be quiet.
- What?

2110
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,340
- Jae Suk.
- Be quiet.

2111
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,110
- You're loud though.
- We must focus on writing.

2112
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,880
- I was just telling him my opinion.
- Be quiet.

2113
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,320
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet.

2114
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,590
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

2115
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:26,650
Say something.

2116
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:27,760
What about me?

2117
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,920
- Say something.
- What about me?

2118
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,380
(The talk polarization is
being alleviated.)

2119
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,530
You should be quiet.

2120
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:36,130
- You should say something, okay?
- I was just telling him my opinion.

2121
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,670
- Okay.
- Share some airtime.

2122
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:38,970
Yes, share it.

2123
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,300
(They gladly share airtime
by the choice of others.)

2124
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,360
Before "Beyond Korea",

2125
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:43,610
I'm going to add "in no time".

2126
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:45,170
"In no time, beyond Korea..."

2127
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,710
"Worldwide, in no time..."

2128
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:48,510
I really want to write,
"At the height of".

2129
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,210
That's a really old expression.

2130
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,970
Who uses "At the height of"?

2131
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:53,670
- "At this time".
- It suits you.

2132
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,170
- It suits you.
- I'm going to add "In no time".

2133
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,610
(The pride of Korean variety shows,
Betrayal and plots)

2134
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:58,050
(A crazy psychological trap
which is beyond amazing)

2135
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:00,260
Everything got deleted.

2136
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,090
- Do something to bring it back.
- What?

2137
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,220
(Haha requests urgent help.)

2138
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,550
(It was restored safely
with Kwang Soo's "Ctrl" and "Z".)

2139
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,400
- That's it.
- I want to write,

2140
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,670
"psychological warfare".
What should I do?

2141
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,070
(He just has to click.)

2142
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:15,170
- How did you do that?
- Use this.

2143
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,240
Okay.

2144
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,630
This is already... Try this.

2145
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:18,970
How do you do this?
What is wrong?

2146
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:19,970
Like this.

2147
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,380
Click on the bottom.

2148
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,340
- Why won't it work?
- Oh, my.

2149
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,940
Suk Jin is touching
the laptop screen.

2150
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:28,840
What is wrong with him?

2151
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,010
Try doing this.

2152
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,220
(He's really doing it.)

2153
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,420
Why...

2154
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,090
Why won't this work?

2155
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,430
Okay, let's take a look.
Member introductions...

2156
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:39,060
I will start with Jae Suk then.

2157
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,490
(Member Introduction,
Yoo Jae Suk)

2158
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:43,300
I think something like
"True to the name" should be added.

2159
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,170
"True to the name,"

2160
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,430
- "he's the center of Running Man."
- That's good.

2161
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,640
What?

2162
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,010
It's about Jae Suk.

2163
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:51,360
You can't say it like that.

2164
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,680
Why can't I say it like that?

2165
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,480
- I thought like this.
- How?

2166
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,940
"Yoo Jae Suk's last program
facing his retirement in 2021."

2167
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,880
- What?
- What is wrong with him?

2168
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,350
"Yoo Jae Suk's last program
facing his retirement in 2021."

2169
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,720
(Yoo Jae Suk's last program
facing his retirement in 2021.)

2170
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,740
What did you say?

2171
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,780
(What?)

2172
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:07,220
What was that? Can he do that?

2173
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:09,850
What's wrong?
I wrote whatever I want to write.

2174
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:11,280
Wait and see what I write.

2175
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,390
(They get started on
their childish fight.)

2176
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,560
This is what I wrote for myself.

2177
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,430
"He's there.
What other explanation do you need?"

2178
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,640
Let me explain.

2179
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,430
"It will be his last program
in this life."

2180
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:27,430
("It will be his last program
in this life.")

2181
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,810
(It suddenly becomes
his last work.)

2182
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:32,220
- Necessary...
- "We hope he's happy there."

2183
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:36,720
(The member introduction
turns into a eulogy.)

2184
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,810
Jong Kook. Right.

2185
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,850
What should I write for Jong Kook?

2186
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:40,960
(She's very serious.)

2187
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,460
(Member Introduction)

2188
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,130
I briefly saw it.

2189
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:46,260
(It looks like
she's badmouthing him.)

2190
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,170
So that's
what you think of Jong Kook.

2191
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:50,690
I see.

2192
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,190
Okay, Ji Hyo.

2193
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,230
- All right.
- Okay.

2194
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:57,310
- It makes you badmouth people.
- Right?

2195
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,980
- This is hard.
- "Many celebrities join the show,"

2196
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,880
"playing games
and clearing missions together..."

2197
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,770
"while going around
to various places."

2198
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:06,480
"Especially..."

2199
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,610
- Are you still working on that?
- Yes.

2200
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,810
When will you write
the member introduction?

2201
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,850
You are still writing
the production objective?

2202
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:16,060
Just move on.

2203
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,130
I need to write it well.

2204
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:20,490
"Especially, this program is..."

2205
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,490
Do I have to write
Haha's nickname at the back?

2206
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:26,800
People call me Lee Jung Jae
and Cha Seung Won these days.

2207
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,430
Stop it. Stop calling yourself
Lee Jung Jae and Cha Seung Won.

2208
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:31,230
Their body proportions are
different from yours.

2209
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,180
That's just what people think.

2210
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,310
Who on earth are they?
Don't listen to what they say.

2211
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,270
You have to pay attention
to the criticisms.

2212
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:41,220
He's a true friend.
He's a true brother.

2213
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,310
When people leave comments
that you're handsome, don't listen.

2214
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:45,960
Fans always say
the nicest things.

2215
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,980
Haha, you are not handsome.

2216
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:50,230
"Kim Jong Kook, the gangster".

2217
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,820
This is a good one.

2218
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:56,020
"He's ugly, but he can't accept it."

2219
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,170
"His fans spoiled him."

2220
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,860
- Are you talking about Haha?
- Kwang Soo.

2221
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,030
- Me?
- Yes.

2222
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,400
How am I spoiled?

2223
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:04,100
"His fans..."

2224
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,400
(His fans spoiled him.)

2225
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,840
"His fans spoiled him."

2226
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,680
How do you like this, Ji Hyo?

2227
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,940
"We can't say that she gets
along well with the members,"

2228
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,440
"but we also can't say
that she doesn't."

2229
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,590
- I like it.
- I am being honest.

2230
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,610
- Do you like it?
- It's fine.

2231
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,980
She can get along with the members.

2232
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:23,730
- She can.
- Yes.

2233
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,800
All right. What's So Min's nickname?

2234
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,890
What about me?

2235
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,270
I have lots of nicknames.

2236
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,770
We have to give you a new nickname.

2237
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,190
(He's eager to come up
with a new nickname for her.)

2238
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:35,030
(Laughing)

2239
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:36,710
- Hey.
- You're bad at making up names.

2240
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:37,810
I am trying.

2241
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:40,810
What's So Min's character?

2242
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,710
Zombie Hair.

2243
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,550
Zombie IQ.

2244
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:48,520
If you don't have ideas,
just don't do it.

2245
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,590
(Laughing)

2246
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:52,590
You are so childish, Suk Jin.

2247
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,480
"Zombie IQ" is so childish.

2248
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,480
I told you. He can't
come up with nicknames.

2249
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:00,230
They are so bad
that I can't stand it.

2250
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:03,270
I am just brainstorming.

2251
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:05,020
- It's not annoying at all.
- I am not choosing them.

2252
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,560
- What?
- I am not choosing them.

2253
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,730
I'm just brainstorming.

2254
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:10,930
I think they are bad too.

2255
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:12,340
"Zombie IQ".

2256
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,570
It's not catchy. It's strange.

2257
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:19,180
I will write my honest opinion.

2258
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:20,180
We are all being honest.

2259
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,920
"Ji Suk Jin was going to leave
the team in the first year."

2260
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,110
(Ji Suk Jin was going to leave
the team in the first year.)

2261
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,350
Very honest.

2262
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,460
Is it necessary to say that there?

2263
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,560
Why would you write that?

2264
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,600
- We should just keep it to...
- "Ji Suk Jin..."

2265
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,760
Talk about that when you are
around the producer.

2266
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,860
- "Ji Suk Jin was going to..."
- The current producer doesn't mind.

2267
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,860
"leave the team in the first year."

2268
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:39,800
"But now he says
Running Man is the best,"

2269
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,490
"and people hate him for it."

2270
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,170
(But now he says
Running Man is the best,)

2271
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,230
(and people hate him for it.)

2272
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,640
It's like a letter.

2273
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,340
- Why would you write that?
- He said he would be honest.

2274
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,900
He said he would be honest,
and he is actually...

2275
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,510
- being very honest.
- I can do whatever I want.

2276
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:52,570
(He introduces the members
with the utmost honesty.)

2277
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,350
"Yang Se Chan. Ye Chan.
Yangsebastien."

2278
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:56,440
"Ye Chan" sounds cute.

2279
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:59,610
"Kim Jong Kook's Favorite Doll."

2280
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:03,460
"But he badmouths me
behind my back."

2281
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,930
(He's genuinely flustered.)

2282
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:09,630
Who...

2283
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:11,270
Who did you hear that from?

2284
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:13,840
That's not true.
Why would I badmouth you?

2285
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,810
"He's pretending to be innocent."

2286
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:19,140
"But once there's proof"...

2287
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:22,210
"But once there's proof,
I will kill him."

2288
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,310
(But once there's proof,
I will kill him.)

2289
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,270
(He declares war.)

2290
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,090
That's like writing a diary.

2291
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,110
That's...

2292
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:36,130
- Haha.
- You're writing about me just now?

2293
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:41,230
"Recently, he sent me..."

2294
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,890
"half-dried herring".

2295
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:44,890
(Recently, he sent me
half-dried herring.)

2296
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,340
- But...
- Isn't that a diary?

2297
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,730
You have to introduce the member.

2298
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:48,930
Why would you write about
him sending you half-dried herring?

2299
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,270
I have to give an update
on the latest news.

2300
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:53,530
I need to give an update
on the latest news.

2301
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:54,680
- This is unbelievable.
- Is that what...

2302
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:55,770
the member introduction
is supposed to be like?

2303
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:57,880
Hey, you have to
introduce the members.

2304
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,770
- I get to decide that.
- Why would you do that?

2305
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,270
- Come on out, Se Chan.
- Okay. Yangsebastien.

2306
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:03,480
Yes.

2307
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,590
I got distracted in the middle.

2308
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,060
Here's the production objective.

2309
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:12,560
"The eight people who grew up
on love will make you laugh."

2310
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,630
(Production objective)

2311
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:16,690
"Are you all ready to
laugh your hearts out?"

2312
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,130
Do you still use that expression?

2313
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,990
"As the old saying goes,"

2314
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:22,270
"'The fruits of studying hard
will show themselves later.'"

2315
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,600
"Do you all know that saying?"

2316
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,570
(The fruits of studying hard
will show themselves later.)

2317
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,810
"It means something good."

2318
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,980
"Korea's one and only
reality-variety show."

2319
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,780
"Open your eyes.
Fun on a big scale will come."

2320
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:37,680
"Open your mouth.
Laughter on a big scale will come."

2321
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:40,590
"Open your heart.
A great lesson will come."

2322
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:42,020
Bravo!

2323
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:44,060
- That's my objective.
- That's a good one.

2324
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,430
- Not bad at all.
- Hey,

2325
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:46,890
- I love it.
- It's the production objective.

2326
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:48,650
- It's very easy to grasp.
- It's simple.

2327
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,430
To show that I've watched
the previous episodes, I wrote,

2328
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:53,100
"'The fruits of studying hard
will show themselves later.'"

2329
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,360
- I love it.
- You did a really good job. Bravo.

2330
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:56,530
- Why are you so good?
- It's nice.

2331
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,530
I will introduce Jae Suk first.

2332
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,680
His nickname is "Crooked Teeth".

2333
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:03,550
"He's popular,
but he's actually the ugliest."

2334
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:06,220
"But with his gift of gab,
he tries hard to look handsome."

2335
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,550
"He's the greatest MC."

2336
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,050
- That's what I wrote.
- That's nice.

2337
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,850
That's...

2338
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:12,110
- how I introduced him.
- Right.

2339
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:15,110
Kwang Soo's nickname is
"A Class Actor Butler".

2340
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,230
"He doesn't care about
B Class actors."

2341
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,280
"He only cares about
A Class actors."

2342
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,590
What's wrong with him?

2343
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,960
How do I only care
about A Class actors?

2344
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,150
He doesn't care about
B Class actors.

2345
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:24,190
It's just a catchphrase.

2346
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:26,860
- What are you talking about?
- If people have seen this show...

2347
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,860
That's nice.

2348
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,710
What do you mean by
"Class A" and "Class B"?

2349
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,100
Next is Suk Jin.

2350
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:32,880
His nickname is "Eternal Youth".

2351
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:36,010
"Growing the long hair
on his ear to live long,"

2352
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:39,220
"he's a hard-working man
who is soon-to-be 60."

2353
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,440
(He's the man
who is soon-to-be-60.)

2354
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,480
Nice.

2355
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,890
- Nice.
- I don't have a long hair.

2356
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:45,550
- Nice.
- I don't have hair on my ear.

2357
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,650
Ji Hyo's nickname is
"Zoned-out Jeoktoma".

2358
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:49,520
"Gosh, I am sleepy.
What are you looking at?"

2359
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,760
"Why do you open
your eyes like that? Get away!"

2360
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,320
That's very simple.

2361
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,230
Those are the only things she says.

2362
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:56,730
Next is Jong Kook.

2363
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:58,100
He's "Protein Monster".

2364
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,690

That's nice.

2367
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,640
I make people uncomfortable

(Hey!)

2370
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:14,980

2378
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:28,800
"She's willing to be a loser,
get betrayed, and shave her head."

2379

2438
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:35,810
"Korea's best MC.
The nation's best MC, Yoo Jae Suk!"

2439
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:37,150
He wrote it well.

2440
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:38,230
(He's excited to hear his part.)

2441
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:39,280
He's flattering Jae Suk.

2442
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,850
"Ji Suk Jin."

2446
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,970
"He's the nation's old man,
Ji Suk Jin."

2447
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,730
- I'm not the nation's best MC.
- He's just an old man.

2448
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:51,930
- Am I just an old man?
- Great.

2449
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:53,510
Jae Suk is the nation's best MC.
Suk Jin is the nation's old man.

2450
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:54,530
"Song Ji Hyo."

2451

"She's a Jeoktoma
who wants to become a rock."

2452
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:58,100
"She doesn't want to do anything."

2453
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,640
"But she's the ace whose intuition
leads her team to victory."

2454
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,590
"She once had a crush on Haha..."

2455
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:05,310
"and was heartbroken."

2456
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:07,460
"But being a cool guy,
Haha asked her to be his sister."

2457
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:10,460
"Now, she and Haha are
the cutest Mapo Siblings."

2458
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:12,850
(This is how they became
brother and sister.)

2459
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:14,390
They are going to be a team!

2460
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,600
(They reaffirm their bond
only to show people.)

2461
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,670
You are crazy, aren't you?

2462

He's always up for anything."

2464
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:26,980
"It's true. He's kind-hearted
and sometimes introverted."

2465
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:30,310
"But he's a crazy man.
He is really crazy. I swear. He is."

2466
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,010
- That's true.
- He wrote "really" so much.

2467
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,270
- It's hard to describe him.
- So I'm just a crazy man.

2468
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,350
- There's nothing to write.
- That's when I got tired.

2469
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:39,050
Why would you swear
while introducing a member?

2470
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:40,590
"Jeon So Min."

2471
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:43,320
"She's the Crazy Poet. She's crazier
in the early mornings."

2472
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,180
"She went crazy last year,
but she hasn't come around yet."

2473
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:47,190
"But with her beautiful mind
and looks,"

2474
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:49,860
"she nearly made men's hearts race."

2475
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:52,300
"With her amazing character,
she is at the heart of the show."

2476
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,670

"He's got the strong appearance
that incapacitates many apps."

2480
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,640
"He makes us laugh."

2481
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,980
- "He makes us laugh hard."
- What is that?

2482
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:05,640
"With his amazing acting,
he makes everyone get absorbed."

2483
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,810
"Yang Se Hyeong is a master
of variety shows,"

2484
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:09,070
"and Se Chan is
Se Hyeong's brother."

2485
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:10,180
(Yang Se Hyeong is a master
of variety shows,)

2486
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,960
(and Se Chan is
Se Hyeong's brother.)

2487
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,310
"Honestly, he's so charming..."

2488
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,310
- "and funny."
- So suddenly?

2489
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:16,390
"Honestly, he's so charming..."

2490
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:17,430
- "and funny."
- So suddenly?

2491
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:18,780
"He's a good man. Se Chan,"

2492
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:19,960
- What are you doing?
- "I like you."

2493
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:22,260
- Why are you writing him a letter?
- "I'm sad you don't call often."

2494
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,730
- "I'm sad you don't call often."
- What are you doing?

2495
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:26,100
- "But I understand."
- Are you writing a letter?

2496
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:27,140
"You get what I mean, right?"

2497
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:30,210
"Let's drink. Call me. I love you.
Yes, man!"

2498
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:32,840
- Yes, man!
- Is it a letter or what?

2499
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,270
It's like a letter. I like it.
I'm touched.

2500
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:37,140
"Kim Jong Kook."

2501
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:39,570
"Grand Award winner.
He's the master variety show star."

2502
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:41,240
"Live life like Kim Jong Kook."

"He went from a gangster
to a Grand Award winner."

2504
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:45,480
(He went from a gangster
to a Grand Award winner.)

2505
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,020
"Let's look into his life,
which he completely turned around."

2506
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,390
(He went from a gangster
to a Grand Award winner.)

2507
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:50,820
(Laughing)

2508
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,760
(Laughing his heart out)

2509
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:55,460
"He's got a strong body and mind."

2510
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:59,130
"He goes to 'My Little Old Boy'
team dinners more. I hate him."

2511
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:00,640
- I love it.
- "But I love you."

2512
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,030
- "But I love you."
- Nice.

2513
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:03,930
He was afraid to upset Jong Kook,
so he said "I love you."

2514
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:06,680
Great.

2515
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,570

"Cha Seung Won in
the world of married couples."

2519
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:15,240

01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:17,110
- Nasty.
- "he leads Running Man."

2521
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:20,180
"He suddenly appears and disappears.
You never know what he'll do next."

2522
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:21,310
"He's cute and sexy."

2523
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,020
- He always...
- "It's crazy."

2524
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,980
"He's popular but humble."

2525
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,760
"Haha is cool enough to let
Jong Kook win the Grand Award."

2526
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,470
"What will he do next?"

2527
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:33,300
- What is that?
- He says that all the time.

2528
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:34,970
(Their production objective
presentations...)

2529
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:37,930
(are about to get even better.)

2530
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,680
(He's the Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong
who pretends to love his family.)

2531
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,310
(Ji Suk Jin,
the Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong)

2532
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:44,400
(He's burning the last embers
of his variety show star career.)

2533
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:45,900
(With the declaration of war,)

2534
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,550
(will the presentation
come to a devastating end?)

2535
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,310
(Over the production objective,)

2536
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,640
(they will laugh,)

2537
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,920
(cry,)

2538
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,060
(and get angry.)

2539
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:55,310
(It's the updating process
that contains all emotions.)

2540
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,930
(It's the fight between the one
who wants to be chosen...)

2541
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:58,280
(and the one who wants to stop him
at all costs.)

2542
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:01,300
(Will they be able to update
the production objective?)

2543
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,840
(Production Objective Race:
Running Man Rewritten 2)
