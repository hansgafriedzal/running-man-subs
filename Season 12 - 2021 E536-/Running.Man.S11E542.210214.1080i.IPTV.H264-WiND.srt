1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,030
(It's the last day
of the Lunar New Year holidays.)

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,400
Hello.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
(There will be Running Man
Neighborhood Athletic Meet.)

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,780
Hello.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,750
- Ha Do Kwon is here again.
- Right.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,510
- Really?
- I saw Do Kwon...

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,750
wandering around outside.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,110
He's dressed like a bully
not to lose again today.

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,740
He's dressed all in black.

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,920
I'm in charge of the cast.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,690
I pick them up.

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,720
And I bring them again
if I like them.

13
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,580
- Cool.
- This is exciting.

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,220
How much would I suffer today?

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,260
(How much would I suffer today?)

16
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,420
Gosh, Do Kwon is such
a troublesome guest.

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,230
- He doesn't want to lose.
- And we don't need to ask...

18
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,030
how he's been doing.

19
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,340
We should skip it.

20
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,930
I'm tired of seeing Do Kwon.

21
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,030
- I know.
- All right.

22
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,700
- Do we start right away?
- It's Suk Jin.

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,000
(The prankster mode is on.)

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,020
It's begun.

25
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,420
He started teasing Suk Jin.

26
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,710
Are we shooting it already?
What? What's going on?

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,490
(Suk Jin is denied from entering.)

28
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,130
I can't believe this. Hey!

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,630
Hello?

30
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,320
You can use
the other gate, Suk Jin.

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,320
(Thanks to the prankster,
he's come a long way.)

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,460
- Good.
- Hey.

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,730
What are you doing
from the beginning?

34
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,760
Gosh, he fell for that anyway.

35
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,730
Is it that you're not strong
enough to open it?

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,540
I didn't open it on purpose.
I don't want him to get hurt.

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,540
- Who'd get hurt?
- If I pulled it, you'd get hurt.

38
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,840
- No, I wouldn't.
- Yes, you would.

39
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,740
- That's not true.
- You would if I forced it open.

40
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,320
You couldn't come in
because you're weak.

41
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,150
I'm at least stronger than you.

42
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,920
- It's just that you're weak.
- I'm not as weak as you.

43
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,920
He's weak. He's so feeble.

44
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,180
Hello.

45
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,980
- Detective, we're here.
- Kwang Soo.

46
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,820
You're here to find the culprit.

47
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,350
- Detective Lee.
- Detective Macgyver.

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,870
I just got in here.

49
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,120
- You shouldn't be late.
- Am I late?

50
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,430
- Yes, you are.
- You're late.

51
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,260
- Chan Hee is waiting here.
- Hello.

52
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,070
Chan Hee was in captions...

53
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,870
- of TV shows from the 1980s.
- Really?

54
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,730
As Cameraman Kang Chan Hee.

55
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,740
Really? From the 1980s?

56
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,570
- Did anyone of you work in the 80s?
- No.

57
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,510
Do you even check captions?

58
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,150
I saw Chan Hee's name...

59
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,880
- when the credits rolled.
- Why do you check the credits?

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Where did you see it?

61
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,850
I saw his name
on "Humor, 1st Avenue".

62
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,480
- It's a very old show.
- "Humor, 1st Avenue"?

63
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,060
- My gosh.
- Do you still watch it?

64
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,820
I understand
you watched "Humor, 1st Avenue".

65
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,530
But why did you check the credits?

66
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,720
I should check the credits.

67
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,370
I tried to find Chan Hee's name,

68
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,220
- and it was right there.
- He must've been the youngest one.

69
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,870
He needs some hobbies.

70
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,370
- I think so.
- He has nothing to do.

71
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,560
- I'm enjoying my hobby in TV shows.
- What is it?

72
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,770
- You two.
- Is it what you're doing now?

73
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,500
I play tricks on you two.

74
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,030
That's my hobby.

75
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,610
- My goodness.
- Teasing Suk Jin.

76
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,840
I'm doing it right now.

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

78
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,020
- Okay.
- You're here.

79
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,150
They are Jong Kook and his gang.

80
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,150
You look taller.

81
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,180
Hello.

82
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,560
I'm wearing dress shoes today.

83
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,810
My goodness.

84
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,150
As I always say,

85
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,650
I rarely find a woman cheesy.

86
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,060
- But she's...
- Is she being cheesy again?

87
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,220
Gosh, So Min was like...

88
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,930
"Hello, Jae Suk."

89
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,340
(She said hello to Jae Suk...)

90
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,340
(and made a 180-degree turn.)

91
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,280
So Min is the first woman
whom I find cheesy.

92
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,400
- So Min, you look great today.
- Do I?

93
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,650
- I'm gaining weight these days.
- You look good.

94
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,280
I'm gaining weight too.
It's driving me crazy.

95
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,650
Why?

96
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,340
I... I...

97
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,440
- What's wrong?
- I've gained 4kg.

98
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,180
- Seriously?
- You gained a lot of weight.

99
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,390
Why are you being like that?

100
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,430
This is adorable.

101
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,860
- So cute.
- I'm serious.

102
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,430
You look cute, Haha.

103
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,190
Your shoulders should be broader.

104
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,190
But they look narrower.

105
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,220
They are slanting.

106
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,240
Your face is getting bigger.

107
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,960
You need some safety pins.
Your shirt would slip down.

108
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,470
- Be confident.
- I think we're done.

109
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,310
It's done.

110
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,370
(He's done talking.)

111
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
- I'm so into at-home exercise now.
- Really?

112
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,620
It's crazy.

113
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,620
- I can't see it though.
- Have you been working out?

114
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,710
My muscles are so...

115
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,390
My gosh. Show me your hand.

116
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,360
My goodness.

117
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,210
- What was that?
- Hey.

118
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,720
What is he doing?

119
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
I didn't know he'd hit me.

120
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,900
- I'm sorry.
- Don't do that to him.

121
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,460
- I'm sorry.
- He's almost 60.

122
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,530
I'm so sorry, Suk Jin.

123
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,960
- Hey, don't say that.
- Hey.

124
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,460
- Stop it.
- He's almost 60.

125
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,140
- Stop saying that.
- He's almost 60.

126
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,340
- People would believe that.
- I'm sorry.

127
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,610
I really mean it.

128
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,740
I just did it instinctively.

129
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,680
He's a living legend
of variety shows.

130
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,080
- He's 60.
- He will be 60 soon.

131
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,740
- We have only four years left.
- My gosh.

132
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,900
- We should throw him a party.
- This is crazy.

133
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,110
- It's really good.
- We don't usually...

134
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,740
see our guests in the parking lot.

135
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,440
But Do Kwon kept walking around...

136
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,090
- with his hands in his pockets.
- I know.

137
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,740
He tried to show that he's here.

138
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,390
It feels like he's our member.

139
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,960
Today, to celebrate
Lunar New Year's Day,

140
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,200
we will have 2021 Running Man
Neighborhood Athletic Meet.

141
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,030
And we have...

142
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,030
special guests
from "The Penthouse"...

143
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,290
who're here to participate
in the athletic meet.

144
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,770
Please come on in.

145
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,400
- It's Do Kwon.
- Who are they?

146
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,360
(More heroes
from "The Penthouse")

147
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,250
(Yoon Jong Hun,
Ha Do Kwon, Park Eun Seok)

148
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,840
(Yoon Jong Hun is the new icon
of sickly sexy charm.)

149
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,980
(He married Cheon Seo Jin
for money and power.)

150
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,520
(He showed the best performance
of his career playing Ha Yoon Chul.)

151
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,480
(He brought chaos to everyone
playing a double role.)

152
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,000
(Park Eun Seok played
a rustic PE teacher, Gu Ho Dong...)

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,460
(and an American
millionaire, Logan Lee.)

154
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,570
(An immoral music teacher
who would do anything...)

155
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,140
(for money and power,
Ha Do Kwon)

156
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,670
(You don't know your place,
and you're fearless.)

157
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,880
(He didn't know his place,
and he was fearless last time.)

158
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,040
(He got knocked out right away.)

159
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,710
(Do Kwon got
his shirt ripped off...)

160
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,650
(and suffered a humiliating defeat.)

161
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,980
(Then he came back with
the 3 actresses of "The Penthouse".)

162
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,900
(He challenged Jong Kook
face-to-face.)

163
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,400
(He fought
Jong Kook face-to-face...)

164
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,860
(and got knocked out again.)

165
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,070
(He was even defeated by Kwang Soo,
the assassin on the chin-up bar.)

166
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,210
(Do Kwon is officially
Running Man's clumsy guest.)

167
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,010
- Hello.
- Hello.

168
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,170
- Do Kwon.
- Hey.

169
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,970
You've lost weight.

170
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,410
Hey, Jong Hun.

171
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,320
Jong Hun, stand in the middle.

172
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,090
Nice to meet you.

173
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,150
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.

174
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

175
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,890
(Ha Do Kwon, Park Eun Seok,
Yoon Jong Hun)

176
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,890
Hey, Do Kwon.

177
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,550
"The Penthouse" is...

178
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,790
the only drama I watched
in the past five years.

179
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,150
- What?
- I watched all the episodes.

180
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,360
- You watched "Sky Castle" too.
- You watched "Sky Castle".

181
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,770
- What about "Sky Castle"?
- Stop it.

182
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,230
It's been more than
five years, right?

183
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,160
- No.
- It hasn't been five years.

184
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,070
And you recently watched "Voice".

185
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,570
- I watched "Voice".
- You watched a lot of dramas.

186
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,080
You also watched
"The Uncanny Counter".

187
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,800
Right. He watched
"The Uncanny Counter".

188
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,580
- There are a lot.
- You have a lot of free time.

189
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,280
- Why is he lying?
- I stopped watching it.

190
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,380
But I watched all the episodes
of "The Penthouse".

191
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,890
As Suk Jin grows older,
he says more lies.

192
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,910
- My gosh.
- He's becoming good at it.

193
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,460
- He's improving a lot.
- He's still improving.

194
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,260
We can't talk about anything
without Suk Jin.

195
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,760
It seems like you're
acquainted with Ji Hyo.

196
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,000
How do you know each other?

197
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,630
- Did you do a drama together?
- Has it been about seven years?

198
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,660
14 years?

199
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,400
- It's been longer than that.
- You know what?

200
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,440
Those who are acquainted
with Ji Hyo look...

201
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,140
- They feel awkward.
- They look really awkward.

202
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,640
She's really cold.

203
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,100
It'd be better for him
to pretend not to know her.

204
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,400
And to be honest,

205
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,540
Jong Hun seems to know Ji Hyo,

206
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,340
but Ji Hyo doesn't seem
to remember him.

207
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,040
- Isn't that it?
- No. I know him.

208
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
What happened seven years ago?

209
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,280
When guests ask her...

210
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,890
about when they first met,

211
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,980
Ji Hyo just stands still.

212
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,590
It seems like
she can't hear anything.

213
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,920
She doesn't remember anything.

214
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,090
By the way,

215
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,850
I was surprised
to see Eun Seok's age.

216
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,850
Are you 38?

217
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,220
- Yes. We are the same age.
- He's older than me.

218
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,590
- Jong Hun is also older than me.
- Right.

219
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,960
- Eun Seok...
- Are they older than me?

220
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,230
They look so young.

221
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,400
I almost made a mistake again.

222
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,400
I was going to ask
how old they were.

223
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,900
He almost made a mistake.

224
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,530
He often makes mistakes.

225
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,440
- It's okay. Do as you please.
- I'm sorry.

226
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,040
Suk Jin.

227
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,170
Eun Seok is the one
who looks young for his age.

228
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,020
I didn't say
I look young for my age.

229
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,320
- I was being quiet.
- Don't be upset.

230
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,040
Suk Jin, don't sulk.

231
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,210
He always says...

232
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,550
- people think he's in his 30s.
- He only...

233
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,280
dresses like a young man.
Only his outfit.

234
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,720
- Hey.
- But inside the outfit...

235
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,130
- Only his outfit is young.
- I'm still fresh.

236
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,150
Only his outfit.

237
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,660
Do Kwon brought his friends today.

238
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,900
He's so determined to win.

239
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,090
Why is he determined?

240
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,160
- Do Kwon.
- Do Kwon...

241
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,770
- brought his friends who are tough.
- Do Kwon.

242
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,510
Are you here
to defeat Jong Kook again?

243
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,100
I don't want anything today.

244
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,800
I really don't.

245
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,380
- I'm here to defeat Se Chan.
- Why me?

246
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,040
- He's lowered his goal.
- It's a lot lower.

247
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,470
He brought down the goal.

248
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,840
He brought it down.

249
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,880
I won't stay still.

250
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,110
Do Kwon is here...

251
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,590
as our guest today,

252
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,190
- but he's like our member.
- He's like our family.

253
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,830
He was here with So Yeon
and other actresses last time.

254
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,480
Are you here as a link...

255
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,850
between "The Penthouse"
and our show?

256
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,270
I'm like your guide.

257
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,270
(Call me a guide.)

258
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,660
- Like an agency.
- It's an agency.

259
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,940
- This time...
- He's an agency.

260
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,100
He's doing this
to get some commission.

261
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,340
- He's dressed like an agent today.
- Right.

262
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,670
- I'm like their guardian.
- Okay.

263
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:38,070
Did you know that Do Kwon
isn't his real name?

264
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,170
- What?
- It's not his real name.

265
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,750
- What are you talking about?
- His real name is...

266
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,940
- His real name is Kim Yong Gu.
- What?

267
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,150
- Yong Gu?
- Yong Gu.

268
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,020
Yong Gu sounds a lot better.

269
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,220
- Yong Gu?
- Yong Gu sounds perfect.

270
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,550
It sounds perfect for you.

271
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,450
- I like the name.
- Yong Gu sounds good.

272
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,650
Yong Gu sounds
better than Ha Do Kwon.

273
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,900
- Yong Gu is better.
- I agree.

274
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,920
I thought...

275
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,450
his name didn't sound right.

276
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,870
Yong Gu is better.

277
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,630
If we went to school together,

278
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,560
I would've called him Young Gu.

279
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,740
(Disappointed)

280
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,770
Yong Gu.

281
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,930
Is your family name Kim?

282
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,560
- He's Kim.
- He's Kim.

283
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,010
- He likes it.
- And he lives in Anyang.

284
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,140
He likes it.

285
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,170
- He's like your immediate family.
- Immediate family?

286
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,910
- Immediate family?
- That sounds nice.

287
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,380
Today, to celebrate
Lunar New Year's Day,

288
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,780
we will have 2021 Running Man...

289
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,810
Athletic Meet with the athletes
from each neighborhood.

290
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,360
And you guys are great athletes
who represent your neighborhood.

291
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,450
The three athletes with the most
trophy stamps will win the prizes.

292
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,530
And the one
with the fewest stamps...

293
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,400
and a person
selected by the last...

294
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,560
will get a penalty.

295
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,510
The last gets to pick
one person again.

296
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,610
I should be nice to the last then.

297
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,510
You will be doing
missions in three teams.

298
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,480
And each team has...

299
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,620
a member of lightweight,
middleweight, and heavyweight each.

300
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,850
Since this is the athletic meet,

301
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,750
each team is named...

302
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,650
after the hometown
of their lightweight member.

303
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,910
The lightweight member?

304
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,990
First, the lightweight member
of Team Gyeongsang.

305
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,150
Song Ji Hyo, the daughter of Pohang.

306
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,260
(The lightweight member
of Team Gyeongsang is Ji Hyo.)

307
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,400
She's in Team Gyeongsang.

308
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,820
What's that dance?

309
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
Is she doing it right?

310
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,160
And...

311
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,900
the lightweight member
of Team Gyeonggi.

312
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,110
Jeon So Min, the flower of Goyang.

313
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,110
(The lightweight member
of Team Gyeonggi is So Min.)

314
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,610
She's so cheesy.

315
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,880
(She likes the nickname,
the flower of Goyang.)

316
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,010
So Min is...

317
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,440
After a long time...

318
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,880
What?

319
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,040
- Just say I'm pretty.
- Is she cheesy?

320
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,890
- I can't bring myself to say that.
- Why not?

321
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,360
- Isn't it what you want to say?
- He forced himself to say that.

322
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,810
I just can't say it.

323
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,280
The lightweight member
of Team Gangwon.

324
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,650
Ji Suk Jin, the son of Jeongseon.

325
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,030
Is he from Gangwon Province?

326
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,760
People in Jeongseon
don't know him though.

327
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,900
I know. He doesn't seem
like a person from Jeongseon.

328
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,530
His profile on a portal says
he's from Gangwon Province.

329
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,430
I'm the son of Jeongseon.

330
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,930
But people in Jeongseon
have no idea.

331
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,200
I think they just pretend
not to know him.

332
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,980
I came to Seoul when I was three.

333
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,300
(Lightweight, Team Gyeongsang,
Team Gyeonggi, Team Gangwon)

334
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,850
Now I'll name the middleweight
members of each team.

335
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,720
Yang Se Chan of Team Gyeongsang.

336
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,850
I'm from Dongducheon.

337
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,580
- You just belong to the team.
- Is that my team?

338
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,410
- You're like a mercenary.
- I'm a mercenary.

339
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,390
Haha of Team Gyeonggi.

340
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,650
Yes!

341
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,890
You should look at me.
Why aren't you looking at me?

342
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,360
- I was confused.
- You should look at me.

343
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,530
The next member of Team Gangwon
is Jae Suk.

344
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,320
I'm on Team Gangwon?

345
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,790
- Team Gangwon.
- Come here.

346
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,930
I'm from Seoul.

347
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,530
(Middleweight: Yang Se Chan,
Haha, Yoo Jae Suk)

348
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,900
Gosh, I don't like this.

349
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,970
Next up is Kwang Soo
on Team Gyeongsang.

350
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,300
(Kwang Soo is the heavyweight
player on Team Gyeongsang.)

351
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,750
- Do Kwon is on Team Gyeonggi.
- Team Gyeonggi?

352
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,170
- Jong Kook is on Team Gangwon.
- Me?

353
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,250
- Hey, Jong Kook!
- I'm on that team?

354
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,480
- Hey, Jong Kook!
- It's game over.

355
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,120
- I'm on that team?
- Jong Kook, come join us.

356
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,350
- My gosh.
- All right.

357
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,520
- Hey.
- Come with me.

358
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,950
- Hey, it's game over.
- We'll win.

359
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,920
- That team is too strong.
- That team is too strong.

360
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,030
- It's game over.
- Yes, we'll definitely win.

361
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,100
- We'll definitely win.
- I'll go through a hard time.

362
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
- Who is on our team again?
- We'll win.

363
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,290
- On Team Gyeongsang? Gosh.
- This team?

364
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
(Heavyweight: Lee Kwang Soo
on Team Gyeongsang)

365
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,970
(Ha Do Kwon on Team Gyeonggi)

366
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,030
(Kim Jong Kook on Team Gangwon)

367
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,930
- Okay. That's good.
- What about them?

368
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,010
What about those two?

369
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,670
Eun Seok and Jong Hun
who do not belong...

370
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,880
- to any of the teams...
- What happens to them?

371
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,440
are hooligans whose abilities
haven't been verified...

372
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,810
on Running Man
and who are aiming to win.

373
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,310
- "Hooligans"?
- As hooligans, you two...

374
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,180
get to choose which team to join...

375
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,950
and carry out the missions
on the team of your choice.

376
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,150
However, the teams
with these two hooligans...

377
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,900
will have a disadvantage.

378
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,320
Regardless of the rankings,

379
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,920
one of the members of the team
won't get any trophy stamps.

380
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,970
- 1 of the team members?
- Just 1 member?

381
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,470
For example, Jong Hun joins
your team,

382
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,430
only 3 of you get stamps
while 1 of you can't get any.

383
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,070
- It's the same for Eun Seok.
- It's a double-edged sword.

384
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,010
Meanwhile, the team with no hooligan
will obtain double stamps.

385
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,150
- It's better without a hooligan.
- Exactly.

386
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,650
However, you can send the hooligan
to another team after a mission.

387
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,580
The hooligans can appoint
someone else as a hooligan...

388
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,810
and become a member of the team...

389
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,450
after each mission.

390
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,760
In short, after each mission,
the hooligans can change,

391
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,130
- and the team members can change.
- We may become a hooligan?

392
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,150
Yes, that's possible.

393
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,970
Now, Eun Seok and Jong Hun,

394
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,930
please choose a team
to join for the first mission.

395
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,060
Can you give us a hint
about the mission?

396
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,330
A hint about the mission.

397
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,330
It requires strength, knowledge,
and speed.

398
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,880
We need knowledge too?
This is an athletic meet.

399
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,330
- Knowledge?
- Knowledge?

400
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,850
- We have a chance to win.
- Listen.

401
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,540
- We're all airheads.
- I'm serious.

402
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,020
- All three of us are.
- No. We can win this.

403
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,150
- They have no hope.
- They're hopeless.

404
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,890
- How could you say that?
- But they...

405
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,950
They're just like you guys.

406
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,650
Do Kwon completes the team.

407
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,390
- The team became complete...
- Hey, he graduated from SNU.

408
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,190
- as he joined it.
- Oh, right. He went to SNU.

409
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,690
- He went to SNU.
- Okay.

410
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,660
- Jong Hun, choose your team.
- Okay.

411
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,270
Since I've met him before,

412
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,740
- I'll join Jae Suk's team.
- Okay!

413
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,640
- Okay!
- Hold on. You've met Ji Hyo too.

414
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,930
- That doesn't even count?
- He's met both of them.

415
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,400
- Did you two really meet?
- He's met...

416
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,740
both of them.

417
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,070
But he told us about how he met
Ji Hyo seven years ago.

418
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,720
- Jong Hun, welcome to my team.
- I bet it's because of Jong Kook.

419
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,410
- It's not like that.
- He made his own choice.

420
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,180
- We starred on "Busted!" as well.
- That's right.

421
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,280
- Come here. We worked together.
- Oh, I didn't know that.

422
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,150
- But... Ji Hyo, you should get mad.
- No.

423
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,990
Eun Seok, choose your team.

424
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,630
Hey, it's been a long time.
Come on. All right.

425
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,730
(He tried to attract him
with his poor English.)

426
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,970
- Let's have a bowl of gukbap.
- Please join our team.

427
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,530
(He chose Team Gyeonggi
despite Se chan's effort.)

428
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,600
This is great.

429
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,060
- Really?
- Okay.

430
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,970
- All right. Bring it on.
- It's okay.

431
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,830
- We'll get double stamps if we win.
- It's a good thing. Double stamps.

432
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,900
We'll win the first game
no matter what.

433
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,400
Let's do some quizzes
in the first game.

434
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,780
Now, we'll move to
the first mission location.

435
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,750
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Come on.

436
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,520
(They'll move to the 1st mission
location!)

437
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,940
You're all full of energy as always.

438
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,020
(The 1st venue of 2021 Running
Man Neighborhood Athletic Meet)

439
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,490
What's that?
What are "Combat" and "Answer"?

440
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,390
I guess we'll do
some quizzes as well.

441
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,450
You think?

442
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,030
Do Kwon, you're not on our team.

443
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,650
I want to stay close
to the powerful men.

444
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,400
(He figured out who had power
after 3 appearances on the show.)

445
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,470
I heard that you've been
shooting the drama.

446
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,270
- "The Penthouse".
- Yes, the second season.

447
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,300
("'The Penthouse' Season 2
to Premiere on February 19")

448
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,740
You must be excited.

449
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,800
(To the halfhearted comment,)

450
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Yes, I am.

451
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,330
(he gave a halfhearted reply.)

452
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,400
It must be nice to get to play
in another season without a break.

453
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,070
- Of course, it's nice.
- It's the best in this era.

454
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,410
You see, I appeared in a drama
written by Writer Kim Soon Ok too.

455
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,020
- You said you got a compliment too.
- You know that, right?

456
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,150
Of course.

457
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,780
- Say hello to her for me.
- In what drama?

458
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,030
In what drama did you appear?

459
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,390
"My Daughter Geum Sa Wol".

460
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,150
- Oh, right. I remember that.
- Yes.

461
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,500
I played a cameo role.

462
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,420
The writer complimented me
for my performance.

463
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,660
(He's bragging about
getting a compliment from her.)

464
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,060
I'm sure she complimented you
as she would never see you again.

465
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,870
- Hey.
- That's what people do.

466
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,640
Do you want me to talk about
"The Producers"?

467
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,110
- You want me to talk about it?
- I got a compliment too.

468
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,440
I stopped by there.

469
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,070
It's so cold.

470
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,480
- Suk Jin, what's wrong?
- Nothing. I was joking around.

471
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,650
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

472
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,990
I tried to tap her on the head,

473
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,220
but failed.

474
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,780
- You failed to pull a prank on her?
- I meant to tap here. Yes.

475
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,030
- Because I sat down?
- Yes.

476
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,450
You felt that a little bit, right?

477
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,190
- Suk Jin, your fists are so soft.
- What?

478
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,920
Suk Jin, why would you
act so tough?

479
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,300
(He's picking a fight with So Min
who's an easy target.)

480
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,140
He does that only to me.
He can't do it to anyone else.

481
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,170
(The 2 of them are equally weak.)

482
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,200
I'll explain the rules now.

483
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,380
Through the first mission,

484
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,980
we'll find the best person
in each weight class.

485
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,390
It's Quiz for Each Class.

486
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,760
- We'll do a quiz from the start?
- Quiz for Each Class.

487
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,910
(A quiz from the beginning?)

488
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,080
- Okay. Here go the airheads.
- Look at her face.

489
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,890
- Ji Hyo seems worried again.
- Oh, my.

490
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,760
- The airhead trio.
- Don't worry, Ji Hyo.

491
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,000
- Let's give it a try.
- Ji Hyo will get a lot of air time.

492
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,560
You will have a match against
the other teams' members...

493
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,870
in the same weight class as you,

494
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,200
and the hooligans will have a match
against each other.

495
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,010
- You have to solve quizzes.
- Okay.

496
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,070
The first person who presses
the buzzer gets to answer.

497
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,610
If you get it right in 5 seconds,
you win 5 points.

498
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,810
But if you say a wrong answer,
you lose one point.

499
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,650
Then we shouldn't press it
unless we're sure.

500
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,860
- Exactly. You may lose one point.
- We'd better not press it.

501
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,150
- But you may also win 5 points.
- 5 points.

502
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,600
If you're not sure about the answer,

503
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,530
press the buzzer
and when your turn comes,

504
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,160
you can choose "Combat".

505
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
- "Combat"?
- Yes.

506
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,740
After you pick up the combat picket,
as soon as another person...

507
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,400
picks up the combat picket,

508
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,060
the three players start
Name Tag Elimination.

509
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,670
(Once another person chooses it,
Name Tag Elimination begins.)

510
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,830
- Name Tag Elimination?
- It begins right away?

511
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,940
Yes, right away. In other words,
when 2 of the 3 players...

512
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,070
give up on the quiz...

513
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,410
- and choose "Combat",
- We can choose the game.

514
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,120
you'll hear the bell ringing.
Then you may begin the game.

515
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,280
You will win two points
for each name tag you rip off.

516
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,620
- For each name tag?
- Yes.

517
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,200
I bet there will only be combats
to the end.

518
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,790
- I guess...
- Combat is the only way.

519
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,000
we'll continue fighting
all day long.

520
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,090
There will be only combats
and no answers.

521
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,030
Ji Hyo, let's just
rip off their name tags.

522
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,770
Right away.

523
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,710
The hooligans will have a match
against each other...

524
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,030
- and one member of Team Gyeongsang.
- I see.

525
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,910
- The hooligans and one of them.
- Okay.

526
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,680
- The first round...
- Let's start with the lightweight.

527
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Go, So Min!

528
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,340
- Go, Ji Hyo!
- Go, Suk Jin!

529
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,020
By the way, I got lucky
to have a match with them.

530
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,550
Exactly. You got so lucky.

531
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,580
I feel so confident. I can take off
their name tags easily.

532
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,090
- They might join their forces.
- Then it won't be easy.

533
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,360
You can work with Ji Hyo
to rip off his name tag first.

534
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,970
They can't do that
even if they join their forces.

535
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,890
- Are you sure?
- I've been working out at home.

536
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,100
Go, Song Jeoktoma! Pick up Combat
unless you're confident.

537
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,270
Put "Answer" down.
Why would you even hold it?

538
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,280
Ji Hyo, hold only "Combat",
not "Answer".

539
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,840
- Don't worry about the rules.
- Are you sure?

540
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,640
- They just do whatever they want.
- I see.

541
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,750
Oh, my. Do Kwon just told
Eun Seok...

542
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,750
not to worry about the rules
saying we do whatever we want.

543
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,660
- Do Kwon, we do have rules.
- We follow the rules.

544
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,050
- You crossed the line.
- We have our own rules.

545
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,290
I believed what he said
without a doubt. "Oh, I see."

546
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,760
(The cast members of Running Man
do follow the rules.)

547
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,270
- Here's your first question.
- Okay.

548
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,860
The first question is
regarding sports.

549
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,970
- That's nice.
- Oh, no.

550
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,560
- This is perfect for us to win.
- This is good for us.

551
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,970
- Good.
- I should be there instead of him.

552
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,270
(He seems confident.)

553
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,480
Oh, no. I know nothing about sports.

554
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,300
We're allowed to tell her
the answer, right?

555
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,840
No. We're not allowed to do that.

556
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,480
- We shouldn't tell her?
- Of course, we shouldn't.

557
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,040
- He's acting like he knows all.
- Why?

558
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,250
He said, "We can just
tell her the answer."

559
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,760
What kind of rule is that?

560
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,160
- You can't tell her the answer.
- Of course, you can't.

561
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,760
I was saying that we're not
allowed to do it.

562
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,230
If you tell your team member
the answer, your team loses a point.

563
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,500
Of course, it's not allowed.

564
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,000
Worry about yourself, will you?

565
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,230
Here goes the first question.

566
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,670
- In basketball,
- Basketball?

567
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,910
what is the best bench player
called?

568
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,010
You don't know the answer?

569
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,870
- If you don't know this...
- Gosh. How...

570
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,800
Press the buzzer
if you know the answer.

571
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,980
- A sixth man.
- Oh, right.

572
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,780
(The answer is "sixth man".)

573
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,640
(She has never heard of it.)

574
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,780
Press the buzzer
if you know the answer.

575
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,310
- Pick up "Answer".
- Go ahead.

576
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,660
- An ace.
- Gosh.

577
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,550
You lost one point.

578
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,660
Is there a points deduction too?

579
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,080
- Why don't they know this?
- Yes.

580
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,350
- Oh, right.
- Go ahead.

581
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,620
- A bench ace.
- Gosh.

582
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,290
You lost one point.

583
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,290
In basketball?

584
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,820
(In that case...)

585
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,240
An ace bench.

586
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,300
"Ace bench"?

587
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,830
(No one has ever heard
the expression "ace bench".)

588
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,240
- "Ace bench"?
- Ji Hyo.

589
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,740
This is frustrating.

590
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,010
(So Min raised "Combat"!)

591
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,250
So Min raised "Combat".
If one of them chooses it too...

592
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,420
(If 1 more person chooses it, they
can start Name Tag Elimination.)

593
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,340
(If 2 of the 3 raise "Combat",
Name Tag Elimination begins.)

594
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,950
If one of them chooses it too...

595
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,720
(Ji Hyo chose to combat.)

596
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,660
(Name Tag Elimination begins.)

597
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,260
(What? Wait.)

598
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,700
- Go, Ji Hyo!
- Rip it off!

599
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,170
Ji Hyo, don't let her rip it off.

600
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,530
(Screaming)

601
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,890
(Because of
the unexpectedly exciting fight,)

602
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,440
(some people in the audience
are about to faint.)

603
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,970
You should be the one to rip it off!

604
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,870
- They're so scary.
- Don't let her do that!

605
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,600
You should be the one to rip it off!

606
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,680
- Don't let her do that!
- Gosh, no.

607
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,720
(Both ripped his name tag off.)

608
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,540
(Ji Hyo ripped it off
before So Min did!)

609
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,660
- That doesn't count.
- What's this?

610
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,850
- You two should keep fighting.
- We won two points!

611
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,380
- It's not over yet.
- Ji Hyo.

612
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,380
- Why do I have two name tags?
- Rip So Min's off too.

613
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,660
- Rip So Min's name tag off now.
- Rip it off!

614
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,620
- It's "sixth man".
- Oh, is that the answer?

615
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,230
- It's not over yet.
- Ji Hyo.

616
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,620
Rip So Min's name tag off.

617
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,390
- Should I...
- Rip her name tag off.

618
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,940
- You can do this!
- We'll win four points.

619
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,010
(It's a match
between Ji Hyo and So Min!)

620
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,830
(Precious Sisters haven't had
a match in a long time.)

621
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,940
Go, So Min!

622
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,440
(Ji Hyo will win 4 points if she
rips So Min's name tag off too.)

623
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,010
You can do this, So Min!

624
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,450
Hey, what's the matter? So Min!

625
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,420
- Hey, So Min!
- Ji Hyo, let's go!

626
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,690
(While they were waiting for
a chance, So Min attacked first!)

627
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,260
- Put them under the armpits.
- Go, Ji Hyo!

628
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,520
I said, put them under the armpits.

629
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,160
Song Jeoktoma, show us
what you can do!

630
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,320
(It's becoming even more exciting
after Suk Jin got eliminated.)

631
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,660
(He got eliminated a while ago.)

632
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,120
Gosh. They're unbelievable.

633
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,560
Push her hands away first.

634
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,430
Rip it off no matter what.
That's good!

635
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,390
(Ji Hyo grabbed
So Min's name tag first!)

636
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,670
(But So Min grabbed Ji Hyo's
shortly after that.)

637
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,780
(They're grabbing
each other's name tag!)

638
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,040
(Who will be the winner
of the match?)

639
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,540
(Ji Hyo wins.)

640
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,750
- That's good.
- Oh, my.

641
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,110
- Nice, four points.
- When did you rip that off?

642
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,280
(That was so close.)

643
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
- Team Gyeongsang won four points.
- Song Jeoktoma is the best!

644
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,580
(Team Gyeongsang gained 4 points
as Ji Hyo won.)

645
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,160
- She's so good at this.
- She practically played with her.

646
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,170
So Min, when can I see you
defeat her?

647
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,290
At least once before I die.

648
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,910
The answer was sixth man.
It was easy.

649
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,970
- Did you know the answer?
- That doesn't matter.

650
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,600
- Everyone in the world knows it.
- I didn't know.

651
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,910
- Why didn't you know sixth man?
- I didn't know.

652
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,780
You should get the right answer.
Or else, you can't win.

653
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,100
Earn your keep, will you?

654
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,250
All right. I heard you.

655
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,720
Seriously, I was... Hey!

656
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,080
I declare hard on you.

657
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,490
"I declare hard on you"?

658
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,420
(I declare hard on you?)

659
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,880
What was that?

660
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,760
- You mean, you declare war on her.
- What does that even mean?

661
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,490
- I'll explain what he meant.
- Hey, I will...

662
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,660
It's when a person who went through
hard times declares war...

663
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
- on someone else.
- Exactly.

664
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,930
- Correct.
- That's what it means.

665
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,390
So Min, I won't go easy on you
anymore.

666
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,240
Suk Jin, please don't
go easy on me.

667
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,790
Here goes your second question.

668
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,600
This is used as an indicator of...

669
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,170
- a country's standard of living...
- Let me answer.

670
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Go ahead.

671
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,710
(Suk Jin pressed the buzzer
even before the question ended.)

672
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,370
- Engel's coefficient.
- Good.

673
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,640
It's called Engel's coefficient.

674
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
(It's called Engel's coefficient.)

675
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,380
(That wasn't the question.)

676
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,550
Don't be flippant!

677
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,280
- Don't be a know-it-all.
- What was that?

678
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,850
- Don't be a know-it-all.
- That wasn't the question.

679
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,760
- You didn't know.
- Why were you being so flippant?

680
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,930
- It wasn't like that.
- Gosh. Don't be so flippant.

681
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,790
- Gosh, seriously.
- Why were you being so flippant?

682
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,790
It wasn't the answer?

683
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,170
Don't be so arrogant.

684
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,740
Don't be a know-it-all.

685
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,530
- I can't believe him.
- I thought I got it right.

686
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,800
Okay. Continue.

687
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Only So Min and Ji Hyo get to
press the buzzer now.

688
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,130
Why would you do that?

689
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,480
Engel's coefficient is...

690
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,510
the proportion of this...

691
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,540
to the total expenditure.

692
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,780
- Let me answer.
- They get to do it first.

693
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,920
You don't have a chance now.

694
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,380
- This is driving me nuts.
- Gosh.

695
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,760
What is this?

696
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,930
I'm so frustrated. Gosh.

697
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,160
(Frustrated)

698
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,380
"The cost of something"?

699
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,050
They said it's GOP.
Or is it GDP? GDP?

700
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,790
Ji Hyo, the answer is GDP.

701
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,230
- GOP or GDP.
- It's GDP.

702
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,270
Trust me.

703
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,590
So it's what people spend
the most money on...

704
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,390
It's the cost of something.

705
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,410
(The answer is
the cost of something.)

706
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,010
- "A cost"?
- Yes. The cost of something.

707
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,280
It's an English word, right?

708
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,300
Isn't it an abbreviation?
I mean, the first letters...

709
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,680
- It's the cost of something.
- "The cost of something"?

710
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,110
Oh, this is...

711
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,250
So Min, it's what you think is
the most important thing in life.

712
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,340
- The largest proportion...
- Go ahead.

713
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,760
The cost of love.

714
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,920
(The cost of love?)

715
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,690
- What?
- All you care about is love?

716
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,580
- He said it's my favorite thing.
- I can answer now, right?

717
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,080
- My favorite thing...
- Ji Hyo...

718
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,200
Challenge them to combat.

719
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,290
You can choose combat
if you don't know the answer.

720
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,770
- Choose combat.
- Five.

721
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,170
(Song Jeoktoma chose combat.)

722
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,170
(So Min chose combat too.)

723
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,970
(The combat begins!)

724
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,060
(Suk Jin is targeting only So Min.)

725
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,100
Come here.

726
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,800
Wait. Wait a second.

727
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Ji Hyo, wait there.

728
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,450
Suk Jin, why are you
targeting So Min?

729
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,800
Ji Hyo, help her
rip his name tag off.

730
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,910
- Wait there.
- Ji Hyo.

731
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,180
- Rip it off.
- Wait.

732
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,840
- Ji Hyo, help her out.
- Just wait there.

733
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
- Wait over there, Ji Hyo.
- But...

734
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,990
- That's ridiculous.
- Why should I?

735
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,160
That's ridiculous.

736
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,690
He's on my team, but I must say,
he's playing so dirty.

737
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,320
You stay here.
Wait just for a while.

738
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,160
- Look at him.
- Wait over there.

739
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,320
- He's playing dirty.
- Ji Hyo, hold him.

740
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,390
- Okay. Let's take a break.
- Gosh, seriously.

741
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,790
- Ji Hyo, I'll give you my name tag.
- Okay.

742
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,060
- You'll give her yours?
- Yes. Ji Hyo, I'll give you mine.

743
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,600
He gets intimidated by Ji Hyo.

744
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,410
He's doing his best right now.
He's not pretending.

745
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,440
(Ji Hyo is still too intimidating
for Ji-rasoni.)

746
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,010
(He's trying to attack So Min,
the easiest target, again.)

747
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,640
He just hit me. He hit me.

748
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,980
- No!
- He's serious about this.

749
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,750
- He seems so enthusiastic.
- Suk Jin is serious about this.

750
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,950
Suk Jin is serious.

751
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,760
Suk Jin is actually trying to win.

752
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,050
His face turned red too.

753
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,030
He's attacking her
with all his might.

754
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,890
- Suk Jin seems so serious.
- My gosh.

755
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,890
I've never seen him
that enthusiastic before.

756
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,000
(He's trying his best
to take So Min's name tag off.)

757
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Ji Hyo seems so relaxed.

758
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,440
Suk Jin's top ripped.

759
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,330
Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

760
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,770
He gave up.

761
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,510
- Ji Hyo, start attacking her now.
- Attack her.

762
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,510
Wait. Give me a second.

763
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,600
So Min, don't waste your energy.

764
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,680
Let's get more points.

765
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,370
- This is so funny.
- Give it a try.

766
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,540
- My, she's so good at this.
- This won't work.

767
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,950
Give it a try. Why?

768
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,960
- This is your chance, Ji Hyo.
- Go and attack her.

769
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,380
So Min, you should put on your mic.

770
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,430
There's nothing to record anyway.
I'll only scream, don't you think?

771
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,700
(There's nothing to record anyway.
I'll only scream, don't you think?)

772
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,200
(The sound engineer says,
"That's true.")

773
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
That's true.

774
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,790
Rip her name tag off!

775
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,390
- Rip one more name tag off, So Min.
- You can do this.

776
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,590
So Min, give it a try.

777
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,800
- She's so scary.
- Oh, gosh.

778
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,710
Let's do a common knowledge quiz.

779
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,100
- Let's do a quiz instead.
- Ji Hyo, you should get mad.

780
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,440
Ji Hyo, don't listen to her.

781
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,800
- You have no common knowledge.
- She's looking down on you.

782
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,480
- Common knowledge, my foot.
- Song Jeoktoma, come on.

783
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,750
(Song Jeoktoma got angry
when she heard "common knowledge".)

784
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,380
She's angry. Ji Hyo got mad.

785
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
She got upset
because So Min suggested a quiz.

786
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,230
(How dare you talk about
common knowledge in front of me?)

787
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,230
- It's the word Ji Hyo hates most.
- Rip it off!

788
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,050
- That word is taboo on Running Man.
- Help me.

789
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,090
Help me. Can anyone help me?

790
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,170
(Ripping)

791
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,890
Nice! That was funny.

792
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,510
- Good job.
- It wasn't easy.

793
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,100
- It was so intense.
- Ji Hyo won all the points.

794
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,680
It was a quiz, but you guys didn't
get any questions right, did you?

795
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,510
Next up is the middleweight class.

796
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,180
- It's my turn?
- Okay.

797
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,420
- Jae Suk.
- I'm sure the others will...

798
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,190
- You should be quick.
- They'll choose combat.

799
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,660
- You should get the answer quickly.
- I should press the buzzer quickly.

800
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,490
Oh, man. Jae Suk is
in the middleweight class too.

801
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,530
(Jae Suk is the best at quizzes
while the others are the worst.)

802
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,430
When you hear the bell ringing,
run to Haha no matter what.

803
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,320
- Got it.
- Se Chan.

804
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,500
- You know, right?
- What do you mean?

805
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,890
If I raise Combat...

806
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,590
- Oh, okay.
- We'll fight together, okay?

807
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,770
- I can get the right answer first.
- Of course.

808
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,060
- Right.
- You can just get it right.

809
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,060
I can get it right.

810
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,030
The first question is regarding
current affairs.

811
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,440
- We're in trouble.
- Raise Combat.

812
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,840
This is a Danish word
that means "coziness".

813
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,420
- A Danish word?
- Go ahead.

814
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,180
(He didn't even hear the question
to the end.)

815
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,220
Hygge.

816
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,190
(Correct)

817
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,760
(He got the right answer quickly
and won 5 points!)

818
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,380
- Hygge!
- Hygge!

819
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,960
Hygge!

820
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,430
(Hygge is a Danish word that means
warmth and coziness.)

821
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,200
- Hygge!
- Hold on. Jae Suk.

822
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,090
- I got it right. Okay.
- Hey.

823
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,170
I said "Engel's coefficient"
just like he said the answer.

824
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,790
But it wasn't the correct answer.

825
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,710
- Did he say the correct answer?
- Hygge.

826
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,300
You should've let us say
some wrong answers that are funny...

827
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,300
like "hyvaa" or "hwitturu matturu".
Why did you answer it right away?

828
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,040
- You should've given us a chance...
- I think...

829
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,840
he's been studying at a library.

830
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,780
- "Hygge" is not a word!
- Exactly.

831
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,780
It's either "hyvaa"
or "hwitturu matturu".

832
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,990
- I promise...
- This is ridiculous.

833
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,190
I'll end this before you get
a chance to raise Combat.

834
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,550
That was like a real quiz.

835
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,660
(It was like a real quiz
for a change.)

836
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,730
I should get
the right answer quickly.

837
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,550
Hey, Haha.

838
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,390
Don't even think you might know it.
Put Combat in front of you.

839
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,060
- We have no chance.
- Let's give it a try.

840
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,440
- It might be an easy one.
- Now...

841
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,300
Wait. Hold on a second.

842
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,830
I just saw Kwang Soo taking this
out of Se Chan's bag.

843
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,210
Are we allowed to steal
others' stamps?

844
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,450
- I swear...
- Hey, hey, hey.

845
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,180
I tried to steal his stamps,
but there aren't any in here.

846
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,540
Gosh, seriously.

847
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,570
- I found no stamps here.
- Right.

848
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,020
- I knew it, so I put them here.
- Put it back in his bag.

849
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,050
- You call this a team?
- I put them in my pocket.

850
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,380
- He's incredible.
- Don't try to steal mine.

851
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,200
It already began.
Make sure to keep your bag safe.

852
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,700
- They're so sly.
- They might steal yours.

853
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,560
- Give me my bag over there.
- I didn't think...

854
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,200
I didn't know you could steal them.

855
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,500
I bet Suk Jin will try it.

856
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,060
- I never even imagined.
- You can't do that.

857
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,940
This is an unusual
consumption pattern...

858
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,940
during economic recessions.

859
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,710
Hey, raise it now. Hurry.

860
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,780
- Go ahead.
- You should get the right answer.

861
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,840
- Revenge spending.
- Wait. Jae Suk.

862
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,140
(What is the increase in consumption
of affordable luxuries called?)

863
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,990
(Could he get the correct answer...)

864
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,190
(so quickly that the others don't
get to raise Combat once again?)

865
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,990
- He was wrong.
- What did you say?

866
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,780
- I'll hear the question to the end.
- I'll hear the rest.

867
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,880
Give us some time.

868
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,050
This is an unusual consumption
pattern during recessions.

869
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,860
What is the increase
in consumption...

870
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,360
of affordable luxuries called?

871
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,700
- C brand effect.
- "Affordable..."

872
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,270
- An effect?
- C brand effect.

873
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,410
Kwang Soo said "C brand effect".

874
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,210
Cheap stuff effect.

875
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,010
(Cheap stuff effect)

876
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,100
(The empty-headed duo frustrates
everyone just like a traffic jam.)

877
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,680
It might be similar to the answer.

878
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,070
- "Cheap stuff effect"?
- What was it called?

879
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,990
Okay!

880
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,540
Buy-1-get-1-free effect.

881
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,220
(Buy-1-get-1-free effect)

882
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,260
(Buy 1 Empty Head and get 1 free.)

883
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,020
- It's funny because he's serious.
- You're laughing?

884
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,780
- How dare you laugh?
- Does Jae Suk know the answer?

885
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,230
- That was a good one.
- You don't know either?

886
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,290
It sounded like a correct answer.

887
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,930
The only effect I can think of is
a placebo effect.

888
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,960
And a butterfly effect.

889
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,430
You know, Ji Hyo said...

890
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,930
I expected something like
a placebo effect.

891
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,130
Do you know what she said?

892
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,170
She said, "saving pennies effect".

893
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,060
(Do you know what she said?
She said, "saving pennies effect".)

894
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,800
- My gosh.
- I couldn't play along with it.

895
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,070
(This is the class
of the queen of airheads.)

896
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,710
- "Saving pennies effect".
- Yes, that's what I said.

897
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,570
- All right.
- Raise Combat. Why won't you?

898
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,990
Go ahead.

899
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,780
(Se Chan raised Combat.)

900
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,610
- Press it. What are you doing?
- It's a combat.

901
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,030
- Let's attack Jae Suk first.
- It's a combat.

902
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,320
(Unlike Suk Jin, Jae Suk quickly
gets ready for the combat.)

903
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,290
- Let's attack Jae Suk.
- Go for it.

904
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,320
- Haha, you have a chance.
- I'll hold him.

905
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,560
Hold him.

906
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,170
- Okay. Good.
- He'll lose shortly.

907
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,200
Rip it off.

908
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860
They did it.

909
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,300
- They're fighting with each other.
- What a shame.

910
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,710
- Go, Haha!
- That won't work.

911
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,800
- Move fast.
- Oh, my. This is exciting.

912
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,870
Haha won't let him win.
Go, Mr. Dirty Mustache!

913
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,750
- You can do it!
- Their pride is on the line.

914
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,180
(They have pride when it comes to
Name Tag Elimination.)

915
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,920
- Good! Grab it!
- Oh, wow.

916
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,610
One has 11 years of experience
and the other has 4.

917
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,040
You can do it! All right!

918
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,190
One has 11 years of experience
and the other has 4.

919
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,960
(The man with 11 years of experience
slapped him in the face.)

920
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,380
(Ripping)

921
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,490
(He won with his experience
as a dirty player.)

922
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,850
- All right!
- He...

923
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,290
- He slapped me in the face.
- Haha wins!

924
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,060
- Haha, you're so cool.
- Good job.

925
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,500
He suddenly looks much younger.

926
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,940
- 11 years of experience!
- Haha, that was so cool.

927
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,240
- You were so nimble.
- I knew it.

928
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,800
He slapped me in the face.

929
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,860
- Isn't it the same thing?
- What is the correct answer?

930
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,780
- The lipstick effect.
- Oh, that. I know that term.

931
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,210
(A situation where people buy more
small luxuries during recessions)

932
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,340
- I've heard of it.
- Oh, the lipstick effect?

933
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,540
- Oh, that was the answer?
- It disappears like lipstick.

934
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,580
(Both of them must not know
what it means.)

935
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,190
It disappears when you use it up.

936
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Isn't it because people try to
buy lipstick for less?

937
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,730
Kwang Soo, you seem so upset.

938
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,850
- I wasn't so sure about it.
- Right?

939
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
It's now time for
the hooligan match.

940
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,770
- One of you will play again.
- Go, Eun Seok.

941
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,030
- Kwang Soo's joining the game.
- Kwang Soo?

942
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,000
- The category is sports.
- Nice.

943
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,560
- All right.
- That's a good one.

944
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,280
After originating from Scotland,

945
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,510
curling went on to being...

946
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,870
an official event
in the winter Olympics.

947
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,220
What are curling stones made out of?

948
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,840
Marble.

949
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,280
(The answer is marble.)

950
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,260
(Spoken like the main member
of the Airhead Squad.)

951
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,660
That's what it looks like though.

952
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,880
- What stone is it made out of?
- Request a combat.

953
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,550
Think of what it can be.

954
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,930
- Yes?
- Cement.

955
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,170
- That's not it.
- My gosh.

956
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,590
That's not it!

957
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,890
Are you okay?

958
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,790
Cement. Seriously?

959
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,800
- I can't believe it.
- Can cement be this smooth?

960
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,600
Name one that no one would think of.

961
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,100
- Name any stone you know.
- Bricks.

962
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,280
- Should I?
- Yes.

963
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,570
- Basalt.
- What...

964
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,480
But basalt has holes in them!

965
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,220
How can it be used to play curling?

966
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,450
Jong Hun, please.

967
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,080
Didn't you think it through?
Basalt has holes in them.

968
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,110
It's a three-syllable word, right?

969
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,320
It's very well-known.

970
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,580
It's obvious.

971
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,050
Granite.

972
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,930
See what I mean?

973
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,170
- Granite!
- That's what I said.

974
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,530
The well-known rock.

975
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,060
- That's what I said.
- I don't know the names of rocks.

976
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,170
- Unbelievable.
- Okay!

977
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,600
They don't seem to be knowledgeable.

978
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,370
Neither of them is
on the clever side.

979
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,180
Kwang Soo has found confidence.

980
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,610
British economist
William Henry Beveridge...

981
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,950
Beverly Hills?

982
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,920
He published a report regarding
issues of social welfare.

983
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,820
In this report,

984
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,880
he named society's five giant evils.

985
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,430
Name one of them.

986
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,700
A giant evil? Isn't it Kwang Soo?

987
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,700
- The 5 giant evils of society.
- 5 giant evils.

988
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,930
Jong Hun, just say anything.

989
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,240
- Just say what comes to mind.
- Whatever sounds evil.

990
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,630
Extravagance.

991
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,330
(Extravagance is incorrect.)

992
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,440
Desire.

993
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,570
No, something else.

994
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,630
Robbery.

995
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,570
What is it?

996
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,800
A giant evil of society?

997
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,340
Betrayal.

998
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,680
(They keep losing points
for giving wrong answers.)

999
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Kwang Soo...

1000
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,990
Wouldn't it be better
to just request a combat?

1001
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,580
If you think about it...

1002
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,190
Please press the buzzer.

1003
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,610
Eun Seok requested a combat.

1004
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,080
Kwang Soo has the upper hand here.

1005
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,230
Yes, that's why
you should attack him first.

1006
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,700
Right, take out Kwang Soo first.

1007
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,090
Take him out first.

1008
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,500
- He's already getting ready.
- Look.

1009
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,730
He's getting ready.

1010
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,940
Why are you taking off
your shoes though?

1011
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,100
Wait!

1012
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,030
- I don't trust him.
- I'll take it instead.

1013
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,570
- I don't trust you either.
- Let me take it.

1014
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,210
- But I didn't do anything.
- Let me take it.

1015
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,980
- A combat.
- Hey!

1016
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,950
- Hold on.
- Team up first.

1017
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,810
- You two should team up.
- Take out Kwang Soo first.

1018
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,140
- Eliminate Kwang Soo first.
- Right.

1019
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,810
Take out Kwang Soo first.

1020
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,160
Take off your satchels.

1021
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,780
Take out Kwang Soo first.

1022
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,820
No, wait!

1023
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,930
Hold on a second.

1024
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,000
No, wait!

1025
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,730
(Eun Seok runs forward
to get his satchel back.)

1026
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,860
No, wait!

1027
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,440
Don't let him!

1028
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,390
(Don't let Kwang Soo
rip off your name tag!)

1029
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,240
(The penthouse residents
aren't seeing straight.)

1030
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,530
Rip his name tag off.

1031
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,030
Hold on!

1032
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,710
(He loses his vest
in a matter of seconds.)

1033
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,510
Rip his name tag off. Hold on.

1034
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,240
Get his name tag!

1035
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,890
- Rip his name tag off.
- Wait.

1036
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,350
Get his name tag first.

1037
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,410
(Kwang Soo sees red
after being humiliated.)

1038
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,720
Rip it off.

1039
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,030
- Get it.
- Good job.

1040
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,030
He ripped off his own name tag!

1041
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,990
(Kwang Soo ripped
a name tag off but...)

1042
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,030
It's his.

1043
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,390
(It was his own name tag!)

1044
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,470
Jong Hun, good job.

1045
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,530
Jong Hun, nicely done.

1046
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,530
Why did you rip yours off?

1047
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,100
Why would you
rip off your own name tag?

1048
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,890
Get Jong Hun's next!

1049
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,100
Jong Hun, be careful.

1050
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,910
- Jong Hun!
- Get Eun Seok's name tag.

1051
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,140
(Jong Hun and Eun Seok
go head to head.)

1052
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,010
Hold on.

1053
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,700
I need my satchel back though.

1054
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,370
- It's all right.
- I got it.

1055
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,540
Nice!

1056
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,580
(Eun Seok scores 2 points for
ripping Jong Hun's name tag off.)

1057
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,350
Jong Hun, are you kidding me?

1058
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,390
To keep things fair,

1059
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,680
Kwang Soo will have
two points deducted...

1060
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,330
- since he ripped his own name tag.
- Right.

1061
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,350
Jong Hun gets 0 points
while Eun Seok gets 2.

1062
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,100
- Nice!
- Okay, good.

1063
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,530
I was only trying to steal it back.

1064
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,890
Let me tell you what the answer is.

1065
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,540
The answer is this.

1066
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,700
- Want.
- Want.

1067
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,310
- Disease.
- Disease.

1068
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,470
Ignorance.

1069
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,700
- Ignorance?
- Is that a giant evil?

1070
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,680
- Ignorance?
- There's a great evil right here.

1071
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,740
I'm a great evil?

1072
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,540
Being ignorant
makes him a great evil.

1073
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,950
Squalor and idleness.

1074
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,620
- Idleness.
- Idleness.

1075
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,740
Right, of course.

1076
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,780
They are words we all know.

1077
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,990
- One should never be idle.
- Idleness.

1078
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,120
They are words we know.

1079
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,060
Here's the next question.

1080
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,530
What is the word...

1081
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,790
that explains a government
failing to pay back...

1082
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,530
all or some of the loan...

1083
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,290
it took out from other nations
within a designated time limit?

1084
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,970
- Don't you know this?
- Are you saying you do?

1085
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,760
Right, go ahead.

1086
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,910
IMF!

1087
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,760
IMF. Oh, that's not it.

1088
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,140
That's what I thought it was.

1089
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,080
You got it wrong just as he did.

1090
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,310
That's what popped into my head too.

1091
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,700
- IMF?
- International Monetary Fund.

1092
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,850
International Monetary Fund.

1093
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,310
Still, it shows...

1094
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,990
that you picked up a few things.

1095
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,180
International Monetary Fund.

1096
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,290
This...

1097
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,180
- Does this call for another combat?
- The government can't repay a debt.

1098
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,620
- It's an English word.
- What?

1099
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,930
- It's an English word.
- An English word?

1100
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,120
There's no way you can get
this right. Request a combat.

1101
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,030
You'll never get this right.

1102
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,430
- Right.
- You know...

1103
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,330
(Can the New Yorker save face?)

1104
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,870
Taxation.

1105
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,930
(Taxation is incorrect.)

1106
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,560
- What's that?
- What's taxation?

1107
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,370
- The levying of the tax.
- Oh, tax.

1108
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,810
The levying of additional tax.

1109
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,970
Like tax-free?

1110
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,010
Tax-free?

1111
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,870
Can you believe it?

1112
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,140
- Tax-free...
- That's the exemption of tax.

1113
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
- That's the exemption of tax.
- I see.

1114
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,410
- Jong Hun.
- Gosh.

1115
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,680
- I don't remember.
- Stop repenting.

1116
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,010
Jong Hun, if you don't know
the answer, request a combat.

1117
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,260
It's okay not to know.

1118
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,330
- Of course.
- This...

1119
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,660
- It's okay.
- Who would know this anyway?

1120
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,330
- He stands no chance in a combat.
- Request a combat.

1121
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,260
You worked out, didn't you?

1122
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,490
You look the same as
Jae Suk and Suk Jin from behind.

1123
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,370
The silhouette from behind
is the same.

1124
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,560
Jong Hun, come on!

1125
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,600
It starts with a D
and ends with a T.

1126
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,510
He gave you everything.

1127
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,010
- Descent.
- Figure out the middle letters.

1128
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,780
- Shouldn't Logan Lee know this?
- De-fact.

1129
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,370
- No.
- What on earth?

1130
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,790
I'm now doubting Logan Lee.

1131
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,720
Are you sure your name is Logan?

1132
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,450
You've been losing points, you know.

1133
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,660
- We've been losing points.
- It's all right.

1134
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,260
- Have I been losing points?
- Yes.

1135
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,620
It's only one point anyway,

1136
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,490
He got the F right.

1137
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,160
F. He got the F right.

1138
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,660
- De-fant.
- No way!

1139
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,390
- Jong Hun.
- Come on!

1140
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,200
- Just say something.
- He got the F right.

1141
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,970
- D, F, and T.
- Just throw about any word.

1142
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,970
No, don't.

1143
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,040
- Just request a combat.
- Combat!

1144
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,870
Let's wrestle it out.

1145
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,680
You've got to be kidding me.

1146
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,310
A combat is on.

1147
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,370
They were so close.

1148
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,180
It's a combat.

1149
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,790
My name tag
was already ripped off once.

1150
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,640
That doesn't mean
you can skip this round out.

1151
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,660
We're from Team Penthouse, so...

1152
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,490
Due to his long arms,

1153
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,850
you'll lose in a 1-on-1 match
with Kwang Soo.

1154
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,450
- Right, you'll lose.
- Eliminate him first.

1155
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,560
- Eliminate him together.
- Take him out first.

1156
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,290
This is fun to watch.

1157
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,560
Logan, get in there!

1158
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,990
Shouldn't you eliminate Logan first?

1159
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,260
Jong Hun, join in!

1160
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,160
(Kwang Soo goes wild.)

1161
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
- Go for it!
- Grab him!

1162
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,260
Jong Hun!

1163
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,280
(Eun Seok takes off his sweater
to play defense.)

1164
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,740
Yes, you've got it.

1165
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,950
- Nice!
- Good job.

1166
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,850
(Jong Hun joins in
and eliminates Kwang Soo!)

1167
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,040
Are you allowed
to take off your clothes?

1168
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,180
You held out well.

1169
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,490
Are you allowed
to take off your clothes?

1170
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,010
You held out well.

1171
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,260
Are you allowed
to take off your clothes?

1172
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,410
(The dirty player from New York)

1173
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,790
He took off his sweater!

1174
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,850
- Put on your sweater first.
- Go ahead and get dressed.

1175
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,120
How can one play this game
if he takes off his sweater?

1176
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,530
- You're the one who took it off.
- Move!

1177
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,330
- But...
- Get out of the frame.

1178
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,140
- I would've just gone naked!
- Move.

1179
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,310
Let us keep filming.

1180
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,700
He said he'd go naked
if that was allowed.

1181
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,870
(The loser was forced
out of the ring.)

1182
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,280
- Goodness.
- They go head to head.

1183
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,970
It's Eun Seok versus Jong Hun.

1184
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,240
Jong Hun, that's good.

1185
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,310
(Only the two
penthouse residents remain.)

1186
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,990
(Even in the drama series,
they went head to head.)

1187
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,390
(Who will win
the Name Tag Elimination?)

1188
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,530
("Don't be mistaken.
I'm done getting trampled on.")

1189
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,830
(The betrayal fuels
Jong Hun's revenge.)

1190
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,430
("Don't you dare!")

1191
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,870
("You'll get a taste
of your own medicine!")

1192
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,910
(The dirty player from New York
goes for the win.)

1193
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,910
Rip his name tag off!

1194
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,540
(Immersed)

1195
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,740
Rip his name tag off.

1196
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,780
(Neither are backing off.)

1197
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,220
- Is this a fight scene?
- I got it.

1198
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,580
It's like a fight scene.

1199
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,810
- They're practicing a fight scene.
- That's right.

1200
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,010
What is that?

1201
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,330
What is that?

1202
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,450
(Logan Lee wins!)

1203
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,530
It wouldn't come off.

1204
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,030
It's all right.

1205
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,600
Jong Hun, it's fine.

1206
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,760
You at least got one.

1207
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,970
(You gave it your all!)

1208
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,040
Nice.

1209
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,870
(Their battle will continue in
the 2nd season of "The Penthouse".)

1210
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,870
Lastly, the heavyweight class
will compete.

1211
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,370
- Are you all right?
- You did great.

1212
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,410
The heavyweight class will compete.

1213
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,540
Still...

1214
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,870
- We've got this.
- The heavyweight class.

1215
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,010
Go, Kim Yong Gu!

1216
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,640
- Good luck!
- Do Kwon's up.

1217
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,890
I didn't have to go this far.

1218
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,790
- It won't be easy.
- We're relying on you.

1219
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,950
- Okay, don't worry.
- We're reassured.

1220
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,990
- The heavyweight class.
- The heavyweight class.

1221
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,060
It's the heavyweight class.

1222
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,390
Go, Kim Yong Gu.

1223
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,060
(He was humiliated in the past...)

1224
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,700
(from having his clothes ripped
and getting kicked in the stomach.)

1225
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,160
Let's just answer the quiz.

1226
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,930
- Go, Kim Yong Gu!
- All right.

1227
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,810
Good luck.

1228
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,910
(He gets ready for the game.)

1229
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,010
Hold on a second.

1230
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,180
Who did this?

1231
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,970
(Who did this?)

1232
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,410
- It wasn't me.
- Hold on.

1233
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,470
- Let me see.
- It really wasn't me, Eun Seok.

1234
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,540
I wouldn't do that to you.

1235
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,790
- What is it?
- Are they missing?

1236
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,390
They're all gone!

1237
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,030
Please refrain from stealing.

1238
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Eun Seok's entire batch is missing.

1239
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,930
- Whose batch?
- Eun Seok's.

1240
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,100
Eun Seok, here it is.
How could you accuse me of stealing?

1241
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,930
- It's right here.
- It's here.

1242
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,660
- I'm sorry about this.
- Hold on a second.

1243
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,200
Why were you over on our side?

1244
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,180
- Wait.
- Why were you over here?

1245
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,410
Why were you wandering around me?

1246
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,870
- Wait.
- I felt your presence, but...

1247
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,580
- It's a misunderstanding.
- I didn't want to believe it.

1248
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,140
Eun Seok, it's upsetting, you know.

1249
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,390
It was as if a fly
was flying around me.

1250
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,490
It's a misunderstanding!

1251
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,890
Being a rich boy in the show
doesn't mean you can...

1252
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,760
Wait. Someone...
But they're really not here!

1253
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,700
Gosh, who took them?

1254
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,470
But they're really not here!

1255
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,260
- Gosh, who took them?
- What?

1256
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,390
(Clean)

1257
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,870
- Who took them?
- Really?

1258
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,640
(Who took them?)

1259
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,930
Who was it?

1260
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,870
- You. Give them back.
- It's not me.

1261
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,040
- It's not me.
- Hey.

1262
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,080
I played the game with him.

1263
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,740
- This is driving me crazy.
- I played the game with him.

1264
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,140
- Who took them?
- It's not me.

1265
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,350
- It's Jeon So Min. I can tell.
- It's really not me.

1266
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,540
- Hold on.
- It's really not me!

1267
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,740
- We need to...
- I'm sure she took them!

1268
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,080
I think we need to check
everyone's bag.

1269
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,390
- It's So Min for sure.
- It's not me.

1270
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,580
- I can tell from her look.
- They're really not here.

1271
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,660
I think it's you, So Min.

1272
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,160
- No, it's not me.
- But her face says she took them.

1273
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,220
- It's really not me. Look.
- So Min.

1274
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,330
They told you to give them back.

1275
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,830
Give them back to him, So Min.
Haha, give them back.

1276
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,470
- Is it you?
- Give them back.

1277
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,240
- It's not me!
- Give them to me right now.

1278
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,140
- Give them to me.
- Jae Suk.

1279
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,810
- It's not me.
- Let me check just once.

1280
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,060
Eun Seok, it's him.

1281
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,330
- Haha took them.
- I'm disappointed by him.

1282
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,040
I was looking for his stamps,
and he came up to me,

1283
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,240
saying, "Give them back."

1284
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,950
- Eun Seok. It's him.
- I'm suspicious of everyone.

1285
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,990
It'll be embarrassing,
so just put them back later, okay?

1286
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,850
- Okay, when everyone's not looking.
- It's really not me.

1287
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,720
- Put it there.
- I swear, it's not me.

1288
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,760
- They can put them back.
- It'll be embarrassing.

1289
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,790
Just put them back later.

1290
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,200
It's here. Put them back
whenever you can.

1291
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,830
You know, children love our show.

1292
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,370
We can't be stealing anymore.

1293
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,930
This is driving me crazy.

1294
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:25,640
You guys are so mean.

1295
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,830
- Put it there.
- They'll put them back.

1296
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,470
- Okay, okay.
- They'll put them back for you.

1297
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,540
Let's start now.

1298
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,700
Let's go!

1299
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,950
(Sighing)

1300
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,350
Do Kwon, you can relax.

1301
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,620
- No, I'm not...
- Take it easy, Do Kwon.

1302
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,640
Do Kwon, are you here
to get Jong Kook?

1303
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,510
No, I'm not.
I'm not after anyone today.

1304
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,160
What do you call a person...

1305
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,530
who guides the visitors
in a museum or an art gallery...

1306
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,760
- Curator.
- That's right.

1307
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,490
- That's correct.
- That's the answer.

1308
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,100
- It's slightly different.
- It's wrong?

1309
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,760
Curatration.

1310
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,160
(Wrong)

1311
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,370
- I'll hear out the question.
- It's clearly wrong.

1312
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,310
What do you call a person
who guides the visitors...

1313
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,450
in a museum or an art gallery
with knowledge about...

1314
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,970
the exhibition? It's a person
who leads guided tours.

1315
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,620
No, that's not it.
There's another term for it.

1316
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,510
- Another term?
- It's not curator?

1317
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,290
There's another term for it.
That's right.

1318
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,010
It starts with a D.

1319
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,580
- D?
- Kwang Soo.

1320
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,660
Kwang Soo, give it a go.

1321
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,490
A DJ.

1322
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,030
Are you kidding me?

1323
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,970
I know it's not a DJ.
I'm actually offended.

1324
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,390
It's DJ.

1325
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,370
Five,

1326
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,560
four,

1327
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,970
- three,
- I knew the term.

1328
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,160
- two...
- I think I know what it is.

1329
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,780
Combat. He requested combat.

1330
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,040
- He pressed the buzzer.
- Let's go, Do Kwon!

1331
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,220
(Name tag elimination starts.)

1332
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,240
You need to stick with Kwang Soo.

1333
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,970
- Jong Kook...
- Don't trust Kwang Soo.

1334
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,240
He'll try to win two points.

1335
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,790
- Get those two points, Kwang Soo.
- Don't ever trust Kwang Soo.

1336
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,810
They've ripped off my name tag
before, so I don't trust anyone.

1337
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,180
- It really is a heavyweight.
- Do Kwon looks small.

1338
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,220
(Swift)

1339
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,290
He's good.

1340
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,990
- He's in trouble.
- Will the members join forces?

1341
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,790
- Will they fight against the guest?
- You're wearing knee pads!

1342
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,240
- Are you Lee Duke Jean?
- Gosh, I'm not!

1343
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,430
Are you Lee Duke Jean?

1344
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,700
(Lee Duke Jean's fan appears
in a pressing situation.)

1345
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,100
You flustered me.

1346
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,310
- It's not him?
- Lee Duke Jean.

1347
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,910
He really looks like Lee Duke Jean.

1348
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,010
What are you doing?

1349
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,950
- Look, he's doing steps.
- Yong Gu!

1350
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,970
- Yong Gu.
- Why does Do Kwon look so slow?

1351
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,080
(Frivolous)

1352
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,220
- You said you're not after him.
- Kim Yong Gu!

1353
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,580
- Kim Yong Gu!
- Yong Gu!

1354
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,580
(Swift)

1355
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,930
(Yong Gu's steps are pretty swift.)

1356
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,220
- He's pretty fast.
- Don't get caught.

1357
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,220
Follow, follow me.

1358
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,160
(Suddenly hitting the brakes)

1359
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,260
- What are you doing?
- Don't get caught.

1360
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,560
(His steps get messed up
while trying to look swift.)

1361
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,410
(The assassin kicks his knee first.)

1362
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,100
- Why are you doing this to me?
- What's wrong with him?

1363
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,430
What are you doing?

1364
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,640
(He got eliminated after
showing his dance moves.)

1365
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,680
He's eliminated.

1366
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,470
(I've only waited for this day.)

1367
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,080
(He's dumbfounded.)

1368
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,450
(Now it's a one-on-one match
between Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.)

1369
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,430
Go easy on him.

1370
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,120
- Kwang Soo is all serious.
- We must watch this.

1371
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,060
(We must watch this!)

1372
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,470
- Kwang Soo is all serious.
- We must watch this.

1373
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,240
(Ripping)

1374
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,830
Impressive, Kwang Soo!

1375
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,580
(Kwang Soo ripped off
Jong Kook's name tag!)

1376
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,780
(Amazing)

1377
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,040
Why did you do that?

1378
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,140
I cared too much
about his hair. Okay.

1379
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,450
Jong Kook!
Gosh, this is frustrating.

1380
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:31,160
- It's okay.
- I fell down.

1381
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,030
- Kwang Soo.
- I'm never cutting my mullet.

1382
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,220
He kept letting me go
when he grabbed my mullet.

1383
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,700
Nice one.

1384
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,830
- Okay. It's okay.
- It's okay.

1385
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:41,560
- Just get the questions right.
- Okay, okay. I got it.

1386
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,560
- It's okay.
- Get the questions.

1387
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,970
- This is worth only two points.
- Okay.

1388
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:46,510
- Get the questions right.
- Kwang Soo, let's do this.

1389
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,510
(They're about to restart the game.)

1390
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,080
- You have to stop Jong Kook.
- We don't know yet, right?

1391
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,780
- I got the stamps back.
- You did?

1392
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,140
- She's the one who took them.
- You got them back?

1393
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,740
- They're back.
- They are?

1394
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,040
(His 5 stamps are back
without him knowing.)

1395
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,290
You really are amazing.

1396
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,990
Haha, when did you put them back?

1397
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:04,220
- Kwang Soo is acting...
- It's really not me.

1398
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,760
- It's giving me chills.
- You're amazing.

1399
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,850
(The suspects are impressed
by each other.)

1400
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,530
- That's amazing!
- You're the best.

1401
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,660
(He yells out "That's amazing"
to divert attention.)

1402
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:17,390
(Then he stealthily opens
Eun Seok's stamp book.)

1403
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,080
(Putting back the stamps)

1404
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:24,910
You really are amazing.

1405
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,780
(He follows the rule
and puts back what he stole.)

1406
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,410
- It's giving me chills.
- You're amazing.

1407
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:33,140
Eun Seok is a bit clumsy too.

1408
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,010
Actually, he's very clumsy.

1409
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,180
We have the result.

1410
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,260
(Announcing the final rankings)

1411
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,100
In last place is Team Gyeonggi
with two points.

1412
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,700
Team Gyeonggi got two points.

1413
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,060
- Why are we in last place?
- Why are we in last place?

1414
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,430
- Did they...
- We're in last place?

1415
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,470
- Yes.
- That's right.

1416
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,200
- You had a lot of wrong answers.
- Wrong answers?

1417
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,560
- Gosh, seriously.
- Wrong answers?

1418
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,560
(Eun Seok answered wrong
the most.)

1419
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,930
- We actually have a shot.
- We do.

1420
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,410
If we're in first place,
we can get double the amount, right?

1421
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,680
The difference in score
is just two points.

1422
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,040
(They're only 2 points apart.)

1423
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,910
The 2 teams won
10 points and 8 points respectively.

1424
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,510
The team that won 10 points...

1425
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:03,950
(Which team will win 1st place
and take 10 stamps each?)

1426
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,010
Team Gangwon.

1427
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:06,040
- is Team Gangwon.
- Yes!

1428
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,290
(Team Gangwon won.)

1429
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,620
- Okay, we did it.
- We did it.

1430
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,060
What a relief.

1431
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,830
What a relief.

1432
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,390
- We did well.
- Only if we didn't get two wrong.

1433
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,600
The team in 1st place
gets 10 stamps each.

1434
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,830
The team in 2nd place gets 7,
and the team in 3rd place gets 5.

1435
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,200
- And?
- Since this team gets double,

1436
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,660
- they get 14 stamps.
- Okay!

1437
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,930
(Team Gyeongsang gets 14 stamps
as they don't have hooligans.)

1438
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:24,930
That's right.

1439
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,200
Because there's no hooligan
on their team.

1440
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,970
Then one of us can't get the stamps.

1441
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,310
That's right, one of you can't.

1442
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,640
- We can't?
- No.

1443
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,200
Let's draw lots first.

1444
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,450
Let's start with Team Gangwon.

1445
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,620
Having a hooligan
is a big disadvantage.

1446
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,410
- Pick one.
- Okay.

1447
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,890
- Shall I pick first?
- Please, please!

1448
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,180
- Do I pick one?
- I'm really unlucky.

1449
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,850
I always become it.

1450
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:42,890
(Only 1 of them will get a dud.)

1451
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:44,160
- What's the mark?
- Is it the one with a mark?

1452
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,830
- What's the mark?
- Is it the one with a mark?

1453
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,990
(Sighing)

1454
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,390
I saw his even before checking mine.

1455
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,560
I saw his even before checking mine.

1456
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,760
- My gosh.
- It's an O?

1457
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,870
How did he...

1458
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,370
It's you.

1459
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,640
Jae Suk won't bet getting
any stamps.

1460
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,830
The next team.

1461
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,240
- You're not getting any stamps?
- Well done, Jae Suk.

1462
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,740
We won thanks to you.

1463
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,580
Well done.

1464
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,910
(Team Gyeonggi starts drawing.)

1465
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,720
I think Eun Seok got it. Did he not?

1466
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,220
Is it you, Do Kwon?

1467
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,180
- Nothing is working out today.
- Yes!

1468
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,060
- That's great.
- My gosh.

1469
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,990
I don't think I'm cut out
for Running Man.

1470
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:18,390
Today is total chaos.

1471
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,830
Seriously...

1472
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:21,890
It's not easy to be this unlucky.

1473
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,100
We get 10 each.

1474
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,120
Nice.

1475
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,700
Everyone, it's time to kick out
the hooligans.

1476
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,830
Oh, the hooligans.

1477
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,160
The teams with hooligans,
Eun Seok and Jong Hun,

1478
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,100
can decide to kick out, keep,

1479
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,040
or switch them.

1480
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,200
It will be between the hooligan
and the rest of the team.

1481
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,740
Write down the number of stamps
with someone's name in secret.

1482
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:44,450
And the hooligan will write down
the number he can afford.

1483
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:48,060
And when they lay the cards...
If the numbers are the same,

1484
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,510
the hooligan will remain
on the team.

1485
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,450
If the hooligan's number
is bigger than the members',

1486
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,160
then the hooligan can appoint
one of the members as a hooligan...

1487
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,790
and send them away
to the other team.

1488
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,120
Oh, we can change the hooligan.

1489
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,160
But if the hooligan's number
is smaller,

1490
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,100
(Rules of play)

1491
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,870
they'll leave the team for good.

1492
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:08,910
It sounds complicated.

1493
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,740
- We need to make the number big.
- We need to use a lot of stamps.

1494
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,780
Oh, do the hooligans leave the team
for good?

1495
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,580
The other hooligans
could join the team.

1496
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,510
So if you want to kick out
the hooligan, use a lot of stamps.

1497
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,890
If the hooligan doesn't want to
be one, use a lot of stamps.

1498
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,620
- Is there a maximum number?
- There isn't.

1499
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,350
- Do we get the stamps back later?
- No, you don't. They'll be gone.

1500
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,950
It's nice to double the numbers.

1501
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:29,660
This is quite difficult though.

1502
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,120
(To which team will the hooligans
be sent to?)

1503
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,120
Are you all done
writing down the numbers?

1504
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:34,930
Okay, okay.

1505
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,870
Team Gyeonggi will go first.

1506
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,930
The stamp owner
will reveal the numbers.

1507
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,780
I lost at rock-paper-scissors,
so we're using my stickers.

1508
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,780
- How many are you spending?
- I got none.

1509
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,140
Five stamps.

1510
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,410
- You must use the five stamps.
- Okay.

1511
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,780
(If Eun Seok wrote more than 5,
he'll remain on the team,)

1512
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,040
(and the new hooligan
will be kicked out.)

1513
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,680
Next, Eun Seok. Please reveal yours.

1514
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,890
What did you write down?

1515
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,310
I only have five.

1516
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,180
- He wrote five!
- It's a tie.

1517
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,260
- Then he'll remain on the team.
- He's staying!

1518
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,350
(As they bet the same amount,
Eun Seok remains on the team.)

1519
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,790
They'll have to
give back the stamps.

1520
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,430
Give us back the stamps.

1521
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:05,660
- He's staying?
- We can't kick him out?

1522
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,660
Okay!

1523
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,470
(It's the best outcome
for the other teams.)

1524
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,600
Then this is... We're only using
all of our stamps?

1525
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,310
- You should've bet more stamps.
- You're staying!

1526
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,310
I can't believe they got a tie.

1527
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,010
- They actually got a tie.
- Next.

1528
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,450
- Suk Jin.
- Can I change the number?

1529
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:20,100
- No.
- I can't?

1530
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,720
- The number isn't that big though.
- Let me tell you this first.

1531
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,350
No one on our team
is of high caliber.

1532
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,640
That means they're all timid.

1533
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,450
- We are all just...
- That's not true.

1534
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,760
- We read the others first.
- We only bet moderate amounts.

1535
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,060
- That's right. Only moderately.
- We don't go big.

1536
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,830
We're not that ambitious.

1537
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:36,950
No, we're not.

1538
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,600
That's the biggest we can bet.

1539
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,430
(The highest number they can
bet is 3.)

1540
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,990
Oh, it's yours.
You're betting three stamps?

1541
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,240
Next is Jong Hun.

1542
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,160
- I don't think he wrote any.
- You can turn the tables later.

1543
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,040
- You can turn the game around.
- You didn't write anything, right?

1544
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,470
- No, no.
- He must've bet a lot.

1545
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:50,580
You didn't write anything, right?

1546
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,470
(If he bet less than 2, he'll be
kicked out to Team Gyeongsang.)

1547
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:54,410
- He must've bet a lot.
- How many did you bet?

1548
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:55,640
(How many did Jong Hun bet?)

1549
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,040
- He must've bet a lot.
- How many did you bet?

1550
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,240
- I bet five.
- He must've bet a lot.

1551
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,720
(He bet 5 stamps.)

1552
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,680
(As the hooligan's number is bigger,
they'll pick a new hooligan.)

1553
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,410
- Now, Jong Hun...
- He's not the hooligan anymore?

1554
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,850
will pick one of them as a hooligan,
and he will move to the other team.

1555
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,160
The newly picked one
will join our team?

1556
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,600
Yes, because there's only
three people on your team.

1557
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,620
I'm staying on this team?

1558
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,870
Yes, you'll remain
as an ordinary player.

1559
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,660
So you're no longer a hooligan.

1560
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:18,510
Then this team
will be free of hooligans.

1561
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,410
But you can become one
and get kicked out.

1562
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,780
That's... No, that's not true.
I'm sure that won't happen.

1563
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:24,640
- So who's leaving?
- You are leaving, Suk Jin.

1564
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,640
No... Don't be like that.

1565
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,640
So who's leaving?

1566
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,870
(You should leave, Suk Jin.)

1567
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,350
(Don't be like that.)

1568
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,350
(Hooligan Jong Hun picks Suk Jin.)

1569
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,660
- But why?
- We'll accept him!

1570
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,720
Please think it over just once.

1571
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,060
- Well done, Jong Hun.
- Well done.

1572
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,720
- It's good that you're staying.
- It's so much better for us.

1573
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,850
- Our team will be stronger.
- It's so much better.

1574
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:43,850
Why don't we play
rock-paper-scissors?

1575
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,560
- We can play that.
- No, no. You did well, Jong Hun.

1576
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,120
Wait, he didn't officially say it.
Jong Hun.

1577
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,040
- Is it...
- Yes, it's you. You can leave.

1578
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,160
- Mr. Hooligan.
- Gosh.

1579
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,970
- Welcome.
- Nice!

1580
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,040
- Now even Jong Hun...
- Mr. Ji!

1581
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,410
Congratulations once again.

1582
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:00,180
Everyone bet it all
so early in the game.

1583
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,580
I thought they'd overturn the game.

1584
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,280
- The fish cake is so good.
- The soup...

1585
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,450
is very spicy.

1586
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:05,740
- It's really good.
- The tteokbokki is amazing.

1587
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,290
Wow, it looks so good.

1588
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:08,950
It is good.

1589
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,530
It's so good.

1590
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,390
It tastes even better
after winning first place.

1591
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,390
My gosh.

1592
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,890
You can listen to the rules
while eating.

1593
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:18,160
The second mission...

1594
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,830
is a combination of foot volleyball
and table tennis.

1595
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,930
It's an alteration
of the new sport, teqball.

1596
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:25,260
It's called
the Birth of Foot Table Tennis.

1597
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:29,010
- Foot table tennis?
- We're good at both.

1598
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,200
Foot table tennis.

1599
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,350
A team of two
will compete against another team.

1600
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,740
So there will be two teams
within your current team.

1601
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,510
Using all body parts
besides your hands,

1602
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:43,260
bounce the ball to the other side.

1603
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,830
You can touch the ball three times
before passing it to the other side.

1604
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,260
You have to return the ball
within three times.

1605
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:54,760
You can bounce the ball on
your table or the ground only once.

1606
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,760
(You can't bounce the ball twice.)

1607
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,470
You can't bounce the ball
on the table or the ground twice.

1608
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:00,470
(You can't bounce the ball twice.)

1609
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,640
The team that scores
11 points first wins.

1610
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,240
The rankings will be decided
by the number of points you get.

1611
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,310
- Okay.
- Sounds fun.

1612
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,640
You need to divide into two teams
within your current team.

1613
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,140
That means 1 member has to play
twice for the team with 3 members.

1614
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,850
Jong Kook will play twice for us.

1615
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,910
(Smiling)

1616
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,530
We can divide into Team Jong Kook A
and Team Jong Kook B.

1617
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,890
Can I play twice?

1618
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,260
Because the two players there
are easy to beat.

1619
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,470
Jong Hun wants to go twice.

1620
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,100
- Oh, really? Okay, he can do that.
- Yes.

1621
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,200
(The passionate man
gladly gives his permission.)

1622
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,890
If you don't play well,
brace yourself for a scolding.

1623
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:31,330
I'm in trouble.

1624
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:32,870
- Jong Kook has a clear rule.
- I do.

1625
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,260
- If you want to, you can play.
- That's right.

1626
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,910
But you'll get a scolding
if you're bad at it.

1627
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,370
What he means by a scolding
isn't appropriate to broadcast.

1628
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:40,580
He means a really harsh scolding.

1629
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,140
He's not kidding.

1630
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,140
(What will become of Jong Hun
who volunteered to play twice?)

1631
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,450
Just keep that in mind, Jong Hun.

1632
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,990
Tell us how you divided your teams.

1633
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,680
The first team to go
is Jong Hun and me.

1634
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,060
The first match,

1635
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,620
Jae Suk and Jong Hun
versus Kwang Soo and Se Chan.

1636
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,390
Let's go! I think we're going to
win this round as well.

1637
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:59,970
- You can serve, Jong Hun.
- Not yet.

1638
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,760
- You do it.
- Let's go!

1639
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,740
This is just the beginning.

1640
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,910
(The game starts.)

1641
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:06,910
- There it goes.
- He's good.

1642
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,970
He's pretty good.

1643
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,200
- He's good.
- He's pretty good.

1644
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,280
Take it slow.

1645
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,230
- Hey.
- I got it. Pass it over.

1646
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,040
(Kicking the air)

1647
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,040
(Luckily, Se Chan passed the ball.)

1648
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,140
- It's on the other side.
- We got it.

1649
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,850
- Okay!
- I should've hit it.

1650
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,020
(The ball hit the table,)

1651
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,350
(and Jong Hun kicks it
out of the line.)

1652
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,540
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1653
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:32,520
- That was good.
- Okay.

1654
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,460
- Good job!
- You can do this.

1655
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,560
That was good.

1656
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,100
(Ssaebssaeb played
a remarkable part.)

1657
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,250
He's good.

1658
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,250
Okay.

1659
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,830
(Team Gangwon 0,
Team Gyeongsang 1)

1660
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,460
That was good. Okay.

1661
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,230
It's 0 to 1.

1662
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,730
- That was good.
- Go back up.

1663
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,640
Oh, no. That was...

1664
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,460
(A sudden slapstick)

1665
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,710
- You should've been careful.
- Be careful.

1666
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:53,940
- You should be careful.
- Isn't it your turn to serve?

1667
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,140
- Oh, that's right.
- It's our serve? Okay.

1668
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,850
(The slapstick during the interval
makes the audience happy.)

1669
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:01,190
- I thought it was their turn.
- I see.

1670
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:02,750
- I thought it was theirs.
- Let's play.

1671
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,210
That was a good one.

1672
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,850
- He's really good.
- That was funny.

1673
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:07,920
He's good.

1674
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,790
Do you want to serve? You can serve.

1675
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,460
- It's our turn?
- That was a good one.

1676
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,460
You can serve.

1677
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,960
- You should watch out!
- I'm so sorry.

1678
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,040
- I wanted to kick it hard.
- Be careful.

1679
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,640
- I wanted to kick hard.
- You did?

1680
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,310
- They're good.
- Be careful, guys.

1681
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:25,640
Don't turn this
into "Comedy Big League".

1682
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,100
I think it's good enough
for "Comedy Big League".

1683
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,480
- Right?
- You two make a great team.

1684
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,000
- Isn't he good?
- They do make a good team.

1685
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,640
Let's get on the table
as soon as you serve.

1686
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,270
No, you serve. I'll go up.

1687
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,440
- I will... Shall we do that?
- Yes.

1688
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,850
Kick it high.

1689
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,040
- Make sure to kick it high.
- Okay.

1690
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:38,710
Isn't he really ugly?

1691
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,750
We got it.

1692
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,390
Pass it to me.

1693
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:44,480
(Their strategy is to minimize
their moving range.)

1694
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,560
(Jong Hun calmly receives the ball.)

1695
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,460
- Good. Receive it.
- Block with your head!

1696
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:50,770
- Okay.
- It didn't hit them.

1697
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,290
- Nice one!
- That was great.

1698
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,060
- Let's stick to this strategy.
- That was great.

1699
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,100
Okay.

1700
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,710
- It's okay, it's okay.
- It didn't hit them.

1701
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,730
(Jong Hun is bright
although they lost a point.)

1702
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,440
- It didn't hit them?
- It's okay.

1703
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,040
You're doing great!

1704
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,250
This is really fun.

1705
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,710
Good, I have to stay far back?

1706
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:08,020
- This is really fun.
- Let's play!

1707
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,640
It's like volleyball.

1708
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,660
- Go up!
- You have to receive the ball.

1709
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,750
(Team Gyeongsang
goes up to the table again.)

1710
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Hit them.

1711
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,520
- Okay!
- Yes!

1712
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,620
Is passing the ball between
the legs allowed?

1713
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,290
- This won't do.
- One of us must stay on the ground.

1714
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:24,190
You have to make the ball
touch their body.

1715
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,000
(An in-between-the-legs shot)

1716
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,770
(The ball passed through
Se Chan's short legs.)

1717
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:32,580
One of us must stay on the ground.

1718
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,170
- That was impressive.
- We're doing great.

1719
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,750
He's proud of himself now.

1720
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,640
It's a neck-and-neck match.

1721
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,940
Let's play it well.

1722
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,020
(Sighing)

1723
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,080
Okay. Wait a minute.

1724
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,160
Why did you burp facing me?

1725
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,620
- Why did you do that?
- Come on, you guys.

1726
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,230
I mean, he attacked
his own team member.

1727
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,520
- Come on.
- I couldn't stop.

1728
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,620
It's like a self-destruct.

1729
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,750
(A biological attack
that stimulates the sense of smell)

1730
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,370
I couldn't stop. I'm sorry.

1731
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,390
- You should face the other side.
- I couldn't...

1732
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:57,960
We all had tteokbokki together.

1733
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:59,460
You did, didn't you?

1734
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,460
But that didn't smell
like tteokbokki.

1735
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,940
It is from the tteokbokki.

1736
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,640
(They even take care of
each other's gut health.)

1737
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,980
Gosh, it's getting digested.

1738
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:07,040
Okay.

1739
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,210
- Kwang Soo.
- It'll be out if it hits the net.

1740
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,940
- Be cunning, that's it.
- It'll be out if it hits the net.

1741
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,940
(Be cunning?)

1742
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,980
- Are you doing commentary?
- That's it. Will it be this side...

1743
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,980
or that side?

1744
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,750
Will it be this side or that side?

1745
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:19,850
- Are you doing commentary?
- Will it be this side or that side?

1746
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,850
(Commentator Ji Suk Jin)

1747
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,980
Will it be this side or that side?
No one knows! There you go!

1748
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,020
- Yes!
- All right!

1749
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,120
No one knows! There you go!

1750
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,660
(He scores a point cunningly.)

1751
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,870
- Good job.
- That was...

1752
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:29,920
(Team Gangwon
was thrown into confusion)

1753
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,390
That was impressive, Kwang Soo.

1754
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,060
(His mullet flaps even more
because he's excited.)

1755
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,290
You're the best, Kwang Soo!

1756
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:35,560
Let me throw it this time.

1757
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,100
(After playing the game using
all sorts of cunning tricks...)

1758
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:40,410
It's a match point.

1759
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,350
- You serve, Kwang Soo.
- It's a match point.

1760
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:43,350
(Team Gyeongsang will win
if they win 1 more point.)

1761
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,120
It's hard to pass it gently.

1762
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,210
It's not easy.

1763
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,770
Will it be this side or that side?

1764
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:50,210
You might've thought it's this side,
but it was that side.

1765
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:54,250
- Will it be this side or that side?
- Will it be this side or that side?

1766
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,660
(A rubber ball windmill
on a roll)

1767
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,850
(Dizzy)

1768
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,660
Will it be this side?
It's that side.

1769
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,960
(He finally serves.)

1770
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,620
- Okay!
- Nice serve.

1771
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,270
(The ball hit the table
and went out.)

1772
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:11,100
(Team Gyeongsang takes 1 win.)

1773
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,170
That was a match point.

1774
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:13,310
Well done!

1775
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:15,100
Will it be this side?
It's that side.

1776
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:17,910
- Okay!
- Nice serve.

1777
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:20,750
But that was too...

1778
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,750
You can't call that a serve.

1779
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,710
(After throwing them into confusion,
Team Gyeongsang takes a point.)

1780
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,190
- Good job.
- The serve was...

1781
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:27,660
The table is too high.

1782
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,250
The final round,

1783
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:32,160
Haha and Eun Seok
versus Jong Hun and Jong Kook.

1784
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,790
It's our turn? We can still play?

1785
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:36,060
Let's play.
Give me the ball, please.

1786
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,540
Let's do this. Let's do it.

1787
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,100
- Hey, don't serve nicely.
- Jong Kook is bad at ball games.

1788
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,670
Jong Kook is bad at ball games.

1789
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:46,330
Let's play. It's a combination
of sports I'm good at.

1790
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,710
Can we play a practice round?

1791
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:49,710
Let's practice first.

1792
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,370
- He's pretty good.
- He's good.

1793
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,140
(He heads the ball downward.)

1794
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,980
(He does it again.)

1795
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,730
(The seal show with a bouncy ball)

1796
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:03,750
He is good.

1797
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,690
- Yes!
- Good job.

1798
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,390
- He is good.
- Jong Hun can receive the ball.

1799
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,390
- Jong Hun can receive the ball.
- Good job.

1800
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:10,670
(Which team will win the match?)

1801
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:11,690
Let's begin the match.

1802
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:12,890
- Serve.
- This is the real deal.

1803
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,600
It's okay.

1804
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:16,310
Okay.

1805
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,230
He is good.

1806
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,440
(Okay.)

1807
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,140
(Jong Kook sends over the ball
Haha headed.)

1808
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:23,940
- Okay.
- It's out.

1809
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,750
- It's hard to be at the front.
- You need to kick gently.

1810
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,440
Since it's a bouncy ball,
you need to kick gently.

1811
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,520
Okay, okay.

1812
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,620
Just put your foot against it.

1813
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,210
Jong Kook is too muscular
to be good at it.

1814
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,120
Jong Kook, I am a big fan!

1815
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,710
- Okay, okay.
- I am a big fan of Jong Kook.

1816
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,730
- Just put your foot against it.
- Team Gangwon needs to win.

1817
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:37,750
Okay. Receive it.

1818
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,790
- Okay, okay.
- That's good.

1819
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:39,920
Okay.

1820
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,290
(Jong Kook jumps up instantly.)

1821
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,170
Out.

1822
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:45,060
- Spike it.
- Spike it.

1823
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,140
Jong Kook, spike it.

1824
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,790
- Jong Kook, spike it.
- Okay. I will try again.

1825
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,730
(That's so funny.)

1826
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:53,600
(The funny sight
makes them stifle their laughter.)

1827
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,600
(Eun Seok serves again.)

1828
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:58,440
Again. One more time.

1829
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,480
Send it over.

1830
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:03,540
(He spikes the bouncy ball.)

1831
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,640
There you go.

1832
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,250
(Jong Kook manages to save it.)

1833
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,690
- You can bounce it once more.
- You can bounce it once more.

1834
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,020
- Okay.
- Can we bounce it twice?

1835
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,960
(Jong Kook messes up
3 times in a row.)

1836
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,350
- Okay.
- Can we bounce it twice?

1837
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,770
(Out)

1838
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,230
- You are the best.
- He is so good.

1839
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,830
I was sleeping behind you.

1840
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,790
- Eun Seok is no joke.
- How is he so good at this?

1841
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:22,040
This is a game for Eun Seok.

1842
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,910
- He is like a seal.
- He moves so fast.

1843
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,910
- He is like a seal.
- He is good.

1844
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:26,980
Let's resume.

1845
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,940
- Jong Kook.
- Bounce it.

1846
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:34,350
Yes!

1847
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:37,540
(He charged forward for no reason.)

1848
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:39,850
I should have gone up sooner.

1849
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,580
Jong Kook.

1850
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,580
Is this how you play it?

1851
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,620
(The audience is forced
to stifle their laughter.)

1852
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:47,190
My goodness. My goodness.
I can't watch this.

1853
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:48,420
I can't watch this.

1854
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:49,890
Eun Seok is so fast.

1855
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,890
- Jong Kook is angry.
- I didn't expect him to do well.

1856
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,170
Jong Kook is angry.

1857
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,640
That's short.

1858
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:57,770
(My goodness.)

1859
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:00,100
Our team is better than this.

1860
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,410
- It's okay. You did well.
- Jong Kook is angry.

1861
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,500
Jong Kook is angry.

1862
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,080
- It's okay. You did well.
- Jong Kook is angry.

1863
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:05,310
Jong Kook is forcing a smile.

1864
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,640
He began to show a fake smile.

1865
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,810
- Jong Kook is angry right now.
- That's not true.

1866
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:10,310
All right. It's okay.

1867
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,520
It's okay.

1868
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:13,660
- It's okay.
- Look at Jong Kook.

1869
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,920
- Eun Seok, just do it.
- He became wary of Jong Kook.

1870
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,480
- It's okay.
- Can you handle the consequences?

1871
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,290
- It's okay.
- Look at Jong Kook.

1872
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:20,290
Are you okay?

1873
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,460
- Look at Jong Kook.
- I am okay.

1874
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,770
(I am okay.)

1875
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,730
Go. We need to get used to this.

1876
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,770
Eun Seok is like a seal.
He is good at this game.

1877
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:31,770
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

1878
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:32,910
(Eun Seok serves again.)

1879
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,000
He can handle the ball really well.

1880
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,040
Attack.

1881
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,310
(Nice heading)

1882
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,620
- How are they so good at it?
- Save it.

1883
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:42,440
There you go.

1884
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,250
What is going on?
He is like a national team member.

1885
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:47,460
There you go.

1886
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,920
(The ball went back and forth.)

1887
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,580
What is going on?
He is like a national team member.

1888
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,020
(Slipping)

1889
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,660
What are you doing?

1890
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:58,330
- I...
- You should have received it.

1891
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,730
- For goodness' sake.
- They have bad teamwork.

1892
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,040
- It's okay. What's the score?
- I didn't expect it.

1893
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,270
- It's 6 to 1.
- It's okay.

1894
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:05,480
- Okay.
- They are really good.

1895
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,580
This is fun.

1896
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,310
- Unbelievable.
- This is so much fun.

1897
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,370
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1898
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,770
Let's go, let's go.

1899
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,640
Haha.

1900
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,120
(Running over)

1901
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,190
Haha.

1902
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:20,960
He is lucky too.

1903
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,120
(The master of the foot table tennis
is lucky too.)

1904
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,920
- Okay, okay.
- We will do anything we can.

1905
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,350
- You can't win against them.
- Seriously.

1906
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,350
- Eun Seok is really good.
- That team is really good.

1907
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:30,190
- Eun Seok is no joke.
- How is he so good at it?

1908
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:31,730
This is Eun Seok's game.

1909
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:33,330
Jong Hun won't look
in Jong Kook's direction.

1910
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:35,100
It's okay.

1911
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,330
We aren't kids.

1912
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,210
Why would we play
with a bouncy ball? We aren't kids.

1913
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,230
All right. Match point. Match point.

1914
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:42,850
Jong Hun is all the way in the back.

1915
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:43,870
(It's the match point
for Team Gyeonggi.)

1916
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,750
We aren't used to the game yet.

1917
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,850
(Jong Hun kicks the ball upward.)

1918
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,620
- You can kick it.
- You can kick it.

1919
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,620
(Seeing the ball touch the table
makes Jong Hun halt.)

1920
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,020
- You can save it.
- You can save it.

1921
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,120
You can kick it.

1922
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,420
(With the other team's permission,)

1923
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,390
(he saves the bouncy ball.)

1924
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:05,190
For goodness' sake.

1925
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,040
I mean...

1926
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:10,040
(A home run sends the ball
to the crowd.)

1927
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,170
(Jong Kook launched
the bouncy ball rocket.)

1928
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:12,210
I mean...

1929
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:13,270
My goodness.

1930
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,140
What was that?

1931
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,040
(Even their teammate
bursts out laughing.)

1932
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:19,080
What was that?

1933
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,750
That happened because of the slope.

1934
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,640
Didn't you know about the slope?

1935
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,580
- I can't do this.
- Jong Kook.

1936
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:25,690
I can't do this.

1937
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,960
(This tall member is drunk
on utmost happiness.)

1938
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,620
(He swings his arms
to ridicule Jong Kook.)

1939
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:34,600
- I can't do this.
- Jong Kook.

1940
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,890
I can't do this.

1941
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,230
- I can't even laugh.
- How is Eun Seok so good at this?

1942
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:40,290
- Didn't you know about the slope?
- I can't even laugh.

1943
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,770
It's over.

1944
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:42,940
Eun Seok is incredible.

1945
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,670
- Gosh, that's too bad.
- Eun Seok toyed with them.

1946
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,040
- Seriously.
- That was incredible.

1947
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,410
(Team Gyeonggi placed 1st.)

1948
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,940
- We placed first.
- You did an amazing job.

1949
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:50,980
Hey.

1950
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,810
If there is the World Cup for it,
he will join the national team.

1951
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,890
Touch Jong Kook's back. It's wet.

1952
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,620
He played really diligently.

1953
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,750
- Jong Kook.
- It's not like that.

1954
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,580
It happened because of the heat.

1955
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,160
That's right.
It happened because of the heat.

1956
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,560
Why is your back so hot?

1957
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,750
It's too hot in here.

1958
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,190
Kwang Soo, you should be careful...

1959
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,870
since Jong Kook is mad at you.

1960
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,100
- Why me?
- I didn't say anything.

1961
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,370
You might not be able
to go home today.

1962
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,230
- You are having too much fun.
- You too.

1963
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,670
You too.

1964
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,270
- Me? Why me?
- You should be careful too.

1965
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,600
- I didn't do anything.
- Jong Kook is angry.

1966
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,270
- Don't be flippant.
- Don't be flippant.

1967
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,310
Don't be so proud of being good
at a child's ball game.

1968
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:25,620
- Okay?
- Calm down, Jong Kook.

1969
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,620
Do you want to have a go
on the field?

1970
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,440
I am too scared to play.

1971
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,710
What is this?

1972
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,020
Why is he intimidating us?

1973
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,690
Don't be so proud of being good
at a child's play.

1974
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,250
- Jong Kook is...
- Stop bragging.

1975
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,390
- Jong Kook is a person.
- Seriously.

1976
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,520
Your endless teasing made him
very angry.

1977
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,660
For goodness' sake.

1978
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:42,890
But it was funny.

1979
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,100
- Okay?
- Keep it down.

1980
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,560
Jong Kook said he will play twice
in the beginning.

1981
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,670
Does the team at the bottom receive
zero stamps?

1982
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:49,730
- Does the team receive some stamps?
- Yes.

1983
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:51,730
- It's twice the number, right?
- The first place.

1984
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,870
Pick a member
who won't receive any stamps.

1985
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,480
This step. This step again.

1986
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,850
(Team Gyeonggi members will receive
10 stamps each except for 1.)

1987
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,440
- Show the inside of the spoon.
- I need stamps.

1988
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,040
1, 2, 3.

1989
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:02,940
This is... This is ridiculous.

1990
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,250
(Do Kwon receives 0 stamps again.)

1991
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,190
(Other Team Gyeonggi members
receive 10 stamps.)

1992
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:09,750
I have no luck.

1993
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,660
He doesn't have any stamps.

1994
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,790
- It's twice the number, right?
- Yes.

1995
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,670
You will receive 10 stamps each.

1996
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:17,460
(They receive 10 stamps each.)

1997
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

1998
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,640
We didn't do anything.

1999
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,000
(Smiling)

2000
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,170
We didn't do anything.

2001
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,270
We didn't do anything,
but we still received 10 stamps.

2002
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,870
1, 2, 3.

2003
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,210
- Okay!
- Okay.

2004
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:28,230
(Team Gyeongsang members receive
7 stamps each except for Se Chan.)

2005
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,310
Okay.

2006
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,080
- Seven stamps each.
- Okay.

2007
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,750
Gosh, Se Chan won't receive
a single stamp.

2008
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:36,020
Hooligans
and the rest of the members...

2009
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:37,040
need to write down the number.

2010
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,580
Because Suk Jin is wearing
a hooligan's uniform,

2011
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:39,890
the hooligans look so weak.

2012
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,060
Should I leave or stay on the team?

2013
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,390
- Share your opinions.
- You are...

2014
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,520
- currently a hooligan.
- Should I leave?

2015
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,560
- Make someone else a hooligan.
- Would that be better?

2016
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,500
- So I should write a big number.
- Then you can stay on the team.

2017
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,830
If you make someone else a hooligan,

2018
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:54,370
you will get to join
a three-member team for sure.

2019
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:55,540
- Will that happen for sure?
- Yes.

2020
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,960
That team will receive
twice the number of stamps.

2021
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:58,910
- Suk Jin, it's better to stay.
- What?

2022
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,710
- It's better to stay.
- Is it better?

2023
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:02,540
It's better to save up the stamps
for the last round.

2024
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,580
- You don't need to switch teams.
- Seriously.

2025
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,580
- Save up the stamps...
- That's right.

2026
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:08,790
for the last round.

2027
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:10,580
Look at their facial expressions.

2028
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,290
Both sides make sense.

2029
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:14,310
The two of them are really evil
when they are together.

2030
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,830
This is confusing.

2031
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:17,980
- Suk Jin, you should stay.
- Stay?

2032
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,890
- You should stay.
- It's better to stay.

2033
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:21,520
- Save up the stamps.
- I wrote down a number.

2034
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,690
(Suk Jin listens to their words
and finishes betting.)

2035
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:26,230
Suk Jin is determined.

2036
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,000
- All right.
- Suk Jin made the right choice.

2037
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,270
Suk Jin, reveal your number.

2038
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,440
- 6.
- 6 stamps.

2039
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,940
- Isn't that 9?
- It's 6.

2040
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,040
6. 6.

2041
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,040
Kwang Soo, reveal your number.

2042
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,100
What is it?

2043
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,310
I knew he wouldn't bet many stamps.

2044
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,940
- I knew it.
- Good job.

2045
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,980
Now, use 6 stamps and 1 stamp
respectively.

2046
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:47,810
If you pick someone as a hooligan,
he or she will join Team Gangwon.

2047
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,660
Who will it be?

2048
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,690
(Suk Jin, pick Ji Hyo!)

2049
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:53,560
(Glancing over)

2050
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,190
(Suk Jin sees Se Chan's signal.)

2051
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:58,060
I will send Ji Hyo to that team.

2052
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:01,390
(Ji Hyo gets kicked out
of Team Gyeongsang!)

2053
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,830
- Ji Hyo.
- You made the right choice.

2054
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:04,140
- Come here.
- Come here.

2055
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:06,000
Our team has three members.

2056
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,210
Three members. That's great.

2057
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,540
Six stamps.

2058
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:10,170
I don't know. I don't know.

2059
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:12,310
- It's good news for us.
- It's good news for us.

2060
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,920
Good job. It's okay.

2061
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,810
- Ji Hyo, we will treat you well.
- That's right.

2062
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,190
- Six stamps.
- Eun Seok, reveal your number.

2063
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,290
One.

2064
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,750
- 0.
- 0.

2065
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,690
Eun Seok wrote down the best number.

2066
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:30,420
If you pick 1 of the 3 members
as a hooligan,

2067
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:31,940
- he or she will go to that team.
- Our team?

2068
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,040
- Why?
- Our team?

2069
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,140
That's ridiculous.

2070
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,140
Hold on.

2071
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:36,870
I told you that it isn't over.

2072
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,100
- Eun Seok.
- What I did...

2073
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,410
was meaningless.

2074
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:42,600
You should have told us.
I celebrated for no reason.

2075
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,080
- This is ridiculous.
- I should have bet more stamps.

2076
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:46,980
(What remains is Eun Seok's choice!)

2077
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:50,440
(Who will become a hooligan
and get kicked out of the team?)

2078
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,690
I am sorry.

2079
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:57,330
(So Min gets sent
to Team Gyeongsang!)

2080
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,000
So Min, Haha planned everything.

2081
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,250
(Haha burst out laughing
as if he knew what would happen.)

2082
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,270
I didn't plan anything.

2083
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,370
(Yong Gu looks apologetic.)

2084
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:07,390
(Eun Seok, pick So Min!)

2085
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,460
(Haha is always one step
ahead of So Min.)

2086
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,940
They made me do it.

2087
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:13,980
- I had no choice.
- "They"? I didn't say anything.

2088
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,310
(Ji Hyo and So Min are
the hooligans!)

2089
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:18,170
(2021 Running Man
Neighborhood Athletic Meet)

2090
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:19,870
What is this for?

2091
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:21,620
(This is where they will play
the last game.)

2092
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,690
(It's time to have a match
of strength and speed.)

2093
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:24,480
I can already tell...

2094
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,390
- It will be intense.
- It will be fierce.

2095
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:28,880
(The last game will test
the teamwork and physical skills.)

2096
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:31,220
All right. We developed
the last mission...

2097
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,500
from World Chase Tag, a new sport...

2098
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,060
- that combines parkour...
- It sounds hard.

2099
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,060
and a game of tag.

2100
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,560
It's Catch Me If You Can.

2101
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:41,670
I know what it is.

2102
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:42,910
There will be two taggers.

2103
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,100
Other teams will send in
two members each.

2104
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,910
Thus, six members in total
will play the game.

2105
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:49,250
Four members will run away
and protect their balloons.

2106
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,770
The two taggers...

2107
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:53,270
will try to pop as many balloons
as possible in two minutes.

2108
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,680
(The team that popped the most
number of balloons will win.)

2109
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,840
All teams will each play defense
and offense once...

2110
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,310
- Yes.
- to decide the winning team.

2111
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,630
For your understanding,

2112
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:05,130
- we prepared a video.
- I have seen it.

2113
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:07,390
- These people are professionals.
- That's right.

2114
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:08,930
- They jump.
- It will be hard.

2115
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:11,020
The taggers chase
after other players.

2116
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:12,840
It's a match of stamina.

2117
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:14,930
- It's like a game of tag.
- Then you are out.

2118
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:16,670
The bag...

2119
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,770
Hold on.
Should I ignore what's happening?

2120
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:24,840
Just laugh it off.

2121
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,050
(They finish watching the video.)

2122
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,220
For the first round, the taggers
will be from Team Yellow.

2123
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:34,420
Our team? Okay.

2124
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,790
(The lineup of Round 1,
offense and defense)

2125
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,190
- Get ready.
- Let's go.

2126
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,960
It's a matter of how many balloons
each team pops.

2127
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,390
We should plan well.

2128
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:44,690
Protecting the balloon...

2129
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,710
- Hurry up.
- Over here.

2130
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:53,080
(They chase after Haha
as soon as they begin.)

2131
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:55,100
- They are chasing after one member.
- I got him.

2132
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,180
(They caught him!)

2133
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,510
(But Haha keeps his balloon
out of their reach.)

2134
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,010
- Jae Suk.
- Get it.

2135
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:03,220
Hold on.

2136
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,940
(When Haha drops the balloon,
they pop it!)

2137
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,550
(As soon as Haha's balloon pops...)

2138
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:08,960
He came to them.

2139
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:10,460
Why did you do that?

2140
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,330
Hold out as much as you can.

2141
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:13,800
- Pass it.
- Jae Suk.

2142
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,590
- I got it.
- Did you get it?

2143
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,930
- Gosh, Eun Seok.
- There you go.

2144
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,000
He ran away.

2145
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,300
- Gosh, Eun Seok.
- There you go.

2146
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,300
(He is still running.)

2147
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,670
Hold out until the end.

2148
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,560
(He holds out...)

2149
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,600
(and overpowers Jae Suk.)

2150
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,580
- Hold out until the end.
- Come on.

2151
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,250
Drag it out as long as you can.

2152
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,550
Nice, nice.

2153
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:33,340
Go, go.

2154
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,380
(Kwang Soo's statue of liberty)

2155
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,850
(He began climbing
as soon as the game started.)

2156
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,590
(Even when Haha was getting caught
and backed into a corner...)

2157
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:45,260
(and Eun Seok was holding out
with all his might,)

2158
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:49,630
(he stood tall
in order to survive by himself.)

2159
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:50,970
Go, go.

2160
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:53,560
(They run over to Kwang Soo
because he is an eyesore.)

2161
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,430
(Screaming)

2162
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:58,100
(Popping)

2163
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,630
(He used his height to put himself
at an advantage,)

2164
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:03,140
(but he ends up self-destructing.)

2165
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,010
(Kwang Soo's comedy skit
isn't over.)

2166
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,270
Good job.

2167
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:08,470
Seriously.

2168
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:09,480
I mean...

2169
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,380
(It's so hilarious.)

2170
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,680
(Thanks to Kwang Soo,
they popped 3 balloons.)

2171
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,720
Eun Seok.

2172
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:22,300
(Everyone is out
except for Se Chan!)

2173
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:25,590
(They run toward Se Chan.)

2174
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:28,800
(Se Chan gets caught
since his mouth isn't aerodynamic.)

2175
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,100
- Hold out until the end.
- Hold out.

2176
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,470
Hold out.

2177
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:33,710
We need to save one balloon.

2178
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:35,430
Hold out.

2179
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:38,100
(He gives out orders
after popping his own balloon.)

2180
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,120
This is sad.

2181
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:43,880
(They pop the last balloon!)

2182
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,440
- Okay.
- Nice.

2183
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,980
1 minute and 14 seconds.

2184
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,310
(Team Gangwon's record is
1 minute and 14 seconds.)

2185
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,980
For the second round, the taggers
will be from Team Red.

2186
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,630
The other teams can send in
two members each.

2187
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:53,720
What? Team Red?

2188
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,500
The taggers.

2189
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,000
We are the taggers.

2190
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,500
- So Min.
- The taggers.

2191
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:03,930
- What are we going to do?
- We are the taggers.

2192
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,470
- What are we going to do?
- So Min.

2193
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,540
- What are we going to do?
- Are the two of them the taggers?

2194
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:08,770
- The taggers.
- Yes.

2195
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,300
- Really?
- You can't play twice.

2196
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:13,550
- You should have told us.
- Can't we be the taggers?

2197
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,180
Fools!

2198
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,250
- Suk Jin.
- We are in trouble.

2199
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,090
So Min and I are the taggers.

2200
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:21,010
- Show us what you can do.
- The game won't end.

2201
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:23,160
- We didn't plan this right.
- Seriously.

2202
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:24,550
We are done for.

2203
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,890
- Are you a tagger?
- Yes.

2204
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:28,190
For goodness' sake.

2205
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:30,800
- Let's go.
- Are the two of you taggers?

2206
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:32,690
(It will take them all day.)

2207
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:35,300
I am sorry, but would you give them
two more minutes?

2208
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,730
- Slow! Cross!
- Clumsy!

2209
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:38,730
- We weren't in sync.
- Let's try it again.

2210
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,680
- Slow! Cross!
- Clumsy! Cross!

2211
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,730
(They barely manage to do it.)

2212
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:43,470
(There is no tension whatsoever.)

2213
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:44,770
Ready.

2214
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,880
- Get set...
- Let's go after one.

2215
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,940
Go after Ji Hyo first.

2216
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,790
Go after Ji Hyo first.

2217
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:54,880
(They attack Ji Hyo first since
she is relatively weak.)

2218
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,260
Corner her. So Min, corner her.

2219
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:59,260
(The two weakest members
corner her.)

2220
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:02,260
(Did he catch her?)

2221
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,190
(After cornering her,)

2222
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,560
(he lets her go.)

2223
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:11,630
Why are you guys so slow?

2224
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:13,840
This is fun.

2225
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,270
Why are you guys so slow?

2226
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:17,440
(Ji Hyo is a good girl
who helps her grandpa work out.)

2227
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,510
Stop playing with the grandpa!

2228
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,340
(Suk Jin is too old to catch up
to his granddaughter.)

2229
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,350
(He finally manages
to hold her one hand.)

2230
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,980
So Min, hurry up.

2231
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:28,980
(This sitcom is so funny.)

2232
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:32,690
(But they can't even touch
the balloon.)

2233
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:34,260
Don't try to catch the balloon.

2234
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,550
(Hitting)

2235
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,090
What is this?

2236
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,560
What are you doing?

2237
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,560
- Catch it!
- This is so boring!

2238
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,910
- What is wrong with you?
- Come and chase after us.

2239
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:45,560
What is this?

2240
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,730
Go after someone else.

2241
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:49,470
- Pop it.
- Hold her arm.

2242
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,970
- What is this?
- Hold her arm.

2243
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:53,580
Hold one arm each.

2244
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:55,750
There it is. They did it.

2245
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,090
- We did it.
- Okay.

2246
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,480
(For goodness' sake.)

2247
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,680
(He got slapped by the balloon.)

2248
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,090
What was that?

2249
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:05,130
(He eats a piece of the balloon
for energy.)

2250
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,890
(The tearful balloon slap show
satisfied the audience.)

2251
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:11,800
What is wrong with him?

2252
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,040
(A balloon is enough
to make his fragile body sway.)

2253
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,040
I think the Ji Suk Jin Show is
the most entertaining.

2254
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,970
Suk Jin, pick a member
to chase after.

2255
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:18,370
There you go. Corner him.

2256
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,580
(He takes light steps.)

2257
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,380
(He escapes easily.)

2258
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:26,120
(Gosh, my right atrium.)

2259
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,550
Why didn't you plan better?

2260
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,340
They had to be the taggers.

2261
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,440
I mean...

2262
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,180
I didn't even break into a sweat!

2263
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:34,460
So Min, get in there.

2264
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:36,590
Do Kwon, you look really cool
right now.

2265
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:38,350
(Do Kwon runs across the stadium
as if he is taking a stroll.)

2266
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,460
What am I going to do?

2267
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,690
Are the two of you walking
or running?

2268
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:46,690
(They pick up an obstacle
out of frustration.)

2269
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:48,760
- Suk Jin.
- What are you doing?

2270
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,470
Catch someone.

2271
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:53,080
Suk Jin, stop resting and run!

2272
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,680
Suk Jin, run!

2273
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,100
Catch Jong Kook.

2274
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,440
Catch someone.

2275
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,770
Corner him.

2276
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:00,920
- Corner him.
- I will give you stickers.

2277
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,380
Do Kwon. I will give you stickers.

2278
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,640
Why are you carrying that?

2279
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,120
- I will give you a sticker.
- No, thank you.

2280
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:08,120
Stop taking out your anger
and just pop the balloons.

2281
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:09,980
Do Kwon. I will give you stickers.

2282
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,220
- How many?
- Three.

2283
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,690
Work together and corner someone.

2284
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:14,830
What are the two of you doing?

2285
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:15,870
Suk Jin!

2286
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:17,390
So Min, here.

2287
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,540
- I look really cool, right?
- Catch him.

2288
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:20,540
I am so fast.

2289
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:24,010
(He has no problem escaping
even if he goes between them.)

2290
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,600
(Exhausted)

2291
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,040
What is this?

2292
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:28,680
How did he escape that way?

2293
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,410
Why can't you catch him
when he is running so slowly?

2294
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:31,880
- He is slow.
- This is no fun.

2295
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,970
Haha is doing better than the people
in the video we watched.

2296
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,180
Good luck.

2297
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:37,480
(3 minutes, time over)

2298
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,510
Okay.

2299
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:41,420
What was that?

2300
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:42,790
It was fun.

2301
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,550
- It was fun.
- It wasn't fun.

2302
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:46,260
What was that?

2303
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:49,800
The balloon slap was
so painful earlier.

2304
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,190
- We got one.
- We got one.

2305
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,800
(Round 3 begins with taggers
from Team Gyeonggi.)

2306
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,210
(They attack Se Chan
from the start.)

2307
01:15:58,230 --> 01:15:59,930
- Gosh!
- Throw him down.

2308
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:02,600
That's teamwork.

2309
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,410
(Se Chan is out right away.)

2310
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:05,510
That's incredible.

2311
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:06,770
The left.

2312
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,310
They are fast.

2313
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:09,310
The right.

2314
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:11,010
- They are incredible.
- Take one each.

2315
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:12,050
(Each of them takes on a member.)

2316
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:14,220
- That's good.
- Eun Seok is fast.

2317
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,430
Kick his belly!

2318
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,680
Kick his belly!

2319
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,460
(It's his chance to take revenge
for the past humiliation.)

2320
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,800
Throw him down to the ground.

2321
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,930
(He pops the balloon
by kicking it!)

2322
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:24,220
Help him!

2323
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,520
Help him.

2324
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:26,970
(Jae Suk is the only one left!)

2325
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:28,090
He is on the ground.

2326
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:31,100
(They pop the last balloon.)

2327
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:32,770
Good job.

2328
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:34,410
That was a work of art.

2329
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:36,710
We didn't plan this right.

2330
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:38,410
- They are so fast.
- Why...

2331
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:40,550
- This won't do.
- That was a work of art.

2332
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:41,940
For goodness' sake.

2333
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:43,750
(2021 Running Man
Neighborhood Athletic Meet)

2334
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,340
- Suk Jin.
- We won!

2335
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,480
- Our plan was the worst.
- We failed.

2336
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,960
We didn't think about the taggers.

2337
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,130
Team Blue with a record
of 42 seconds.

2338
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:52,330
(Team Gyeonggi is placed 1st.)

2339
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:55,300
You get 20 stamps each.

2340
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,430
- 20 stamps.
- 20 stamps?

2341
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,340
Did they pop all the balloons
in 42 seconds?

2342
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,690
That's insane.

2343
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:03,470
Then comes Team Yellow with a record
of 1 minute and 14 seconds.

2344
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:05,370
- It was our big break.
- Seriously.

2345
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,410
- Life is all about the big break.
- Okay.

2346
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:08,430
Suk Jin.

2347
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:11,140
- Let's see the prizes first.
- The prizes.

2348
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,140
(The special prizes
for the Lunar New Year)

2349
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,310
It looks delicious.

2350
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:15,750
- It looks delicious.
- It's beef.

2351
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,680
2021 Running Man Neighborhood
Athletic Meet's gold medal goes...

2352
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:23,720
(Who will win the gold medal
and the Korean beef set?)

2353
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:25,220
to Haha.

2354
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,260
(The gold medal goes to Haha.)

2355
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:27,260
Really?

2356
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,430
The gold medal doesn't suit him.

2357
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:29,970
(He wins the gold medal
with 37 trophy stamps.)

2358
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:31,560
That's incredible.

2359
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,590
(Dream, Daddy won the gold medal!)

2360
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:34,760
The silver medal goes to Ji Hyo.

2361
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,260
(Ji Hyo wins the silver medal
with 34 trophy stamps.)

2362
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,560
Mapo-gu!

2363
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:39,340
- Mapo-gu!
- The bronze medal, Jong Kook.

2364
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:40,580
(Jong Kook wins the bronze medal
with 32 trophy stamps.)

2365
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,600
Wasn't there someone else
with more stamps than me?

2366
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:46,440
The penalty goes to Suk Jin
with 14 trophy stamps.

2367
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,880
14?

2368
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:50,880
- You always get the penalty.
- How many weeks is that now?

2369
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,960
This is nothing new.

2370
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,920
I think we can establish that fact
before the shoot.

2371
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,830
The games must be fair...

2372
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:58,760
- because he places last every time.
- It's not like that.

2373
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,050
- Right? The games must be fair.
- It's not like that.

2374
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:03,800
When you bet stamps to decide
who the hooligans will be...

2375
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,590
Don't think about the past.

2376
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:07,090
You didn't bet stamps.

2377
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:09,510
Suk Jin, you can pick a member
to receive the penalty with you.

2378
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:10,910
Really? What did you say?

2379
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:12,430
(The tables have turned.)

2380
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:15,130
I think I saw you do this.

2381
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:17,380
I said that they should get rid
of these games.

2382
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,510
Didn't you do this just now?

2383
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,970
- Seriously.
- No way.

2384
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:22,050
I did this.

2385
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:23,640
Jae Suk became polite.

2386
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,980
- Look at Jae Suk.
- He brought his hands together.

2387
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,260
He is ridiculous.

2388
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,960
You should pick someone
who hates the penalty.

2389
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,330
- That's right.
- Who hates it the most?

2390
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:33,090
It should be someone like Kwang Soo.

2391
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:34,520
- That's true.
- I don't mind the penalty.

2392
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,660
You don't mind it?

2393
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,560
- I mean...
- I choose Kwang Soo.

2394
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,730
Are you serious?

2395
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,540
I choose Kwang Soo.

2396
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,730
I wonder what the penalty will be.

2397
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,130
- Kwang Soo is cool about it.
- That's right.

2398
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:48,510
- You are amazing.
- I didn't know you would accept.

2399
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:50,550
Kwang Soo, you changed a lot.

2400
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:51,800
You are cool.

2401
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,580
- Is that the final decision?
- Yes.

2402
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,640
- I chose you.
- Really?

2403
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,120
- It's you.
- What's the penalty.

2404
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,420
I'll tell you what it is.

2405
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,310
- It's Lunar New Year's Day.
- Right.

2406
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:01,050
This will remind you of the Lunar
New Year's Days of your childhood.

2407
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:02,350
- Dumplings?
- It's kite-flying.

2408
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:03,460
- Kite-flying?
- Wow, kite-flying?

2409
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:06,520
You can go home after flying a kite.

2410
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,660
This is easy.

2411
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,190
I've never tried it before.

2412
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,720
- Bye.
- Bye.

2413
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,220
How did they think of kite-flying?

2414
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:13,230
Gosh, how...

2415
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:16,870
This place looks nice. Okay. Good.

2416
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,040
I'm doing it now.

2417
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:20,800
(Kwang Soo has no idea
how to fly a kite.)

2418
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:23,010
It's about to fly.

2419
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,050
He's such a fool.

2420
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,880
That fool. I'm flying it.

2421
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,510
I'm not like that fool. It's flying.

2422
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,920
(Meanwhile, the fool's kite is...)

2423
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,920
It's flying.

2424
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,090
There's no wind at all.

2425
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,790
What should I do to fly it?

2426
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:42,300
Good. It's time.
I should fly it now.

2427
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,020
Okay.

2428
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:46,340
It's done, right?

2429
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,470
(The kite is flying stably.)

2430
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:51,210
It's flying.

2431
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,210
How did he do that?

2432
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,710
Suk Jin, you completed the mission.

2433
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:56,800
(Suk Jin's penalty is over
only after 18 minutes.)

2434
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,180
- How did you fly it?
- What?

2435
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:59,210
(Suk Jin's penalty is over
only after 18 minutes.)

2436
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,680
I'm going home.

2437
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,810
(Big Nose can get off work now.)

2438
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:02,810
My gosh.

2439
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:04,340
Bye, Kwang Soo.

2440
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,550
See you, Kwang Soo.

2441
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,810
- Help me.
- Bye.

2442
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:10,220
I'm not supposed to get the penalty.

2443
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:11,960
Bye. See you.

2444
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,500
You should help me with this.

2445
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:16,720
Hang on. It's time.

2446
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:18,130
It's flying.

2447
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,040
(It's flying!)

2448
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:24,300
What should I do?

2449
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,600
There's no wind.

2450
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,180
It's flying.

2451
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:32,680
(Making a fuss)

2452
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,680
What is it doing? What's wrong?

2453
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,120
(An unexpected
stunt-flying performance)

2454
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,380
What's wrong with this?

2455
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:43,020
(Kwang Soo's mind is
spinning like his kite.)

2456
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:45,380
Why is it... Darn it.

2457
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:47,690
What should I do? Suk Jin!

01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,670
Super ultra-small investors.

2459
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,970
(A big investor is here.)

(A good chance to make money,
stock investment)

2461
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:55,590
This one.

2462
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:57,040

invest their money.)

2464
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,380
- I'm really nervous now.
- Please. Just this once.

2465
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,210
(The new market is open.)

2466
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,720
(Joy)

2467
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:08,580
(Sorrow)

2468
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:10,510
(Joy and sorrow alternate
in the room.)

2469
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:13,120
(As their opponents show
a high return on investment,)

2470
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,460
(they decide to wait patiently.)

2471
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:15,550
(They need information
for higher rates of return.)

2472
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:17,130
I don't make any moves
before I get information.

2473
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:19,020
- What information can I get?
- Will it rise?

2474

("Tazza: One Eyed Jack"
will be released soon.)

2475
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:23,390
It's "go big or go home".

2476
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:24,590
You told me to keep it.

2477
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:27,230
(But not all the information
is accurate.)

2478
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:28,430
What's there to life?

2479
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,510
(They start risky investments
relying only on information.)

2481
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,100
(Everyone in the world knows this.)

2482
