(This episode is about a simulated
stock investment with toy money.)

00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,480
(Please don't follow their
reckless investment strategies.)

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,230
Today, I'm going
to show you what I can do.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,530
I should win first place.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,330
He's the worst pushover here.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,030
Small investors, come here.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,790
(The stock-investment spree
is sweeping the country.)

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,900
(And small investors are
supporting the stock market.)

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,080
(The stock market is heating up
with a lot of investors jumping in.)

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,900
(I've just started
investing in stocks.)

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,170
(Those who don't invest
in stocks these days are fools.)

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,020

investment craze...)

Gosh, I'm going to teach
you guys a lesson today.

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,560
Hello.

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,880
A lesson about finance.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,420

(Two women who are here
to show what they've got)

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,530
This doesn't seem
like a TV show. Hello.

(Jeoktoma Song Ji Hyo,
Tiger Moth, Jeon So Min)

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,600

- Hello.

00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,270
Hello.

(Moneybag Kim Muscles)

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,810
I said this in the elevator earlier.

27
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,140
He looks like a man who makes
7,000 to 8,000 dollars a year.

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,410
- A new recruit.
- Why would you say that?

29
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,710
He doesn't belong here.

30
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,710
Then how much does he make a month?

31
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,980
600 dollars a month.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,680
- Hey, 600 dollars a month?
- Only 600 dollars.

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,710
That's even lower
than the legal minimum wage.

"I'll work for just my bus fares!"

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,320
600 dollars a month?

36
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,560
All right. You novice investors.

37
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,290
What? Novice investors?

38
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,400
- Hello, novice investors.
- Hey.

Welcome, you novices.

(Smarty-pants Yoo Jae Suk)

41
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,070
Welcome to my investment company.

42
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,670
- I just...
- Welcome.

43
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,170
- arrived from New York.
- What?

44
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,680
(I just arrived from New York.)

45
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,510
- I came from Manhattan.
- You should self-quarantine then.

46
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,600
- Self-quarantine.
- What? Self-quarantine?

47
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,900
You should go.

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,820
- Send him off.
- Please leave.

49
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,510
(Those who make lame jokes
should self-quarantine.)

50

Those who travel overseas
for national events...

51
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,480
- don't have to self-quarantine.
- What's with your shoes?

52
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,790
- You're wearing running shoes.
- Your shoes are ridiculous.

53
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,490
(He's wearing running shoes
with a suit.)

54
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,650
You don't seem
like a professional investor.

55
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,400
This is a new trend
among New Yorkers.

56
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,290
- What? New Yorkers?
- A trend among New Yorkers.

57
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,490
- What?
- We should move busily.

58
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,790
Have you been to New York?

59
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,230
What? New York... Excuse me.
What are you talking about?

60
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,870
You should get your story straight.
What's the deal?

61
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,280
- I have no plan.
- Did you just arrive from New York?

62
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,240
Will you keep saying that or not?

63
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,680
If you will,
you should self-quarantine.

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,050
Let me correct myself.
I'm from Gapyeong.

65
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,910
- Gapyeong?
- That's not so far.

66
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,310
- Gapyeong?
- That sounds a lot better.

67
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,680
All right.

68
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,990
You should've been clear about that.

69
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,280
By the way, you look
nothing like an office worker.

70
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
He's not an office worker.

71
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,620
I work in the private loan business.

72
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,060
Private loan business? I see.

73
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,250
- Private loan business.
- Private loan business?

74
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,690
- Right.
- If you fail to pay him back,

75
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,220
- you'll be in big trouble.
- I work in private loans.

76
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,770
- That means he's a loan shark.
- Exactly.

77
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,800
I got on the wrong road.

78
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,770
You're in the loan business.

79
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,030
- A loan business.
- Right.

80
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,180
He collects money.

81
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,180
Look at your suit.
You don't look like an investor.

82
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,340
I'm a fashionable office worker.

83
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,680
He's just a bully.

84
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,410
- What?
- He's just a bully.

85
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,680
His father runs a tailor shop.

86
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,310
You matched the suit
to your hair color.

87
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,020
No, that's not it.

88
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,890
I just chose this
because spring is coming.

89
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,310
Since the soccer player,
Kim Byung Ji...

90
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,330
No, I'm not like Kim Byung Ji.

91
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,890
- He does look like Kim Byung Ji.
- That's Kim Byung Ji's hairstyle.

92
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,120
- No.
- With a ponytail.

93
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,750
- Just let him be. It's hilarious.
- Okay.

94
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,120
Whatever I wear,
they always talk about my hair.

95
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,590
Are we waiting for Haha?

96
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,400
Hasn't he arrived yet?
Or is he doing some mission?

97
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
He's almost here.

98
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,310
- Seriously?
- Maybe he's doing some mission.

99
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,080
Seriously, it's his mindset
that's a problem.

100
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Weren't you like him
when you were his age?

101
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,710
I came to work a day early
and spent the night there.

102
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,150
- You did?
- Sure.

103
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,150
- I heard you did that on purpose.
- Right.

104
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,310
Because you didn't want to go home.

105
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,120
You got there a day early?

106
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,490
- On purpose?
- Sure.

107
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,890
Suk Jin is really funny.

108
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,090
You know his car. His Jisla.

109
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,720
He recently had his car
wrapped in a unique color.

110
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,490
- Really?
- Right. It's a light gray.

111
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,590
And on his YouTube channel,

112
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,590
he said, "If you see me
on the street, say hi to me."

113
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,500
And since the car
has such a unique color,

114
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,310
a lot of people recognize him
on the streets.

115
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,610
- Right. People recognize him.
- Really?

116
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,500
There's only one car
in that color in the country.

117
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,870
So last week,
he got rid of the car wrapping.

118
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,710
(He ended
the communication himself.)

119
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,890
Why? You should say hi to people.

120
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,410
I guess he hated it.

121
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,620
He's the worst.

122
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,830
- Accept their greetings.
- He has two faces.

123
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,560
How could you...

124
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,930
- I'm sorry.
- You asked them to say hi.

125
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,430
- I'm sorry.
- He asked people to say hi to him.

126
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,770
- You shouldn't be fake like that.
- But when people did...

127
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,770
I did say hello back to them.

128
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,900
You just got rid of the wrapping.

129
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,530
He even paid money to get rid of it.

130
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,900
My nose is running.

131
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,510
- Did he even pay money for that?
- He did.

132
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,300
That's a waste of money.

133
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,880
And it has to be done by an expert.

134
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,510
It took four hours.

135
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,410
So you can't just
take it off yourself?

136
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,450
It took six hours.

137
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,610
So what's the color now?

138
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,450
- It's back to the original color.
- Its original color.

139
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,450
Let's not talk about the color.

140
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,610
Why? I want to say hello.

141
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,420
- It's white.
- Don't say the color.

142
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,190
Is it white?
It's a white car, everyone.

143
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,260
- Don't say that.
- White.

144
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,760
If you see the Jisla on the street,
say hello to him.

145
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,900
Seriously,

146
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,500
he's the worst
middle-aged man I know.

147
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,590
- He's the worst.
- The worst middle-aged man?

148
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,510
- He's here.
- He's here.

149
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,800
Hey.

150
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
- I'm sorry.
- He looks like an office worker.

151
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,510
The thing is...

152
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,580
Did you sleep in?

153
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
That's because...

154
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,020
- You're busy these days.
- Make an excuse.

155
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,380
- Say something.
- I went to Russia for business.

156
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,190
(He makes an excuse
about Russia stammering.)

157
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,550
- Russia?
- What did you do in Russia?

158
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,820
- You can't say that.
- Hey.

159
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,910
Haha, that will get you in trouble.

160
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,130
- That's not it.
- Think about it tying your shoes.

161
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,200
- You should say it as you get up.
- This is serious.

162
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
- Our viewers are mad.
- I'm sorry.

163
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,900
He can't button up the jacket.

164
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,030
It's because he gained weight.

165
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,530
He's so fat now.

166
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,590
He gained a lot of weight.

167
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,210
- What happened?
- He can't button it up.

168
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm sorry.

169
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,660
(I'm sorry.)

170
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,100
He apologized sincerely.

171
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,210
- He really means it.
- I appreciate...

172
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,600
- his sincere apology.
- Things can happen in life.

173
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,520
All right. Today,

174
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,150
we will identify the best stock
investor of Running Man.

175
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,410
It's called Running Man Investment
Contest: Genius Investors Race.

176
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,610
- Investment.
- Investment.

177
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,980
I know nothing about investment.

178
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,400
But it's not like we are
investing in real stocks, right?

179
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,790
Yes, you are.

180
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,160
- We are?
- For real?

181
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,790
- Yes. I'll explain.
- Really?

182
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,270
You all will get
the investment capital,

183
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,210
- 500 dollars in Running Money.
- 500 dollars?

184
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,510
And you will invest
in stocks you want.

185
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,600
The top two members with
the most money will get the prizes.

186
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,280
And the one with the least money
will get a penalty.

187
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
The top two.

188
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,320
You will have three chances
to make investments today.

189
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,110
With your own money,

190
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,460
- you can buy and sell stocks.
- Really?

191
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,220
We reconstructed the stock charts...

192
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,330
based on real stock prices
from 2011 to 2020...

193
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,720
and social issues.

194
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,700
So you can forecast
the stock prices and invest...

195
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,660
considering the social issues
of each year.

196
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,530
- So it's based on the past.
- We're doing this with past prices.

197
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,300
- Right.
- This is...

198
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,880
It sounds fun.

199
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,250
The prices of each stock item...

200
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,900
were randomly chosen
by the crew members...

201
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,610
among the actual prices
of the given year.

202
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,890
The prices can increase
hundreds of times.

203
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,890
You will make investments
on a yearly basis...

204
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,550
from 2011 to 2020.

205
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,760
20 minutes counts
as 1 year in the stock market.

206
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,960
Once a new year begins, stock prices
of the year will be revealed.

207
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,400
With those prices,

208
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,730
you'll predict the stock prices
for the following year...

209
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,400
and make your investment.

210
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,640
That is, you should predict
the stock prices of each item...

211
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,670
that change every year
and make investments accordingly.

212
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,540
And after 10 years, in 2020,

213
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,470
the person with the most assets
will be the winner.

214
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,280
And you will perform two missions.

215
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,910
You will get points
according to your rankings.

216
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,020
With these points, you can
buy the information you need...

217
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,460
- at Information Exchange.
- This is important.

218
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,030
It means you can buy information
regarding stock trading.

219
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,050
- That sounds important.
- It's important. I should buy it.

220
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,070
(Running Daily's stock information
will play an important role.)

221
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,590
First, we will have
a warm-up mission...

222
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,160
to win some points
which you'll use to buy information.

223
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,300
- It starts right away.
- It's all about information.

224
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,510
Information is always important.

225
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,470
This is a warm-up mission to get
points and buy stock information.

226
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,540
It's called Nerve-wracking
Money Bucket Flipping.

227
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,670
Money Bucket Flipping?

228
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,890
Player number 1 and 5 will
start flipping the money buckets.

229
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,190
They will start at the same time.

230
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,330
We place the money buckets
on the table with the R mark on top.

231
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,260
And you're supposed to flip it.

232
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,030
If you get it to stand, you will
pass it to the person next to you.

233
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,420
And the person who ends up
with two money buckets is out.

234
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,900
This is hard.

235
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,640
This is difficult. You should try.

236
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,800
- So if you get caught...
- Right.

237
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,030
Okay. Shall I go first?

238
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,300
Let's start. Ready, start.

239
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,170
Harder. More quickly.

240
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,040
- Gosh, this isn't easy.
- Hard. Push it hard.

241
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,910
- It shouldn't be too hard.
- I can't do this.

242
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,090
You shouldn't push it too hard.

243
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,150
It shouldn't be too hard.

244
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,410
- Okay.
- He did it.

245
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,610
(He flips the bucket
for the first time.)

246
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
All right.

247
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,150
(Next up is Haha.)

248
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,330
Push it.

249
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,130
It should be harder than you think.

250
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,790
- It should be harder.
- Why can't I do this?

251
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,420
Even harder than you think.

252
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,130
You have to do this.

253
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,640
Push it harder than that.

254
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,190
- Push it hard.
- Hey.

255
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,300
Okay!

256
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,510
(Haha did it before Suk Jin.)

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,830
Catch him!

258
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,900
I did it.

259
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,150
- Hurry.
- There you go.

260
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,480
(Jong Kook did it right away.)

261
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,380
Hurry.

262
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,040
- What do we do?
- Hey.

263
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,150
You got it.

264
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,520
(Ji Hyo also did it with one shot.)

265
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,720
- On the first try.
- Hey, Yang Ssaebssaeb.

266
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,810
Hey, here it comes.

267
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,120
(Small Investor Yang is
being pursued aggressively.)

268
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,780
- I think this is broken.
- Do it right.

269
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,190
All right.

270
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,290
Is it my turn?

271
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,900
Se Chan is going to get caught.

272
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,160
I did it. Kwang Soo.

273
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,920
Jae Suk, hurry. Please.

274
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,240
This isn't easy.

275
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,640
Why can't I do this?

276
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,030
Go!

277
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,300
- Catch Suk Jin.
- It's back to square one.

278
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,780
- Let's catch Suk Jin.
- Hey.

279
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,040
- Hurry.
- Push it and move your finger.

280
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,700
- Hey.
- Come on.

281
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,780
Hey.

282
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,070
- It's not working.
- Gosh, it shouldn't be too hard.

283
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,150
It shouldn't be too hard.

284
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,220
Jae Suk.

285
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,040
- Why does he keep doing this?
- Okay.

286
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,020
(Suk Jin succeeds
right at that moment.)

287
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,180
Let's catch Jae Suk.

288
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,420
- Go! Hurry.
- Catch Jae Suk.

289
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,900
(Let's catch Jae Suk!)

290
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,400
- Let's catch Jae Suk.
- We're almost there.

291
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,630
(If he ends up with two buckets,
he's eliminated.)

292
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,900
- Jae Suk is shaking.
- Catch Jae Suk.

293
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,370
Jae Suk's hand is shaking.

294
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,110
(While his hand shakes,
Ji Hyo flips the bucket.)

295
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,330
- Catch Jae Suk.
- We're almost there.

296
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,610
Jae Suk is shaking.

297
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,940
- Catch Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk's hand is shaking.

298
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,850
(Excited)

299
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,120
Catch Jae Suk.

300
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,280
(Jae Suk is eliminated.)

301
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,490
(The poor gamer is eliminated
after one round.)

302
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,320
- We got him.
- He's caught.

303
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,180
Your hand was shaking a lot.

304
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,730
You were trembling.

305
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,150
He's a nervous wreck.

306
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,690
What a coward.

307
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,060
Jae Suk is the last.

308
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,160
You need to eliminate two more.

309
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,930
Jae Suk is the last. Good.

310
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,010
I'm so nervous.

311
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,800
How did they come up with this game?

312
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,900
This is fun.

313
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,300
It's so thrilling.

314
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,940
- Then...
- All right then.

315
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,720
- Haha and...
- Se Chan,

316
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,310
Jong Kook, and So Min will start.

317
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,680
- Okay.
- No.

318
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,150
I'm so nervous.

319
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,620
Ready, start.

320
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,020
Gosh, that was close.

321
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,130
- Gosh, this is...
- Here.

322
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,650
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

323
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,690
Here.

324
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,870
- So Min will get caught.
- It's coming to So Min.

325
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,190
Hurry and send it to me.

326
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,900
- Done.
- Gosh.

327
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,770
So Min and Ji Hyo are really good.

328
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,770
So Min is good.

329
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,900
- Okay.
- Haha.

330
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,900
- Darn it.
- He got two.

331
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,930
(Haha is out.)

332
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,070
- Darn it.
- He got two.

333
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,750
Haha is out.

334
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,520
- Go away, Mr. Dirty Mustache.
- Mr. Dirty Mustache.

335
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,120
Go away, DM.

336
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,750
- DM is out.
- Mr. Dirty Mustache.

337
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,050
- This is simple.
- All right.

338
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,360
Ready.

339
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,230
Start.

340
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,580
(If they survive this round,
they can get more points.)

341
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,760
Hey, this is...

342
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,950
- He did it.
- You shouldn't hurry.

343
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,560
- Go.
- Let's catch Jong Kook.

344
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,100
Okay.

345
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,270
(They succeed so quickly.)

346
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,400
The three of us are really good.

347
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,300
I let my guard down.

348
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,140
- This is really hard.
- I let my guard down.

349
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,400
So Jae Suk is in last place.

350
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,070
- Oh no.
- He's the last.

351
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,350
I'll have to show you.

352
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,750
The last place gets zero points...

353
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,180
to buy information.

354
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,150
- Zero points?
- Oh, dear.

355
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,580
- Haha gets 1 point.
- 1 point.

356
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,950
- And Jong Kook gets 2 points.
- Okay.

357
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,950
And the rest gets five points each.

358
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,600
- Okay.
- That's great.

359
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,150
- Oh no.
- It's hard to flip it.

360
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,470
Just to let you know,
there are two types of information.

361
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,970
Level 1 Information
and Level 2 Information.

362
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,830
You can buy Level 1 Information
with 1 point,

363
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,700
and Level 2 Information
with 3 points.

364
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,770
I'll buy it no matter what.

365
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,830
Let me tell you what it is about.

366
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,240
Level One Information
contains the issues of a company.

367
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,280
But we don't know
how they will turn out.

368
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,780
So you mean they are real events.

369
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,120
Real events of
the corresponding year.

370
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,220
Real events.

371
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,780
But we don't know how
they will affect the stock prices.

372
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,280
If you buy Level Two Information,

373
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,550
you can see whether
the stock price will rise or fall.

374
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,860
- Really?
- Really?

375
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,230
- My gosh.
- Does it say when?

376
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,030
- Okay.
- I have no idea about stocks.

377
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,230
We should buy stocks
at the beginning.

378
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,470
Please change your clothes
and gather again at the exchange.

379
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,560
Okay.

380
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,770
(Now they will begin
the fierce information war.)

381
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,280
Let's go.

382
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,940
I'll show you what I've got today.

383
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,120
You'll see what I can do.

384
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,260
Today, with my golden hands...

385
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,950
Small investors, come here.

386
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,260
Super pushover investors
should go there.

387
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,420
- I'm a small investor.
- Suk Jin.

388
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,400
- What?
- Pushovers should go over there.

389
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,320
(The Running Investors
are gathering around.)

390
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,660
Gosh.

391
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,500
You should teach me a lot.

392
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,560
Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

393
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,900
- Everyone.
- Yes.

394
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,430
You guys are famous
investors of Korea.

395
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,930
(Famous investors of Korea)

396
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,830
Famous investors? I like that.

397
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,880
(They've been acting like investors
with R money for 11 years.)

398
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,750
Are we going back
to January 1, 2011?

399
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,650
Yes. All right.

400
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,350
I don't remember
the price index of that time.

401
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,650
I don't remember
the KOSPI of that time.

402
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,490
- That's when I was in the military.
- Really?

403
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,780
Did you read the newspaper a lot?

404
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,320
- You can't do use your phones.
- Okay.

405
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,230
We are doing this
for a period of 10 years.

406
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,630
It ends with the results of 2020.

407
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,630
What happened in 2011?

408
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,030
- I can't remember.
- I don't remember anything.

409
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,290
Suk Jin seems really excited.

410
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,770
- He looks so thrilled.
- I know.

411
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,470
This place is the stock exchange
where you will make investments.

412
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,170
Investments will be made
on a yearly basis.

413
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,380
20 minutes counts as 1 year.

414
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,850
You can either go to
the Information Exchange...

415
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,150
to buy information
about the next year.

416
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,180
Yes, I want to buy it.

417
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,280
(Level 1 Information
offers comprehensive information.)

418
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,410
(Level 2 Information
offers detailed information.)

419
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,760
I can't ask questions...

420
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,860
- when I don't know anything.
- I know, right?

421
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,490
- I have no idea.
- You know nothing about stocks.

422
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,630
I don't know anything.

423
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,950
Or you can buy stocks
at your Stock Exchange.

424
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,400
I should see what it is like
in 2011 first.

425
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,530
- Right. We should see what's what.
- We should.

426
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,370
You have 500 dollars each
in your bag.

427
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,510
I have no points to buy information.

428
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,770
So I should just follow my guts.

429
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,970
You can do that.

430
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,400
Or you can pay money
and buy information from others.

431
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,430
Can we do that?

432
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,440
Can we share information
with others?

433
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,750
Yes. But the information isn't...

434
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,020
written on paper.
You can only read it once.

435
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,890
- We have to memorize it then.
- So they can lie about it.

436
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,040
We should share
information together.

437
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,720
- What happened in 2011?
- I won't get it even if I read it.

438
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,910
I don't remember.

439
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,320
I'll show you
the stock prices in 2011.

440
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,920
Pull up the prices.

441
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,690
- A Entertainment?
- My gosh.

442
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,950
Are they real
entertainment agencies?

443
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,030
Yes, they are.

444
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,730
C IT.

445
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,660
You'll get 20 minutes now.

446
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,160
You can start stock trading now.

447
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,400
Can we start?

448
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,330
(The 2011 Stock Market)

449
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,750
C IT.

450
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,040
- It's three dollars.
- IT.

451
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,040
- Biotechnology.
- You can start stock trading now.

452
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,220
Can we start?

453
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,410
- What?
- What's that?

454
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,990
- I'll invest all my money.
- One of us should...

455
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,650
- I think I know what it is.
- Jae Suk.

456
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,760
There's one thing I know.

457
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,990
- Hang on.
- Now...

458
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,150
- One of them is...
- This is...

459
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,050
Can I decide...

460
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,190
- whether to invest or not?
- Sure.

461
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,130
There's a shipbuilding company
whose stock price is 250 dollars.

462
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,030
What is this? What is 250 dollars?

463
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,160
- Is it per share?
- Per share.

464
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,700
Let me explain.

465
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,370
These are the prices of one share.

466
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,700
(The investment clock
of 2011 is ticking even now.)

467
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,170
I have 500 dollars. A Entertainment.

468
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,170
Hey, Jae Suk.

469
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,040
Come here. You...

470
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,260
What year did we
join the entertainment agency?

471
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,810
When did you join your agency?

472
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,820
(He takes advantage of his career
and checks entertainment companies.)

473
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,550
- I can't tell you that.
- What year was it?

474
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,760
- I'll share information with you.
- You will?

475
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,030
Wait. What year was that?

476
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,970
What happened in 2011?

477
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,400
- What did I do?
- That's when he started it.

478
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,060
We started
Running Man in 2011, right?

479
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,570
This is what was good back then.

480
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,800
(This is what was good back then.)

481
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,880
The small investors are gathering.

482
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,350
The small investors are
gathering around.

483
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,540
We have a source.

484
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,750
- You should tell me too.
- The food company.

485
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,520
There were some chips...

486
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,720
that were popular back then.

487
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,730
The entertainment and beauty
industries were good in 2011.

488
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,860
(Serious)

489
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,080
The entertainment industry
wasn't doing well back then.

490
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,400
Hang on.

491
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,230
- IT.
- What's biotechnology?

492
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,970
Biotechnology is...

493
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,820
- You know...
- Biotech.

494
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,560
It has something
to do with the human body.

495
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,740
- Like medicine?
- Biotech.

496
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,870
Like life science.

497
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,030
- Medicine?
- It involves medicine.

498
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,380
What's IT?

499
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,570
IT? IT is...

500
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,700
semiconductors.

501
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,200
Semiconductors.

502
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,440
(He learned everything about
stock investment in one day.)

503
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,890
(The 2011 Stock Market)

504
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,810
The chemical industry did well too.

505
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,760
All right then.

506
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,420
(Jae Suk tries to recall
his memories and starts trading.)

507
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,490
In 2011,

508
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,860
I have to buy stocks...

509
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,030
- in beauty companies.
- Why is this only three dollars?

510
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,530
I should follow what Jae Suk does.

511
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,900
I'll buy two shares.

512
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,030
And I'll buy one share
in the chemical company.

513
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,700
Chemical.

514
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,410
(Kwang Soo invests
by eavesdropping.)

515
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,740
I'll spend 500 dollars
on the chemical company.

516
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,570
- All of it?
- Yes.

517
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,980
(All his money in one company?)

518
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,840
- You can buy up to 12 shares.
- Wait.

519
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,420
The food company's
stock price rose too.

520
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,780
- G Foods.
- G Foods?

521
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,350
Three.

522
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,810
And I'll spend the rest in H Beauty.

523
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,930
H Beauty.

524
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,430
I...

525
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,500
- Why are you watching me?
- No, I wasn't.

526
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,930
- What...
- I'll follow you.

527
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,270
- Don't look at me.
- I have no information.

528
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,090
- These two.
- Are you done?

529
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,700
- I have 20 dollars left, right?
- Yes.

530
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,130
Six shares of B Entertainment.

531
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,240
- Six shares?
- Yes.

532
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,300
All right.

533
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,140
Hello, Hyeong Gu.

534
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,810
I'm the biggest investor here.

535
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,480
This is your chance to make money.

536
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,380
I'll invest 100 dollars
in I Chemical.

537
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,690
(The self-proclaimed big investor
starts his investment.)

538
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,050
Gosh, you startled me.

539
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,230
Why are you being like this?

540
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,350
What did I do?

541
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,590
You're distracting me
when I'm trying to make investments.

542
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,700
I'm done already.

543
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,170
I can't make investments like this.

544
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,740
- I think you saw what I did.
- Because I had no information.

545
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,200
Don't call me Beanpole.

546
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,530
You beanpole.

547
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,300
The Information Exchange is open.

548
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,360
You can buy information there.

549
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,740
I should buy information.

550
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,540
Hello.

551
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,710
(I'm here to buy information.)

552
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,220
F Biotechnology.

553
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,720
I need information
about F Biotechnology.

554
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,140
You can choose either
Level 1 and Level 2.

555
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,920
1 point for Level 1
and 3 points for Level 2.

556
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,520
- I'll buy Level 1.
- Level 1?

557
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,990
(So Min buys Level 1 Information
about F Bio and H Beauty.)

558
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,160
"Running Daily, 2012"

559
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,700
"The anti-cancer medicine
developed by the subsidiary..."

560
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,970
"of F Biotechnology
raised expectations."

561
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,390
(Both are positive facts,)

562
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,820
If it raised expectations,
it's a good thing.

563
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,790
(but it's hard to predict how
they'll affect the stock prices.)

564
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,860
I'd like to buy
F Biotechnology's shares.

565
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,300
I'll buy 200 dollars' worth of them.

566
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,180
And one share of H Beauty as well.

567
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,210
Level 2 information on H Beauty.
I should use 3 points.

568
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,750
I mean, I have five points.

569
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,810
Thanks.

570
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,880
"Its stock price rose..."

571
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,080
"due to its aggressive expansion
in Southeast Asia."

572
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,380
"H Beauty launched a new product."

573
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,080
(The Level 2 information mentioned
the increase in the stock price.)

574
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,550
Okay.

575
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,850
(That's good.)

576
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,930
- I'll be off.
- Okay.

577
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,670
I knew it. K-beauty has been popular
since then.

578
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,790
Where were you?

579
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,000
I got some information
on the stock market.

580
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,130
- Did you?
- Yes.

581
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,130
- You're smiling happily.
- Pardon?

582
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,740
I want this to be private.

583
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,070
(Ji Suk Jin Stock Exchange)

584
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,140
I'd like to buy...

585
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,250
H Beauty's...

586
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,450
(He's talking quietly
to keep it confidential.)

587
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,750
I'll buy as many shares of H Beauty
as I can.

588
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,920
- As many as possible.
- Is this your final decision?

589
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,520
Yes, it is. I won't change my mind.

590
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,760
(He decided to spend all his money
to buy H Beauty's shares!)

591
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,030
Gosh. I'm a super good investor,
but I can't decide...

592
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,120
- Can I get information as well?
- Se Chan.

593
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,170
You can buy it.

594
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,170
- Shall I give you a gift?
- Yes, please.

595
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,890
- It's perfect.
- But I think...

596
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,060
- Go all-in for the entertainment.
- Pardon?

597
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,130
An entertainment agency.

598
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,870
Not the one whose share price is
three dollars.

599
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,410
Invest all your money in a company
whose share price is 20 dollars.

600
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,600
- That company?
- Yes.

601
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
That's the only thing I know.

602
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,780
- There are three in total.
- I'm giving you a gift.

603
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,480
Invest all your money
in that company as I said.

604
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,990
- You trust me, right?
- Okay. I'll see you later.

605
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,450
- It's not like that.
- In what year...

606
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,460
(Yang Se Chan's Account Balance)

607
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,990
I'll buy additional shares of
B Entertainment worth 130 dollars.

608
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,320
Additional shares of B Entertainment
worth 130 dollars...

609
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,790
- I already bought its shares.
- So Min.

610
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,350
So Min, shall I give you a gift?

611
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,670
- I got some information.
- Yes, please.

612
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,890
- You want it or not?
- Yes. I got two tips too.

613
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,890
- Really?
- Yes.

614
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,030
How about we share our information?

615
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Sounds good.

616
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,630
(I got her!)

617
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,250
Go all-in
for the entertainment agencies.

618
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,040
- The entertainment agencies?
- Yes.

619
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,450
- Do you want to finalize it?
- No, wait.

620
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,610
I want one share of A Entertainment.

621
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,720
- Is that all?
- Yes. This is turned off.

622
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,020
(She bought shares of the 2
entertainments as Big Nose advised.)

623
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,310
- Is this your final decision?
- Yes. Thank you.

624
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,730
(While Suk Jin was trying to lure
So Min into an investment,)

625
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,430
(Jae Suk overheard the fake
information Suk Jin told.)

626
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,230
I'll buy shares
of B Entertainment...

627
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,970
worth the amount of money
I have left.

628
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,170
(He bought B Entertainment's shares
with the money he had left.)

629
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,630
You have to pay 500 dollars.

630
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,530
Gosh, seriously.

631
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,940
(Se Chan, So Min, and Jae Suk
were fooled by the fake news.)

632
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,510
I have done this before.

633
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,410
I don't know...
Can you give me a minute?

634
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,640
I don't know anything
about stocks.

635
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,980
If you tell me the company
and the number of shares,

636
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,880
you can buy as many shares
as you can with your money.

637
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,380
(Oh, I see.)

638
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,990
Then I'll buy both C and D.

639
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,460
How many shares
would you like to buy?

640
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,230
- How many shares?
- The number of shares.

641
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,460
(When people like her start buying
the stocks, the price will go down.)

642
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,090
I know nothing
about stock investment.

643
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,730
What if...

644
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,390
I become addicted to it
in the future?

645
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,670
This is driving me nuts.

646
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,300
- First...
- Yes.

647
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,270
I don't know.

648
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,300
I'll spend all the money I have
to buy H Beauty's shares.

649
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,340
(Jong Kook is also done
buying shares!)

650
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,540
I'll just buy a share
of only this IT company.

651
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,680
- Just one?
- Yes.

652
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,380
You must not try to perfectly guess
the highs and lows,

653
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,040
but some people become too greedy.

654
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,580
- You see, I always...
- Suk Jin,

655
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,020
you seem so confident.

656
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,780
- I...
- Right.

657
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,820
I always bought the highest
and sold the lowest.

658
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,120
I have had a bad experience.

659
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,120
That was such great information.

660
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,770
Jae Suk, you couldn't
get any, right?

661
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,170
- Get what?
- Information.

662
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,670
I don't need any information.

663
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,240
I trust my hunches.

664
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,130
I hope your hunches are right.

665
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,570
I trust myself and nothing else.

666
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,780
- That's ridiculous.
- Right.

667
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,910
I just trust myself.

668
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,140
- I see that.
- Everyone!

669
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,020
There's a famous quote
regarding stock investment.

670
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,280
"Do not put all your eggs
in one basket."

671
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,920
That means you shouldn't go all-in
for one company.

672
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,720
- Then why did he go all-in?
- Bear that in mind.

673
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,760
Why did you put all your eggs
in one basket?

674
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,730
That's my style.

675
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,760
- His nickname is Silly Basket.
- "Silly Basket"?

676
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,030
(He always goes all-in for 1 thing.)

677
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,030
It's because he always puts
all he has in one basket.

678
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,620
I should sell my shares
when the price goes down, right?

679
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,330
That's up to you. John Lee said,

680
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,010
"Hold on to blue ship stocks."

681
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,180
- Holding?
- Yes.

682
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,830
I invested all the money I had
in shares.

683
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,100
I'm done.

684
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,140
This is so difficult.

685
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,370
How many companies
did you invest in?

686
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,750
- I went all-in for 1.
- Just 1 company?

687
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,310
- I'll tell you the key point.
- What company?

688
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,750
- Sorry?
- In what company did you invest?

689
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,720
You must think long term.
No day-trading.

690
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
- Is that so?
- Yes.

691
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,580
- Then...
- Don't sell your shares next year.

692
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,550
Buy shares to hold on to until 2020.

693
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,430
- People can be...
- But the price may go down.

694
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,760
- swayed by rumors.
- It may drop sharply.

695
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,270
They're exchanging information
without knowing the stock market.

696
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,170
Listen. Stocks prices... Jae Suk,
stock prices are like waves.

697
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,030
When they go up, there will be
a time when they go down.

698
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,800
And when they go down,
that's when they go back up.

699
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
- Hey.
- Hold on to it!

700
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,830
Let's...

701
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,130
Hold on to it.

702
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,540
Keep holding on to it.

703
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,640
Let's just go for it!

704
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,780
- Go up!
- Let's go for it whatever happens.

705
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,110
- You small fries.
- What?

706
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,450
- I realized something about it.
- What is it?

707
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,550
It makes me have hope.

708
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,610
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

709
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,760
- It gives me hope.
- Of course.

710
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,320
It's a meaningless hope though.

711
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,050
- Your life can change overnight.
- Bo Pil!

712
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,460
Hey! 2012 is coming soon.

713
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,850
- Here we go!
- It's around the corner.

714
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,470
- Come on.
- Is it already 2012?

715
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,170
- What did I do in 2011?
- This is fun.

716
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,240
I think IU released
"Good Day" at around that time.

717
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,330
I'm pretty sure of it.

718
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,330
Why would you bring
the music industry up?

719
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,630
- What do you mean by that?
- We're investing in stocks.

720
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,440
I'm giving you the information.

721
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,640
- But...
- It's related to the company...

722
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,250
- we invested in.
- He's working in the TV industry.

723
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,920
Every entertainment agency is
different from one another.

724
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,280
- We all should...
- Merger and acquisition...

725
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,340
You guys are obsessed
with petty issues,

726
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,040
and that's a problem.

727
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,250
I'll tell you what you should
think about.

728
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,550
- Jae Suk.
- Who was...

729
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,220
- the president in that year?
- He can't understand what you say.

730
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,320
Should we consider things like that?

731
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,550
Also, think of the biggest events
that happened...

732
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,890
in 2011.

733
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,000
- Should we consider social issues?
- Yes.

734
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,050
Those things are
what you must consider.

735
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,060
Then is it possible that I
hit the jackpot while waiting?

736
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,670
- Yes. But it may go down too.
- I see.

737
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,500
The price may drop sharply,
but shares won't become garbage.

738
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,600
Right.

739
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,800
- It's garbage when it's delisted.
- You're right.

740
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,070
- But it may be delisted too.
- Am I right?

741
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,410
If a company listed on KOSDAQ
remains in the red for four years,

742
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,340
- it is reevaluated.
- He sounds like an expert.

743
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,480
- And...
- By the way...

744
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,250
- Then why did he lose money?
- You see... Listen, everyone.

745
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,610
In my entire life, I bought shares
that got delisted later three times.

746
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,110
- And I was a member...
- You're...

747
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,160
You're bragging about it?

748
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,260
of an online forum,
and my ID was "Red Hand".

749
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,160
Why "Red Hand"?
Wasn't it "Blue Hand"?

750
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,230
No, it wasn't.

751
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,930
It's because he had to stop
a nosebleed so many times.

752
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,470
- He stopped a nosebleed...
- Not to let others know.

753
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,170
with his hand so many times.

754
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,710
It's almost 2012.

755
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,100
- It's almost 2012.
- We'll hear the New Year's bell.

756
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,300
The New Year's bell will ring soon.

757
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,300
(Who achieved the highest returns
in 2011?)

758
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,210
The New Korean Wave expanded...

759
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,920
(And which stocks will give wings
to the hopes of the investors?)

760
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,140
Pyeongchang won
an overwhelming victory.

761
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,990
(2012 will begin.)

762
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,110
I wonder how it will turn out.

763
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,380
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

764
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,120
2012 has begun.

765
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,790
Please reveal the stock prices
in 2012.

766
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,560
Happy New Year, everyone!

767
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,030
(He eavesdropped on others
and invested in I Chemical.)

768
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,440
Please reveal the stock prices
in 2012.

769
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,770
The prices will be revealed.
Let's find out.

770
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,910
The prices will be revealed.

771
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,910
(Who will be happy
after the prices are revealed?)

772
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,480
(A Entertainment: 10 percent up,
B Entertainment: 900 percent up,)

773
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,710
(C IT: 17 percent down,
D IT: 33 percent down,)

774
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,800
(G Foods: 17 percent down,
J Shipbuilding: 20 percent up,)

775
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,950
(B Entertainment: 900 up, H Beauty:
20 up, I Chemical: 25 down)

776
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,570
- It went up.
- B Entertainment rose 900 percent?

777
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,640
- It went up.
- B Entertainment stock...

778
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,920
- rose 900 percent?
- Give me my money back.

779
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,720
(B Entertainment stock increased
by 900 percent!)

780
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,080
It rose 900 percent?

781
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,350
- It rose 900 percent?
- Give me my money back.

782
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,590
Give me my money back!

783
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,320
- My, J Shipbuilding stock...
- Hey.

784
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,590
B Entertainment stock
rose 900 percent?

785
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,790
(B Entertainment stock that Suk Jin
lied about actually rose.)

786
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,630
- It went up.
- It rose 900 percent?

787
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,530
(He's excited,
but he can't scream in joy.)

788
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,970
Stock prices are like waves.

789
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,570
When they go down,
they go back up again!

790
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,280
- How did B Entertainment do...
- Gosh. I went all-in.

791
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,680
- How did the price...
- I went all-in.

792
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,750
increase by 900 percent in 1 year?

793
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,840
(Those who were fooled by Suk Jin
hit the jackpot!)

794
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,810
- I think I bought B Entertainment.
- Did you?

795
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,080
- I bought B Entertainment, right?
- If only I bought...

796
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,520
50 dollars' worth of
B Entertainment's shares...

797
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,380
- What is it?
- Did you buy its shares?

798
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,490
I bought 100 shares.

799
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,790
- B Entertainment?
- Check the rate of return.

800
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,530
- What's his rate of return?
- 540 percent!

801
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,930
540 percent!

802
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,000
(He became rich
with a 540 percent rate of return!)

803
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,060
I think I did well.

804
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,130
My rate of return is 540 percent.

805
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,410
How did it happen?

806
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,670
540 percent?

807
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,330
- They're now worth 2,700 dollars.
- That's unbelievable.

808
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,250
- 2,700 dollars.
- My gosh.

809
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,750
I invested my money
in B Entertainment!

810
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,610
Is that true?

811
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,990
Right after IU released her song
"Good Day".

812
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,250
(10 years after the release
of IU's "Good Day",)

813
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,460
(Se Chan is having a good day
with R money.)

814
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,220
I invested in A Entertainment.
Why didn't it go up higher?

815
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,280
(So Min also earned
328 percent profit.)

816
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,260
This is awesome.
It's hard to believe.

817
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,260
I hit the jackpot.

818
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,160
I struck gold.

819
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,030
(Whispering)

820
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,290
All my stocks went up.

821
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,390
- B Entertainment...
- Everyone else bought it.

822
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,170
Did you buy it too? Did you?

823
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,100
(How sweet.)

824
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,830
(Jae Suk earned
a 59 percent return.)

825
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,140
- Everyone else bought it.
- Hey!

826
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,910
Kwang Soo earned a profit.

827
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,420
He earned 42 dollars.

828
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,920
I invested in the same companies
as Jae Suk.

829
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,340
I expected a profit.

830
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,610
Hey, Ji Hyo lost 100 dollars.

831
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,460
Hey, don't look.

832
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,780
Gosh. At the last minute...

833
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,850
(I wish I had known
what I know now.)

834
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,320
(The person who caused the gust
earned only a 20 percent profit.)

835
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,390
(Jong Kook earned
a 20 percent profit.)

836
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,560
(He earned a profit,
but feels like he lost money.)

837
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,500
- I think I might...
- That...

838
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,410
get hooked on stock investment.

839
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,130
- I'm worried.
- Right.

840
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,330
This is so much fun.

841
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,330
(She finally learned the fun
of stock investment.)

842
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,250
When you invest in stocks,

843
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,340
you often get jealous.

844
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,420
When you see others' success,

845
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,810
you get jealous. Am I right?

846
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,540
(He feels jealous
whenever the stock market closes.)

847
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,280
I didn't know I would feel this way,
comparing myself to others.

848
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,990
I earned a profit too.

849
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,230
Nevertheless, seeing those who
earned more than 100 percent,

850
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,850
I feel like I lost my money.

851
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,620
(This is why it's important
to stay calm.)

852
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,860
So this is how it feels.
I know now.

853
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,130
(January 11, 2012)

854
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,170
(The stock market for 2012
has opened.)

855
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,770
Should I buy some information?

856
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,470
(Kwang Soo earned 8 percent.)

857
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,870
They say you should
hold on to your stocks.

858
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,980
I should sell I Chemical stocks
no matter what.

859
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,340
(But I should sell
I Chemical stocks.)

860
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,140
I'm going to buy some information.

861
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,040
But they say you should
hold on to your stocks.

862
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,490
(He told himself to focus on
long-term investments.)

863
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,690
I'll buy Level One information
on H Beauty.

864
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,760
I'll buy its shares
if it's likely to go up.

865
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,350
I should buy something
that will go up.

866
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,820
(The tall investor became impatient
and plans to sell I Chemical.)

867
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,820
"H Beauty."

868
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,820
"The marketing
and legal costs increased."

869
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,290
What does this mean?

870
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,240
Just take it literally.

871
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,130
Does it mean the stock price
will go up or down?

872
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,130
Read it again and...

873
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,240
When the legal cost increases,

874
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,140
- does the stock price go up?
- I can't tell you that.

875
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,340
I should ask someone else.

876
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,340
(I should ask someone else.)

877
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,490
What does it mean?

878
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,780
- Jae Suk, if the marketing...
- Yes?

879
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,820
and legal costs increased...

880
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,080
When a company carries out
a lot of marketing activities,

881
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,120
it would obviously cost
a lot of money,

882
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,620
but it could also increase
the sales.

883
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,530
Okay. Think about your agency,
King Kong by Starship.

884
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,940
Let's say they put up
billboards that promote you...

885
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,370
to make you a star.

886
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,250
- It must cost them a lot of money.
- Yes.

887
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,520
But they do that
because it's effective.

888
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,340
So the advertising cost would be
a loss, but they can make...

889
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,540
- a profit from it, right?
- A profit.

890
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,950
But you don't know how it will
affect the stock price.

891
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,850
Then... Okay.

892
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,260
Oh, that's what they mean
by marketing costs.

893
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,500
First, I'll sell all the shares
of I Chemical.

894
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,790
And H Beauty...

895
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,930
- Do you want to buy its shares?
- Yes, I'll buy its shares.

896
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,030
(Yoo Jae Suk's Account Balance)

897
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,170
(Jae Suk got information
on H Beauty from Kwang Soo.)

898
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,240
H Beauty.

899
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,510
- I'll buy as many as I can.
- H Beauty's shares?

900
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,780
I'm so upset. I'll hold on to
A Entertainment's shares.

901
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,280
Stock prices always fluctuate,
you know.

902
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,070
A Entertainment is...
Maybe its stocks...

903
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,110
(The 2 men with no experience
in investments discuss stocks.)

904
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,540
(Laughing)

905
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,920
(They laugh too
out of embarrassment.)

906
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,380
- I know how this must look.
- Join us.

907
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,990
- We know nothing about stocks.
- Gosh.

908
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,780
It's really funny.

909
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,460
- The two of us who know nothing...
- I haven't seen people...

910
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,660
checking the stock prices
in a while.

911
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,500
They're exchanging information
when they know nothing about stocks.

912
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,770
I think that biotechnology started
booming in 2016.

913
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,100
I should buy shares in biotechnology
companies before 2016.

914
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,510
I'll go with
biotechnology companies.

915
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,040
I think the entertainment companies
will go downhill.

916
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,570
The IT companies' stock prices
went down so much too.

917
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,720
If its stock is 300 dollars,
that means it's a blue-chip stock.

918
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,960
It's definitely a blue-chip stock.

919
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,110
But I think I should keep
H Beauty stocks longer.

920
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,660
K-beauty became
more and more popular.

921
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,660
(He's recalling his stock history
with a serious look on his face.)

922
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,000
It became more and more popular.

923
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,820
You do have a lot of information.

924
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,930
Yes, I do.

925
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,170
- I don't need to buy information.
- Okay!

926
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,390
I'd like to buy
F Biotechnology's shares.

927
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,240
(Using his own big data, he decided
to invest in F Biotechnology.)

928
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,270
As many as I can.

929
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,240
(B Entertainment's major shareholder
is buying information.)

930
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,370
I'd like to get
the Level Two information.

931
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,250
(Se Chan wants to see if he should
keep B Entertainment's shares.)

932
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,810
Really? It drops in 2013, right?

933
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,810
(It's going to crash!)

934
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,450
Gosh. Okay.

935
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,080
(The useful information
made him smile happily.)

936
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,190
It will go down.

937
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,230
This is so much fun!

938
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,090
I want to sell all the shares
of B Entertainment.

939
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,320
Okay. All of them have been sold.

940
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,390
I'd like to buy 1,000 dollars' worth
of G Foods' shares.

941
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,770
- 1,000 dollars?
- Yes.

942
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,300
This feels like
actual stock trading.

943
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,630
- What should I buy?
- B Entertainment.

944
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,410
- What?
- Hold on to it for two more years.

945
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,480
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

946
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,840
- Okay.
- B Entertainment...

947
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,540
- I was going to sell it.
- No, hold on to it.

948
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,570
Did you earn a lot?

949
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,280
Well, it's not bad.

950
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,020
- You did well.
- You're not allowed to see this.

951
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,280
- Hold on to it.
- Okay.

952
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,080
Make sure to hold on to...
When a stock goes up,

953
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,920
you should hold on to it longer.

954
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,350
- Not selling it?
- No.

955
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,660
Why would you sell it
when it's going up?

956
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,350
(He leaves after putting
the naive novice in trouble.)

957
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,230
- You got information, right?
- Yes. Kwang Soo.

958
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,530
Did you buy any stocks?

959
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,130
- What is it?
- I got Level Two Information.

960
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,390
I remember it surged one time.

961
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,030
- B Entertainment stock will go up?
- Definitely.

962
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,170
It will go up even higher?

963
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,480
Yes. It will keep going up
until next year.

964
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,630
Don't sell it.

965
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,710
(Kwang Soo is getting fooled again.)

966
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,710
- I'm telling you the truth.
- It will go up higher?

967
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,710
Yes, it'll keep going up.

968
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,920
I'll sell D IT.

969
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,040
(Ji Hyo invested in B Entertainment,
C IT, and H Beauty.)

970
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,640
H Beauty and...

971
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,450
(Jong Kook decided to
hold on to H Beauty's shares.)

972
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,350
I'll keep the shares of H Beauty.

973
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,350
(H Beauty, 100 dollars, 5 shares)

974
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,350
(I'll go with C IT.)

975
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,960
I'll go with C IT.

976
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,000
It's not like I'm guessing
on an exam.

977
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,590
What am I doing?
Gosh, I'm so frustrated.

978
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,360
F Biotechnology,

979
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,440
B Entertainment,

980
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,330
and G Foods.

981
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,630
Guys, days are passing by.

982
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,630
- Days are passing by.
- I can't wait.

983
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,950
(They're all waiting
for the next year's market.)

984
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,180
It makes me expectant somehow.

985
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,310
I'm a little excited.

986
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,610
- This is just a game.
- My gosh.

987
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,040
- It makes me expectant.
- This is so much fun.

988
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,280
I think I have potential.

989
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,550
- I don't think you do.
- You're wrong.

990
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,660
- This is what worries me.
- Did you earn a profit?

991
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,880
If So Min or Se Chan...

992
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,890
wins the contest,

993
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,790
they will think they really are
good at this.

994
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,500
So...

995
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,030
They will open an account
for stock trading right away...

996
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,010
- And they'll lose a lot of money.
- Exactly.

997
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,060
And then...

998
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,480
- I actually thought of doing it.
- Next week,

999
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,030
they will show up
with dark circles under the eyes.

1000
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,100
They won't be able to sleep.

1001
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,180
Ji Hyo, do you know much
about stocks?

1002
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,610
- Did you buy any stocks?
- Ji Hyo, did you buy any?

1003
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,780
I suffered a loss.

1004
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,220
You suffered a loss?

1005
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,220
- We didn't know.
- Ji Hyo.

1006
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,810
- You lost money?
- We didn't know.

1007
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,460
What did you buy this time?

1008
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,190
- Ji Hyo.
- I bought an IT company's shares.

1009
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,460
IT companies didn't do well
in that year. Why did you...

1010
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,760
I know nothing about stocks.

1011
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,350
- What did you buy this time?
- IT companies...

1012
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,860
I invested in some other companies
this time.

1013
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,200
Why didn't you keep it?

1014
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,290
She sold it.

1015
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,090
- The IT company...
- If you invest in stocks like that,

1016
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,560
- you lose your money.
- I invested in an IT company.

1017
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,240
- But I know nothing about stocks.
- Right?

1018
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,780
- IT companies will boom.
- But you shouldn't just guess.

1019
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,180
I just went with my hunch.

1020
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,480
Besides, I got information,
but I still didn't know...

1021
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,280
- what to do.
- Se Chan, you should...

1022
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,140
Se Chan's investment style
can be risky.

1023
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,250
Investing all your money
in a low-priced stock like he did...

1024
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,140
is a shortcut to bankruptcy.

1025
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,350
Then why did you do that?

1026
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,220
- Leave him be.
- I learned from my experience.

1027
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,380
- Why did you...
- I'm young and rich.

1028
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,580
I go all-in for a blue-chip stock
unlike him.

1029
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,500
You know, right? He always...

1030
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,870
advises someone who succeeded
in doing something.

1031
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,990
- That's true.
- Absolutely.

1032
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,260
You need information...

1033
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,470
- to earn a profit.
- That doesn't matter.

1034
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,010
Don't you guys have
the knowledge...

1035
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,780
of how the economy changed
from 2011 to 2020 in your head?

1036
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,740
- You have that knowledge in yours?
- Of course, I do.

1037
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,470
- Just go home.
- You know that.

1038
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,080
- You do?
- Suk Jin, just go home.

1039
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,370
Try to figure out how things are
going with your family.

1040
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,740
- I'm speechless.
- How can you not know that?

1041
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,140
You don't even know
how your wife feels.

1042
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,760
What's the point of knowing
how the economy changed?

1043
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,310
I didn't buy shares
in any biotechnology companies.

1044
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,930
(My love)

1045
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,490
(Bye, oh, bye, oh)

1046
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,120
- Biotechnology?
- Biotechnology stocks...

1047
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,370
won't go up this year.

1048
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,060
- Invest in them in the future.
- Sorry, but how much did you earn?

1049
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,430
- How much?
- 20 percent.

1050
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,200
(He earned too little
for the knowledge he has.)

1051
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,040
Hey, I earned
more than 500 percent.

1052
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,100
Who are you to teach me?

1053
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,850
What you're doing is called...

1054
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,640
"speculation", and what I'm doing
is called "investment".

1055
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,740
You're a speculator.

1056
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,950
Look at him. He's jealous.

1057
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,450
You're jealous, right?
I earned 540 percent.

1058
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,490
He's just...

1059
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,850
- This is just a game, but he...
- You're unbearably jealous, right?

1060
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,260
- Help him out.
- Suk Jin.

1061
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,120
- Are you jealous?
- No.

1062
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,330
- I think you are.
- Not at all.

1063
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,720
I'm just worried about you.

1064
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
(The successful investor
teases Suk Jin.)

1065
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,620
- You're jealous, right?
- No, I'm not.

1066
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,760
This year is almost gone.
It's almost the end of the year.

1067
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,970
- It's coming soon.
- It's coming soon.

1068
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,560
- Let's go!
- The new year is coming.

1069
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,140
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

1070
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,310
- The bell is about to ring.
- Please, please.

1071
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,140
- Just this once.
- The New Year's bell!

1072
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,680
- Ring it!
- Help me out just this once.

1073
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,910
It has come.

1074
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,640
- It has come.
- The bell is ringing.

1075
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,620
(Jong Kook kept H Beauty.
Kwang Soo kept B Entertainment.)

1076
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,990
(Haha bought C IT's shares
following his hunch.)

1077
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,290
(Se Chan leaked fake information
and sold B Entertainment's shares.)

1078
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,080
(How did the stock market change
in 2013?)

1079
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,160
Reveal the stock prices.

1080
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,890
Oh, gosh! I hit the jackpot!

1081
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,790
I hit the jackpot!

1082
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
(A Entertainment: 37 percent up,
B Entertainment: 83 percent down,)

1083
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,260
(C IT: 40 up, D IT: 25 up,
E Biotechnology: 20 up,)

1084
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,290
(F Biotechnology: no change,
G Foods: 20 down,)

1085
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,290
(H Beauty, 33 down,)

1086
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,240
(I Chemical: 33 down,
J Shipbuilding: 17 up)

1087
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,660
- I hit the jackpot!
- It's okay.

1088
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,830
Oh, man. This is driving me insane.

1089
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,430
(B Entertainment stock dropped
by 83 percent!)

1090
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,370
(Haha earned a 5 percent profit.)

1091
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,220
(I hit the jackpot!)

1092
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,240
(Total Value: 550 dollars,
profit: 28 dollars)

1093
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,180
(He's excited as if he earned
a 500 percent profit.)

1094
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,350
(Se Chan earned a profit again
by switching to D IT!)

1095
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,760
(He caused others to lose money
and earned a profit again!)

1096
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,390
I am young and rich!

1097
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,970
(I am Yang and Rich!)

1098
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,470
Gosh. I'm in trouble.

1099
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,470
But Se Chan told me
to hold on to it.

1100
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,040
(Hang on. What is going on?)

1101
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,830
(Both B Entertainment and H Beauty
stocks crashed.)

1102
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,280
(Kwang Soo got scammed
and lost a lot of money.)

1103
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,640
- Se Chan.
- I am young and rich!

1104
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,540
Hey, you told me to hold on to it.

1105
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,220
Hey, you shouldn't listen to
everything others say.

1106
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,640
- Hey.
- Whereas I made money,

1107
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,990
some others must lose.

1108
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,810
You two are those people, you punks.

1109
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,220
He told me to hold on to it.

1110
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,060
(You are responsible
for your own investment decisions.)

1111
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,260
If I'm wrong this time, I promise...

1112
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,490
It's okay.

1113
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,370
Why did H Beauty stocks go down?

1114
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,430
Wasn't K-beauty popular back then?

1115
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,490
This is driving me nuts.

1116
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,930
(He's checking his balance
in shock.)

1117
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,970
What?

1118
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
(He lost 50 percent.)

1119
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,600
(Cut in half)

1120
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,850
270 dollars?

1121
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,080
It's been cut in half.

1122
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,720
Gosh. What do I do?
What should I do?

1123
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,220
Where did my money go?

1124
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,160
Where is my money?
Give me back my money.

1125
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,950
I'm not doing this anymore.
Give me back my money.

1126
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,560
Give me back my money.
I said I won't do this anymore!

1127
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,930
Give me back my money.
I'm going home.

1128
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,200
I'm not doing this anymore.

1129
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,060
I don't even care about stocks.
Give it back now.

1130
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,120
Give me back my money.

1131
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,390
Give me back my money!

1132
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,870
Jae Suk, the marketing cost...

1133
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,870
- I'm just asking.
- Okay.

1134
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,240
You told me
how marketing activities...

1135
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,280
- That's right.
- can help to make a profit...

1136
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,620
But it doesn't work well
in some cases.

1137
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,350
Then should I hold on to it?

1138
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,910
- Why are you asking me that?
- It's just...

1139
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,080
Why are you asking me that?

1140
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,180
It's because every stock I bought
went down.

1141
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,390
- Gosh, seriously.
- Should I...

1142
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,290
This is driving me nuts.

1143
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,660
I should've sold B Entertainment.
What should I do?

1144
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,490
I'm done for.

1145
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,290
Did I lose? Gosh. Minus 71 percent.

1146
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,240
(Total Value: 622 dollars,
loss: 1,520 dollars)

1147
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,470
I can't believe this.

1148
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,510
Ji Hyo.

1149
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,740
(And Ji Hyo has been suffering
losses for 2 years in a row.)

1150
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,370
Ji Hyo.

1151
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,970
Jae Suk,
I think that stock investment...

1152
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,810
- Ji Hyo, why did you sell...
- doesn't suit me.

1153
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,140
the IT companies' shares
when their prices went up?

1154
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,470
I sold all the shares
of the IT company I had.

1155
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,390
(Big Nose lost almost one-third.)

1156
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,810
I lost 160 dollars. Hold on.

1157
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,220
(The veteran investor
got burned by K-beauty.)

1158
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,330
Beauty is the way.

1159
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,120
Isn't that when K-beauty
became popular?

1160
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,260
K-beauty was supposed to be a hit.

1161
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,600
That's when K-beauty
took off like crazy.

1162
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,990
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Didn't K-beauty take off?

1163
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,040
- Of course. It was a huge hit.
- How odd.

1164
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,060
(He enters the Information Exchange
huffing and puffing.)

1165
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,100
- Hello.
- Come on in.

1166
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,200
(He enters the Information Exchange
huffing and puffing.)

1167
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,430
Hold on.

1168
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,640
- Hi.
- B Enter was five dollars, right?

1169
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,870
(He buys Level 1 Information
on B Entertainment.)

1170
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,870
With a famous IT company...

1171
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,280
(He buys Level 1 Information
on B Entertainment.)

1172
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,510
This is crazy.

1173
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,680
An IT company?
But this is an entertainment agency.

1174
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,010
(A merger between
two big IT companies?)

1175
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,530
An IT company?
But this is an entertainment agency.

1176
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:12,330
(How does this merger
affect B Entertainment?)

1177
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,830
(Meanwhile, Haha purchases
information on H Beauty.)

1178
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,700
This is too vague though.

1179
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,870
(H Beauty in discussion
to find a foreign investor.)

1180
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,330
In discussion.

1181
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,370
Nothing's been finalized yet then.

1182
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,470
But what if...

1183
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,370
this deal happens
before the year ends?

1184
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,580
I remember hearing
something about this.

1185
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,220
I don't know if I should
sell these stocks or not.

1186
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,450
(A silhouette appears
outside the door.)

1187
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,260
(The spy is at the door
hoping to see something.)

1188
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,990
(He secretly takes a photo
with his phone.)

1189
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,790
(Thanks to the sly move, he gets
another piece of information.)

1190
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,290
What happened in
the chemical industry in 2013?

1191
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,390
- What?
- What happened?

1192
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,040
The chemical industry?

1193
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,100
I can't tell which
company it is though.

1194
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,580
Did you ask about
the beauty company earlier?

1195
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,280
The one that's in discussion
with a marketing deal?

1196
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,700
Yes, they're looking to invest.

1197
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,510
They'll soon sign a big deal then.

1198
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,740
They will.

1199
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,850
Wait, they will?

1200
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,850
Will they sign it next year then?

1201
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,310
- I...
- That's what you should tell me.

1202
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,010
- Tell me what matters!
- I'm...

1203
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,530
I'm not an expert.

1204
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,660
They were looking
to invest last year.

1205
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,700
And that could soon
turn into a huge business deal.

1206
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,660
It happens when you
invest in marketing.

1207
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,120
Doesn't B Entertainment
intrigue you?

1208
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,030
- B Entertainment?
- Yes, B Entertainment.

1209
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,790
- Do you know something?
- It'll soon be a big hit.

1210
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,930
I have information on them.

1211
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,370
- It'll be a big hit?
- What did you hear?

1212
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,470
I mean, it's still only
at five dollars.

1213
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,680
I received information on them.

1214
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,740
- What was it?
- What?

1215
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,200
- No way.
- Hold on.

1216
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,310
- Will it go up?
- You received information?

1217
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,510
Will B Entertainment's
stock price go up?

1218
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,850
Come on, Kwang Soo.

1219
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,640
Let me know what it is.

1220
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,310
- What...
- Give me a hint.

1221
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,010
- That's not it.
- The stock price won't go up.

1222
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,060
- You never know yet.
- Listen to this.

1223
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
I'll tell you this one thing.

1224
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,180
You were right to sell it.

1225
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:50,060
- It used to be three dollars.
- How typical...

1226
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,990
It went from 3 dollars to 5.

1227
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,620
(Meanwhile,
Se Chan is lost in thought.)

1228
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,220
H Beauty.

1229
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,470
I'll buy 30 stocks.

1230
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,970
(Yang and Rich
goes all-in for H Beauty.)

1231
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,290
- Stop fussing, will you?
- That's good.

1232
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,660
(Yang Se Chan, H Beauty, 35 stocks)

1233
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,970
I'll keep these.

1234
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,510
Up until 2015,

1235
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,680
K-beauty is on an upward trend.

1236
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,850
That I know.

1237
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,780
I'll keep them some more.

1238
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,450
- Just once more.
- You seem agitated.

1239
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,220
(His voice is trembling.)

1240
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,450
I'll keep these.

1241
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,620
- I guess I have no choice.
- That worked out.

1242
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,060
I Chemical wouldn't...

1243
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,490
drop for three years straight.

1244
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,330
It's why I also...

1245
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,620
I'll buy I Chemical's stocks.

1246
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,720
(He purchases more
of I Chemical's stocks.)

1247
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,450
It won't drop
for three years straight.

1248
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
- That'll be 13 stocks.
- Can't you allow that?

1249
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,370
440 dollars.

1250
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,370
(Suk Jin received information
on B Entertainment.)

1251
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,490
440 dollars.

1252
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,830
I'll use it all to buy
B Entertainment's stocks.

1253
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,760
All of it.

1254
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,140
You're going all-in.

1255
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,680
I'll sell the rest.

1256
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,080
The chemical industry
goes big at least once.

1257
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,180
- Right?
- It does.

1258
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,100
- It dropped for two years.
- I'm sure of it.

1259
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,970
- The industry will go big.
- I can...

1260
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,310
share this money, right?

1261
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,810
- You see...
- Kwang Soo,

1262
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,450
care to put on a show?

1263
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,950
At a stock exchange?

1264
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,620
We're supposed to be
gentlemen today.

1265
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,850
- But I have the money.
- Put on a show?

1266
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,390
Do something with your hair
and I'll...

1267
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,930
I'll give you money
to buy more stocks.

1268
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,200
With my hair?

1269
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,390
Look at all the money I have.

1270
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,490
I tend to keep my money in my hands.

1271
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,330
<i>Look at me, bio</i>

1272
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,330
<i>- Bio</i>
- It should take off about now.

1273
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,200
I know exactly when
the bioindustry took off.

1274
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,600
I began investing in stocks
when biotechnology...

1275
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,910
was the craze.

1276
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,310
- He's at it again.
- I'm aware of the exact year.

1277
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,350
I'm sorry, but did you
make money off it?

1278
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,870
I didn't.

1279
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,890
(He's all talk.)

1280
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,120
When everyone earned money...

1281
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,560
off stocks
of biotechnology companies?

1282
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,680
- You lost money at that time?
- Yes.

1283
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,290
- Goodness.
- The stocks...

1284
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,990
My rate of return
was 100 percent, but...

1285
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,390
- Ji Hyo!
- She's completely hooked.

1286
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,620
She's addicted to this.

1287
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,330
- Ji Hyo?
- Ji Hyo's in trouble.

1288
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,160
Is she a day trader now?

1289
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,160
I earned a lot
thanks to the beauty industry...

1290
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,640
but lost a lot because of it too.

1291
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,760
Don't you know when...

1292
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,740
- the beauty industry took off?
- Suk Jin.

1293
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,870
K-beauty.

1294
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,370
Isn't the year etched in your brain?

1295
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,040
- I'm sorry to ask.
- Yes?

1296
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,540
Did you earn any money
investing in the beauty industry?

1297
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,040
- No.
- Then...

1298
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,280
I lost money.

1299
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,490
Who is he trying to lecture then?

1300
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,950
You talk like someone
who earned big time.

1301
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,620
I thought John Lee was here with us.

1302
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,890
Who are you, John Ji?

1303
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,660
- It's not over yet.
- Right.

1304
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,290
- The date is drawing near.
- We're almost there.

1305
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,350
(It's the New Year again.)

1306
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,370
- I'm given newfound hope.
- Let's do this.

1307
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,200
After the stock prices
of 2014 are revealed,

1308
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,370
your account balance
will be revealed as well.

1309
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,430
- Sure.
- Got it.

1310
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,410
My lips keep drying up.

1311
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,970
I'm going to earn
my original investment...

1312
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,950
and then keep the cash on me.

1313
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,180
- My original investment...
- Come on!

1314
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,580
I'll earn back
my original investment...

1315
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,140
and take off to Jeju Island.

1316
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,120
- Please...
- Please!

1317
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,910
Please!
My heart's pounding right now.

1318
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,490
My heart's pounding.

1319
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,160
I'll earn back
my original investment and take off.

1320
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,830
I'll keep waiting.

1321
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,430
The beauty industry will take off.

1322
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,530
Starting this year,
it'll be on the rise.

1323
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,330
It'll be big this year and the next.

1324
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,330
It'll be huge.

1325
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,140
Happy New Year!

1326
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,410
I wish you all the best.

1327
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,040
See? 150 percent!

1328
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,700
- Nice!
- Finally!

1329
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,240
- 150 percent.
- What did I tell you?

1330
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,910
- 150 percent!
- H Beauty.

1331
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,620
- See? 150 percent.
- 150 percent!

1332
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,180
- Okay.
- 150 percent.

1333
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,510
(Se Chan hits the jackpot since
he only bought H Beauty's stocks.)

1334
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,760
- 150 percent.
- What did I tell you?

1335
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,490
(The winners of 2014 are
the shareholders of H Beauty.)

1336
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,490
See? What did I tell you?

1337
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,530
(Suk Jin sold H Beauty's stocks
and only earned a small amount.)

1338
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,260
See what I mean?
It's the beauty industry.

1339
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,120
H Beauty, 150 percent.

1340
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,470
This was the year.

1341
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,640
I sold all
the H Beauty stocks I had.

1342
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,970
- Why didn't you listen to me?
- I sold them all.

1343
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,640
This was the year.

1344
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,640
I sold H Beauty's stocks...

1345
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,180
and bought bio stocks instead.

1346
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,410
(Yang and Rich!)

1347
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,010
I'll buy you a car.

1348
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,950
- What did I tell you?
- Here comes Yang and Rich!

1349
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,310
H Beauty.

1350
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,680
- This was the year.
- 150 percent.

1351
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,120
Here comes Yang and Rich!

1352
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,560
I just sold
all of my H Beauty's stocks.

1353
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,950
I'll buy you a car.

1354
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,490
I sold all of my H Beauty's stocks.

1355
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,580
This was the year.

1356
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,990
- Kwang Soo.
- I sold all their stocks...

1357
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,290
and bought bio stocks.

1358
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,490
How can a stock price
go up by 150 percent?

1359
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,970
We were right.

1360
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:50,200
(Get over here!)

1361
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,890
(He takes Suk Jin by the collar.)

1362
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,370
Give me back my money!

1363
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,700
Hold on.

1364
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,910
(Suk Jin's advice is a disaster
for individual investors.)

1365
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,370
(My head's spinning.)

1366
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:03,700
My heart's pounding.

1367
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,310
- It's pounding like crazy.
- Hey!

1368
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,370
- My heart's pounding like crazy.
- This is insane.

1369
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,290
- I...
- I hit the jackpot.

1370
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,010
You'll get goose bumps too
once you know.

1371
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,180
In the year 2014,
your account balance ranking...

1372
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,060
will be revealed.

1373
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,490
Se Chan earned too much.

1374
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,120
- Jae Suk...
- To be honest...

1375
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,700
- I hit the jackpot.
- K-beauty.

1376
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,160
Is Se Chan the richest?

1377
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,790
(Who's the richest in 2014?)

1378
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,470
- I'm in 4th place.
- I'm in 6th place.

1379
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,430
We only counted your stocks.

1380
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,640
(Account Balance Ranking)

1381
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:30,910
This is the ranking.

1382
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,100
I'm in third place.

1383
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,310
What's with Jae Suk?

1384
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:34,850
- What do you mean?
- Jae Suk...

1385
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,470
I'm in third place.

1386
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,010
I feel like I've been wronged.

1387
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,450
I held on to H Beauty for two years,

1388
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,810
but the price skyrocketed
as soon as I sold it.

1389
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,640
This is crazy.

1390
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,540
- That's just his story.
- I mean...

1391
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,010
What did you do?

1392
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,180
I sold all of H Beauty's stocks
that I had...

1393
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,760
after keeping them for two years.

1394
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,350
The information he had ruined me!

1395
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,700
K-beauty took off.

1396
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,470
I didn't bother with
any information.

1397
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,660
I should've gotten
some information myself.

1398
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,390
I told you to invest in it.

1399
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,470
- Let's play the next game then.
- Sure.

1400
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,640
This is making me dizzy
even though it's not real money.

1401
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,080
Kwang Soo, you're in the last place.

1402
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,600
I mean...

1403
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,700
When will
the chemical industry bloom?

1404
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,780
How can the stock price drop
for three years straight?

1405
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,680
- It'll go up though.
- When?

1406
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,510
Do you even know
what this industry is?

1407
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,640
What do you think chemicals are?

1408
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,510
I remember seeing them
in science class.

1409
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,080
You need to know
what the companies do.

1410
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,660
(Kwang Soo proves that
you must analyze companies.)

1411
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:26,200
- Are you all right, Ji Hyo?
- Here's your first mission.

1412
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,260
Just do as I say.

1413
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,530
You'll trick me.

1414
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,200
I'm young and rich, Ji Hyo.

1415
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,470
(Those who suddenly become rich
tend to flaunt that.)

1416
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,060
Like the previous one, this game...

1417
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,310
- is worth information points.
- Really?

1418
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,100
In the first mission,

1419
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,410
you'll be convincing
the staff of Running Man.

1420
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,470
This is Master Debaters.

1421
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,740
I'm good at that.

1422
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,540
- You must be good with words.
- That I can do.

1423
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,450
After the topic is revealed,

1424
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,260
you'll be randomly split
into 2 teams of 4...

1425
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,620
and will start a debate
regarding that given topic.

1426
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,160
After listening to your debate,

1427
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,660
30 members of the staff
in this auditorium...

1428
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,700
will vote on the team
that was more convincing.

1429
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,930
The team with the most votes
will win.

1430
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,600
That sounds difficult.

1431
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,470
You will be given
three topics in total.

1432
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,640
The members of the winning team...

1433
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,200
will receive
three points respectively.

1434
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,870
So you can earn
a maximum of nine points.

1435
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,950
That's enough to earn big
for three years straight.

1436
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,080
Points are this important.

1437
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,640
- The information...
- We need the information.

1438
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,010
The first topic is this.

1439
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,790
(Who will win if Jae Suk and
Suk Jin get into a real fight?)

1440
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,720
(A: Suk Jin will win.
B: Jae Suk will win.)

1441
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,850
This...

1442
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:29,080
How can one argue this?

1443
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,660
This...

1444
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,290
- Is it a physical fight?
- Physical, of course.

1445
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,620
- A fistfight.
- One that's for real.

1446
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,200
A for Suk Jin and B for Jae Suk.

1447
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,040
The rest will randomly
choose their sides.

1448
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,010
- Taking the right side is crucial.
- This isn't easy.

1449
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,010
This...

1450
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,930
(It's crucial to choose the side
that is more convincing.)

1451
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,180
No!

1452
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,140
No!

1453
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:51,950
Darn it!

1454
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:56,180
I guess you chose A.

1455
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,850
How can one argue this?

1456
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,390
Don't you worry.

1457
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:01,620
- I'm doomed.
- Don't you worry.

1458
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,790
Please hold up your spoons.

1459
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,560
- B.
- I have B.

1460
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,160
Please stand with
your respective teammates.

1461
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,160
- Okay.
- Sure.

1462
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,200
- Guys.
- As if this can be argued.

1463
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,620
Jae Suk would even win
a worded argument.

1464
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,160
Just the fact...

1465
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,040
that I'm considered
as a match for Suk Jin...

1466
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,510
- is upsetting.
- It hurts your pride.

1467
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,640
- Also...
- We'll never actually fight, but...

1468
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,640
We can even show you
who'll win right now.

1469
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,580
- What?
- They'll fight...

1470
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,370
and Jae Suk will win.

1471
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,280
- We can show you that.
- Stop it.

1472
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,390
Go head to head.

1473
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,240
Haven't you been exercising at home?

1474
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,450
It won't even be close.

1475
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,160
- Don't go in that direction.
- He'll be beaten up for real.

1476
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,490
- He'll be beaten up for real.
- Then which one should we go with?

1477
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,620
Excuse me.

1478
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,180
- All right.
- Here comes the fiery fist.

1479
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,790
Let's talk about the statistics.

1480
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,470
- First, both of them wear glasses.
- Right.

1481
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,430
- Fake versus real glasses.
- "Real glasses"?

1482
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,140
(Fake glasses versus real glasses)

1483
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,240
- Your glasses are real, right?
- Yes, they are.

1484
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,640
You have a better chance of winning
since your glasses are fake.

1485
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,060
- Of course.
- His glasses are real.

1486
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,330
- For me... That's a good point.
- Yes.

1487
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,780
Let me just tell you one thing.
It's simple.

1488
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,350
Even if the four of you
come at me...

1489
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,970
What did you say?

1490
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,280
(What did you say?)

1491
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,350
- What did you say?
- That's not true.

1492
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,220
- You can't beat me.
- Smash, smash, smash.

1493
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,260
(Smash, smash, smash)

1494
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,350
You'll be done in one blow.

1495
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,790
- In one blow.
- Look here.

1496
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:11,260
Se Chan said
something really important.

1497
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,990
I'm going to take off my glasses,

1498
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,260
and then take his off for him.

1499
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,330
- Wait.
- Then he can't see anything.

1500
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,740
- All your moves are so petty.
- You sound so strong! It's scary.

1501
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,990
- Everyone, think about it.
- He's never fought with anyone.

1502
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,390
- If he can't see...
- He can't see anything.

1503
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,330
See? He can't see anything.

1504
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,540
You're over here.

1505
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,680
(He got scared.)

1506
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,810
Oh, no. He can see.

1507
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,700
- He can see.
- Be careful.

1508
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,620
You have to think of this.

1509
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,310
You have to remember his character.

1510
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,850
- That's right.
- He's right.

1511
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,990
Do you think he will beat me up?
Do you think Jae Suk will beat me?

1512
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:39,990
- That's right.
- He can beat you up.

1513
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,390
- How can Jae Suk beat Suk Jin?
- Do you think he will beat me up?

1514
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,430
He will never beat me...

1515
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,560
until I'm covered in blood!

1516
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,530
- How can Jae Suk beat Suk Jin?
- Will he ever do that?

1517
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,290
- He's not the type to do that.
- But what if they get into a fight?

1518
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,490
- Let's suppose they're in a fight.
- He might make you pass out...

1519
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:49,790
- so you won't be covered in blood.
- But do we have to...

1520
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,390
go this far?

1521
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:52,660
- Jae Suk.
- Do we have to go this far?

1522
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,430
Do you think you can beat me
until my nose bleeds...

1523
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,810
- and get bruises all over?
- I would never do that.

1524
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,640
- I can't beat you like that.
- But I can!

1525
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,600
(Brazen)

1526
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,780
- Did you all hear that?
- We won!

1527
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,810
I can beat you like that.

1528
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,120
- He's capable of beating Jae Suk.
- Since...

1529
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,010
- Since I'm older than him.
- That's right.

1530
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,350
- He's right.
- I can beat him since I'm older.

1531
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,850
But he can never beat me.

1532
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,720
But I can make him go without pain.

1533
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,910
- In 1 blow.
- That's right. In 1 blow.

1534
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,330
- In 1 blow?
- Yes, in 1 blow.

1535
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,530
He has no guts to do that,
and he's not the type to do it.

1536
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,760
No, I can do it if I don't want to
make him feel pain.

1537
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,790
- Of course.
- In one blow.

1538
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:24,790
I can punch him when he goes,
"What did you just say?"

1539
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,810
(He's all talk now.)

1540
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,160
- Then I'll dodge...
- The end.

1541
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,540
- and throw an uppercut.
- The end.

1542
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,600
I'll dodge your uppercut...

1543
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:37,200
- and kick you with my knee.
- A knee kick.

1544
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,350
I will simply
block your knee kick...

1545
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,010
- and kick you with my knee.
- Wait a minute.

1546
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,290
But your fist was blocking him.
How would you use your hands?

1547
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,180
I got it out in the meantime.

1548
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,450
I got it out to use it.

1549
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:47,660
- That's how you blocked him?
- And pushed his knee down.

1550
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,930
No, that's not it.

1551
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,660
But he's really sturdy.

1552
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,100
I texted him saying... Suk Jin,
you need to show our texts.

1553
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,290
- I saw him using his strength...
- Why don't we take turns...

1554
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,120
and kick each other's butts?

1555
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,790
- That's good!
- He's doing push-ups!

1556
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,040
Look at that!

1557
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,200
(A sudden push-up performance)

1558
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,970
(The end)

1559
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,830
- Hey.
- Shall we kick each other's butts?

1560
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,780
Sounds good.
If you make noise, then you lose.

1561
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,100
- Suk Jin.
- Let's kick each other's butts.

1562
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,280
Let's see how tolerant you are.

1563
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,720
- Good.
- If you make noise, you lose.

1564
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,970
Tolerance is really important.

1565
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,580
Everyone, we need to see
how tolerant they are.

1566
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,080
- I'm kicking your butt first?
- Take this seriously.

1567
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,680
- We're kicking the butt, right?
- Check out his kick.

1568
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,760
(Suk Jin goes first.)

1569
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,220
Maybe it's better to kick thighs.

1570
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,720
- You need to kick the butt.
- Yes, not the thighs.

1571
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,790
- All right. Of course.
- I'm kicking you for real.

1572
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,160
Go ahead.

1573
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,720
- Kick him for real.
- Yes, do it for real.

1574
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,990
(Whack)

1575
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,430
(That was strong.)

1576
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,930
- Suk Jin kicked for real.
- Did you see that?

1577
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,010
(Breathing out)

1578
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,040
(Biting his lips)

1579
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,540
Suk Jin kicked for real.

1580
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,580
Did you see that?

1581
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,470
- You kicked for real.
- Yes, I did.

1582
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,720
- You saw, right?
- Ji Suk Jin!

1583
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,280
- Did you see that?
- Ji Suk Jin!

1584
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:49,950
- Did you see that?
- But it was right in the middle.

1585
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,850
- Did you see him?
- Also, you kicked him...

1586
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:54,310
with the tip of your foot
and poked the middle of his butt.

1587
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,030
- That's not fair.
- Suk Jin can kick for real.

1588
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,350
- It's my turn now.
- What is it, Jae Suk?

1589
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,450
It's my turn now.

1590
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,100
Did you see how I used
my full weight?

1591
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,930
I could feel it. I could feel you
kicking him for real.

1592
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:02,970
I can tell you have experience
with fighting.

1593
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:04,890
But Jae Suk has his chance.

1594
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:06,370
- Come forward.
- Suk Jin.

1595
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,370
- If you hold it, you win.
- If you don't cry, you win.

1596
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,560
I'm not sure he'll be okay, though.

1597
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,910
- You have to watch them, everyone.
- Will you be okay?

1598
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,180
Suk Jin has experience
with fighting.

1599
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,910
- Like this.
- It was really loud earlier.

1600
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,200
Make it deep.

1601
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,520
- Make it deep.
- Gosh.

1602
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,750
You made a noise.

1603
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,350
(Sighing)

1604
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
What are you doing?

1605
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,290
This makes you look weak.

1606
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,790
- I think he made a noise.
- He made a noise.

1607
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:39,790
- Didn't you
- They're all listening.

1608
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,040
Didn't he make a noise?

1609
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,870
- I think he just made a noise.
- He did.

1610
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,770
Please forget it.
Forget what just happened.

1611
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,600
I'll give it a go now.

1612
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,640
- Kick him for real.
- Okay.

1613
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,640
(Now it's Jae Suk's turn to kick.)

1614
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,350
(Grunting)

1615
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:53,350
That was okay.

1616
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:54,470
It wasn't that strong.

1617
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,540
- He didn't kick that hard.
- It's because he got softhearted.

1618
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,040
- He got softhearted.
- It wasn't hard. Did you see that?

1619
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,490
- He didn't kick hear.
- It's because he's softhearted.

1620
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:00,750
- But...
- I kicked hard.

1621
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,250
This is what's important.
I didn't kick hard, but you went...

1622
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,660
(I didn't kick hard,
but you went like this.)

1623
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,350
- He can't tolerate pain.
- You saw him, right?

1624
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:06,600
He can't tolerate pain.

1625
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,890
The first debate has come to an end.

1626
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:09,890
- All right.
- Okay.

1627
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,160
- The staff members...
- They'll pick Jae Suk unanimously.

1628
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,060
who are convinced that Suk Jin
will win, lift up A.

1629
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,000
Lift up B for Jae Suk.

1630
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,660
- Is there anything you want to say?
- Let me say one last word.

1631
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,810
He can't beat someone whom
he's been friends with for 30 years.

1632
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,580
- He'd just get beaten and lose.
- That's right.

1633
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,750
Please keep that in mind.

1634
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,910
That's right. I don't want to
deny what Suk Jin said.

1635
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,520
- That's right. That's important.
- That's right.

1636
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,520
But if he needs a beating,
then he'll have to be beaten.

1637
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,620
Of course.

1638
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,560
Of course. If he needs to be,
then he should be beaten.

1639
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,080
- He can't beat me for sure.
- I hope that doesn't happen though.

1640
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,290
- I hope that doesn't happen.
- Jae Suk,

1641
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:43,000
imagine Suk Jin apologizing to you
with a nosebleed.

1642
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,790
- That will never happen.
- That won't happen.

1643
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,430
- Keep that in mind, everyone.
- Imagine if they fight for real.

1644
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,560
The premise is if they ever fight.

1645
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,140
- Pick B.
- All right. One...

1646
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,200
(What will the staff members pick?)

1647
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,410
- There are more A's.
- Pick A. There are more A's.

1648
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,810
If you only consider the kicks...

1649
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,250
(Which team will win 3 points each?)

1650
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,620
- Of course they picked B.
- Okay, they all picked B.

1651
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,410
- There are more B's.
- B!

1652
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,540
- B!
- Of course.

1653
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,850
But you all saw their kicks.

1654
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:06,890
(10 people picked Suk Jin,
20 people picked Jae Suk.)

1655
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,620
- Wasn't my kick harder?
- All right.

1656
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,120
But there are a lot of people...

1657
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,680
- who picked A.
- There are more A's than I thought.

1658
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,330
Why did you think
Suk Jin would win?

1659
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,850
That's even worse.

1660
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,600
Why? You never know.

1661
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:20,370
Hey, how would you know?

1662
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,770
- But...
- I can totally stomp that punk.

1663
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,540
Suk Jin, calm down.

1664
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,810
- Hey, Suk Jin.
- What's wrong with you?

1665
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:28,600
- Are you mad, Suk Jin?
- I can punch him like this.

1666
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,140
He's sulking for the third time.

1667
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,870
We'll give three points to
all members of Team B.

1668
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,470
All right, let's collect
the spoons now.

1669
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,490
Here's the second topic.

1670
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,850
(Will Jong Kook be able to
get married within 3 years?)

1671
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,620
(A: He can, B: He can't)

1672
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,160
- I think he will.
- This is...

1673
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,720
What would you pick, Jong Kook?
I'll let you pick first.

1674
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,790
- Me?
- Yes.

1675
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:47,930
I'll just pick randomly.

1676
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,700
I have no idea also.

1677
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,790
- This is so hard.
- Are you saying you can't?

1678
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,520
We need to be on Jong Kook's team.

1679
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,890
I picked A for this.

1680
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,160
- Gosh.
- You're in trouble.

1681
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:56,640
I need to be on Jong Kook's team.

1682
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,000
This is driving me crazy. Hold on.

1683
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,160
- It's B.
- I'll have to be with Jong Kook.

1684
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,330
Okay, I'll just accept
whatever I pick.

1685
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:02,500
- He picked B.
- We're in trouble.

1686
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,080
- What did you pick? Is it A or B?
- Is it A?

1687
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,750
You need to be on Team A.

1688
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,770
- I picked A.
- You picked A?

1689
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,770
- Okay.
- It's settled then.

1690
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,970
- It's settled.
- We'll win for sure.

1691
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,890
That settles it.
It's fine as long as he picked A.

1692
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,290
- Then we'll win for sure.
- That's all that matters.

1693
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,310
Those who picked B, come here.

1694
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,490
- I picked B.
- Okay.

1695
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:15,560
It's fine as long as he picked A.

1696
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,580
- I will get married. I need to.
- You need to get A.

1697
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:20,660
We don't have to
discuss this topic for long.

1698
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,660
He said he wants to get married.

1699
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:25,600
- So what can we say about that?
- That's right.

1700
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,870
- Of course.
- But Jong Kook...

1701
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:31,370
plans to get married, to be precise.
He's not going to get married.

1702
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,430
- No, no.
- He plans to.

1703
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,200
- He wants to get married.
- He has a plan to do so.

1704
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,410
He can't get married alone.

1705
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,140
- Of course.
- Within three years...

1706
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,750
I need to get married
within three years.

1707
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,250
He needs to have a partner to marry,

1708
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,640
but according to his daily routine,

1709
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,120
it's impossible for him
to meet someone new.

1710
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,350
- No, I will meet someone.
- You're mistaken.

1711
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:48,560
Let me tell you, you're mistaken.
There are decent people...

1712
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:50,490
around Jong Kook.

1713
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:51,620
- There are many.
- But...

1714
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:55,020
he's not actively taking part
in developing...

1715
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,430
- any relationship.
- That's right.

1716
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,160
He's restraining himself
from meeting someone new.

1717
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,870
That's what I'm saying.
He's really unapproachable.

1718
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,310
I just haven't set my mind to it.

1719
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,310
Anyway, I have to get married
within three years.

1720
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,000
- That's right.
- He says he has to get married.

1721
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
- But...
- Isn't that up to me?

1722
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,970
Just because you want to,

1723
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:12,750
- you need a partner to marry.
- That's not it.

1724
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,310
Just because you want to,
it doesn't mean you can.

1725
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:15,410
If there's a decent person...

1726
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:16,410
Are you seeing anyone right now?

1727
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,620
I'm okay with anyone, actually.

1728
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,180
- What you're saying is...
- That's not how marriage works.

1729
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,580
- What?
- That's not how marriage works

1730
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,560
How are you so sure that person
will like you back?

1731
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,430
- That's right.
- Both of them need to agree.

1732
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,750
But Jong Kook is capable of that.

1733
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,930
He goes up to people
and talks to them.

1734
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,870
If he really wants to,

1735
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:38,600
he can go up to anyone
at a bus stop or something...

1736
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,580
- and talk to the person.
- Jong Kook would never do that.

1737
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,870
- Of course.
- He can never do that.

1738
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:43,180
- No, he can.
- If he sets his mind to it,

1739
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,580
- he can.
- How can he do that?

1740
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:46,770
I've heard the rumors though.
At the Gangnam intersection,

1741
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,140
there's a muscular guy
who asks for people's numbers.

1742
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,140
(There's a guy at the Gangnam
intersection who asks for numbers.)

1743
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,580
While showing his nipples,
he'd go, "Hello."

1744
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,250
- "I'm Kim Nipple."
- That's enough.

1745
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,810
- You've heard the rumor, right?
- "I like you."

1746
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:56,930
That's not true.

1747
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,660
(The muscular man
is ready to get married.)

1748
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:02,220
- I think...
- Listen to Ji Hyo, it's important.

1749
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,830
According to
what I've learned so far,

1750
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,040
Jong Kook dates one person
for a long time.

1751
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,100
- That's right.
- He sees one person for a while...

1752
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,560
and sees if she is someone...

1753
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,830
he can get married to.

1754
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,330
- So...
- Three years is not long.

1755
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:17,040
Based on my experience,

1756
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,870
you can't marry someone
if you see them for a long time.

1757
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,970
- He realized it.
- Yes, I realized it.

1758
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,850
You have to get married
within 2 or 3 months.

1759
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:24,180
- 2 or 3 months?
- Come on.

1760
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,120
- No way.
- That's impossible.

1761
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,490
- Jong Kook.
- He said he realized it,

1762
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,350
so why are you arguing against him?

1763
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:31,250
- I said I realized it.
- That's not how it works.

1764
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,450
He'll make you pay for it
if you lift up B!

1765
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,660
I think I'll be able to get married.

1766
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,470
- Do you think he'll let you be?
- I will get married.

1767
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,600
- I'll be over 40 then.
- Are you going to curse him?

1768
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,870
- That's right. I'll get married!
- He said he'll get married.

1769
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:42,870
What's wrong with you all?

1770
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,140
He said he'll get married...

1771
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,160
- within three years!
- All right. Let me...

1772
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,080
explain realistically
why he has no other choice...

1773
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,600
but to get married
within three years.

1774
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,970
Before, he used to hold it in a lot.

1775
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,350
He didn't eat anything
besides protein.

1776
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,640
- But now, he has chips too.
- He eats everything.

1777
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,120
- He's now doing things...
- He has ramyeon too.

1778
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,080
- that normal humans do.
- That's not convincing at all.

1779
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,220
- "He now has chips."
- "He has chips and jellies..."

1780
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,720
- Just hear him out!
- That's so childish!

1781
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,950
He works out for three hours
after having chips.

1782
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:12,290
- But still...
- He has no time to date anyone.

1783
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,330
Then I can eat something nice
late at night...

1784
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,560
- He's open to it.
- with my girlfriend or wife-to-be.

1785
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,200
So Min, say something.

1786
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,310
I'm not supposed to think
this way, but as I listened,

1787
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,080
- I think he might not be able to...
- Stop it.

1788
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,470
- Darn it.
- You should keep quiet.

1789
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:26,680
- Hey!
- Get out of here.

1790
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,870
Get out of here.

1791
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,540
- Get out of here.
- Get out!

1792
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,180
- But...
- Go away.

1793
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,910
Even back in my days,

1794
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,390
it took me three years
to marry my wife.

1795
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,330
He needs to date someone for
two years, book a venue,

1796
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,450
meet each other's parents...

1797
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:40,500
- It'll only take six months.
- What?

1798
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,290
No, that's not possible.
Hey, Jae Suk.

1799
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:45,100
How long did it take you
to marry Kyung Eun...

1800
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,600
from the point you met her?

1801
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,770
It took a total of two years.

1802
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:50,770
That's pretty short.

1803
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:53,270
- It doesn't take three years.
- It doesn't take that long.

1804
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:54,740
That's considered short.

1805
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,830
What about you?

1806
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,250
- What do you mean it's short?
- It took me three years.

1807
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,950
- No, don't put it that way.
- How long did it take you?

1808
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,350
- I didn't take that long too.
- How long did it take?

1809
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,750
- It didn't take me that long.
- How long did you take?

1810
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,680
- Don't ask me.
- He said it took him three months.

1811
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,640
- I know! He only took 3 months!
- He took shorter than me.

1812
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,660
- It depends on each case,
- It took me six months.

1813
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,950
but for Jong Kook,
three years is not enough for him.

1814
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,750
I'm not saying
that he can't get married.

1815
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,830
It takes Jong Kook
a year and a half to kiss.

1816
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:21,060
Jong Kook is very careful.
He's a very careful person.

1817
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:24,330
If he wants to meet someone,

1818
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:27,040
but there's no one to meet,

1819
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,100
then I'll introduce someone to him.

1820
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,370
Of course! I must get married
within three years.

1821
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:30,600
Who do you have in mind?

1822
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,180
There's someone
who's a year older than me.

1823
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,180
(There's someone
who's a year older than me.)

1824
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,180
(What?)

1825
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,720
She likes Jong Kook so much.

1826
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,390
- But the point is,
- Listen to him first.

1827
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,390
- she's always ready.
- That's what's important.

1828
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:41,850
- That's what's important.
- But that's a little...

1829
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:44,660
- She's always ready to go.
- Isn't that a little...

1830
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,290
- Isn't she too old?
- That's how much she's ready.

1831
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,350
- He has high standards.
- Wait! I can introduce him.

1832
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,060
- There's someone I have in mind.
- Right?

1833
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,160
- People around him can help.
- She's older than me.

1834
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,770
There's someone I know
whom I can introduce to him.

1835
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:55,500
There are many people who like him.

1836
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,200
- There's a lot.
- Now you're setting him up?

1837
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,640
All right. Let's check the results.

1838
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,140
- I'm going to get married.
- Team A will win for sure.

1839
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,580
We are on Team A.

1840
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,100
- Jong Kook is on Team A.
- But everyone,

1841
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,370
just consider
his lifestyle for now.

1842
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:10,540
You guys came up with this topic.
You can't all choose A.

1843
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,520
One,

1844
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,120
two,

1845
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,750
three.

1846
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,830
(Which team did
the staff members pick?)

1847
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:17,850
My gosh.

1848
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,580
(There are more people
who chose A.)

1849
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:20,720
- He'll get married.
- A!

1850
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,120
- Of course.
- Who chose B?

1851
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,370
It's three years.
That's long enough.

1852
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,370
Who are you?

1853
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:27,290
Are you crazy?

1854
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,870
- Honestly...
- He will get married.

1855
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,500
I had to argue against it,
but I believed that you will.

1856
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,970
That's right.
I think he'll get married.

1857
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,330
- You know how we feel.
- I think you'll marry for sure.

1858
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,740
Of course he'll get married
within three years.

1859
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:36,810
Maybe next year.

1860
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,750
I didn't win any points.

1861
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:40,750
I got nine points.

1862
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:44,140
Each time you win,
we'll give you three points.

1863
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,620
Jae Suk earned nine points.

1864
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:49,790
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and So Min
won six points each.

1865
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,830
Wow, Jae Suk did really well.

1866
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:52,720
Suk Jin, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan
won three points each.

1867
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,850
- Haha earned nothing.
- All right.

1868
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,200
What's happening with our stocks?

1869
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,200
The stock trading for 2014
will begin again.

1870
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,470
Let's start the time now.

1871
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:04,500
I need to get information
on them again.

1872
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,310
- I'll just follow you.
- Share one if you have good info.

1873
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,410
(After a fierce battle
to earn points,)

1874
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:12,200
(the 2014 stock trading
has begun.)

1875
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:13,410
- Se Chan,
- Yes?

1876
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:14,770
how much do you have in total?

1877
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:15,770
I have 7,000 dollars.

1878
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,580
- 7,000?
- Yes.

1879
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,580
(Yang Se Chan's account balance)

1880
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,350
I'm young and rich.

1881
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:21,810
We should do a business together.

1882
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:22,810
(We should do a business together.)

1883
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:24,660
I know, right?

1884
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,220
Which field though?
Is the beauty industry okay?

1885
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,500
I just trust your guts, man.

1886
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,060
Okay, just trust me.

1887
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,020
So what are we investing in?

1888
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,470
- Let's go for H Beauty.
- H Beauty?

1889
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:35,500
We have to stick to it.

1890
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,470
The price for F Biotechnology
is stuck at 2 dollars.

1891
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,000
- That's...
- Suk Jin.

1892
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,500
I think the price will rise
this year.

1893
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,100
- This year?
- The thing is,

1894
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,350
as far as I remember,

1895
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,850
(His gaze is fixed on Jong Kook.)

1896
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:50,850
everyone talked about
biotech stocks.

1897
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,680
I remember that's how it was
back in 2015.

1898
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:55,520
F Biotechnology.

1899
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,220
(Hearing the rumor, the big investor
heads to Information Exchange.)

1900
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,850
Hello.

1901
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:00,220
- Hello.
- Hi.

1902
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,660
(The super investor doesn't easily
believe in the info that came free.)

1903
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:04,100
F Biotechnology, please.

1904
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,600
Here's the envelope
for F Biotechnology.

1905
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,200
("F Biotechnology Requests
Sale Approval...")

1906
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
("for Anti-cancer Drug that
Was Clinically Tested Abroad")

1907
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,870
(Will the stock price rise due to
high expectations for the new drug?)

1908
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,330
All right, thank you.

1909
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,870
(With his ability to eavesdrop
and insight, he got top info.)

1910
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,910
My goodness.

1911
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,020
I'm going all-in on F Biotechnology.

1912
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:26,350
- All-in?
- I'll add 600 dollars more.

1913
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,120
Please keep it from the others.

1914
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,120
(Staring)

1915
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,660
F Biotechnology
that only costs two dollars...

1916
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:36,200
is definitely going to
hit the jackpot at some point.

1917
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:38,470
But I'm not sure when.

1918
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:39,470
(Jong Kook has no idea when prices
will rise as he has no info.)

1919
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:42,200
It costs only two dollars,
so it can't go any lower than that.

1920
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:43,930
I've been thinking long,

1921
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,470
(Currently, Kwang Soo has the lowest
price-earnings ratio.)

1922
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,600
J Shipbuilding's price dropped.

1923
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,770
(I Chemical, J Shipbuilding)

1924
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:50,350
It's either J Shipbuilding
or I Chemical.

1925
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,310
- Are you saying...
- I set my mind...

1926
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,040
on either one of the two.

1927
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,180
- You think it'll rebound?
- I'll ask about J Shipbuilding,

1928
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,640
- and...
- If there are favorable factors...

1929
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,680
- "Rebound"?
- The price will rise again.

1930
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,350
- After it dropped...
- Rebounds means it'll rise again?

1931
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,450
(Rebounds means it'll rise again?)

1932
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:06,290
I'm certain that J Shipbuilding
will rebound within this year.

1933
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,290
(Pretends like nothing happened)

1934
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,950
It's showing signs of rebounding.

1935
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,720
There's an old saying that goes,
"Hold out."

1936
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,770
("Hold out" is an old saying?)

1937
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:15,790
J Shipbuilding will definitely
rebound within this year.

1938
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,600
I'm torn between I Chemical
and J Shipbuilding though.

1939
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:20,930
- Let me give you some advice.
- Okay.

1940
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,950
You need to recover quickly, right?

1941
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,540
Give me some tips, Suk Jin.

1942
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,640
But you still have...

1943
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,950
Kwang Soo is in last place.

1944
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,850
So if you move at this pace,
you'll never win.

1945
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:32,950
- I'm in last place too.
- So you should...

1946
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:33,950
You're in last place too?

1947
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,560
Then you two should...

1948
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,830
- aim for big profits.
- I Chemical is rising too slowly?

1949
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:40,600
The prices of I Chemical
and J Shipbuilding rise too slowly.

1950
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,660
You're taking
a lot of lessons today.

1951
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,870
No, that's not it.
He's giving me some information.

1952
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,290
For how many years has the price
for I Chemical dropped?

1953
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:48,560
It constantly dropped
for three years.

1954
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,060
That means it's going to drop more.

1955
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,500
Only the ones that are rising
will keep rising.

1956
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,910
There's this saying
that's famous in stocks.

1957
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,930
What is it?

1958
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,600
Don't get hit by the falling rain.

1959
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,470
Avoid grabbing a knife
that's falling.

1960
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,250
- And...
- That's right. I've heard of it.

1961
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,140
get on a galloping horse.

1962
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,140
(Get on a galloping horse.)

1963
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,120
- Which one is the galloping horse?
- B Entertainment?

1964
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,290
H Beauty!

1965
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,350
H Beauty is galloping!

1966
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:11,160
But I'm not sure if I should
buy H Beauty's stocks.

1967
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:15,350
I definitely gained experience
in stocks for all those years.

1968
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:16,700
What's your ranking?

1969
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,290
I'm in sixth place.

1970
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,640
I remember all those terms.

1971
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,470
Hello.

1972
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:24,040
(Kwang Soo came to get
credible information instead.)

1973
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,560
Level One Information
on J Shipbuilding, please.

1974
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,540
Here's Level One Information.

1975
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,470
"International Oil Prices Dropped".

1976
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,950
- "Greece Faces Default".
- Do you want to write it down?

1977
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,140
("International Oil Prices Dropped,
Greece Faces Default")

1978
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:38,220
Greece default...
What does that even mean?

1979
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:40,180
That's definitely bad, right?

1980
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:42,890
"Default"...

1981
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,180
Jae Suk, who is Default?

1982
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,290
Default. Greece Default.

1983
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:50,500
But it came out last week. Default.

1984
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,830
- You heard it last week.
- Oh, default.

1985
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,830
- What does it mean again?
- Something like a bubble economy...

1986
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,870
No, that's the lipstick effect.
Or not?

1987
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:59,910
I only memorized the answer,
not the question.

1988
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,040
It means going bankrupt.

1989
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,580
It means they can't
pay off their debts.

1990
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:05,770
That's about J Shipbuilding,
isn't it?

1991
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:06,970
- Let me see.
- Kwang Soo.

1992
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:08,950
- Kwang Soo, how much do you have?
- You asked about J Shipbuilding?

1993
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,040
- You agreed to listen to me.
- I have 10 dollars.

1994
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,250
I'll show you.

1995
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,580
- I...
- J Shipbuilding.

1996
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,750
No, don't buy J Shipbuilding.

1997
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:16,580
If it drops again, I'm done for.

1998
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,660
(Desperate)

1999
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,180
I Chemical's price
will go up though, right?

2000
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:22,350
(Do you want me to
share the information?)

2001
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:23,930
Do you want it?

2002
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:26,390
(Will Se Chan share the information
on F Biotechnology?)

2003
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,560
E Biotechnology.

2004
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,970
(E Biotechnology)

2005
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,470
(You want me to buy E Biotechnology
that costs 50 dollars?)

2006
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:35,370
But E Biotechnology is...

2007
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,370
(Se Chan only knows that the price
of F Biotechnology will increase.)

2008
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:40,270
If a biotech stock
costs 60 dollars...

2009
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,450
(A typical scene where
a small investor gets scammed.)

2010
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:44,750
Jae Suk, should I buy
B Entertainment or E Biotechnology?

2011
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,140
Just tell me that.

2012
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,120
B Entertainment?
I'm in last place right now.

2013
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,950
I'm really serious.

2014
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:52,290
Should I buy
B Entertainment or E Biotechnology?

2015
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:54,330
(Even for the mentor,
recommending an item is difficult.)

2016
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,560
Kwang Soo.

2017
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,750
(Kwang Soo.)

2018
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:58,390
- Forget it. I won't tell you.
- Go and listen to him...

2019
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,160
- since he's in first place.
- E Biotechnology?

2020
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,770
I told you. E Biotechnology...

2021
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:03,770
got approved by the FDA.

2022
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:06,370
I'm not in the mood to joke around.
I'm totally serious.

2023
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,080
Why would I fool you
when I have so much money?

2024
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,540
I'll give you my money later
if I'm wrong.

2025
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:12,600
E Biotechnology
got approved by the FDA.

2026
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,680
I'm not sure about the rest.

2027
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,750
And that's for E Biotechnology.

2028
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,950
Gosh, I want to buy E Biotechnology.

2029
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:19,640
You're buying E Biotechnology?

2030
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,220
I'll invest everything
in E Biotechnology.

2031
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,990
(As if they're possessed,
they buy E Biotechnology stocks.)

2032
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:24,350
(Yoo Jae Suk's account balance,
E Biotechnology)

2033
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:26,830
(Okay. My plan worked.)

2034
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,350
Should I go with the two-dollar one?

2035
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:30,660
(Jong Kook had his eyes
on the 2-dollar F Biotechnology.)

2036
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,290
I made up my mind.

2037
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,600
(Kim Jong Kook's account balance)

2038
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,970
I will invest in H Beauty
for another year.

2039
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,540
I will do that for another year.

2040
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:40,500
Really?

2041
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,700
I will wait for another year.

2042
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,870
(Tapping)

2043
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:45,750
Ji Hyo said that investing in stocks
doesn't suit her.

2044
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:47,250
Earn money by working hard.

2045
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:48,540
I think that's my style.

2046
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,180
I am the same.
I earn money by working hard.

2047
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:53,310
If that's your style, it will be
upsetting to lose money like this.

2048
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,560
You were telling the truth, right?

2049
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:57,350
- For goodness' sake.
- I am desperate right now.

2050
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:58,950
Take this.

2051
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,790
If the prices fall again...

2052
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,290
- If you don't trust me, forget it.
- This is also for E Biotechnology.

2053
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:05,290
This is also for E Biotechnology.

2054
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,390
Please wrap it up.

2055
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:10,060
If the prices fall again,
I will be done for.

2056
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:11,470
The bell will ring.

2057
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:12,560
Here it comes!

2058
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,580
The price has to rise.
E Biotechnology!

2059
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:15,870
- Do we need to sit down?
- E Biotechnology!

2060
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:17,180
(He spread false rumors
about E Biotechnology.)

2061
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:18,200
Hold on to it!

2062
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:19,870
- Let's see it.
- Here it comes.

2063
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,770
- I can't sit down and wait.
- Let's go.

2064
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,520
(Please!)

2065
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,450
I told you that
H Beauty's stock price will rise.

2066
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:30,080
- Okay!
- E Biotechnology, 1,100 percent!

2067
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,290
E Biotechnology!

2068
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:32,660
Gosh, E Biotechnology.

2069
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:35,220
F Biotechnology's stock price
rose by 500 percent.

2070
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,290
My goodness.

2071
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:38,790
(E Biotechnology's stock price
rose by 1,100 percent.)

2072
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,540
(How did this happen?)

2073
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:45,060
(Se Chan's false information
gave them the biggest success.)

2074
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:46,930
Kwang Soo, I had no idea.

2075
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,200
No way. Hold on.

2076
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,370
E Biotechnology!

2077
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:51,580
Hold on to it!

2078
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,870
E Biotechnology!

2079
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,680
(Yoo Jae Suk's account balance)

2080
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,870
(Ji Suk Jin's account balance)

2081
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,580
I invested all of my money
in biotechnology.

2082
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,540
E Biotechnology's stock price
rose by 1,100 percent.

2083
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,060
Was it the year of biotechnology?

2084
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:02,890
F Biotechnology's stock price
rose by 500 percent.

2085
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:04,430
(Song Ji Hyo's account balance)

2086
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,580
1,100 percent?

2087
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,000
(She didn't invest
in biotechnology.)

2088
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,870
- It was E Biotechnology.
- 1,100 percent!

2089
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:12,000
1,100 percent?

2090
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,270
You have over 2,000 dollars.

2091
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:15,390
Did you invest all of your money
in E Biotechnology?

2092
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,660
Thank you.

2093
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,100
Thank you.

2094
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:19,970
- All right.
- FDA approved! E Biotechnology!

2095
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,240
FDA!

2096
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,470
Was there really information
about the FDA?

2097
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:25,600
No, there wasn't.

2098
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,270
- Was it a lie?
- It was a lie.

2099
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,910
I knew about F Biotechnology,
but E Biotechnology was the jackpot.

2100
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:32,220
E Biotechnology.
How much do I have now?

2101
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,340
(The number of zeros multiplied.)

2102
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,710
2,460 dollars.

2103
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,090
I went from 200 dollars
to 2,460 dollars.

2104
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:39,260
This is insane.

2105
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:41,130
(Suk Jin is excited as well
since he invested in biotechnology.)

2106
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:43,220
Is that all?

2107
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:45,590
(He can't help but become greedy.)

2108
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,670
I invested in F Biotechnology.

2109
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,460
Hold on.

2110
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,710
- How much is that?
- How much does he have now?

2111
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:54,210
- 45,000 dollars.
- 45,000 dollars?

2112
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,470
I might make 100,000 dollars
at this rate!

2113
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:57,640
That's insane!

2114
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,340
How did he go from 500 dollars
to 45,000 dollars?

2115
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:01,750
- Is that even possible?
- He is a genius at this.

2116
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,340
He has 772 percent.

2117
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,090
- That's incredible.
- 1,100 percent.

2118
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,210
11 times.

2119
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:08,710
(Se Chan's account balance
keeps increasing each year.)

2120
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:10,180
I have over 4,000 dollars now.

2121
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,050
- I have over 4,000 dollars now.
- I don't have much.

2122
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:15,020
I invested in E Biotechnology
and F Biotechnology.

2123
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,090
I am at the bottom.

2124
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:18,960
(She realizes
that she is at the bottom.)

2125
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:22,300
Se Chan, thank you.

2126
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,060
So it was FDA approved.

2127
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,910
Se Chan.

2128
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,010
Do you know anything about
this year's FDA approval?

2129
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,470
FDA approval? I will have to see.

2130
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,710
But E Biotechnology...

2131
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:34,270
(Let's see.)

2132
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,620
(He checks Se Chan's portfolio.)

2133
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,120
Hold on. You knew
that E Biotechnology...

2134
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:39,750
would be FDA approved,

2135
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:40,850
but you didn't invest a cent.

2136
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:42,920
Look at this.

2137
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,380
- Listen, Kwang Soo.
- Hold on.

2138
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,760
E Biotechnology's stock price
rose by 1,100 percent,

2139
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,590
- but he invested in...
- He didn't choose E Biotechnology.

2140
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,460
- F Biotechnology.
- He chose F Biotechnology.

2141
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,590
Even with my false information,
you made a 1,100-percent profit.

2142
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,040
- I did.
- You should be satisfied.

2143
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,040
- You didn't lose any money.
- In any case, you are a savior.

2144
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,240
You will go bankrupt...

2145
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,630
because of swindlers like him.

2146
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,300
- I need information.
- Information matters a lot.

2147
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,140
(Having the correct information
is the only way to survive!)

2148
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,340
I will go and look.

2149
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:07,950
I will go and look
at the information.

2150
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:10,210
It's time to receive information.

2151
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,210
(Jong Kook makes a move.)

2152
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:14,810
Hello. I am back.

2153
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,350
(A regular at Information Exchange
visits this year as well.)

2154
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,880
This year...

2155
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,090
(Proud)

2156
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:22,460
With the information
you gave me last year,

2157
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,830
I was able to make some money.

2158
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,240
I will give you this as a thank you.

2159
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,430
(He shows off with R money.)

2160
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:30,670
Information on
E Biotechnology, please.

2161
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,100
- Level One Information?
- Yes.

2162
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,340
(He purchases Level 1 Information
on E Biotechnology.)

2163
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,910
E Biotechnology.

2164
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,380
"An official notice
of technology export contract..."

2165
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:39,640
Does that mean they will export it?

2166
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:41,080
What does it mean?

2167
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,770
Isn't it a good thing?

2168
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,810
(He thinks it's a good thing
because there are big words.)

2169
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:46,840
What does it mean?

2170
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:51,520
Jae Suk!

2171
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,260
- Yes?
- What does "Official notice" mean?

2172
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:54,590
(What does "Official notice" mean?)

2173
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:55,720
"Official notice".

2174
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,800
That's how the information starts.

2175
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:59,090
What's the full sentence?

2176
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:00,840
(What's the full sentence?)

2177
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,130
I can't tell you that.

2178
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,300
Then I can't tell you what it means.

2179
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,740
It's about E Biotechnology.

2180
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:06,460
Is it a good thing?

2181
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:07,710
It's a good thing
to export technology, right?

2182
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,740
- "Official notice".
- I think it's a good thing.

2183
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:12,010
It's a good thing
to export technology, right?

2184
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,210
- It's a good thing.
- That's right.

2185
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,420
Hold on to it.

2186
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,670
(He ends up receiving
good information.)

2187
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,310
E Biotechnology's official notice
of technology export contract?

2188
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:19,710
(E Biotechnology's official notice
of technology export contract?)

2189
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:20,880
In that case...

2190
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:22,880
He gave me good information.

2191
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,790
I will invest in E Biotechnology.

2192
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,850
(Will E Biotechnology's stock price
rise one more time?)

2193
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:28,960
Did you ask about biotechnology?

2194
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,300
- What?
- Biotechnology?

2195
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,460
- I can't tell you for free.
- Of course not.

2196
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,590
I can give you 10 dollars.

2197
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,430
I am sorry.

2198
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:37,630
Jae Suk.

2199
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,600
I am your friend.

2200
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,880
- Please help me.
- I know that, but...

2201
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,130
I am sorry.

2202
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:45,410
Jae Suk, I will have
my fourth child soon.

2203
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:46,950
(He uses a strong move.)

2204
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:48,010
Raise the child well.

2205
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:50,770
Will one member receive the penalty?

2206
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:51,880
- Yes.
- Jae Suk.

2207
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,210
I am at the bottom.

2208
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,090
Please give me a tip.

2209
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:56,880
Seriously.

2210
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,990
I am at the bottom.

2211
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:59,850
(Jae Suk decides to have mercy
on the novice.)

2212
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,050
Buy E Biotechnology's stock.

2213
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:04,920
E Biotechnology?
You mean it, right? I trust you.

2214
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,420
(He recommends E Biotechnology
based on the information he got.)

2215
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:07,590
I got the information
from someone else.

2216
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,300
I will buy E Biotechnology's stock.

2217
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,840
- You will sell H Beauty's stocks.
- Yes.

2218
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,430
So Min, did you receive information?

2219
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,380
I got some Level One Information.

2220
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,050
What do you know about foods?

2221
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,250
It's so strange.

2222
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,490
Isn't it unrelated
to the hotel business?

2223
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:26,120
My information was about
Gangwon Province's hotel business.

2224
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,310
(Deregulation on
Gangwon's province's hotel business)

2225
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:29,590
- What did it say?
- Something about deregulation.

2226
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,260
- That was for foods?
- I don't remember.

2227
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,090
Yes. The information seemed to be
completely unrelated.

2228
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,890
That was for foods?

2229
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:35,920
(Suk Jin checks the information
on foods.)

2230
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,000
Gangwon Province's hotel business?

2231
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:41,130
(She fails to receive help
even after sharing information.)

2232
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:42,870
Foods...

2233
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,630
I will pull out of G Foods
and invest in I Chemical.

2234
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:48,880
(She sells all her G Foods stocks
and buys I Chemical stocks.)

2235
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:50,430
Gangwon Province's hotel business?

2236
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,750
It means the economy is improving.

2237
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,450
I will invest all of the money...

2238
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:56,470
(He uses the information...)

2239
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:57,550
on G Foods.

2240
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:59,090
(to purchase G Foods stocks.)

2241
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:00,250
I will buy as much as I can.

2242
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:03,510
Why isn't
G Foods' stock price rising?

2243
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,960
Didn't it rise?

2244
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,020
(G Foods' stock price
has fallen for 4 years.)

2245
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,180
I see.

2246
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,720
With 500 dollars,

2247
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,420
(After looking at the chart)

2248
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,460
I will buy G Foods stocks.

2249
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,060
- G Foods?
- Yes.

2250
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,500
Level Two Information
on E Biotechnology.

2251
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,710
- I can buy it, right?
- Yes.

2252
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,010
(He purchases Level 2 Information
on E Biotechnology.)

2253
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,100
E Biotechnology.

2254
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,100
(E Biotechnology terminates
the technology export contract...)

2255
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,840
(in a single day,
and stock prices fall.)

2256
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,420
(Kwang Soo also checked
the information on E Biotechnology,)

2257
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:34,660
(but the Level 2 Information
showed a twist.)

2258
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:37,590
(Not knowing about the twist,
Jae Suk and Ji Hyo invested...)

2259
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:39,760
(in E Biotechnology.)

2260
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,960
Okay, okay.

2261
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:44,000
E Biotechnology. Gosh.

2262
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,220
Then I shouldn't invest
in E Biotechnology.

2263
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,330
(Which strategy will he use
this time?)

2264
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,840
I invested in G Foods.

2265
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,010
How much did you invest?

2266
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,600
- I went all-in.
- All-in?

2267
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,710
- Invest in E Biotechnology!
- E Biotechnology and G Foods.

2268
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:56,410
(Invest in E Biotechnology!)

2269
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:57,770
I invested in those two.

2270
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:58,770
Buy some more stocks.

2271
01:13:58,770 --> 01:13:59,770
Listen to me.

2272
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,250
Invest in E Biotechnology,
not G Foods.

2273
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:03,750
Should I pull out of G Foods?

2274
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,010
But there is information on G Foods.

2275
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:08,260
Deregulation on
Gangwon's province's hotel business.

2276
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,050
(He is giving me information
on G Foods.)

2277
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,130
Don't you trust me?

2278
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:15,050
The stock price won't rise
by 100 percent or 200 percent.

2279
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:18,060
But E Biotechnology's stock price
will rise by over 1,000 percent.

2280
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,020
- That's what you didn't know.
- Hold on.

2281
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,040
Invest in E Biotechnology.

2282
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,090
(It's easy to fool Kwang Soo.)

2283
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:24,240
I will sell
all of my F Biotechnology stocks...

2284
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,340
and invest 20,000 dollars
in G Foods.

2285
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,880
(He invests in G Foods
thanks to Kwang Soo's information.)

2286
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,130
20,000 dollars in G Foods.

2287
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:31,170
Listen.

2288
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:33,450
We will get ruined
if false information spreads.

2289
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:36,670
- Seriously. It's spreading.
- False information is spreading.

2290
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:37,790
(It's the year-end of 2015.)

2291
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,450
- Let's go.
- Please.

2292
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:40,590
Happy New Year!

2293
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:42,010
Let's go, E Biotechnology!

2294
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:44,550
(Se Chan's recommendation,
E Biotechnology?)

2295
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,590
(F Biotechnology?)

2296
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,720
Foods.

2297
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,050
(The wealthy investors' pick,
G Foods?)

2298
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,220
Let's go!

2299
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,130
(All of them feel like
they will be rich!)

2300
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,460
(Who will get to smile?)

2301
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:57,460
The price rose.

2302
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,100
(The 2016 Stock Market)

2303
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,630
- What?
- The price rose.

2304
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:03,630
- What rose?
- What is up with H Beauty?

2305
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:06,140
- The price rose the same way.
- Thank goodness.

2306
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,450
(E Biotechnology's stock price fell
and G Foods' stock price rose.)

2307
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,120
(G Foods' stock price rose
by 25 percent.)

2308
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,450
What rose?

2309
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:13,180
What is up with H Beauty?
The price rose the same way.

2310
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,260
Thank goodness.

2311
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:18,720
(He became the nouveau riche
through stocks.)

2312
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:23,260
(E Biotechnology's stock price fell
by 50 percent?)

2313
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:26,260
Kwang Soo, I told you to sell
the E Biotechnology stocks.

2314
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,870
The price rose the same way.

2315
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:29,890
This is bad.

2316
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,010
- Ji Hyo.
- The price rose the same way.

2317
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,670
I trusted Kwang Soo's information.

2318
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,600
I guess it wasn't reflected
in the stock price.

2319
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,800
(He just lost half of his fortune.)

2320
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,210
I listened to Kwang Soo...

2321
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:39,800
and invested in G Foods.

2322
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:41,470
- I went all-in.
- All-in?

2323
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:42,550
- You earned money.
- 25 percent.

2324
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,990
How did you get information
on E Biotechnology?

2325
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,050
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo lost
half of her money again.)

2326
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,050
That little...

2327
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,460
(She swears without realizing it.)

2328
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:50,590
(This is how a novice investor
loses her entire fortune.)

2329
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:51,960
I shouldn't have trusted him.

2330
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,290
It's real information I received.

2331
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:55,500
That was Level One Information.

2332
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:57,870
Level Two Information was about
a drop in the stock price.

2333
01:15:57,870 --> 01:15:58,870
(An unexpected variable
made the stock price fall.)

2334
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:00,520
I should have gotten
this information.

2335
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,540
I only got Level One Information.

2336
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,760
- This is driving me crazy.
- This is driving me crazy.

2337
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:06,760
- I can't believe Kwang Soo!
- I am sorry.

2338
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,540
This is driving me crazy.

2339
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,770
I beat him. Okay.

2340
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,250
(Suk Jin got ahead of him.)

2341
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,380
Minus 3,900 dollars?

2342
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:14,140
(The E Biotechnology stockholder
becomes speechless.)

2343
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,950
You invested in E Biotechnology,
didn't you?

2344
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:17,920
This is bad.

2345
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,010
Hey.

2346
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:20,790
I will be able to buy
a Mercedes-Benz soon!

2347
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:21,810
(Yang Se Chan's account balance)

2348
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,590
- I'm getting close to an E-Class.
- Really?

2349
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:25,420
(He will be able
to buy an E-Class soon!)

2350
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,800
- I made so much money.
- How much do you have now?

2351
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,000
I have 57,000 dollars.

2352
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,830
(I have 57,000 dollars.)

2353
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:34,370
You went from 500 dollars
to 57,000 dollars.

2354
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,240
You are a master investor.

2355
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,840
He is like Warren Buffett.

2356
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,910
Warren Buffett?

2357
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,410
(Some people made money,
and others lost money.)

2358
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:43,410
Ji Hyo. I thought
it was correct information.

2359
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:44,910
(This is how you lose a friend
by investing in stocks.)

2360
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:47,210
Ji Hyo. I thought
it was correct information.

2361
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,250
Jae Suk.

2362
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,640
This is why we need information
of a higher level.

2363
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,050
Don't you have information points?

2364
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,810
Jae Suk, I used them already.

2365
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,120
- Don't ask me for help.
- This is driving me crazy.

2366
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,990
I am so upset because of you.

2367
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,050
(Kwang Soo checks
his account balance.)

2368
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:01,720
Why would the price rise again
after going up by 1,100 percent?

2369
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,020
You fools.

2370
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:05,870
(Lee Kwang Soo's account balance)

2371
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:07,170
(Suk Jin moved up
with his G Foods stocks.)

2372
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:09,560
- Gosh.
- Nothing goes my way.

2373
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:10,870
What's the point
of earning money here?

2374
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:12,870
I am losing money in real life.

2375
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,910
This game makes life fun.

2376
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,800
What's the point
of earning R money here?

2377
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:20,300
My stock prices fell in real life.

2378
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,710
(The stockholder of G Foods
wakes up from the sweet dream.)

2379
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,640
This is frustrating.

2380
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,640
This is driving me crazy.

2381
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,710
What is up with biotechnology?

2382
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:31,050
It's about time
the biotechnology stock prices fall.

2383
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,680
I will sell
all the biotechnology stocks.

2384
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,760
(She says a tearful goodbye
to biotechnology.)

2385
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,920
Once I earn the principal amount,

2386
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,390
I will be done.

2387
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:39,590
I am sorry, but we won't meet again.

2388
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:41,430
- I heard that so many times.
- I am serious.

2389
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,060
"I will stop investing in stocks
once I earn back my principal."

2390
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:46,300
I heard that so many times
from the actual investors.

2391
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,100
Which stocks did you buy earlier?
G Foods?

2392
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,210
Me? Ji Hyo, you should buy
F Biotechnology now.

2393
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,670
Biotechnology is on the rise.

2394
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:57,120
Get lost.

2395
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,260
I am purchasing information.

2396
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,010
When will I Chemical see the light?

2397
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,260
I Chemical stock price
will rise this time.

2398
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:06,260
I Chemical keeps falling.

2399
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,290
(I Chemical stock price
didn't rise for years.)

2400
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:08,330
I should get information.

2401
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:11,050
(The tall investor thinks
I Chemical stocks look cool.)

2402
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:12,590
I want information on I Chemical.

2403
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:13,700
- Level One Information?
- Yes.

2404
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,430
The stock price fell
for four consecutive years.

2405
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:17,040
"The government announces plans
to fight fine dust."

2406
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,740
(The government announces plans
to fight fine dust.)

2407
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,380
How is this related to I Chemical?

2408
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:23,270
Let me write it down.

2409
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,470
(Why would you ask me that?)

2410
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,340
I don't know if it's a good thing
or not.

2411
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:29,580
(He ends up writing down the words
and exiting like last time.)

2412
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,450
Jae Suk.

2413
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,050
What does fine dust have to do
with the chemical industry?

2414
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,210
Your information ruined me
last time.

2415
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,420
This is the actual information.

2416
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:38,630
- It's real.
- What is it?

2417
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,880
I am thinking about
investing in I Chemical.

2418
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,260
- Fine dust was a big problem then.
- Yes.

2419
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:44,760
"The government announces plans
to fight fine dust."

2420
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,090
It's a good thing, right?

2421
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:51,060
I will trust you this time.

2422
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,630
This is actual information.

2423
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,510
It's real. I am serious.

2424
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:55,540
(Without Jae Suk's help,
Kwang Soo has to take a wild guess.)

2425
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,580
It's a good thing, right?

2426
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,380
(He follows his mentor.)

2427
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,380
It's a good thing, right?

2428
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:00,710
It's real.

2429
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,450
I will invest everything
in I Chemical.

2430
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:03,580
- I Chemical?
- Yes.

2431
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,620
(Jae Suk invests in I Chemical.)

2432
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,010
I have to take this chance
if I want to win.

2433
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:08,990
I will invest all of the money
in I Chemical.

2434
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,790
- You will sell everything?
- Yes.

2435
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,420
Guys, it's December.

2436
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,850
Wrap it up.

2437
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:15,890
(Everyone is serious.)

2438
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,090
Is that outfit okay?

2439
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,300
Hold on. Come on, Jae Suk.

2440
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,670
- Jae Suk.
- Hold on.

2441
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:21,300
You need to put your pants on.
What is your problem?

2442
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,840
I am wearing leggings.

2443
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,040
Hold on.

2444
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,560
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

2445
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,560
- You need to put your pants on.
- You are wearing leggings too.

2446
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,740
I am wearing shorts over them.

2447
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,040
You look ridiculous.

2448
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,770
It's too hot in here.

2449
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:34,510
You should take them off
and put your pants on.

2450
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:35,640
These are pants.

2451
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,080
Those aren't pants.

2452
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,380
You are wearing leggings.

2453
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:41,090
Jong Kook,
you are wearing leggings too.

2454
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:42,210
I am wearing shorts over them.

2455
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,310
Why can't I wear them?

2456
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:46,380
I hope I don't end up
at the very bottom.

2457
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,630
After this year...

2458
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:48,630
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo's minds
are on the penalty.)

2459
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:50,020
If the price rises,

2460
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,460
please take out all the money
no matter what I say.

2461
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,590
- I need to quit.
- You want to cash everything out?

2462
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:55,960
Yes.

2463
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:58,630
If the price falls,
I will have to try one more time.

2464
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,410
If I remember correctly,

2465
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:04,170
biotechnology rose in 2017.

2466
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,050
Are you certain?

2467
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:09,140
I invested in biotechnology stocks
and earned money back then.

2468
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,680
You guys are acting like
stock experts.

2469
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,140
(They are becoming more invested
as the years progress.)

2470
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,460
People are becoming
very careful now.

2471
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:17,710
It's December.

2472
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,290
12,000?

2473
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:21,830
That's 15,000 dollars' worth.

2474
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:23,960
15,000 dollars? Hold on.

2475
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:25,560
Let's see.

2476
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,330
Since I don't have enough change,
I will give you a blank check.

2477
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:29,670
I am getting a blank check now.

2478
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:31,000
- Really?
- Yes.

2479
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,040
(He started with an annual salary
of 7,000 dollars in the opening.)

2480
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,870
- That's incredible.
- I am jealous.

2481
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:35,300
I will give you
a 9,000-dollar check.

2482
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,710
A 9,000-dollar check?

2483
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,250
10,000 dollars, right?

2484
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:41,380
I will give you this.

2485
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:42,640
I will buy 100 shares
in F Biotechnology.

2486
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,750
(Other investors
try to beat Se Chan.)

2487
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:46,250
- I will buy 100 shares.
- 100 shares in F Biotechnology.

2488
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:48,210
I will invest all the money
in F Biotechnology.

2489
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,460
I will go back to the beginning.

2490
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,550
F Biotechnology.

2491
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,550
- Will you invest everything?
- Yes. F Biotechnology.

2492
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,130
You should listen to the people
around you.

2493
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,130
I will buy
some F Biotechnology stocks.

2494
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:01,960
(Jae Suk belatedly buys
F Biotechnology stocks.)

2495
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:05,340
I will sell everything
and invest in G Foods.

2496
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,410
(Jong Kook invests in G Foods.)

2497
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:09,170
Gosh, I put all my eggs
in one basket.

2498
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:10,430
I did it for a big break.

2499
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,450
J Shipbuilding stock price
dropped so much.

2500
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:14,100
It dropped so much.

2501
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,710
J Shipbuilding, 10 shares.

2502
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,640
All right. It's time.

2503
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:21,140
Please wrap it up.

2504
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,960
- Let's go.
- Please.

2505
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,960
- Please.
- I need a big break.

2506
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,850
Please let me succeed this year.

2507
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:28,500
I need to earn money this year.

2508
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,500
I need a big break.

2509
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,920
(Everyone took chances
since only a few years remain!)

2510
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,390
(The stock price will increase
the gap between the rich and poor.)

2511
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:34,590
Happy New Year!

2512
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:35,800
Come on!

2513
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,060
Let me hear some good news.

2514
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,340
I have no confidence.

2515
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,100
(Many people invested
in F Biotechnology.)

2516
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:42,770
(Kwang Soo and Jae Suk invested
in I Chemical.)

2517
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:45,380
(Se Chan and Jong Kook picked
G Foods.)

2518
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:46,470
- Please.
- Biotechnology.

2519
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:47,510
(The stock prices of 2017
are revealed.)

2520
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:48,640
Yes!

2521
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,210
- Biotechnology!
- G Foods.

2522
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:52,750
(The stock prices of 2017
are shocking.)

2523
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,710
(The investors' fierce battle
begins.)

2524
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,920
(The novice investors...)

2525
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,660
(dream of rising above
as they sell their souls to money.)

2526
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:00,290
(As the real and fake information
get mixed up,)

2527
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,830
(the rankings change dramatically.)

a neck-and-neck match.)

I even had a photoshoot!
