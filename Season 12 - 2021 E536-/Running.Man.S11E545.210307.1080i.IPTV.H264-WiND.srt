1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,630
(Last week, in Running Village...)

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,600
(It was a birthday party for
the village elder, Ji Suk Jin.)

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,960
(Happy birthday, Mr. Ji.)

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,840
(Ji Suk Jin, born in February,
the oldest in Running Village)

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,270
(Stay healthy, Mr. Ji.)

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,750
(The residents are excited
about Mr. Ji's birthday party.)

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,120
(A parade of presents is a must
at a birthday party.)

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,620
(A bamboo wife)

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,320
(That's a lie.)

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,680
(Jae Suk got him a gateball set.)

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,730
(Bravo to your
shining variety life.)

12
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,820
(We love you
for the rest of your life.)

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,320
(Long life, health, blessing)

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,100
(They had some good times together
celebrating his birthday.)

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,500
Long life, health, and blessing.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,640
The residents of Running Village
congratulated Suk Jin today.

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,970
The village head...

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,470
sent a present to Suk Jin,
the oldest resident,

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,680
to wish him a long and healthy life.

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,110
- This is the real present.
- Seriously.

21
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,010
Why wish for a long and healthy life
when I am in my 50s?

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,010
Is it a letter?

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,210
It's a letter.

24
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,420
(There's a letter in the gift box.)

25
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,960
"Dear Mr. Ji Suk Jin."

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,960
"Happy birthday to Mr. Ji Suk Jin,
the oldest resident of the village."

27
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,420
"Were you surprised
by the empty box?"

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,920
I haven't checked the box yet.

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,560
"For your birthday,
I prepared a surprise event."

30
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,400
"At a place in the village
that is related to 'House',"

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,930
- "I hid the gold I prepared."
- Gold?

32
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,610
(Gold?)

33
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,870
"I hope you will find it well."

34
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,750
"I think it'd be hard for you
to find it by yourself,"

35
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,710
"so I'm giving you..."

36
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,070
"an important hint."

37
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,450
He just took it.

38
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,480
"And you can pick two members
who are clever..."

39
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,180
"and decode the clues
I'm giving you with them..."

40
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,620
"to find the gold."

41
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,820
"The other five members will..."

42
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,320
"look for the gold individually."

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,670
Individually?

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,500
"If your team finds the gold first,"

45
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,760
"you can share it
with your members."

46
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,670
"The other residents will
find hidden hints."

47
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,230
"The resident who touches
the box that has gold in it..."

48
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,230
- "will have the gold to oneself."
- That sounds fun.

49
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,010
"Those who fail to find my gift
will get a penalty."

50
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,510
"If your team finds the gold,"

51
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,250
"you will get to pick two people
to get a penalty."

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,540
"If one of the residents finds it,"

53
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,310
"the winner will pick two people
from your team to get a penalty."

54
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,860
"Good luck, everyone."

55
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,810
- So it's like 5 to 3.
- Right.

56
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,920
That sounds good.

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,820
Like the letter says, you will have
a race where you look for gold.

58
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,950
It's called
It's Time to Find the Gold Race.

59
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,100
I see.

60
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,520
Suk Jin, we'd like you to pick
two clever members...

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,470
whom you want to be a team with.

62
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,110
We have many members
who are good at petty tricks.

63
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,410
- There are a lot.
- That's right.

64
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,480
- Suk Jin is...
- Haha is good at this.

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,800
Suk Jin has gotten penalties
for the past six weeks.

66
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,070
- That's right.
- He needs to end it.

67
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,950
He should break the jinx today.

68
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,950
He's not so lucky.

69
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,850
Who'd be good at tricks?

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,110
- So Min is good.
- What about Kwang Soo?

71
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,790
So Min won't even look at him.

72
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,220
So Min, you should look at Suk Jin.

73
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,820
- Why would you avoid him?
- Two members.

74
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,190
I've made up my mind.

75
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,760
(He picks two members
after much consideration.)

76
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,860
Kim Jong Kook and Lee Kwang Soo.

77
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,320
- Darn it.
- Okay.

78
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,670
(They are recruited to
Suk Jin's team against their will.)

79
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,830
Hey. What was that?

80
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,610
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Seriously.

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,510
You don't have to do this.
I don't want you anymore.

82
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,040
- Today is a good day.
- Hey.

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,300
Hey, Kwang Soo. Hey.

84
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,910
- Try to smile.
- Hey.

85
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,270
Today is a good day.

86
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,170
- What are you doing?
- He didn't answer.

87
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,690
Hey, I don't want you on my team.

88
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,720
I don't need you either.

89
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,220
- I'm really...
- Yes!

90
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,450
I need to break the jinx
of six penalties, Jong Kook.

91
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,480
Jong Kook.

92
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,520
Hang on.

93
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,230
Aren't the three of you the ones
who wrote the letter of apology?

94
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,660
- That's right.
- They did.

95
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,860
You three wrote
the letter of apology.

96
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,600
And you flew a kite with me.

97
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,630
That's right.

98
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,940
Why are we doing this
on such a good day?

99
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,040
- He's right about that.
- Okay.

100
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,440
I often meet them at the ending.

101
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,610
Exactly.

102
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,910
So your team is decided.

103
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,640
Before we start the mission,

104
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,170
we will play
the first game for hints.

105
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,300
Like I said,

106
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,240
there are hints
hidden in the village.

107
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,720
Unlike how we normally do things,
in this round,

108
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,220
you will go to a random place
in this village...

109
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,920
where you think
the gold is hidden...

110
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,420
carrying your tracking device
with you.

111
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,290
Once you are done
choosing your place,

112
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,700
the device of the member who's
closest to the gold will go off.

113
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,670
And for the next 15 minutes,

114
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,760
you will look for the gold or hints.

115
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,110
We even have tracking devices.

116
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,700
(The one who stays
closest to the gold...)

117
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,230
(will find out the approximate
location of the gold.)

118
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,200
But even if your device
doesn't go off,

119
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,950
you can still find hints
about the location of the gold.

120
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,540
So you should try
to look for the hints.

121
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,010
- We should find the hints first.
- Now, I want you...

122
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,690
to move to places where you think
the gold is hidden.

123
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,860
- Okay.
- Let's go.

124
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,750
A place where I think
the gold is hidden?

125
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,230
Hang on. Where should I go?

126
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,750
There are many houses.

127
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,790
So...

128
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,330
I should go to a place
where I think the gold is hidden.

129
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,490
- Right.
- Any place in the village.

130
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,040
In this whole village?

131
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,730
The whole place?

132
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
We have hints.

133
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,110
- Right. We have hints.
- We can see the hints first.

134
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's see the hints
and move separately.

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,850
We can go to places that are
more likely to have the gold.

136
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,110
We should think the five of us...

137
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,810
- are on the same boat.
- Okay.

138
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,810
- All right, Jae Suk.
- Us?

139
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,720
- We should scatter away.
- Okay.

140
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
(They agree to scatter
and find the gold separately.)

141
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,220
2 will go up, and 3 will go down.

142
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,810
We should scatter in all directions.

143
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,120
It says Haha's House.

144
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,330
(Haha's House near the slope?)

145
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,620
I guess they are all
someone's house.

146
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,170
What's that?

147
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,490
It says House of Dolls.

148
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,630
I'll go to House of Dolls.

149
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,430
- Did you feel that too?
- I felt it.

150
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,300
Will you go that way?
I'll stay here.

151
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,980
Take a look at it. I'll get in...

152
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,280
Will you get in the car?

153
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,870
What's all this?

154
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,150
There's a giraffe.

155
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,350
(What's the house
full of stuffed dolls for?)

156
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,370
Giraffe.

157
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,520
Let's check the hint first.

158
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,220
(Suk Jin and his team
check the hint first.)

159
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,860
"All the houses aren't the same."

160
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,530
(This is an important hint
only for Suk Jin.)

161
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,380
(Don't share it
with the other residents.)

162
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,190
(Hint: All the houses
aren't the same.)

163
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,290
"All the houses aren't the same."

164
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,920
Suk Jin, there's House of Sports.

165
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,130
There are many houses.

166
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,040
(There's House of Sports
right behind them.)

167
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,300
(House of Sports)

168
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,730
(But in other buildings
in Running Village...)

169
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,540
(House of Deep Sleep)

170
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,240
(There are many houses...)

171
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,520
(with different themes.)

172
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,480
(House of Cooking)

173
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,460
(There are many mysterious
houses in Running Village.)

174
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,660
(There are also the houses
of the 8 residents in the village.)

175
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,250
(So Min's House, Ji Hyo's House,
Jong Kook's House)

176
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,750
(Hyeong Gu's House,
Jae Suk's House, Suk Jin's House)

177
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,400
(Se Chan's House, Kwang Soo's house,
Haha's House)

178
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,600
"All the houses aren't the same."

179
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,290
Suk Jin, there's House of Sports.

180
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,560
There are many houses.

181
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,770
I bet the gold isn't
in one of these houses.

182
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,710
- There are real houses.
- Like a doghouse.

183
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,000
- A doghouse.
- Right.

184
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,370
There is a doghouse in the middle.

185
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,080
Will you stay in the doghouse then?

186
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,080
I'm just asking.

187
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,610
That's what the hint says.

188
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,150
Why would I go into a doghouse?

189
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,880
There's a doghouse, a birdhouse,

190
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,620
and other things.

191
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,590
- It should be something like that.
- Things that say house.

192
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,360
"All the houses aren't the same."

193
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,490
(Did the three of them
solve the hint right?)

194
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,960
- Should we go into some house?
- What would it be?

195
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,230
Let's go look for the gold.
We're a team now.

196
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,560
- Okay.
- Okay? Good luck.

197
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,490
- I'm serious about this.
- Let's do this seriously.

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,670
House of Books?

199
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,710
Are we on the same team?

200
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,370
Sure. We're a team.

201
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,410
(They should find a place
where the gold is hidden.)

202
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,740
(Scanning)

203
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,350
I don't think it's here.

204
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,440
(He doesn't think the gold is
in a cute place like that.)

205
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,790
I'll stay here.

206
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,810
(I'll stay here.)

207
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,920
I'll stay here.

208
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,460
I don't think this is it.

209
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,460
The house Jae Suk abandons...

210
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,420
is more likely
to be the correct answer.

211
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,400
I pick this place. I'll stay here.

212
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,690
(Se Chan picks an open space
near the three-way intersection.)

213
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,790
I pick this place.

214
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,690
I'll stay in the center.

215
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,670
I should've put on warmer clothes.

216
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,110
Suk Jin, you're the lead today.
You have two cameras.

217
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,370
That's not true.

218
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,670
- All members are the leads.
- This is so cool.

219
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,870
I'll give you the gold if I find it.

220
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,910
Okay.

221
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,720
(Who will find the gold that's
a birthday gift for Suk Jin?)

222
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,150
We did many important things
around here.

223
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,290
(Kwang Soo tries to find out
the gold based on his experience.)

224
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,790
I personally think it's around here.

225
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,730
Because we did
a lot of things here before.

226
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,790
- Is this your choice?
- Yes.

227
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,230
If I'm close to the gold,
will you tell me that?

228
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,670
Your tracking device will go off.

229
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,900
The one who's closest to the gold.

230
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,060
(This is it.)

231
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,540
(Thumbs up)

232
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,670
- Is this product placement?
- No.

233
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,370
(He just gave a thumbs up
out of habit.)

234
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,780
Is this product placement?

235
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,650
(Is this product placement?)

236
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,580
I could put this on my dog's collar
and let it out, right?

237
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,110
(What else should I say?)

238
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,380
(Ji Hyo even dances with the device
to cover the production cost.)

239
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,960
It might be one of these two.

240
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,920
Suk Jin, it's Ji Hyo's house.

241
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,290
Ji Hyo won a lot of gold.

242
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,420
Ji Hyo won a lot of games
and won gold.

243
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,420
So I bet it might be
in Ji Hyo's house.

244
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,400
All the houses aren't the same.

245
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,670
(Jae Suk is upstairs
in the same building.)

246
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,860
Hang on. Hyeong Gu's House?

247
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,930
(Hyeong Gu's House)

248
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,300
Is there Hyeong Gu's House?

249
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,080
I should stand here.
This is strange.

250
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,810
Hyeong Gu's House
doesn't sound right.

251
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,240
Ji Hyo's House.

252
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,180
(Jong Kook visits Ji Hyo's house
as he guessed earlier.)

253
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,910
(Ji Hyo's House)

254
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,480
Am I supposed to make a guess
with what I see?

255
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,610
There's nothing special in here.

256
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,860
(Right at that moment...)

257
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,730
"When it's big, have a close look."

258
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,460
(When it's big, have a close look.)

259
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,750
"When it's big, have a close look?"

260
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,930
("When it's big,
have a close look?")

261
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,940
(Does the family motto
of Ji Hyo's house mean something?)

262
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,130
I'll stay here.

263
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,730
- Have you made up your mind?
- Yes. I pick Ji Hyo's house.

264
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,610
- I've made up my mind.
- Is that your choice?

265
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,110
- Yes.
- Okay.

266
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,140
(Suk Jin, Jong Kook, and Jae Suk
choose the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floor.)

267
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,870
I think it's here.

268
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,010
(Haha picks House of Dolls
that he found at the beginning.)

269
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,780
- Have you made your choice?
- Yes. I have a feeling.

270
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,190
The thing you pick first
is mostly correct.

271
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,960
The device of the person
closest to the gold will go off.

272
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,150
- My gosh.
- We're at an advantage.

273
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,880
If Jong Kook's device
or Suk Jin's goes off...

274
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,650
(Whose device will go off?)

275
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,830
(Beeping)

276
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,390
(The person who's standing
closest to the gold is...)

277
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,130
(Yang Se Chan.)

278
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,970
(The gold is
near the three-way intersection.)

279
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,480
Am I the only one who can hear that?

280
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,900
(The gold is
near the three-way intersection.)

281
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,550
(He's caught by Haha.)

282
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,050
What are you looking at,
you old man?

283
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,190
- Haha, my device went off.
- I know.

284
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,550
I told you. It's in the center.

285
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,950
I won't tell anyone.

286
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,610
(They promise that
they won't tell anyone else.)

287
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,720
Haha.

288
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,250
It must be somewhere near here.

289
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,980
(The gold is
somewhere near Se Chan.)

290
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,730
This is amazing. It was Se Chan.

291
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,830
Haha.

292
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,430
It must be somewhere near here.

293
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,570
(Where's the gold then?)

294
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,070
The device of the person
closest to the gold just went off.

295
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,730
Mine didn't go off.

296
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,000
That means it's not in here.

297
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,530
I hope it was Suk Jin or Jong Kook.

298
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
- You can continue.
- Find the gold?

299
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,980
Yes. You can look for it now.

300
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,550
(They can look for the clues
for 15 minutes.)

301
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,680
I should go ask them.

302
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,380
Did your device ring?

303
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,910
- Did yours go off?
- I think it was Suk Jin's.

304
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,980
What?

305
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,280
Suk Jin's device went off,
so he's going around alone.

306
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,560
He's acting like the protagonist.

307
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,230
Are we supposed
to look for the gold now?

308
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,570
How would we find it when we
don't know where it went off?

309
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,600
Aren't you going to tell us
where the device went off?

310
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,390
We're not telling you.

311
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,260
We can't find it when we don't know
where the device went off.

312
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,660
(Se Chan and Haha scatter away
keeping the secret to themselves.)

313
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,180
I should smell the gold.

314
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,400
The smell of gold.

315
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,910
Can I go in here?

316
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,910
(Se Chan hovers around
where he stood earlier...)

317
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,550
Hang on. Where was I earlier?

318
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,780
(looking for the gold.)

319
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,220
It must be somewhere here.

320
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,860
There's a strange doll in here.

321
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,460
(Jae Suk is searching
the residents' houses.)

322
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,990
(So Min's House)

323
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,730
"When up high, check down below?"

324
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,430
(There's a family motto
in So Min's house too.)

325
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,760
"When up high, check down below."

326
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,340
(Jae Suk boggles at the phrase.)

327
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,440
What's that?

328
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,030
Does that mean
it's not in a high place?

329
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,630
(He walks down the stairs
to check down below.)

330
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,770
(Jong Kook's House)

331
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,140
"I'm always watching you?"

332
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,640
(I'm always watching you?)

333
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,380
(There's another motto.)

334
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,510
Look at that.

335
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,090
What?

336
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,860
(Kwang Soo spots the same frame
in Jong Kook's House.)

337
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,120
So this is the clue.

338
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,930
(Passing by)

339
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,250
(He leaves Kwang Soo right away
since he's on a different team.)

340
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,460
This is the clue.

341
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,340
(He steals Kwang Soo's shoes
while he's at it.)

342
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,160
(He walks away with
Kwang Soo's shoes smiling.)

343
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,810
(Then Kwang Soo tries to leave.)

344
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,270
(What?)

345
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,000
Those are my shoes.

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,110
(He steals the cameraman's shoes.)

347
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,220
Those are my shoes.

348
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,780
No.

349
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,690
(The cameraman follows
the shoe thief in his socks.)

350
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,010
(They steal
each other's shoes in a relay.)

351
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,380
- Oh no.
- What?

352
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,960
Did you find something?

353
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,700
- Did you find anything?
- Were these your shoes, Yoon Sang?

354
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,750
(Yoon Sang lost his shoes
to Kwang Soo.)

355
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,890
Yoon Sang, I'm sorry.

356
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,570
These are Yoon Sang's.

357
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,390
I'm wearing Yoon Sang's shoes.

358
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,390
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

359
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,000
I had no choice.

360
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,480
Jong Kook, there's a clue.

361
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,870
"When it's big, have a close look."

362
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,140
- That's the clue.
- Hey.

363
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,350
There's a clue in my house too.

364
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,480
Each house has...

365
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,140
Each room has a clue.

366
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,740
Each room has a clue on the wall.

367
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,140
"I'm always watching you."

368
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,720
"I'm always watching you."

369
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,480
(Ji Hyo's House, So Min's House,
Jong Kook's House)

370
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,380
We should put them together.

371
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,460
I will go to my house.

372
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,360
It's around here,
so I guess it's in the house.

373
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,330
It might be in the building.

374
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,300
There are Jae Suk's House...

375
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,940
and Suk Jin's House.
But the problem is...

376
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,340
Jae Suk's House has
a lot of R stickers in it.

377
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,810
- Really?
- Yes.

378
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,730
Haha, the clue is...

379
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,500
Someone in here... Gosh.

380
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,850
- Haha.
- What?

381
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,580
- Did you find it?
- Haha.

382
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,050
- There's something.
- It's just paper.

383
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,510
Well done.

384
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,610
Hang on.

385
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,780
Take a look at it.

386
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,150
What is this?

387
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,410
(What's in the envelope
that Se Chan found?)

388
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,730
I remember what this is.

389
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,390
Isn't this the thing
about the Yoo Family?

390
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,860
We played yutnori here.

391
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,100
- And the room on the right is...
- That's the place.

392
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,130
Suk Jin's room.

393
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,260
I know that.

394
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,130
It's Suk Jin's room.
And the one on the left is...

395
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,400
- What?
- Why?

396
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,000
- It was the same back then.
- Jae Suk's House?

397
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,400
(On the left and right
of the living room in the picture,)

398
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,310
(there are Suk Jin's House
and Jae Suk's House.)

399
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,510
They are steaming songpyeon.

400
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,640
They're making songpyeon.

401
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,220
It says R.

402
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,610
(And there are four people
in the picture.)

403
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,610
(One of them is...)

404
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,460
(Yoo Jae Suk.)

405
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,620
Jae Suk, where... Why...

406
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,650
Nothing.

407
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,600
What's with that mischievous smile?

408
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,070
- I'm just looking around.
- What are you doing?

409
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,930
- What are you up to now?
- I'm just looking around.

410
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,230
What's with that mischievous smile?

411
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,630
(Does he have a secret
that the others don't know?)

412
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,610
(The 1st search is over.)

413
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,210
Time's up.

414
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,240
- Please gather around.
- Okay.

415
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,350
(The first search is over.)

416
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,820
(The place for the first mission
has toy hammers in line.)

417
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,090
(What's the mission?)

418
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,150
This is where I got pregnant.

419
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,510
- What?
- I was pregnant here.

420
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,620
That's right.

421
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,380
You should get over the skit.

422
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,990
(Se Chan and So Min were a newly
married couple...)

423
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,970
(during last year's Chuseok holidays
in Episode 523.)

424
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,390
(Retching)

425
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,260
(So Min was absorbed in the skit
and went too far.)

426
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,970
(Her joke embarrassed
even her husband.)

427
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,400
(Do you have an upset stomach?)

428
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,580
(No. Wait...)

429
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,770
(That's how So Min
came up with the best meme.)

430
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,140
This is where you found out
you were pregnant.

431
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,720
- Right. I was retching.
- That's right.

432
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,610
Happy birthday, Suk Jin.

433
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,050
Happy birthday, Suk Jin.

434
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,860
You keep saying that. That's enough.

435
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,410
Why are you angry?
Can't you be happy?

436
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,480
I'm not angry.

437
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,780
Long life, health, and blessing!

438
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,960
- We should do this when we can.
- That's enough.

439
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,230
We should do this when we can.

440
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,120
My dad came to my room yesterday.

441
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,800
I was wrapping the bamboo wife
for him, and Dad asked what it was.

442
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,990
So I said it was
a birthday gift for Suk Jin.

443
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,130
Then he asked how old Suk Jin is,
so I said...

444
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,840
- he was born in 1966.
- That's correct.

445
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,080
I also said that he's quite old now,
and my dad said,

446
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,810
"Hey, he's still so young."

447
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,270
(Suk Jin is still very young
compared to So Min's father.)

448
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,240
- My dad said...
- It's understandable.

449
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,450
- You're right.
- Her father must feel that way.

450
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,910
"He's still so young."

451
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,320
That's what seniors always say.

452
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,750
- Say hello to your father, So Min.
- "He's still so young."

453
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,380
When elderly people like him see
a man who was born in 1966,

454
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,390
- He's like a baby to them.
- he looks so young.

455
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,520
- He's in the prime of his life.
- He's the youngest in such a group.

456
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
(Baby Big Nose still has
a long way to go.)

457
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,890
- Today, you have two missions.
- Okay.

458
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,160
To celebrate Suk Jin's birthday,
we prepared...

459
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,470
missions that would be easy
for Suk Jin.

460
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,030
You must be at an advantage.

461
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,730
I guess we'll play some games
I can win.

462
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,350
Then they're probably not
physically hard...

463
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,820
- if it's advantageous for him.
- We don't have to be strong to win.

464
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,740
We rarely see toy hammer games
on TV shows these days.

465
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,960
- They're all simple, easy games.
- Simple and easy?

466
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,090
- Simple and easy?
- The games we've done before?

467
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,120
Did you really have to
put it like that?

468
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,150
You could've used some other words
like "cute".

469
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,020
You mean some old games?
Good. Let's do this!

470
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,020
All right. Let's do this.

471
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,490
The first mission is...

472
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,470
the upgraded version of
Catching Rats,

473
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,030
the game played in the show
that Suk Jin hosted...

474
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,730
- during his best days.
- I know that game.

475
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,030
<i>Catch rats, catch rats</i>

476
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,080
- It's Daring Rats.
- I remember that game.

477
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
- Suk Jin will do it well.
- Catch rats, catch rats

478
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,980
- Squeak, squeak, squeak
- I don't...

479
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,370
- remember the rules clearly.
- He has an advantage.

480
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,480
(This is the young Big Nose
during his best days.)

481
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,610
Okay.

482
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,230
(After the song, the 1st player says
the number of the rats to catch.)

483
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,230
- How many rats?
- How many rats?

484
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,430
Three rats!

485
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,570
(Players can say either "Caught it"
or "Missed it".)

486
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,570
(When all the rats are caught,
everyone says, "Hooray".)

487
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,340
(You're out when you do the wrong
motion or miss the timing.)

488
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,940
- Catch rats, catch rats
- How many rats?

489
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,310
For example, you say, "Three rats."

490
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,900
- "Caught it."
- "Caught it" or "Missed it".

491
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,310
After three people
saying "Caught it", we all say...

492
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,740
- "Meow"?
- "Hooray."

493
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,320
- Oh, right.
- Hey, you're still young.

494
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,910
- What's wrong with you?
- I mean, he hosted the show.

495
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,410
- There you go.
- Okay.

496
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,320
- Back then, he was the MC,
- Actually, I...

497
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,880
but he only followed
the staff's decisions.

498
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,650
- I bet he didn't care.
- I see.

499
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,030
- He was like a parrot.
- He was more like an avatar.

500
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,160
- He was an avatar.
- He didn't participate in it.

501
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,220
- That's true. I didn't.
- The directors were Shin Won Ho...

502
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,740
- Oh, right.
- And Na Yeong Seok.

503
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,000
- That's right.
- What?

504
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,040
- He must've been close to them.
- Won Ho and Yeong Seok.

505
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
- You worked with Na Yeong Seok?
- And the writer was Lee Woo Jung.

506
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
(What a fantastic line-up of staff.)

507
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,040
- They're very successful now.
- Indeed.

508
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,610
All the people who worked with him
became so famous, but he...

509
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,110
- If you think about it...
- Hey!

510
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,280
- Why?
- Yeong Seok,

511
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,210
Won Ho, and Woo Jung...

512
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,350
tend to keep working
with the same people.

513
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,020
- They all have that tendency.
- That's right.

514
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,790
- They always do that.
- Then why...

515
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,790
And the people who worked with them
became top stars.

516
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,880
- It's true.
- Really?

517
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,890
Director Shin hired the same actors
for his new dramas.

518
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,220
- They all do that.
- It's like a shortcut to success.

519
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,530
Suk Jin, what happened?
Did you fight with them?

520
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,500
I'm not the type
who argues with others.

521
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,160
- Do you think I'm that type?
- He's right. He's an individualist.

522
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,860
- He's an individualist.
- I don't argue with others.

523
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,900
(He failed to make
the friendship last long.)

524
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,040
We talk on the phone from a distance
and root for each other.

525
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,310
Who would talk on the phone
when they're close by?

526
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,470
- That's why we use a phone.
- Come on, Jae Suk.

527
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,510
Why?

528
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,710
- Today is Suk Jin's birthday.
- He's still so young.

529
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,470
- It's his birthday.
- He's in the prime of his life.

530
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,090
You see, I'm grateful...

531
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,520
- that all three of them are...
- Yes.

532
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,880
doing so well, and I don't have to
worry about them.

533
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,490
I always cheer for you, guys!

534
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,530
Who worries about whom?

535
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,560
- Won Ho, Yeong Seok, and Woo Jung!
- Right.

536
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,720
- You guys are the best.
- Won Ho, Yeong Seok,

537
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,740
- and Woo Jung,
- Yes.

538
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,690
you have nothing to worry
about Suk Jin.

539
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,700
- He's taking good care of himself.
- I'm doing fine.

540
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,900
- Don't worry about me.
- Of course.

541
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,580
We added a new rule to this game.

542
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,170
You can say, "Caught it",
"Missed it", or "It ran".

543
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,350
- What's that?
- "It ran"?

544
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,880
When a player says, "It ran",

545
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
one of the rats that were caught
will be excluded from the count.

546
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,910
That is, there will be one less rat
that you caught.

547
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,560
Oh, I see. We can take one out too?

548
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,380
(In the upgraded version,
they can take a rat out too.)

549
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,300
- That sounds so difficult.
- So we have to catch one more.

550
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,000
If you do the wrong motion,

551
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,530
- miss the timing,
- We do the motion too?

552
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,220
or count the rats incorrectly,
you're out and lose one point.

553
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,390
Gosh, seriously.

554
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,740
Oh, that's so cute. It's a rat.

555
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,430
- There's a song too.
- They play the song too.

556
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,740
I haven't heard this song
in a long time.

557
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,040
- It's an old song.
- Thank you.

558
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,970
After that, we'll hear,
"How many rats?"

559
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,280
What do we do with this toy hammer?

560
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,700
- You hit others with it.
- When someone makes a mistake.

561
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,020
Kwang Soo, what else could we do
with a toy hammer?

562
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,550
- Pardon me?
- Use your head.

563
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,880
- Would we crack walnuts with it?
- Jae Suk.

564
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,520
I never said anything about walnuts.

565
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,090
- Don't waste my time like that.
- Hey!

566
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,620
- He's just nervous.
- He's right.

567
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,120
He's doing his warm-ups.

568
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,330
Gosh, seriously.

569
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,220
Play the music.

570
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,220
(Rat Song starts.)

571
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,070
(From Dirty Mustache Rat...)

572
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,160
I haven't done this in a while.

573
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,400
(To So Min Rat who looks perfect
with the headband.)

574
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,540
(Catch rats, catch rats)

575
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,510
- How many rats?
- How many rats?

576
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,900
- Six rats!
- Caught it.

577
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,080
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

578
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,210
- It ran.
- Caught it.

579
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,410
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

580
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,550
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

581
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,820
- No. That's not right. Is it?
- No.

582
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,020
- He said...
- You're all out.

583
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,260
- We didn't catch them all.
- We were wrong.

584
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,180
We had one more rat to catch.

585
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,530
Oh, right. She said, "It ran."

586
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,150
- Everyone was looking around...
- I think we did correctly.

587
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,650
and followed him
as soon as he said, "Hooray".

588
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,300
None of us was sure.

589
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,890
Five.

590
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,860
- We had one more rat to catch.
- Exactly.

591
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,340
But he was the first one
to say "Hooray".

592
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,500
- No.
- You're out.

593
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,810
It wasn't me.
Suk Jin said it first.

594
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,160
- Listen to me.
- No, no.

595
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,970
- The two of them caught rats.
- I was mistaken.

596
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,970
- The two of them caught rats.
- Forget it!

597
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,110
- Listen. Hey!
- We can't even play the normal one.

598
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,470
- Let's try one more time.
- I can't play the original game.

599
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,640
He was the one who should be out.

600
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,140
- Let's call it a practice.
- Good.

601
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,590
Let's focus, everyone.

602
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,710
(Jae Suk cut Suk Jin off
when he was imitating the siren.)

603
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,650
(Catch rats, catch rats)

604
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,450
- How many rats?
- How many rats?

605
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,530
Four rats!

606
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,860
- Caught it.
- It ran.

607
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,120
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

608
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,660
- Caught it. Hooray!
- Hooray!

609
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
No, we caught only three rats.

610
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,390
- Caught it.
- It ran.

611
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,340
(After shouting, "It ran",)

612
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,200
(he said "Hooray"
before anyone else said it.)

613
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,700
We caught only three rats.
I didn't say "Hooray".

614
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,110
- We caught 3, right?
- We needed 1 more rat.

615
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,640
- We had to catch one more.
- What's wrong with you?

616
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,940
- Why?
- My gosh.

617
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,020
- I raised my arms because of you.
- Take him out. It's not fun.

618
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,370
I raised my arms because of you.

619
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,490
- Because of me?
- Yes.

620
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,910
You're so lousy at games!

621
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,560
- He ruined the strawberry game too.
- Okay. Got it.

622
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,360
- We had one more to go.
- Okay.

623
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,720
Jae Suk, you lost one point.

624
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,420
- Why? Why?
- Okay.

625
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,800
You said "Hooray".

626
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,260
- You looked so confident.
- You were the only one.

627
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,530
But they said it too.

628
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,600
I did it because of you.

629
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,360
Raise your hand
if you don't understand the rules.

630
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,070
- Jae Suk, raise your hand.
- No. I know the rules.

631
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,390
These two caught rats, right?

632
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,630
Everyone, let's just not say
"It ran" for the time being.

633
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,740
- We can just not say it.
- That's right.

634
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,870
- Don't say it.
- Right.

635
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,470
- Let's stay safe.
- Don't say it.

636
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,700
- Let's stay safe.
- It's a promise.

637
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,250
- Okay. Good.
- Also, about the number of rats,

638
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,820
- choose a small number like one.
- Don't say "It ran".

639
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,880
- Just don't say it.
- Until we get used to this game.

640
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,750
- Never say "It ran".
- Let's get used to it first.

641
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,020
- I won't let it slide if you do.
- I'll make it really easy for you.

642
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,380
- Okay.
- What number will it be?

643
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,880
- How many rats?
- I'll say three.

644
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,380
- Okay.
- Keep that in mind.

645
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,720
- Let's begin.
- 1, 2...

646
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,920
- Say "How many rats?"
- Okay. Ready, go.

647
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,950
- How many rats?
- How many rats?

648
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,390
- Three rats!
- Caught it.

649
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,460
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

650
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,460
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

651
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,740
- Three rats!
- Caught it!

652
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,010
- Caught it.
- Missed it.

653
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,340
- Caught it. Hooray!
- Hooray!

654
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,700
- Five rats.
- Caught it.

655
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,930
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

656
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,010
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

657
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,280
- Two rats!
- Caught it.

658
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,580
- Caught it. Hooray!
- Hooray!

659
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,250
Caught it.

660
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,350
(He was extremely nervous
from the start.)

661
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,850
(Caught it!)

662
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,710
Caught it.

663
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,590
(He made a mistake
because he was too nervous.)

664
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,690
Why? Why can't you do that?

665
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,360
- Why? Why?
- Why? Why?

666
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,000
What's the problem?

667
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,500
Why do you always get so nervous?

668
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,040
Why are you lousy at everything else
but hosting a show?

669
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,840
Don't make us play simple games!
He always ruins it.

670
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,130
- He's so lousy at this.
- I'm not good at this.

671
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,430
Why?

672
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,430
I'm not good at playing
games like this.

673
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,510
You should've said
the number of rats to catch.

674
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,470
We didn't even say "It ran".

675
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,580
He said he caught a rat.

676
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,280
- I'm not good at this.
- He caught it.

677
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,610
He didn't even know when to say
"Hooray", so he looked at us...

678
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,880
and followed us.

679
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,180
- We should all say it at once.
- He gets flustered.

680
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,360
Let's try to continue
more rounds without stopping.

681
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,530
(Catch rats, catch rats)

682
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,070
<i>Catch rats, catch rats,
squeak, squeak, squeak</i>

683
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,270
- How many rats?
- How many rats?

684
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,360
Seven rats!

685
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,460
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

686
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,800
- Missed it.
- It ran!

687
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,840
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

688
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,580
(Flustered)

689
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,740
Missed it.

690
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,280
- We agreed not to say "It ran".
- Why did you do that?

691
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,410
What's wrong?

692
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,910
Why did you say that?

693
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,520
Why can't I say it
when the rules allow it?

694
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,640
- We all agreed not to say it.
- But it's allowed.

695
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,990
Why did you do that?

696
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,180
- Why would you do that?
- You were told not to.

697
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,720
- Why would you try to stand out?
- Don't do what you're told not to.

698
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,150
- Just don't do it.
- What did I do wrong?

699
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,060
- What? Don't do it as we agreed.
- What did I do wrong?

700
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,220
- We all agreed not to say it.
- We all agreed.

701
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,600
But it's allowed to say "It ran"
according to the rules.

702
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,160
- That's not the point.
- I didn't do the wrong motion.

703
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,040
- But we all agreed on it.
- When will we ever get used to it?

704
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,340
It might take us a few days
to learn how to play this.

705
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,700
Shut your mouth.

706
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,470
You ruined everything. So shut it.

707
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,670
- I ruined everything?
- Hey!

708
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,700
You ruined it.

709
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,900
- Ji Hyo was enjoying herself.
- Hey.

710
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,520
- Right. I'm sorry.
- Kwang Soo.

711
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,910
You start the game.
Say the number of rats.

712
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,020
- And let's not...
<i>- Catch rats</i>

713
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,380
(Jae Suk started singing.)

714
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,820
(Suk Jin tried to be an MC
after a long time.)

715
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,520
(But Jae Suk cut him off.)

716
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,220
Suk Jin, don't talk to the players
like that.

717
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,000
"Hey, say the number of rats."

718
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,920
- What was that?
- Just because it's his birthday.

719
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,390
- He speaks like an old man.
- Also...

720
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,100
- Today is my birthday, you know.
- He's so bossy.

721
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,130
Don't call a big number like seven.

722
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,510
It makes it harder
to play this game.

723
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,340
- Too many rats...
- No more than four rats.

724
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,340
- He's a bossy man.
- Under five.

725
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,110
- Gosh, seriously.
- Don't make it confusing.

726
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,580
And don't say "I couldn't catch it."

727
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,520
- You mean "It ran".
- "It ran."

728
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,020
- Suk Jin, come on.
- Just say "Missed it".

729
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,610
- Don't say it either.
- My gosh.

730
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,910
- Ready, go.
- Say "How many rats?"

731
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,110
- How many rats?
- How many rats?

732
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,150
Four rats!

733
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,260
- Caught it.
- Missed it.

734
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,380
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

735
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,720
- Caught it. Hooray!
- Hooray!

736
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,260
- Three rats!
- Caught it.

737
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,330
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

738
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,360
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

739
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,650
Seven rats!

740
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,160
- Missed it.
- Caught it.

741
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,500
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

742
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,570
It ran.

743
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,540
- Gosh, you.
- Why?

744
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,930
It ran.

745
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,810
(Ji Hyo punished him.)

746
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,240
- You were told not to say it!
- What's wrong?

747
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,700
I told you not to say "It ran".

748
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,640
(Kwang Soo who said it last time
is punishing him most harshly.)

749
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,440
You should never say "It ran"!

750
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,280
- I told you not to say it.
- What? Why?

751
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,520
- Was it you?
- Why would you hit me?

752
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,750
(The person who said it before
gets punished too in this game.)

753
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,050
Why would you hit us?

754
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,360
It can happen, you know.
A rat ran away.

755
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,650
- On such a happy day like this?
- We all agreed not to say it.

756
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,720
- My rat ran away.
- We all agreed.

757
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,880
Exactly.

758
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,190
Hey, we were enjoying the game
without stopping.

759
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,620
- He's right.
- But you ruined it.

760
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,530
- It was fun.
- Don't act like a know-it-all.

761
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,100
- I was flustered.
- Hey, don't act up.

762
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,620
I had no choice but to say it.

763
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,690
- Ji Hyo could've just moved on.
- Exactly.

764
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,160
But she hit me right away. Gosh.

765
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,630
- That was funny.
- Why did you say it?

766
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,780
- Who was out?
- Ji Hyo lost one point.

767
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,200
- Oh, good.
- Let's begin.

768
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,350
He was the one who was hit,
but she lost a point?

769
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,370
Ji Hyo was the one who was out.

770
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,090
Ji Hyo, say "It flew away"
while doing this motion.

771
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,250
This is not fun at all.

772
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,290
You just say "Caught it".

773
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,290
Okay. I'll do whatever I want.

774
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,880
- I never said "Missed it".
- Fine. I heard you.

775
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
It's easy to count.

776
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,950
How many rats?

777
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,030
- Two rats!
- Caught it.

778
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,890
We should sing the song first.

779
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,950
We don't have to sing it every time.

780
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,330
But that's part of the game.

781
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,860
- We don't have to do it every time.
- Yes, we have to.

782
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,160
<i>Catch rats, catch rats,
squeak, squeak, squeak</i>

783
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Why won't you sing it?

784
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,470
(He reluctantly sang the song
with a fake smile on his face.)

785
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,870
(He got upset right away.)

786
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,280
- How could I sing along?
- He sang it in his own style.

787
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Let's take a break.

788
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,170
- Why didn't you sing along?
- What was that?

789
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,970
- What's wrong with you?
<i>- Catch</i>

790
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,180
<i>- Rats, catch rats
- Catch rats</i>

791
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,640
<i>Squeak, squeak, squeak</i>

792
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,990
<i>Catch rats, catch rats,
squeak, squeak, squeak</i>

793
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,150
- How many rats?
- How many rats?

794
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,860
- Three rats.
- Caught it.

795
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

796
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,860
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

797
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
Four rats.

798
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,160
- Missed it.
- Caught it.

799
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,620
- Caught it.
- Missed it.

800
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,160
(Ji Hyo had been fully concentrated
since a long time ago.)

801
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,630
- Caught it?
- Hooray!

802
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,700
(Only she didn't raise her arms.)

803
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,870
- Hold on a second.
- What was that?

804
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,670
- Gosh.
- You were too late.

805
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,140
- Ji Hyo, come on.
- What was that?

806
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,780
You sounded unsure.
Say it confidently.

807
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,640
- Be bold. "Caught it?"
- This isn't a quiz.

808
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,180
- It's not a short-answer question.
- It sounded like a question.

809
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,090
- Understood. I'm sorry.
- Don't make it sound like that.

810
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,820
- Got it.
- Why would you ask a question?

811
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,760
- It's "Caught it" or "Missed it".
- Exactly.

812
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,680
- It's that simple.
- Ji Hyo.

813
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,120
Since you keep making a mistake,
Suk Jin hasn't been out yet.

814
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,330
I won't be out.

815
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,260
- Let's switch seats.
- Let's do that.

816
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,390
I played this game for years.
I will never make a mistake.

817
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,800
- Where should I sit?
- Come over here.

818
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
- Suk Jin, sit between us.
- Okay.

819
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,930
If I make a mistake,

820
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,770
I'll let Se Chan hit me
in the forehead.

821
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,770
- Are you serious?
- I'm confident.

822
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,270
That wouldn't be special.
We all get hit in the forehead.

823
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,610
I meant finger flick,
not the toy hammer.

824
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
- Really?
- Yes.

825
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,640
- Se Chan can hit really hard.
- Here we go.

826
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,810
Instead... There must be
something I get.

827
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,940
- "Something you get"?
- You'll get to eat later.

828
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,710
Oh, you're right. That would work.

829
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,680
- And you got one year older too.
- You should eat something.

830
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,790
- He got one year older.
- Exactly. You got one year older.

831
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,650
That's what he got.

832
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,560
- Oh, I got one year older.
- Yes, you did.

833
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,620
- I didn't realize that.
- You're one year older now.

834
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,120
- That's good enough.
- Great.

835
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
Ready, go.

836
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,390
<i>Catch rats, catch rats,
squeak, squeak, squeak</i>

837
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,070
- How many rats?
- Six rats!

838
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,840
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

839
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,430
- It ran.
- Caught it.

840
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,660
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

841
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,280
- Caught it. Hooray!
- Hooray!

842
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,130
- Three rats.
- No. You counted wrong.

843
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,250
- We had one more rat to catch.
- That's right.

844
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,710
- What's wrong with you?
- What's the problem?

845
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,280
Don't be anxious.

846
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,880
We were doing great.
Why did you ruin it?

847
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,610
- Gosh.
- We were having fun.

848
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,910
Jae Suk, it's because
you said "It ran".

849
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,060
- Gosh. What's the problem?
- He said it like he didn't care.

850
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,790
Why did you say it?

851
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,450
What's wrong?
Am I not allowed to say it?

852
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,300
Gosh. He says there's nothing wrong
with it now.

853
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,160
Why did you say "It ran"?

854
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,690
He says it's okay because he did it.

855
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,890
Then let's say you're older than me.

856
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,800
- I'm sorry.
- You're older than me from now on.

857
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,460
That's weirdly convincing.

858
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,160
It makes you feel like
you're wrong.

859
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,610
- My gosh. Kwang Soo will go first?
- Okay.

860
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,250
<i>Catch rats, catch rats,
squeak, squeak, squeak</i>

861
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,520
<i>- Catch rats, catch rats</i>
- Louder, louder!

862
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
Louder!

863
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,180
Are we in the military?

864
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,790
(Following Old Fossil Yu,
Battalion Chief Yoo appeared.)

865
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,610
- Is this a boot camp?
- Be quiet.

866
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,650
I'm just saying you should
be more excited.

867
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,060
- Right, It wasn't cheery.
- You were frowning.

868
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,260
- Boost your cheery energy.
- Sing it louder.

869
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,260
- Move your shoulders up and down.
- Hey, be more excited.

870
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,570
<i>Catch rats, catch rats,
squeak, squeak, squeak</i>

871
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
<i>Catch rats, catch rats,
squeak, squeak, squeak</i>

872
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,660
- How many rats?
- How many rats?

873
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
Six rats!

874
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,690
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

875
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,740
- Caught it.
- Missed it.

876
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,740
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

877
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,040
- Caught it. Hooray!
- Hooray!

878
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,700
Four rats!

879
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,370
- Caught it.
- It ran.

880
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,280
- It ran.
- Caught it.

881
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,520
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

882
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,210
- Caught it. Hooray!
- Hooray!

883
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,050
Did we count correctly?

884
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,180
Yes, we did.

885
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,090
(No one was sure
when they raised their hands.)

886
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,680
- We did it right.
- Let's be honest.

887
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,020
Raise your hand
if you just guessed.

888
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,450
- I followed my hunch.
- Me too.

889
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,220
- I guessed.
- This is unbelievable.

890
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,600
- Ji Hyo, let's begin.
- Ji Hyo.

891
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,860
Five rats.

892
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,070
- Caught it.
- Missed it.

893
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,960
- It ran.
- Caught it.

894
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,770
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

895
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,630
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

896
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,810
- Three rats!
- Caught it.

897
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,400
- It ran.
- It ran...

898
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,040
- That doesn't work.
- That'd be minus one rat.

899
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,080
- Caught it.
- It ran.

900
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
It ran...

901
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,140
(He's out because there's no rat
to run away!)

902
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,910
All right. That was good.

903
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,050
(It's time for them to hit him
with their toy hammers.)

904
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,790
Why can't anyone hit him?

905
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,410
- Hey!
- Cheer up, Jong Kook!

906
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,650
- Why won't you hit him?
- Hit him now!

907
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,220
- Why won't you guys hit him?
- Why did you hit him so lightly?

908
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,220
Why didn't you hit him?

909
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,420
Why did you hit him so lightly?

910
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,530
- I didn't want to mess up his hair.
- What was that?

911
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,570
Did you guys see him hit Jong Kook?

912
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,390
- Why?
- He just tapped him on his head.

913
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,270
Let's move on already.
We should continue.

914
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,270
- This is so funny.
- Gosh, seriously.

915
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,270
Here. Are you satisfied now?

916
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,270
- By the way, we've improved.
- Suk Jin...

917
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,430
Suk Jin...

918
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,700
tried to be as polite
as he could be.

919
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
(It was a polite touch.)

920
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,670
He hit Jong Kook like this.

921
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,080
After hitting Jong Kook,
he even asked if it was good enough.

922
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,880
- To make sure he wasn't upset.
- His hair...

923
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,790
I didn't want to mess up his hair.

924
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,290
How many times did you hit me?

925
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,590
Three times.

926
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,030
He spoke in a cute way.

927
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,030
I hit you three times. Why?

928
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,120
- Let's try to keep going. It's fun.
- Let's do this.

929
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,690
<i>Catch rats, catch rats,
squeak, squeak, squeak</i>

930
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,270
- How many rats?
- Six rats!

931
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,400
- Caught it.
- It ran.

932
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,960
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

933
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,130
- Missed it.
- Caught it.

934
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,540
- Caught it. Hooray!
- Hooray!

935
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,670
Suk Jin is out.

936
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,610
- Caught it.
- Caught it.

937
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,710
(He raised his hands too early.)

938
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,050
- Why did you do that?
- Suk Jin.

939
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,640
I'm starting to get confused
when it's almost over.

940
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,820
Hang on. Suk Jin promised to let
Se Chan hit him in the forehead.

941
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,520
Shut it. It's over now.

942
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,910
- It's over now.
- But a promise is a promise.

943
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,950
You made a promise.

944
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,060
- But it's over.
- You should keep your promise...

945
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,220
- because it's your birthday.
- You promised.

946
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,560
- Do you want to hit me?
- Consider it as a birthday noogie.

947
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,620
No, I don't,
but it's a birthday noogie for you.

948
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,030
- What do you mean?
- Or apologize to the viewers...

949
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,070
- for making an empty promise.
- Why did you even make a promise?

950
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,360
- Earlier...
- You said it yourself.

951
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,390
Hey.

952
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,460
(He revealed his forehead
in the end.)

953
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,360
All right.
My forehead is still fine. Here.

954
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,310
- Happy birthday, Suk Jin!
- Go ahead.

955
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,870
My finger will hurt too
since it's winter.

956
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,870
- I know.
- Exactly.

957
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,400
- That's true.
- Right.

958
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,520
It hurts both ways.

959
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,640
Why did I make this promise?

960
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,050
I realized it was a mistake
right away. Take it easy.

961
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,790
Hit me just hard enough
to make the sound.

962
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,180
They can increase the volume later.

963
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,830
- And I'll overreact.
- Okay.

964
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,760
- You really are a professional.
- Of course.

965
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,890
You know what can be done
in the editing process.

966
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,100
- Here I go.
- Okay.

967
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,860
- Somehow it makes me feel...
- Okay.

968
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,420
So Min, dance for him
as his daughter-in-law.

969
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,070
- Do we have some toilet paper?
- I will...

970
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,570
- When you hear me hit him,
- Then start dancing.

971
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,070
- start dancing.
- "Here we go!"

972
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,070
- Can you...
- Yes?

973
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,080
- Can you play gugak music for me?
- Of course.

974
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,340
Can you play some music too?

975
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,610
- On someone's phone?
- What?

976
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,900
So Min, that's great.

977
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,670
- She prepared herself properly.
- Yes.

978
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,670
(Flapping)

979
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,970
(His daughter-in-law's
filial dance...)

980
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,380
That's great. So Min, way to go.

981
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,860
- She's such a good daughter-in-law.
- Play it as soon as I hit him.

982
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,990
- Your daughter-in-law...
- She's a great dancer.

983
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,490
- She's...
- All right.

984
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,530
So Min, wait over here
until I hit him.

985
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,890
She's amazing.

986
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,830
Suk Jin seems happy.

987
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,070
- He looks happy.
- He's finally smiling.

988
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,540
- He's blushing.
- You see...

989
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,040
- His daughter-in-law is...
- You're doing well.

990
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,430
such a great dancer.

991
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,070
- She drew my attention.
- Yes.

992
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,970
Please make the pain go away.

993
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,080
- Through a laugh.
- Make me laugh.

994
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,050
She's like a laughter therapist.

995
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,780
This is so funny.

996
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,670
Your daughter-in-law learned
to dance properly.

997
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,440
(Here I go.)

998
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,320
- Here I go.
- All right.

999
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,090
(One blow, locked and loaded)

1000
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,380
(Bam!)

1001
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,690
(As soon as the finger flick signal
was sent,)

1002
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,890
(So Min started performing.)

1003
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,030
Here we go!

1004
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,340
Happy birthday, Suk Jin.

1005
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,360
(Happy Birthday, Grandpa Big Nose!)

1006
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,400
All right. Here we go.

1007
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
(His sons are giving him
a palanquin ride on their arms.)

1008
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,970
- I wish you a healthy, long life!
- Great!

1009
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,110
I wish you health!

1010
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,440
- I wish you health!
- I wish you a healthy, long life!

1011
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,080
He must be really happy.

1012
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,990
- Stay healthy. That's all I want.
- He must be happy.

1013
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,680
He must be really happy...

1014
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,560
- seeing that he's smiling.
- He's smiling happily.

1015
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,860
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

1016
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,950
- So Min!
- Cheers.

1017
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,620
This is amazing.

1018
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,100
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1019
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,860
(Thank you, my boys.)

1020
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,620
All I want is
for you to stay healthy.

1021
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,460
(The eldest son practiced
juggling toy hammers for this day.)

1022
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,600
That's incredible.

1023
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,340
He's juggling toy hammers.

1024
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,570
Toy hammers?

1025
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,170
That's great.

1026
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,400
(The second son performs
fire blowing.)

1027
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,610
(Their father got drunk
on their cute performances.)

1028
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,080
Why would he climb up
on my back suddenly?

1029
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,610
- Gosh.
- Happy birthday!

1030
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,090
(The father, who just got smacked,
and his children are all happy now.)

1031
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,490
This is so good.

1032
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,590
I'm happy as long as you're
enjoying this.

1033
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,260
Jong Kook, you should demonstrate
some ssireum skills.

1034
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,420
- I'll do that.
- His forehead is so red.

1035
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,330
- Suk Jin, are you okay?
- It hurts so much.

1036
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,460
(The finger flick helped
boost his energy.)

1037
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,960
- Oh, gosh. Look at him.
- Suk Jin.

1038
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,770
- Look at his forehead.
- Are you all right?

1039
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,360
- You got one year older.
- It hurts.

1040
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,040
Suk Jin, it looks like
there's a road on your forehead.

1041
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,970
- You got one year older.
- I see a road on your forehead.

1042
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,550
- It's okay.
- His forehead is so red.

1043
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,640
I think you should buy that land
since there's a new road.

1044
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,910
It's quite bumpy.

1045
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,520
It's okay.

1046
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,440
It made a loud noise.

1047
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,250
The results are out.

1048
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,290
Only the people in the top three
will go out...

1049
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,090
to use the tracking chance...

1050
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,360
that I told you about earlier.

1051
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,590
- Only three of us?
- Yes.

1052
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,030
The first place is...

1053
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,560
(Who could be the 1st person
to obtain the chance?)

1054
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,030
- Se Chan.
- Really?

1055
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,220
- Me?
- Se Chan?

1056
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,860
- I didn't make many mistakes.
- He was out only once.

1057
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,500
- Only once.
- The second place...

1058
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,890
(Who are the other 2 people
to get the chance?)

1059
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
are Kwang Soo and So Min.

1060
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,340
- Oh, yes! Okay.
- Okay!

1061
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,810
Okay. The youngest members won.

1062
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,370
Let's join forces together.
It's been a while!

1063
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,780
We can go anywhere we want, right?

1064
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,800
- See you later.
- I'll see you later.

1065
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,680
- So Min, make sure to find it.
- We should...

1066
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,550
After all the eight of you
finish searching,

1067
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,680
we'll give the three of them
the tracking chance.

1068
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,450
- We must find it.
- It must be us to find it.

1069
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,620
- Even if it's not me.
- You can split up.

1070
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,590
- Can we start searching?
- I'll go through every place.

1071
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,120
Let's search every place.

1072
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,160
I didn't go into that place earlier.

1073
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,970
We have to win by any means.

1074
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,300
I'll go up there.

1075
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,590
(Haha is going
into the House of Props.)

1076
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,800
"House of Props".

1077
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,340
Since it went off there,
it must be somewhere around here.

1078
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,240
(Left: House of Props,
Right: Se Chan's previous location)

1079
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,970
House of Props.
Right. I'm sure of it.

1080
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:52,970
(Considering the distance, the House
of Props is likely the right place.)

1081
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,510
(Surprised)

1082
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,680
(He found a hint.)

1083
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,760
(He found it unexpectedly
while looking for gold.)

1084
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,490
Let me have a look.

1085
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,220
Including Suk Jin,
there are all eight of us here.

1086
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,120
What does it mean?

1087
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,340
Is this... Wait. Am I supposed to
figure it out from this? Wait.

1088
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
(What does this photo indicate?)

1089
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,470
There must be something here.

1090
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,840
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo and So Min...)

1091
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,370
(The House of Games)

1092
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,010
I saw a clue being placed here.

1093
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,450
(So Min also found a clue.)

1094
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,410
"It's darker under the lamp."

1095
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,620
(It's darker under the lamp.)

1096
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,780
"It's darker under the lamp."

1097
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,660
What could this indicate?

1098
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,860
The phrase means
that we miss what's...

1099
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,360
- right under our noses.
- Under our noses.

1100
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,370
"It's darker under the lamp."

1101
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,300
(Which place could be
right under their noses?)

1102
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,470
Did you find anything?

1103
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,890
- Nothing's here, right?
- Nothing.

1104
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,030
Did you find anything downstairs?

1105
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,700
Yes, I did.

1106
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,510
What did you find?

1107
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,870
(He ponders for a while.)

1108
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,950
"Even walls have ears."

1109
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,050
- What a liar.
- How did you know that?

1110
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,220
How did you know?

1111
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,390
- As if I couldn't tell.
- But it made sense.

1112
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,260
It's an idiom you could think of.

1113
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,550
It's exactly at your level.

1114
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,800
"It's darker under the lamp."

1115
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,990
As if.

1116
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,470
(Actually, he just doesn't trust
anything that Kwang Soo says.)

1117
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,490
Unbelievable.

1118
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,930
(But I was telling the truth.)

1119
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,470
You're in for a bad day today.

1120
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,740
(While wishing each other the worst,
they head to the House of Books.)

1121
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,840
You're done for today.

1122
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,870
Our teammates are here.

1123
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,840
- Jae Suk...
- Don't let them come in.

1124
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,010
- First of all...
- Wait!

1125
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,780
You're supposed to find the pieces.

1126
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,050
You're supposed to find the pieces.

1127
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,590
No, we were just
solving this puzzle.

1128
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,990
(So Min and Se Chan
are solving a puzzle.)

1129
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,410
(During the 1st search)

1130
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,450
This is odd.

1131
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,090
I see pieces to a puzzle
lying around.

1132
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,450
I see more over there too.

1133
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,930
Anyone can tell
that they're not random.

1134
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,030
It's odd, right?

1135
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,470
Wait, I think I'm right.

1136
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,370
The pieces are scattered
around the place.

1137
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,760
We need to solve this puzzle.

1138
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,340
What's this?

1139
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,240
It must be someone's face.

1140
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,930
I think this needs to be solved.
Help me with this.

1141
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,370
There are two of them.
When will we finish this?

1142
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,820
We need to combine forces.

1143
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,370
- We need to solve this.
- Right.

1144
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,490
(While solving the puzzle
with Se Chan...)

1145
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,390
You're supposed to find the pieces.

1146
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,760
- Well...
- That's not right.

1147
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,050
(Se Chan hasn't been
much of a help though.)

1148
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,950
This will take too long,
so I give up.

1149
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,860
(After seeing them solve a puzzle,)

1150
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,590
(they leave the scene
feeling relieved.)

1151
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,720
It's not worth it.

1152
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,800
There's a puzzle here.

1153
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,030
(Jae Suk joins in
on solving the puzzle.)

1154
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,970
When up high, check down below.

1155
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,070
("Up high" lingers
on Kwang Soo's mind.)

1156
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,010
(He heads into a building
to find higher ground.)

1157
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,410
Must I go someplace higher?

1158
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,570
(Will Kwang Soo be able
to find something on higher ground?)

1159
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,840
This is a tricky one.

1160
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,950
Wait a second.

1161
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,240
I think it's doable.
It won't take long.

1162
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,260
(Thanks to Jae Suk,
they have someone's body.)

1163
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,390
This goes here.

1164
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,930
- Isn't this the place?
- Yes.

1165
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,760
No way. This is Jae Suk.

1166
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,320
- It's you.
- It's Jimi Yu.

1167
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,360
It's you.

1168
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,200
- It's you.
- It's Jimi Yu.

1169
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,220
It's you.

1170
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,260
Why is this of Jimi Yu?

1171
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,970
- What's this?
- Why am I in the puzzle?

1172
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,200
(This tacky man
has the face of Jimi Yu.)

1173
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,840
The outfit seemed like Jimi Yu's.

1174
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,610
Why didn't you tell us then?

1175
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,340
- Hold on a second.
- Weren't you going to share?

1176
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,680
- Of course not.
- You would've easily noticed.

1177
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,280
Wait a second. I had to make sure.

1178
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,720
I wasn't certain.

1179
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,180
Where was this taken?
Do you remember this rope?

1180
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,990
Of course I don't.

1181
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,490
You didn't say anything
when you knew it was you though.

1182
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,390
That's not true.
I just wanted to be sure.

1183
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,760
- The mouth makes it obvious.
- Right.

1184
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,760
(Why has Jimi Yu
been offered as a clue?)

1185
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,260
(There must be
a meaning behind this.)

1186
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,160
This must be a clue.

1187
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,410
It seems like one.

1188
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,840
(Big Nose discovered
another puzzle.)

1189
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,700
Wait, these eyes...

1190
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,300
Is this us? This could be you.

1191
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,050
- That must be it.
- It's a face.

1192
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,840
I see someone's eyes.

1193
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,070
(This puzzle reveals
another person.)

1194
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,840
Did I put this in the right place?

1195
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,410
(The eyes seem to belong
to a foreigner.)

1196
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,050
"When up high, check down below."

1197
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,590
(So Min's House)

1198
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,990
(He figures that the gold
is somewhere up high.)

1199
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,550
"When up high, check down below."

1200
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,800
What's this?

1201
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,970
What's this?

1202
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,110
Why is this photo here?

1203
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,140
(There's a photo of So Min
and Bo Pil in So Min's house.)

1204
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,140
(This photo...)

1205
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,950
(is one that Jae Suk ignored
after seeing it.)

1206
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,840
(Kwang Soo takes it
with him though.)

1207
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,010
Is it Bo Pil?

1208
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,450
"I'm watching you."
That could be his words.

1209
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,280
(I'm watching you.)

1210
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,200
(He's always watching the members.)

1211
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,450
"It's darker under the lamp."

1212
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,550
(It's darker under the lamp.)

1213
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,820
(The main director always
sits in front of them.)

1214
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,370
(It's darker under the lamp.)

1215
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,410
(I'm watching you.)

1216
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,700
It's not odd for So Min
to have her photo at her house,

1217
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,070
but why would Bo Pil be in one?

1218
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,200
(Haha's House)

1219
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,320
(Kwang Soo makes an advance.)

1220
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,220
(A pick-pocketing attempt)

1221
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,050
(If he's right,
Bo Pil would have the gold.)

1222
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,780
- What's with him?
- Unbelievable.

1223
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,120
(What's going on?)

1224
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,860
- What's with him?
- Unbelievable.

1225
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,820
What is he doing?

1226
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,050
(But just then...)

1227
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,890
(He pulls out a jewelry box!)

1228
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,240
Did you find the gold?

1229
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,780
Is that the gold?

1230
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,010
(So Min goes through
the other director's pockets.)

1231
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,140
(Kwang Soo dashed in
and found the jewelry box.)

1232
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,050
(Anyone who finds the gold
will instantly win.)

1233
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,450
(And the race will be over.)

1234
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,890
(He hurries out
and checks the contents.)

1235
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,930
What on earth?

1236
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,590
(You've been fooled.
Find the real jewelry box.)

1237
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,760
Seriously?

1238
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,030
(A fake jewelry box?)

1239
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,090
(In the letter
sent by the village head)

1240
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,970
(Beware of the fake jewelry boxes.)

1241
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:54,140
(Kwang Soo was the only one
not aware of the fake boxes.)

1242
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,050
What?

1243
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,240
Are you kidding me?

1244
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,240
(Kwang Soo runs back in
with his hair flying.)

1245
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,450
Let's keep solving the puzzle.

1246
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,820
- Why...
- What's going on?

1247
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,990
- What's wrong?
- Tell me what this is.

1248
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,450
(Kwang Soo was fooled
by the staff's trick.)

1249
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,760
- What's wrong?
- Tell me what this is.

1250
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,860
I don't know what that is.

1251
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,430
What's going on?

1252
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,220
Stop frisking me.

1253
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
(He checks the director's pockets
out of disbelief.)

1254
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,930
(That's odd...)

1255
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,070
Kwang Soo, is this
what you're looking for?

1256
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,570
I think it is.

1257
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,660
Kwang Soo, is this
what you're looking for?

1258
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,090
I think it is.

1259
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,660
(I think it is.)

1260
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,160
What is it?

1261
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,410
Anyone can tell
that's a ssamjang container.

1262
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,470
(Kwang Soo's not as stupid
as one thinks.)

1263
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,970
- How did you know that?
- How did you know?

1264
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,140
- It's obvious.
- You see,

1265
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,280
- he's the famous...
- Ssamjang.

1266
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,720
- What's that you have?
- What is it?

1267
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,010
I think it's an empty box.

1268
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,890
The second search is over!

1269
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,720
Let's head out for now.

1270
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,010
(The 5 who weren't in
the top 3 leave first.)

1271
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,930
I think someone's house
was that way.

1272
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,160
I doubt it'd be
anywhere near here.

1273
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,780
I'm lost.

1274
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,490
Will this tracking device
really go off?

1275
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,930
"I'm watching you."

1276
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,640
(It's why the second tracking chance
must be used wisely.)

1277
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,200
(Which house could the gold be in?)

1278
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,530
Who on earth is watching us?

1279
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,570
"When it's big, have a close look."

1280
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,870
If only I knew
whose device went off earlier.

1281
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,200
(Se Chan's more at ease...)

1282
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,640
(since his tracker
was the one that rang.)

1283
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,550
It can't be down there
since mine went off around here.

1284
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,950
Can't you tell me the distance
between me and the gold?

1285
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,590
(The gold must be near
where he first stood.)

1286
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,220
(He decides to stand
close to where he originally stood.)

1287
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,410
Kwang Soo, stand down there.

1288
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,430
(Se Chan sets a bait.)

1289
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,090
Haha was at the House of Dolls
and I was here.

1290
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,050
Ji Hyo was in that house...

1291
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,430
and Suk Jin was in that one.

1292
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,570
No one stood down here though.

1293
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,970
Meanwhile, I'll stand here.

1294
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,300
(Nonchalantly,
he steps to the spot he decided on.)

1295
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,260
- The House of Games?
- I'll stay here.

1296
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,300
(Nonchalantly,
he steps to the spot he decided on.)

1297
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,300
That can't be the spot.

1298
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,010
(It has to be someplace higher.)

1299
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,370
Hold on.

1300
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,640
When up high...

1301
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,470
When it's big...

1302
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,510
"When it's big, have a close look."

1303
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,840
"When it's big, have a close look."

1304
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,390
"I'm watching you."

1305
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,590
Could it be a dashcam?

1306
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,620
(When up high and when it's big...
This van is always watching them.)

1307
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,430
- Here?
- Yes.

1308
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,680
Near the House of Dolls.

1309
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,720
(He stands somewhere up high.)

1310
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,470
(He starts searching
the House of Dolls.)

1311
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,590
Could it be inside a doll?

1312
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,530
(The House of Dolls)

1313
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,700
There's a clue in every house,
but not in this one.

1314
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,300
No way!

1315
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,050
(He finds a clue
in the passenger seat.)

1316
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,180
What's this?

1317
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,090
(It's a photo of something
taken up close.)

1318
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,140
I found a clue.

1319
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,680
(It must be a photo
of where the gold is.)

1320
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,280
Will it ring automatically?

1321
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,430
(Meanwhile, So Min...)

1322
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,160
Right, then...

1323
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,430
(She arrives at
the House of Cooking.)

1324
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,570
I'll sit here.

1325
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,200
(She sits in the center
of the House of Cooking.)

1326
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,070
It all looks delicious.

1327
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,660
(She only came in here
because she's hungry.)

1328
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,800
Please let my device ring.

1329
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,260
(So Min, Se Chan, Kwang Soo)

1330
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,780
(The three have taken their places.)

1331
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,550
(Where the alarm first rang)

1332
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,510
(The device closest
to the gold will ring.)

1333
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,180
(Where the alarm first rang)

1334
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,010
(The device rang!)

1335
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,430
(So Min's the closest!)

1336
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,550
My device is ringing.
I'm the closest.

1337
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,090
You are currently...

1338
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,320
the closest to the gold.

1339
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,990
(So Min's the closest to the gold.)

1340
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,570
(She only sat here out of hunger,
but she got lucky.)

1341
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,700
Then...

1342
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,910
This means
I'm closest to the gold, right?

1343
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,410
To the gold...

1344
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,780
(Where the alarm first rang)

1345
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,090
(Not so far away,
the second device rang.)

1346
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,550
(Where the device rang next)

1347
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,220
(So where exactly is the gold?)

1348
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,200
Gosh, what a feast.

1349
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,050
It must be Suk Jin's birthday meal.

1350
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,160
Gosh, it's a feast.

1351
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,700
Are we allowed to eat this?

1352
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,800
- No way.
- Can we eat this?

1353
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,760
This is a work of art.

1354
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,110
It's Suk Jin's birthday after all.

1355
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,640
Thank you for the meal.

1356
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,110
The seaweed soup looks delicious.

1357
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,700
- Thank you for the meal.
- This is a feast.

1358
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,910
So this is where
I get my birthday meal.

1359
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:56,990
<i>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</i>

1360
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:00,860
<i>- Happy birthday, dear Suk Jin
- Happy birthday, dear Suk Jin</i>

1361
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,030
<i>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</i>

1362
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,820
My gosh.

1363
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,760
I was carried by the members
and got hit as a means to celebrate.

1364
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,200
Jong Kook and I...

1365
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,390
should bow first.

1366
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,640
Right, of course.

1367
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,660
Unbelievable.

1368
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,340
- Please don't.
- Let's do that.

1369
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,510
- Are you serious?
- We should.

1370
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,530
He means it.

1371
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:17,870
Don't do it!

1372
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,140
Get Suk Jin's wallet, guys.

1373
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,870
- We need to get the money gift.
- Suk Jin.

1374
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,140
(In hopes of receiving a money gift
from him, they all line up.)

1375
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,740
- Happy New Year, Suk Jin.
- Happy New Year, Suk Jin.

1376
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,220
I wish you good health!

1377
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,720
Thanks.

1378
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,680
I hope everything you wish for
comes true this year.

1379
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,320
You didn't have to make a deep bow.

1380
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,530
- This is nice. It's heartwarming.
- Sit down.

1381
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:36,660
Give us the money now.

1382
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,160
- Please give me the money now.
- I'll treat you to a good meal.

1383
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,300
Where is the money?

1384
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,700
I'll treat you to a good meal.

1385
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,930
Suk Jin, 2,000 dollars
will be enough for me.

1386
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,090
Since I'm younger than Jae Suk,
I can do with 1,800 dollars.

1387
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,800
My gosh.

1388
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,840
- It looks good.
- The seaweed soup looks good.

1389
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,180
- It really...
- Thank you for the food.

1390
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,610
Thank you for the food.

1391
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,110
We're having a feast
thanks to Suk Jin.

1392
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,700
It's nice.

1393
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,370
They came early in the morning
to make all these dishes.

1394
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:00,450
This is good.

1395
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,780
I usually have a simple meal
on my birthdays. This is amazing.

1396
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,240
(As many people's effort was put in,
we wish Big Nose good health.)

1397
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,720
I think they prepared a game where
we get splashed with something.

1398
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,030
It's Kwang Soo's favorite game.

1399
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,820
This is the last mission.

1400
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:14,870
This mission is similar to the game
Suk Jin played as a kid.

1401
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,030
- Me?
- It's a modified version...

1402
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,890
of Rice Barley Game.
It's called In a Split Second.

1403
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:20,470
(Second mission, In a Split Second)

1404
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,240
It's a game where we pick
either barley or rice.

1405
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,010
Rice, barley.

1406
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,340
Two people will play the game
at a time.

1407
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,550
You'll be using your face
instead of your fist.

1408
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,870
The opponent will wear
the cylinder cardboards...

1409
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:35,240
and use the pot lids
covered in flour to play defense.

1410
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,390
The one playing offense...

1411
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,260
can pick either barley or rice...

1412
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,220
and put their head in between
the opponent's pot lids.

1413
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,180
You need to move your head
up and down.

1414
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,300
- You succeed if you don't get hit.
- Oh, up and down?

1415
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,120
So in the end,
we'll all be covered in flour.

1416
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,590
There's no way we can avoid it.

1417
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,090
You can yell out barley
as many times as you want,

1418
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,530
but you can yell out rice
only five times.

1419
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,680
If you yell rice and avoid getting
hit, you'll earn one point.

1420
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,680
If you fail, then your point
will be deducted.

1421
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,140
So we can hit however we want
when they yell barley?

1422
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,640
This game is meant for Kwang Soo.

1423
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,910
- It totally is.
- No, it's not.

1424
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,550
What's important in this game
is the lineup.

1425
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,950
You can play against
one person only.

1426
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,620
You play offense and defense
with the same person,

1427
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,890
so the lineup is very important.

1428
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:13,950
He's right.

1429
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,550
It's important.
The lineup is important.

1430
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,990
Then let's decide with this.

1431
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:19,660
- We can play Game of Wits.
- Game of Wits?

1432
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:21,200
How can we decide the lineup...

1433
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,320
- through that?
- Let's just give it a go.

1434
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:23,890
- There's a way.
- 1st place and 2nd place will...

1435
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:24,930
- That's it.
- Oh, really?

1436
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,340
Let's get ready.

1437
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,510
Start.

1438
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,510
(Game of Wits starts.)

1439
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:31,930
One!

1440
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,370
One!

1441
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,800
- 2!
- The 2 of you can go first.

1442
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,840
(The first lineup is ready.)

1443
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,550
That's not fair!

1444
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,590
- But...
- Isn't this clever?

1445
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,260
- But...
- We'll play against each other?

1446
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,660
- This is how it's done?
- We didn't win the game?

1447
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,220
He's such a great MC.

1448
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,780
- There's no number 3 and 4?
- Number 1 and 2 can go first.

1449
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,030
You two can play
against each other.

1450
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,390
Se Chan and Kwang Soo,
please step forward.

1451
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,820
- How...
- How do we play?

1452
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:57,490
- The one playing defense...
- They're going to play for real.

1453
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:58,530
And the one playing offense...

1454
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,870
They're going to listen to Jae Suk
and play.

1455
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,340
They're so naive.

1456
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,010
<i>- Flour party</i>
- I can only say rice five times?

1457
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,930
- I can only say it 5 times, right?
- Yes, you only get 5 chances.

1458
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,370
But if you get hit,
we'll deduct a point.

1459
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,140
If you manage to not get hit,
then you'll earn a point.

1460
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,450
You need to use all five chances
to finish the game.

1461
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:12,870
- Don't hit when I yell barley.
- I'll stay away from them.

1462
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,720
- I can only hit him in this zone?
- That's right.

1463
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,840
Let's practice first.

1464
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,720
- No, move your head up and down.
- You need to go up and down.

1465
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,490
- Try it. Is this how he goes?
- Yes, that's it.

1466
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:21,620
Up and down.

1467
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,490
- I hit him like this?
- Doesn't he have to move...

1468
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,260
- back and forth?
- You should go forward more.

1469
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,720
We tried moving back and forth,
but it wasn't fast enough.

1470
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,200
So the ones playing defense
need to play fair.

1471
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,990
- If he's in the zone, then...
- Down here?

1472
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,430
- Like this?
- I think that'd be better.

1473
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,470
- Try it.
- Or maybe not.

1474
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,530
- Try going as fast as you can.
- I think that'd be better.

1475
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:36,740
You can go back and forth then.

1476
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,010
- Barley.
- So this should work better.

1477
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,700
It's just a practice round.

1478
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,200
(Se Chan attacks Kwang Soo
without prior consent.)

1479
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,280
- It's just a practice round.
- He said barley.

1480
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,280
- I can hit him when he says barley.
- Yes, he can.

1481
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,120
Barley is equivalent to safe.

1482
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,910
You can say rice whenever you want.

1483
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:50,990
- That's right.
- It's safe.

1484
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,260
Barley is safe.

1485
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,180
You've played Rice Barley Game
before. It's exactly the same.

1486
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,050
- You need to go fast.
- Ready, go.

1487
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,160
Barley. Barley.

1488
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,590
- Is this how I'm supposed to play?
- Wait a minute.

1489
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,800
- What is this?
- Yes, it's allowed.

1490
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,890
- This is...
- Is this how we play?

1491
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:02,990
It is.

1492
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:05,200
- But this is...
- He should move fast and say rice.

1493
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,700
- Say rice and move out fast.
- I need to say rice fast?

1494
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,340
- But...
- No, that's not it.

1495
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:11,530
I dodged, but he hit me anyway.

1496
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,470
Kwang Soo, you can't ruin the game.

1497
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:15,680
We can't play the game now
because of you.

1498
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,910
So if you move up and down,
you can dodge fast.

1499
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,180
I think moving up and down
would work better.

1500
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,320
He needs to go down fast.

1501
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,680
- Let's practice.
- Move up and down.

1502
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,840
- Try going down.
- Barley.

1503
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,280
- It works.
- It works.

1504
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,510
- This works, Kwang Soo.
- That's it.

1505
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,990
- This works.
- That's good.

1506
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,120
- Then I'll play now.
- Okay.

1507
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,620
(They begin the first round
after figuring out the rules.)

1508
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,820
Barley!

1509
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,360
That was close.

1510
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,820
- "Rice".
- Barley!

1511
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,890
Is this how we play?

1512
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,030
Hey, you're bad at this game.

1513
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,160
- I moved really fast.
- You're bad at this game.

1514
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,870
He puts his head right in the spot
for me to hit.

1515
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,800
It's like Suk Jin is watching
a variety show on TV.

1516
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,950
I love this game.

1517
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:54,120
It's hilarious.

1518
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,450
This is perfect
for Suk Jin's birthday.

1519
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,510
- He's having fun. He seems happy.
- He loves it.

1520
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,120
It reminds me of
the Rice Barley Game I used to play.

1521
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,820
I'm having so much fun.

1522
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,950
- I need to pass my head through.
- Yes, you need to pass through.

1523
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,470
Rice!

1524
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,840
(He brutally fails the first attack
and loses a point.)

1525
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,430
- That's minus one point.
- You got hit.

1526
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:16,470
- That's right.
- You got hit.

1527
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,840
- I need to avoid getting hit?
- Of course.

1528
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,200
I can play offense later, right?

1529
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,410
He's in big trouble.

1530
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,550
- You need to move really fast.
- By the way,

1531
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,840
you look like the Magic Monkey.

1532
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,470
He really does!

1533
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,320
(Even its protruding mouth
looks like Se Chan's.)

1534
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,450
- Doesn't he look like one?
- He looks like Abu in "Aladdin".

1535
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,220
- Do I really look like it?
- Yes.

1536
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,820
Let's play, Kwang Soo.

1537
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,050
- You need to pass through fast.
- Or you can...

1538
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,220
- You need to miss the hit.
- I'll make sure to succeed now.

1539
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,950
You need to say rice
after deceiving him with barley.

1540
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,390
- Barley. Barley.
- That's it.

1541
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,660
- Barley.
- You don't have a knack for it.

1542
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,840
- That's it.
- That's how you play.

1543
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,610
- Barley. Barley.
- Move fast so he can't hit you.

1544
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,160
Barley. Barley. Barley. Rice!

1545
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,340
(He makes a fuss
and manages to succeed.)

1546
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,410
- Okay!
- Wow.

1547
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,280
You have only one chance left.

1548
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,410
- Okay.
- All right.

1549
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:56,510
You're quite good.

1550
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,870
I can hit him
before he says rice, right?

1551
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,180
- Kwang Soo is good at games.
- Barley.

1552
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,820
- He's good at them.
- Barley. Barley.

1553
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,010
Wait. He hit me when I didn't
even go down. Is this allowed?

1554
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,780
- I need to defend too.
- Is this allowed?

1555
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,490
- I need to defend too.
- Hey, hey!

1556
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,680
- I need to defend, don't I?
- He can't hit me...

1557
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,300
- when I didn't attack, can he?
- That's right.

1558
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,550
It's because
there's a battery in me.

1559
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,090
Se Chan didn't do
anything wrong though.

1560
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:16,160
- Right.
- So this is allowed?

1561
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,890
- Of course!
- You're not good at this.

1562
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,640
You need to keep saying barley
until you get a chance to say rice.

1563
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,370
(He's making a fool of Kwang Soo
without even batting an eye.)

1564
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,070
- Barley.
- The space is too tight for him.

1565
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,180
Barley.

1566
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,010
- Barley.
- Okay.

1567
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:28,780
Barley.

1568
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,910
(He gets hit anyway
even if he uses a different rhythm.)

1569
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,820
I pity him now.

1570
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,950
(Slapping)

1571
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:38,260
Why did you hit me?
Kwang Soo, I was only defending!

1572
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,490
(The fool covered in flour
finally explodes.)

1573
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,180
I was only defending!

1574
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,360
Are you sure this is how we play?

1575
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,820
- Why wouldn't you yell out rice?
- He should hit me...

1576
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,090
- You went down!
- only when I attack!

1577
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,700
You should hit me
after I yell out barley.

1578
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,700
How can you hit me
when I didn't yell out anything?

1579
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,160
What's the point of saying
barley and rice then?

1580
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,390
You need to go down
when you yell out rice.

1581
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:53,470
I didn't yell out anything,
so why did you hit me?

1582
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,470
You need to go down
when you yell out rice.

1583
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,110
You hit me
when I didn't yell out anything,

1584
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,530
so when can I yell out rice?

1585
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,910
That's when you go down.

1586
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,280
You need to do a better job.

1587
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,070
Are you Toshio or something?

1588
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,970
I'm going to start now.

1589
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,050
(Be calm.)

1590
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,280
Barley.

1591
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:10,280
- That's how you should play.
- Yes, go slowly and get the rhythm.

1592
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,510
There you go.

1593
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,620
He's such a fool.

1594
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,220
- It's tense.
- Barley!

1595
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,030
(He yells out barley
after calmly breathing.)

1596
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,260
Gosh, I should've yelled out rice!

1597
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,870
I should've yelled out rice!

1598
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,660
- I thought too hard.
- Why didn't you yell out rice?

1599
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,840
I thought too hard.

1600
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,160
Why didn't you yell out rice?

1601
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,640
It was a battle against myself.

1602
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,030
I gave you a signal this time.

1603
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,030
- Yell out rice already.
- It was the right speed for rice.

1604
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,140
I should've yelled out rice.

1605
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,530
You have only one chance.

1606
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,240
- You have only one chance.
- If Se Chan does well...

1607
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,450
(Flinching)

1608
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,870
Wait. Don't give me signals.

1609
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,950
Don't give me signals.

1610
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,590
You have only one chance.

1611
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,180
Barley. Barley.

1612
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,260
- You should've said rice.
- Rice!

1613
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,490
All right!

1614
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,450
Kwang Soo's final score
is minus one.

1615
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:55,030
- Minus one?
- Yes.

1616
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,930
- He did well.
- It's not easy, but he did well.

1617
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,990
I should go down at once. You...

1618
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,800
(Collecting all the flour
as he's desperate to get revenge)

1619
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,530
That's enough already.

1620
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,910
Kwang Soo is gathering
all the flour.

1621
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,340
- You can't put your arms down.
- Okay.

1622
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,470
He looks so scary.

1623
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:13,840
Gosh, if you get hit by those...

1624
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,090
- I mean...
- You can only start when I'm ready.

1625
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,050
- He's so determined.
- He is.

1626
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,950
- Lift your arms a little.
- He's just going to hit Se Chan.

1627
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,090
He's clenching his teeth.

1628
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,950
- Look at his face.
- I'm sorry...

1629
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,120
I'm sorry, but he's gone mad.

1630
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,160
- Look at my finger.
- I can see it.

1631
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,430
- You're okay, right?
- Yes.

1632
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,070
(Will Kwang Soo who's gone mad
be able to get his revenge?)

1633
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,390
- This is...
- He can go fast if he wants to.

1634
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,030
- Look at him. He's good.
- He's twerking.

1635
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,700
- Play until your energy runs out.
- He's twerking.

1636
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,680
Rice!

1637
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,780
(He easily scores 1 point.)

1638
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,740
Rice!

1639
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,220
(He scores another point
right away!)

1640
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,510
- I'm going to go again.
- He's good!

1641
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,620
Rice!

1642
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,410
Rice!

1643
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,050
- Wait.
- What's wrong?

1644
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,780
- Why aren't you doing anything?
- I have two more chances.

1645
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,950
(He couldn't even swing once
and lost 3 chances in a row.)

1646
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,030
Why aren't you doing anything?

1647
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,200
- You should yell out barley too.
- I will.

1648
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,720
- I will yell out barley.
- You should say barley a few times.

1649
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,870
- Okay. I'll say barley first.
- You can't only yell out rice.

1650
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:03,760
- You want me to say barley first?
- You should say it a few times.

1651
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,840
Barley, barley, and then rice?
Got it.

1652
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,840
- Twerking.
- "Twerking"?

1653
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,410
(The twerking master
gets ready to play.)

1654
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,740
You're good, Se Chan.

1655
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,030
That's so hot.

1656
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,340
It looks like a skit
from "Comedy Big League".

1657
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,340
(Shaking)

1658
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,970
There's not enough space here.

1659
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,620
Sir, there's not enough space here.

1660
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,910
- Should I make more space?
- Yes.

1661
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,370
Please make some more space.

1662
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:22,950
He's dying to hit Se Chan.

1663
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,760
He doesn't care about the game.
He just wants to hit Se Chan.

1664
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:28,680
Rice!

1665
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,450
You dodged again? Hold on a second.

1666
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,360
(There's only one chance left,
but he's far from hitting Se Chan.)

1667
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,120
- That's good!
- Se Chan earned four points.

1668
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,990
- I earned four points.
- Kwang Soo hasn't hit him once.

1669
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,470
Rice!

1670
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,490
It hasn't even started!

1671
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:41,160
(It hasn't even started!)

1672
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,410
It hasn't even started!

1673
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:45,200
You brat. It hasn't even started!

1674
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,530
- Rice!
- How could you play right away?

1675
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,680
- I'm done.
- Good job!

1676
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:50,610
- We'll accept that.
- For real?

1677
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,640
All right!

1678
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,970
Se Chan won five points.

1679
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,570
Well done, Se Chan.

1680
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,620
(Se Chan wins with 5 points.)

1681
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,820
- That was a neat finish.
- Well done, Kwang Soo.

1682
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,320
I can't hit as fast as I want to.

1683
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,180
- I can't hit fast.
- It's Ji Hyo versus So Min now.

1684
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,490
Hang on. I want to practice first.

1685
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:05,620
That's a good attitude.

1686
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,160
- She's fast.
- She is.

1687
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,970
It's not that easy to hit.

1688
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:09,970
- Right.
- I'm serious.

1689
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,300
Let's begin now.

1690
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,140
- It's nerve-racking.
- Yes, it must be.

1691
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,470
It's nerve-racking. Barley.

1692
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:17,160
- You need to find the right timing.
- I should've said rice.

1693
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,570
Barley.

1694
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:20,740
(They seem to be having a good time
for now.)

1695
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,740
You can't go down with So Min.

1696
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,870
- She can't help it.
- It can't be helped.

1697
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:24,840
- It's only natural.
- It can't be helped.

1698
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,470
- I didn't say anything!
- It can't be helped.

1699
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,620
(Ji Hyo just smacked her.)

1700
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,410
I'm so sorry, So Min!

1701
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,780
(Grabbing)

1702
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,220
Don't give up, So Min!

1703
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,030
- So Min.
- I didn't mean it. I'm so sorry.

1704
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,860
(Ji Hyo expresses how sorry she is
by applying flour on So Min.)

1705
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,930
- I'm so sorry.
- Ji Hyo means it.

1706
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,490
Ji Hyo is really sorry.

1707
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:44,220
- You'll be covered in it anyway.
- It's okay.

1708
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,430
It's hilarious.

1709
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:48,610
Rice!

1710
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,840
Good job.

1711
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,840
(So Min succeeds in her attack
while Ji Hyo still feels sorry.)

1712
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,140
You should keep it up.

1713
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:53,910
I shouldn't meet her eyes.

1714
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,200
Barley! Barley!

1715
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:57,680
Barley!

1716
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,570
- Ji Hyo.
- Aren't you just beating her up?

1717
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,320
- She keeps...
- Ji Hyo keeps beating her up.

1718
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,220
- Don't do that!
- She's so harsh.

1719
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,450
She hits So Min all she wants
and hugs her to say sorry.

1720
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,590
So Min went down
as she yelled out barley.

1721
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,050
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo followed her and hit her.

1722
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:12,030
It's because I keep losing strength
to keep my arms up.

1723
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,030
If she gets hit...

1724
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,760
It's because I keep losing strength.

1725
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,620
(She attacks So Min mercilessly
before she loses her strength.)

1726
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,640
(Nervous)

1727
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,840
Rice!

1728
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,840
(So Min has earned 2 points so far!)

1729
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:28,740
(Smack)

1730
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,780
What was that?

1731
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,910
- You just hit her?
- Why did you hit her?

1732
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,050
Weren't you going down?

1733
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:36,240
- Song Jeoktoma is back!
- You weren't going down?

1734
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,620
I thought she was going down.

1735
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:38,660
- That's so cunning of you.
- Why did you hit her?

1736
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,660
She just smacked her.

1737
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,950
(She just smacked her.)

1738
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,620
She kept mouthing something.

1739
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,620
She kept doing that,
so I thought she'd go down.

1740
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,430
- Song Jeoktoma, you're impressive.
- I thought she was going down.

1741
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:48,570
- Song Jeoktoma.
- It's my turn now.

1742
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,820
- Run, Song Jeoktoma.
- Look at this, Ji Hyo.

1743
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,590
- You need to coat them thoroughly.
- Look at this, Ji Hyo.

1744
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:54,840
(Hitting)

1745
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:58,010
(What was that?)

1746
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,010
(Delinquent Ji Hyo
kicks Kwang Soo in the head.)

1747
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,610
She kicked his head. Wow, she...

1748
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:04,610
She kicks his head now.

1749
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:06,010
Isn't the purpose of this game
to get flour on our faces?

1750
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:09,240
She precisely hit
the crown of his head.

1751
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,840
- It didn't hurt though.
- I think...

1752
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,010
Kwang Soo's been hit a lot. Ji Hyo
must have a lot of experience too.

1753
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,530
- She's tough.
- Okay.

1754
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:18,280
- All right.
- Good.

1755
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,430
Why do you always go through
the pockets when you find a jacket?

1756
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,160
I was looking for a hint.

1757
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,990
- I was looking for a hint.
- He has a habit of stealing.

1758
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,470
- I thought there'd be a hint.
- I mean...

1759
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,740
I was just checking.

1760
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,610
You don't even hide
and go through her pockets.

1761
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:31,070
- No, that's not true.
- He has issues.

1762
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,910
- Let's play.
- Barley.

1763
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,870
- Wait, so when I say barley...
- You need to go down fast.

1764
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,970
Barley.

1765
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,640
- She's quite slow.
- Put down your head fast.

1766
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,640
So Min is quite slow.

1767
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:41,140
- Rice!
- That's it!

1768
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,140
You only need to say it fast.

1769
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,890
- Put down your head fast.
- So Min can't catch up.

1770
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,320
You only need to say it confidently.

1771
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,260
(Will she say it or not?)

1772
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,280
Barley!

1773
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,620
- Barley!
- Wait a minute.

1774
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,820
- She can't hit her like that.
- You...

1775
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,220
- Barley!
- Wait a minute.

1776
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,720
- So Min hit her like this.
- You can't go down with me.

1777
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,760
That's not true.

1778
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,470
- She hit her like that.
- That's not true.

1779
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:59,760
- She followed me down.
- No!

1780
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,660
- She definitely followed me down.
- How can the game proceed...

1781
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,800
if she keeps going down Ji Hyo?

1782
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,740
No. That's not true.

1783
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:07,800
Don't hit the back of her head!

1784
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:10,410
- That's not true.
- She hit the back of her head.

1785
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,140
- That's not true.
- So Min, you...

1786
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,140
- You hit me right here.
- No, I didn't.

1787
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,620
- That's not true.
- That's not cool, So Min.

1788
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,740
How could you... Gosh.

1789
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,620
- I won't go down from here.
- From here?

1790
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,050
From here?

1791
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:21,620
(The game resumes.)

1792
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,930
- That's it. Stay there.
- Stay here.

1793
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:24,590
You need to be in the spot
where her head passes through.

1794
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:25,620
Just go down fast.

1795
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,820
(Will she say it or not?)

1796
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,930
This is fun.

1797
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:30,390
Rice!

1798
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:33,390
(She succeeds
in the delayed attack.)

1799
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:34,740
Wow, she played with So Min.

1800
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,870
- Wow, she used a fake move.
- "Rice!"

1801
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,010
I totally fell for it.

1802
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,430
That was really well-played.

1803
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:42,010
- We should play like that.
- She's good at this game.

1804
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,840
I think she hit my ear too hard.

1805
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,840
It's time for me and Haha to play.

1806
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,950
(The Precious Sister's game
ended on a good note.)

1807
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,340
- It's time for me and Haha to play.
- Okay.

1808
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,780
(Round 3, Jae Suk versus Haha)

1809
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,760
It's all about speed.

1810
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,550
- It's...
- He's at it again.

1811
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:57,450
Hang on. I'm not ready yet.

1812
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,390
He's got a good posture.
That's good.

1813
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:03,160
- You need to go down really fast.
- Of course.

1814
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,260
(Will he be able to
show what he got this time?)

1815
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,160
- You need to go down really fast.
- Of course.

1816
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,640
- He passes through so fast.
- That's it.

1817
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,680
Here we go.

1818
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,340
- Okay.
- Can I start?

1819
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,780
- He has a bad back though.
- Right.

1820
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:29,880
- I'll start now.
- His back must hurt then.

1821
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,340
Rice! Rice!

1822
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,450
Wait a minute.

1823
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,780
(Rice! Rice!)

1824
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,160
(He's covered in flour
after yelling out rice twice.)

1825
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,160
Are you okay?

1826
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:42,760
Jae Suk.

1827
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,320
You only yelled out rice twice,
and you're covered in flour already.

1828
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,430
You're covered all over with flour
after saying rice twice.

1829
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,430
He yelled out rice
only twice, right?

1830
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,300
How could he be completely covered
in flour after only saying it twice?

1831
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,110
He looks the same as Kwang Soo now.

1832
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:54,240
- What happened?
- I got it now.

1833
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,410
- You said it's all about speed.
- Okay, I got it now.

1834
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:56,880
- I should calm down.
- He must've been hit on the nose.

1835
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,700
- You should calm down.
- He was hit on the nose.

1836
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,410
(He lost two chances with no gain.)

1837
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:03,110
Here we go. Barley.

1838
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,320
Haha doesn't hit him
when he says barley.

1839
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,090
Barley. You're not hitting me
when I say barley.

1840
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,510
I don't think he'll hit you
even if you say rice at this rate.

1841
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,510
Barley!

1842
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,180
"Rice."

1843
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,180
Barley!

1844
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:14,990
Barley! Barley! Darn you...

1845
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,050
(The guy who's not good at games
is rich with flour now.)

1846
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:20,030
- Hey.
- You basically asked for it.

1847
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,130
- You went down at the right timing.
- Haha hit you at the right timing.

1848
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,490
- You put your head there to be hit.
- Is that so?

1849
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:24,760
- Yes.
- It was really rhythmical.

1850
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,300
You failed twice already.

1851
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,300
Twice?

1852
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,880
(He has three chances now.)

1853
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:33,780
Barley! Rice! Rice! Rice!

1854
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,070
(Barley, rice, rice, rice)

1855
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:42,410
Didn't he cheat?

1856
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,680
- My goodness.
- Didn't he cheat?

1857
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,860
That was hilarious.

1858
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,680
- You put your head there to be hit!
- What's wrong?

1859
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,400
- You're terrible at games.
- You're not fast at all, Jae Suk.

1860
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,660
He got the lowest score?

1861
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,930
Yes, he got minus five points.

1862
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:54,990
That's the lowest.

1863
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,200
Wait, that's Big Nose!

1864
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,860
- That's Big Nose!
- He turned into Mr. Big Nose.

1865
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,860
His nose is attached
to his glasses.

1866
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,300
How did only his nose get hit?

1867
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,780
- Only his nose was hit.
- Right, only his nose was hit.

1868
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:03,800
Your nose...

1869
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,300
If you play defense well,

1870
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,510
- you still have a chance.
- Of course.

1871
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:10,510
Haha has gained weight recently,
so he might not be as fast.

1872
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:11,610
(Haha is not as fast because
he recently gained weight.)

1873
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:15,780
- You're so ugly.
- It's scary, right?

1874
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,010
Rice!

1875
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,010
(He suddenly yelled out rice.)

1876
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:20,490
(After shaking him up,
Haha succeeds in his attack.)

1877
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:21,680
- That's acceptable.
- Is this allowed?

1878
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,800
- Of course it's acceptable.
- Rice!

1879
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,800
- There he goes again.
- What was that?

1880
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,700
- Focus, Jae Suk!
- Don't be fooled by what he says.

1881
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,400
Haha is using an advanced skill.

1882
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,070
(The man with a dirty mustache
keeps flinching.)

1883
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,700
(Big Nose is tensed up.)

1884
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:36,970
Rice.

1885
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:39,510
- Darn it.
- That was amazing.

1886
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:41,570
- Keep going!
- I'm going to hit him this time.

1887
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,410
(He gets his hips working again.)

1888
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,820
(Hitting)

1889
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,490
(Hitting)

1890
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:49,510
Jae Suk.

1891
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,660
- No! You can't do that!
- What's wrong with you?

1892
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,660
(A fight breaks out
between the men covered in flour.)

1893
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,680
What's wrong with these guys?

1894
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,490
No, you can't do this! Stop!

1895
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,800
My gosh, he's so annoying.

1896
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,130
Stop it!

1897
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,900
Jae Suk is upset!

1898
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,570
Jae Suk is upset.

1899
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,110
Haha knows when to be annoying.

1900
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,130
- You should hit him at least once.
- I should do that.

1901
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:10,130
- You should hit him at least once.
- You should hit him at least once.

1902
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,740
You can't let him take five points.

1903
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:15,340
(Haha starts
teasing Jae Suk again.)

1904
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,320
- He must be really annoyed.
- That's cute though.

1905
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,610
(Haha uses all his skills
to annoy Jae Suk.)

1906
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:21,680
He's so annoying.

1907
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,090
He's so annoying.

1908
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,880
(Darn him.)

1909
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,950
He's getting into the beat.

1910
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,200
(Crazy beat
that drives Jae Suk mad)

1911
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,700
- This battle...
- It's exciting!

1912
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,400
(DJ Bachelor Ghost)

1913
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:37,490
(Getting into the beat)

1914
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:40,130
Jae Suk
is getting into the beat also!

1915
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:41,340
It's actually exciting.

1916
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:43,200
I want to join them too.

1917
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,240
(They're just excited.)

1918
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,300
- Rice.
- Darn it.

1919
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,180
(Jae Suk allows the counterattack
while getting into the beat.)

1920
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:54,820
(It's Haha's complete victory!)

1921
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,260
Here we go.

1922
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,220
This is so upsetting.

1923
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,180
- Goodness.
- Here we go.

1924
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,590
My goodness.

1925
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:02,930
I think we got
enough footage for the show.

1926
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:04,050
You are right.

1927
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,320
I can't wait for this big match.

1928
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,030
My goodness.

1929
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:09,970
- It isn't easy, right?
- If I am not careful,

1930
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,200
I will hit him with my wrists.

1931
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,010
You need to win.

1932
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:14,610
The rules.

1933
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,340
- He is fast.
- He is good.

1934
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:18,700
He is fast. Suk Jin is fast.

1935
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:20,610
- Didn't I hear a crack?
- He is fast.

1936
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,180
He is like
a long-headed grasshopper.

1937
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,650
- He is fast.
- All right.

1938
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:25,010
He greets people so well.

1939
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,220
He ran out of energy.

1940
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,590
His back hurts now.

1941
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,260
- He ran out of energy.
- He is dizzy.

1942
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,990
- It's like he has cupulolithiasis.
- He ran out of energy.

1943
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,260
All right.

1944
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:33,630
Rice.

1945
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,430
(He succeeded
to land the first attack!)

1946
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:38,430
So that's how you play.

1947
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,720
- He got covered in flour.
- He has a nice tactic.

1948
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,990
Why are you covered in flour
when you dodged?

1949
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,900
Barley.

1950
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,130
(He got flour on his big nose.)

1951
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,800
(Giggling)

1952
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,340
The daughter-in-law is happy.

1953
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:55,200
- It's so much fun.
- Suk Jin is aging!

1954
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,740
(Seeing her father-in-law's struggle
makes So Min laugh.)

1955
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:00,090
Suk Jin is getting white hair.

1956
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:01,320
Mother-in-law will be happy.

1957
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,720
Long life, health, and blessing!

1958
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,550
(She enjoys
her father-in-law's antics so much.)

1959
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,680
He is so charming.

1960
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,360
The daughter-in-law is happy.

1961
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,530
He is so charming.

1962
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,470
- That's my father-in-law.
- Three times remain, right?

1963
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:14,720
Okay. That's it.

1964
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,990
It won't be easy.

1965
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:18,070
(It seems impossible
to pass through Jong Kook's hands.)

1966
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,260
Isn't this too narrow?

1967
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:22,030
Okay, okay.

1968
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,910
(He picks up his courage
and passes through the hands.)

1969
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:26,200
- You didn't say.
- You didn't say.

1970
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,880
- You didn't say.
- You need to say "Rice".

1971
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,880
You didn't say.

1972
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,070
You need to say "Rice".

1973
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,410
- You just passed through.
- I didn't say it.

1974
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,610
My goodness.

1975
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,150
- It hurts.
- Father-in-law, good luck.

1976
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,550
Okay. Look at this. This is speed.

1977
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,660
This is speed.

1978
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,090
He is bound to get fooled.

1979
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,590
(Jong Kook doesn't get fooled.)

1980
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,700
- Rice.
- Father-in-law.

1981
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,930
Father-in-law.

1982
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:48,130
Let him go now.

1983
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:50,590
(Suk Jin's final score is
minus 1 point.)

1984
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:52,160
Let's switch sides.

1985
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,340
Okay.

1986
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,610
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

1987
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:56,610
Jong Kook will go this time.

1988
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

1989
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:59,780
Jong Kook's tights will turn white.

1990
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:00,800
My goodness.

1991
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,950
(Putting on)

1992
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,150
Seeing him makes my heart ache.

1993
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,490
Seriously. He is living a cool life.

1994
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,180
Suk Jin became so old.

1995
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,360
- I don't know what to do.
- Seriously.

1996
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,260
His hair turned gray.

1997
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,530
My goodness.

1998
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:14,990
How did that happen?

1999
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:16,260
- Let's go.
- We began, right?

2000
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,400
- Yes.
- Let's begin.

2001
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:21,720
Rice.

2002
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:23,800
He is fast.

2003
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,430
He did it twice.

2004
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:28,240
I bet he won't hit Jong Kook once.

2005
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:31,510
Suk Jin, isn't this too narrow?

2006
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:32,700
Rice.

2007
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,780
(Hitting)

2008
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,070
(He ends up hitting Jong Kook
after getting fooled many times.)

2009
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,340
- Jong Kook!
- Hey!

2010
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:41,510
- It's Suk Jin's birthday.
- It's his birthday.

2011
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:42,680
It's Suk Jin's birthday.

2012
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,720
- You hit me in the eye!
- It's Suk Jin's birthday.

2013
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,860
- I am so annoyed!
- Jong Kook.

2014
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,490
(He hit Jong Kook
for the 1st time in 11 years.)

2015
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,800
Jong Kook.

2016
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,200
- I am so annoyed!
- It's Suk Jin's birthday.

2017
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,160
- I am so annoyed!
- You can't do that.

2018
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,760
I had to hit him once.

2019
01:05:58,070 --> 01:05:59,800
- I had to hit him once.
- For goodness' sake.

2020
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,860
I had to hit him once.

2021
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,410
To the winners
of the second mission,

2022
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,470
Se Chan, So Min, Haha,
and Jong Kook,

2023
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,680
we will give the tracking chance.

2024
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,910
- Okay.
- Okay.

2025
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,150
(The winners of each round
get the tracking chance.)

2026
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,240
What could it mean?

2027
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,010
I don't understand the hint.

2028
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:17,990
What could be similar to the photo?

2029
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:19,860
I am 100 percent sure...

2030
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,800
that the gold is moving.

2031
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:26,030
(The gold is moving?)

2032
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:28,300
Listen. In the beginning,

2033
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,300
I heard the sound when I stood here.

2034
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:40,470
(He was the closest to the gold
out of 8 members!)

2035
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:43,220
(The gold was located
somewhere close.)

2036
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:46,110
(Se Chan)

2037
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,550
(During the 2nd tracking,)

2038
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,680
(he situated himself nearby
to narrow down the location.)

2039
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:59,590
(But he wasn't the closest
to the gold.)

2040
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:05,130
(That's why Se Chan thinks
the gold is moving.)

2041
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,760
If my device doesn't go off,

2042
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,800
that means the gold is moving.

2043
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:11,610
The gold.

2044
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,200
I will stand here.

2045
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:16,650
(Who is the closest to the cold?)

2046
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,180
I hope it goes off.

2047
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,950
(So Min, Jong Kook, Haha,
and Se Chan)

2048
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,410
The device went off.

2049
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:24,360
You aren't the closest to the gold.

2050
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:26,090
It's moving.

2051
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:29,490
(The device went off...)

2052
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:30,700
Mine is going off, right?

2053
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:34,220
(at Jong Kook's location.)

2054
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,840
Look at this.

2055
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,300
(The gold is somewhere near here.)

2056
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,410
I need to look closely.

2057
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,340
(Meanwhile, So Min went
to Jae Suk's House.)

2058
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,410
What?

2059
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:45,930
Isn't this the background
of Jae Suk's puzzle?

2060
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:47,110
I think it is.

2061
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:51,970
(So Min spent nearly a day
on the puzzle.)

2062
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:55,490
(She resumed working on the puzzle
during the 3rd search.)

2063
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:57,260
Where is this place?

2064
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,030
(Is the background...)

2065
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:03,660
(Jae Suk's House?)

2066
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,900
There must be something in here.

2067
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,570
(So Min begins to search
Jae Suk's House.)

2068
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:07,720
What? Look at this.

2069
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,740
(And...)

2070
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:14,130
(Jae Suk quietly
resumes his search.)

2071
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:15,630
- Can I begin now?
- Yes.

2072
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:19,010
(It's the last search.
Who will take the gold?)

2073
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,840
This is... Who is he?

2074
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:22,610
Who is he?

2075
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,070
He is American, right?
Jong Kook would know.

2076
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,820
He is American.

2077
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,180
(He seems like an American.)

2078
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,320
Who is he?

2079
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:31,720
Can we use the internet?

2080
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,660
(Can we use the Internet?)

2081
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,680
Jong Kook!

2082
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,760
- Jong Kook!
- Yes?

2083
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,290
- Did you find something?
- It's an American.

2084
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:40,530
- An American?
- We don't know who he is.

2085
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:41,760
Why is there an American?

2086
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,040
You know Americans well.

2087
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,630
- Why is there an American?
- It's an American.

2088
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:45,790
Who is he?

2089
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:47,000
(He somehow became
the expert of Americans.)

2090
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,070
What?

2091
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:50,370
- Who is he?
- Who is he?

2092
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:51,740
Isn't he... No, that's not it.

2093
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:54,040
- Is he a politician?
- I think so.

2094
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,150
He has to be a politician.

2095
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,470
That tie...

2096
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,340
Is he a Republican?

2097
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,710
(He doesn't know what that is.)

2098
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:02,710
I mean,

2099
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,490
politicians wear ties
of certain colors.

2100
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,380
What? Who is he?

2101
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:10,160
The puzzle...

2102
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,700
The puzzle points to someone.

2103
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,130
(He searches House of Books
for more clues.)

2104
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:21,960
(Staring)

2105
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,610
Hold on.

2106
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:24,910
(Hold on.)

2107
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,710
What is this?

2108
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:32,150
(One DVD is upside down.)

2109
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,920
(It has a number sticker.)

2110
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,620
Hold on. What is this?

2111
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,710
(There is a number sticker
on the "Les Miserables" DVD.)

2112
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:39,790
What is this?

2113
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:41,660
Number six.

2114
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,360
What is this?

2115
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,790
(He finds another DVD
with the number 6.)

2116
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,170
Number three, "The Way Home".

2117
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:48,290
(He keeps getting
DVDs with stickers.)

2118
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:49,400
Number four.

2119
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,800
(Jae Suk appears.)

2120
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,930
- Se Chan.
- Jae Suk.

2121
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:55,430
Jae Suk.

2122
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:57,080
- There are numbers.
- What?

2123
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,110
- There are numbers.
- What?

2124
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,610
I found these.

2125
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,580
I am missing numbers 1 and 2.
What is this?

2126
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,650
(He has numbers 3, 4, 5, 6.)

2127
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:06,150
"House underneath is"?

2128
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:07,880
What does this mean?

2129
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,180
We aren't supposed to combine
the first letters, right?

2130
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:14,790
"House underneath is".

2131
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,400
- "House underneath is"?
- "House underneath is".

2132
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,200
("House", "Underneath", "Is",
and underlined "Gold")

2133
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:21,530
Jae Suk.

2134
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:24,290
We are missing numbers 1 and 2.

2135
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:25,590
It's underneath someone's house.

2136
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,110
- It's underneath someone's house.
- You are right.

2137
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:30,040
It's underneath someone's house.
Everyone has a house.

2138
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:33,910
The missing letters could be
"Suk Jin" or "Jae Suk".

2139
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:36,150
- It's underneath someone's house.
- That must be the case.

2140
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:37,620
"It's darker under the lamp."

2141
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,820
(Kwang Soo is hung up on the hint
about the lamp.)

2142
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:43,660
(He finds a hint in the duvet.)

2143
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,990
"A wheeled house"?

2144
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:48,830
(A wheeled house)

2145
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,660
"A wheeled house"? The van?

2146
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,720
(A wheeled house)

2147
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,800
(Does the wheeled house mean
House of Dolls?)

2148
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,040
Kwang Soo, where are you going?
Kwang Soo, come here.

2149
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,130
- What?
- Where are you going?

2150
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:03,370
Go to the car.

2151
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:05,280
I found a hint that read
"A wheeled house".

2152
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,870
- Okay, okay.
- The car.

2153
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,340
(Obsessed with the gold,
Kwang Soo arrives in no time.)

2154
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,780
Suk Jin, this is
the only wheeled house.

2155
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,040
- This is the only one.
- "A wheeled house".

2156
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,210
- Is that what the hint says?
- Yes.

2157
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,360
- What?
- Suk Jin.

2158
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,510
- We are close to winning.
- What is this?

2159
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,830
- Who is this?
- Jae Suk,

2160
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,220
- who is this?
- Who is this?

2161
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,290
Jimmy Carter.

2162
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:25,700
- Who is Jimmy Carter?
- A former US president.

2163
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,920
(The 39th president of the US,
Jimmy Carter)

2164
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,000
- Why is Jimmy Carter here?
- I don't know.

2165
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,330
Jimmy. Is it Ji Suk Jin?

2166
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,410
The puzzle I saw earlier showed
Jimi Yu.

2167
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,250
What is Jimi Yoo doing here?

2168
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,110
(The puzzles showed Jimi Yu...)

2169
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:45,010
(and Jimmy Carter.)

2170
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,710
- Jimmy Carter. Jimi Yu.
- Jimmy.

2171
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,710
Jimi Yu. Jimmy Carter.

2172
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:53,380
There must be something
between the dolls.

2173
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,330
There are more dolls in the trunk.

2174
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:56,920
(The photo does seem to show...)

2175
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:57,960
Here.

2176
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,330
(a part of this car.)

2177
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:00,960
Kwang Soo,
you need to look underneath.

2178
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,900
Kwang Soo,
you need to look underneath.

2179
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,000
(The hint said,
"When up high, check down below.")

2180
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:10,540
(Is the van
the wheeled house from the hint?)

2181
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,740
(In that case,
is the complete hint...)

2182
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,670
("House of Dolls,
underneath is gold"?)

2183
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,210
I don't see anything.

2184
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:17,470
No?

2185
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:19,320
Is there another wheeled house...

2186
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,510
- other than House of Dolls?
- "A wheeled house".

2187
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:21,710
Gosh.

2188
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:24,790
Jimmy. "House underneath is".

2189
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:26,420
(Jae Suk and So Min combine
the hints.)

2190
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,290
- I know. Jimi.
- Jimi.

2191
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,660
Is it underneath my house?

2192
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:36,330
(Is the gold
underneath Jae Suk's House?)

2193
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:42,930
(After a few words,
he runs to his house.)

2194
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,210
My room. Jimi Yu.

2195
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,080
Jimmy. "House underneath is".

2196
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,670
(Is the gold hidden
at Jimi Yu's House?)

2197
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:51,820
What does it mean?

2198
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,490
Jae Suk!

2199
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,620
What?

2200
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:59,050
What? What is it?

2201
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,990
- I am so shocked.
- Why?

2202
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:02,080
Jimi?

2203
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,860
- And? "House underneath is"?
- Jimi Yu.

2204
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,120
Yes.

2205
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:06,570
Jimi Yu's House.

2206
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:07,900
If you take out Yu...

2207
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,040
It's "Jimmy's House,
underneath is gold".

2208
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,430
Who is Jimmy?

2209
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,540
Jimmy Jib, underneath is gold.

2210
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,130
"Jib" is a homonym for "House".
Jimmy Jib, the camera.

2211
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:22,300
(Jimmy Jib)

2212
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,750
"Jib" is a homonym for "House".
Jimmy Jib, the camera.

2213
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,340
I became so shocked just now.

2214
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,580
('House" that is different
from other houses.)

2215
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,860
(All the houses aren't the same.)

2216
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,420
"When up high, check down below."

2217
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:40,090
(When up high, check down below.)

2218
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:42,570
(It always looks down
from a higher place.)

2219
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,430
"I'm always watching you."

2220
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:46,000
(I'm always watching you.)

2221
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,260
(It always watches the members.)

2222
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:54,970
(They didn't recognize
the details of the Jimmy Jib.)

2223
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:56,950
What is this?

2224
01:13:56,950 --> 01:14:01,210
(The members were filmed
using the Jimmy Jib.)

2225
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,790
Bo Pil and So Min?

2226
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:06,990
(It was actually a photo
of the Jimmy Jib.)

2227
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:10,290
It could be among the members.

2228
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:13,670
(Something that watches everything
among the members)

2229
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:16,630
(Its name is Jimmy...)

2230
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:20,170
(and it's a wheeled house.)

2231
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,630
Is there another one
that is hidden somewhere?

2232
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,630
(The reason why the gold could move)

2233
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,410
(The 1st search)

2234
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:33,420
(Then the Jimmy Jib moved
for filming.)

2235
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:37,550
(During the 2nd search,
So Min's device went off.)

2236
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,860
(It was right behind Jong Kook!)

2237
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:44,200
(The gold is hidden
at the Jimmy Jib.)

2238
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,860
"Jib" is a homonym for "House".
Jimmy Jib, the camera.

2239
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:48,170
(Even as they iterated the hints,
they had no clue.)

2240
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,530
I became so shocked just now.

2241
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:52,400
(The gold is at the Jimmy Jib!)

2242
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,110
It's the Jimmy Jib!

2243
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,240
- There must be something.
- What?

2244
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,130
(Everyone learned about the location
around the same time.)

2245
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:02,210
(Jae Suk arrives 1st.)

2246
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,420
Under the Jimmy Jib.

2247
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,490
Where is it?

2248
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:08,710
Under the Jimmy Jib.

2249
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:10,160
(He found the jewelry box.)

2250
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:15,220
(The 1st person to touch the gold
will have it for oneself.)

2251
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,420
- Did someone take it?
- Who took it?

2252
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,120
Isn't this the end?

2253
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,570
(Did someone take the gold?)

2254
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,200
- "I will take it."
- "I will take it."

2255
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:26,930
(One of the members)

2256
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:28,130
Who took it?

2257
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:29,800
Who is it?

2258
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,470
Let me see the handwriting.

2259
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,000
I think it's Jae Suk.

2260
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It isn't me.

2261
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:35,910
Jong Kook was here earlier.

2262
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:37,580
But I didn't find anything.

2263
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:40,420
- I can't believe it.
- Someone took it.

2264
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:44,160
(The gold disappeared.)

2265
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,550
Someone found the gold already.

2266
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:50,050
- Really?
- Let's go to the final location.

2267
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,460
I am getting goosebumps.

2268
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,400
Who is it?

2269
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,870
(Someone is fooling the members
after taking the gold.)

2270
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:56,030
For goodness' sake.

2271
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:57,240
It's so scary.

2272
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,960
- It isn't me. One of them took it.
- That's right.

2273
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,130
Someone is acting.

2274
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:05,240
It's so scary.
Someone has the gold right now.

2275
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,580
I wonder who took it.

2276
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:09,280
It's so scary. Someone is acting.

2277
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:13,210
The gold rings were hidden...

2278
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,510
at the Jimmy Jib.

2279
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:16,550
That's right.

2280
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:19,460
The mottos in the houses pointed
to the Jimmy Jib.

2281
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,790
Had you gathered all the DVDs,
the letters would have made,

2282
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,830
"Jimmy Jib, underneath is gold."
But you didn't find the 1st 2 DVDs.

2283
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,030
- We found them at the end.
- We found them at the end.

2284
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,090
But someone found the gold first.

2285
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,260
- Seriously.
- I am impressed.

2286
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:32,370
Who found it?

2287
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,540
This member even left a note
because he or she found it early.

2288
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,210
- That's incredible.
- It's 1 of the 3.

2289
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:37,280
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

2290
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,210
- Against our expectations,
- Did this member find it fast?

2291
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,540
this member found it fast.

2292
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,910
I hope it's a member of our team.

2293
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:44,650
This member found the gold
before anyone else...

2294
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:47,010
and acted throughout the race.

2295
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:48,710
(Found the gold before anyone else
and acted throughout the race)

2296
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:52,250
(The winner's team will decide...)

2297
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:56,960
(the candidates for the penalty.)

2298
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,870
(Who is the winner of the day?)

2299
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:03,760
Congratulations, Kim Jong Kook.

2300
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,740
(Kim Jong Kook)

2301
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:06,910
My goodness.

2302
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:08,540
Congratulations, Kim Jong Kook.

2303
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:13,340
(My goodness.)

2304
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,170
(The winner of the day is
Kim Jong Kook.)

2305
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:17,210
- How did you find it?
- How did Jong Kook do that?

2306
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:21,340
(The first hint was given
only to Suk Jin.)

2307
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,710
(Jong Kook ruled out
the regular houses.)

2308
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:30,220
(As he would with dumbbells,
he lifted up his deductive skills.)

2309
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,500
It's "I'm always watching you."

2310
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:35,400
"I'm always watching you."

2311
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,400
A camera.

2312
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,430
(During the first search,
he pointed to a camera.)

2313
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:38,960
It's always watching us.

2314
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:41,410
"When up high, check down below."

2315
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,370
"I'm always watching you."

2316
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,500
"When it's big, have a close look."

2317
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,110
Isn't it the Jimmy Jib?

2318
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:50,170
Where is the Jimmy Jib today?
Is it here?

2319
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:51,950
"It's darker under the lamp."

2320
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,290
I think it's the Jimmy Jib.

2321
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:56,450
I will stand here.

2322
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:59,120
There is no reason
for the Jimmy Jib to be here.

2323
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,550
Mine is going off, right?

2324
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:02,920
"It's darker under the lamp."

2325
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,920
(Then he began to search
the Jimmy Jib.)

2326
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:07,120
There it is.

2327
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,330
My goodness.

2328
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:11,430
(He became flustered too.)

2329
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:16,500
My goodness!

2330
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:19,410
How did this happen?

2331
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:20,650
(He succeeded to acquire
3 gold rings.)

2332
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,170
(The bright color of the gold...)

2333
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:23,950
Hold on. But...

2334
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,080
(made him grin from ear to ear.)

2335
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:26,680
A piece of paper.

2336
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,010
(Then Jong Kook asked
for a piece of paper.)

2337
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,250
Hold on. They would recognize
my handwriting.

2338
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,620
"I will take it." I won.

2339
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,680
(He used his left hand
to fool the members.)

2340
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,220
(Thus, he even left a message.)

2341
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,220
- Who is he?
- Who is he?

2342
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:46,040
(He went to different places
and meddled in people's business.)

2343
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:48,870
You guys are so mean.

2344
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,110
You gave them such a difficult hint.

2345
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:56,610
Aren't you going to tell
Kwang Soo and Suk Jin?

2346
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,340
Suk Jin and Kwang Soo need
to make an effort.

2347
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,820
Suk Jin likes having hopes.

2348
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,010
Hope keeps him going,
so I will give it to him.

2349
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,080
(He kept quiet
to give Suk Jin hope.)

2350
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,290
- I made the right choice, right?
- Suk Jin.

2351
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:09,290
(He gave Suk Jin
the happiness of hope.)

2352
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:10,460
He is so annoying.

2353
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,200
- He is so annoying.
- He is so annoying.

2354
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,220
He is so annoying.

2355
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,790
The hints were "A wheeled house"
and Jimmy Carter.

2356
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:17,960
I was like, "It's so easy."

2357
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,330
My goodness.

2358
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:20,460
(Here is the gold.)

2359
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:21,740
Okay.

2360
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:22,910
My goodness.

2361
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:23,910
(The three men got
friendship rings.)

2362
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:25,670
- They got friendship rings.
- That's too bad.

2363
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,250
- The rings are shiny.
- I am jealous.

2364
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:29,300
Why couldn't you tell
from all those hints?

2365
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:30,710
We couldn't tell.

2366
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:31,970
You guys are so slow.

2367
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,540
I knew it was the Jimmy Jib.

2368
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:38,120
- I knew it was over there.
- For goodness' sake.

2369
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,510
This is frustrating.

2370
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:41,680
- We will reveal the penalty.
- Okay.

2371
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:46,400
The penalty of the day is making
a video for Suk Jin's birthday.

2372
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:50,330
Two members will film a fun video to
Turbo's "Happy Birthday to You"...

2373
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:53,090
so that it's
a minute and 30 seconds long.

2374
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,500
- That's so much work.
- After the episode airs,

2375
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,040
it will be revealed
on Running Man's social media.

2376
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,430
- On Running Man's social media?
- It's so much work.

2377
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:01,340
You have to come up
with an idea too.

2378
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,000
- It should go...
- It's so much work.

2379
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,780
to someone who finds it annoying.

2380
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:08,450
- I want Haha to do it.
- I think Ji Hyo should do it.

2381
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:09,490
Haha.

2382
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:11,580
- I am okay with it.
- We should see her dance.

2383
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:14,360
It would be funny if Ji Hyo does it.

2384
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,790
Ji Hyo would be a good choice.

2385
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:17,750
- But I don't have an idea.
- Do you want to do it or not?

2386
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,120
I wouldn't mind it.

2387
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,460
Then let's have Ji Hyo do it.

2388
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:21,620
Haha, do you want to do it or not?

2389
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:22,700
I don't want to do it.

2390
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,930
Let's have one who wants to do it
and one who doesn't.

2391
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,290
That's a good idea.

2392
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:27,630
- Besides,
- The two of you.

2393
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:30,300
it will be convenient since you live
in the same neighborhood.

2394
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,130
We made our choice. Haha and Ji Hyo.

2395
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,410
Okay.

2396
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:36,470
- Okay.
- I don't know how to do it.

2397
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:38,120
I can't wait to see it.

2398
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:40,290
I don't have any ideas.

2399
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:41,790
Ji Hyo, let's film it here.

2400
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:46,010
(They have no intention
to celebrate Suk Jin's birthday.)

2401
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:48,220
Music, cue.

2402
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,700
(They begin filming
in a strange way.)

2403
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:55,700
(What is up
with her facial expression?)

2404
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,000
(She walks over...)

2405
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,900
(and stares into the distance
in this strange video.)

2406
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,430
(The video will be uploaded
to social media and YouTube.)

2407
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:04,710
We did it.

2408
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,420
(Evil spirits are rampant
in the Running Dynasty.)

2409
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:15,650
(The people are suffering
because of the evil spirits.)

2410
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:19,290
(Why is Yang Se Chan the king?)

2411
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:21,080
Make them kneel.

2412
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,920
(Due to the tyrannical king
and treacherous subjects,)

2413
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,660
I feel so victimized.

2414
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:28,570
(the nation is in a bad state.)

2415
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,170
(Jang Dong Yoon, Keum Sae Rok)

2416
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:31,630
(Park Sung Hoon, and Kim Dong Jun)

2417
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:34,130
(Then...)

2418
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:37,110
(evil spirits enter the palace.)

2419
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:39,000
- An evil spirit.
- Evil spirits have a mission.

2420
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,910
(The evil spirits who want
to take over the country...)

2421
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:43,450
(versus the ones who want
to save the country)

2422
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:44,750
Some are born as evil spirits.

2423
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,280
(What will become
of the Running Dynasty?)

2424
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:49,210
(Records of the Running Dynasty,
the Appearance of the Evil Spirits)
