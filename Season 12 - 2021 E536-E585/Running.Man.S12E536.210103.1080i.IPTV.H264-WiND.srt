00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,110
(Card Sharks 2:
The Return of the Gamblers)

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,970
Card Sharks Two,
The Return of the Gamblers.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,110
(About 6 months ago)

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,150
I have a feeling
something huge is going to happen.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,020
Eight card sharks from all over
the country were gathered.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,120
And they held the first
Card Shark Association Meeting.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,350
They elected the first chairman...

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,000
of the Card Shark Association
who gets enormous power.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,460
Ji Suk Jin was elected the first
chairman of the association.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,980
But the chairman failed
to dominate the association...

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,370
and resigned from the position.

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,670
Yoo Jae Suk!

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,770
Yoo Jae Suk was elected
the second chairman.

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,940
Form a single line.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,620
But as soon as he got elected,

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,910
he changed abruptly
and imposed strict rules.

17
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,910
(But as soon as he got elected, he
changed abruptly and imposed rules.)

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,360
Pay your association fees.

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,550
What?

20
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,090
Then he started to extort
association fees from the members.

21
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,120
(Then he started to extort
association fees from the members.)

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,190
Give me two caramels.

23
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,270
If I give you two,
and you go sit there...

24
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,660
- I won't sit there. Don't worry.
- Really?

25
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,200
Even after he went bankrupt,

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,860
he kept collecting association fees.

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,940
All right.

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,080
And the chairman ended up
laying hands on the association fee,

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,670
and it upset the members greatly.

30
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,970
It's done.

31
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,610
He lost all the association fees...

32
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,280
- and got kicked out with no money.
- I told you not to come.

33
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,860
The first Card Shark
Association Meeting...

34
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,950
came to a devastating end like that.

35
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,950
And a few months later...

36
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,390
(The chairman called the members
together deep into a mountain.)

37
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,230
(The portrait of the chairman
is hanging on the wall...)

38
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,870
(to show his character.)

39
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,750
Hi, I'm Sally. My name is Sally.

40
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,750
Call me Sally.

41
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,520
You've got your own character.

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,670
(You've got your own character.)

43
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,920
I've prepared this for a whole week.

44
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,160
It took me a long time
to put these stickers on.

45
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,310
(It took me a long time
to put these stickers on.)

46
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,030
The New Year's Party
of the Card Shark Association?

47
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,280
(She's totally immersed
in her role.)

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,120
My husband is on a business trip.

49
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,160
(Chewing gum noisily)

50
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,670
That's why I'm here.

51
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,920
(My husband is on a business trip.
That's why I'm here.)

52
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,770
I'm Sally. Oh, hey.

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,390
Hey, Laura.

54
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,510
- Hi, Laura.
- What are you doing, Sally?

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,700
We're having a New Year's party.
Where are you from?

56
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,580
Where are you from?

57
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,050
- Is the gum part of your character?
- Yes.

58
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,080
(Laura, aka Song Jeoktoma)

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,050
(Sally, has stickers
all over her body)

60
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,350
Hey.

61
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,150
- Hello, Jong Kook.
- Who's Madam Jeong?

62

(Kim Grand Award,
the Punch of the association)

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,920
I'm Sally. Hello.

65
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,330
Hello, Sally.

66
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,100
- Nice to see you.
- Hello.

67
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,170
- Hello.
- Hello.

68
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
My goodness.

69
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,770
(Two members are coming in
with their long mullets.)

70
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,900
- Hey, Kka Chi.
- It's an homage.

71
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,640
(An homage to Jo Kka Chi
from Tazza 3)

72
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,200
(Yang Kka Chi, the fake,
Jo Kka Chi, the original)

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,710
It's an homage.

74
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,950
- Why are you copying me?
- An homage to Kka Chi from Tazza.

75
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,640
I mean, I'm grateful, but...

76
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,860
- this feels weird.
- Jong Kook.

77
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,730
I got back-hair extensions
at a beauty salon.

78
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,230
You put so much work into it.

79
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,520
- Come closer.
- My goodness.

80
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,630
- It's the Card Sharks' special.
- Kka Chi.

81
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,020
- It's nice to meet you.
- I'm Sally.

82
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,200
Sally, it's good to see you.

83
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,800
Gosh, are you MacGyver?

84
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,360
- Actually, this is Lee Kwang Soo.
- Hello.

85
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,930
- I'm Sally.
- It's nice to see you.

86
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,730
(A petty thief imitating the thieves
from Home Alone)

87
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,140
What are you supposed to be,
a thief?

88
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,800
- Why? Don't I look okay?
- You look like a thief.

89
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,140
You should do better than this.

90
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,380
- What's wrong with this?
- I can see your underwear.

91
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,710
You look like a thief.

92
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,850
- Hello.
- Oh, gosh.

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,110
- Who is this?
- It's Im Ha Ryong. Hello, sir.

94
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,550
Hello, Ha Ryong.

95
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,790
(Senior Card Shark, Has many
nicknames including Im Ha Ryong)

96
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,760
- Who is he supposed to be?
- He really is a senior card shark.

97
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,630
Is he Corporal Pyeong?

98
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,860
What? He doesn't look like him.

99
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,770
- I'm actually Corporal Ji.
- Corporal Ji?

100
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,170
- Yes, I'm Corporal Ji.
- He insists.

101
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,460
- "Stop right there."
- He's Ha Ryong.

102
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,460
You look like Sopa Bang Jung Hwan.

103
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,460
Can you call yourselves
real card sharks?

104
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,570
(A time warp placed this old
card shark in the wrong place.)

105
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,930
- What is that?
- Don't do that.

106
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,040
He's not here yet.
He's the chairman.

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,480
- This says...
- What is this?

108
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,380
- Is he dead? My goodness.
- No.

109
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,320
- What?
- What are you doing?

110
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,640
What's wrong with you?

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,640
- Isn't he dead?
- There are no ribbons on the frame.

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,020
- Are you sure he's not dead?
- What are you talking about?

113
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,450
So when is the chairman coming?

114
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,890
- When is he coming?
- He's not here yet?

115
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,130
Let's have a seat.

116
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,050
We still have time.
He'll be here in 30 minutes.

117
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,630
Gosh, who elected him the chairman?

118
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,520
- He's so arrogant.
- Actually, no one elected him.

119
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,720
- My goodness.
- So where is he now?

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,240
Why is the couch so low?

121
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,370
Gosh, it's so flat.

122
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,830
What is this?

123
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,100
It's flat as a sitting cushion.

124
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,400
My goodness. It's so flat.

125
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,700
This is like a sitting cushion.

126
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,600
- Gosh.
- He loves that it's comfortable.

127
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,950
- Yes, but it's...
- Suk Jin loves it.

128
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,910
Why do you look like
you're from a historical drama?

129
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,620
- Come on.
- Are you from "Rustic Period"?

130
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,950
- Why did you draw this?
- Maybe he's Sirasoni.

131
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,520
You really look like
you were on "Rustic Period".

132
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,990
- You little kids.
- I think there was a role like him.

133
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,930
- Why did you draw a mustache?
- Kim Young Tae.

134
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,350
You're a bully, aren't you?

135
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,700
- His name is Jo Kka Chi.
- You're perfect for the role.

136
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,000
"Don't you know me?"

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,870
- By the way.
- Jo Kka Chi.

138
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,890
You know what?

139
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,370
Maybe it's because
of his long mullet.

140
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,640
But your mouth
seems to stick out more.

141
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,310
Don't you think so?

142
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,140
Like he's wearing
special effect makeup.

143
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,640
- No. I only extended the mullet.
- Really?

144
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,750
- I know why he grows the mullet.
- Why?

145
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,970
Because it warms
the back of the neck.

146
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,640
- Yes, it does.
- Seriously.

147
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
(So it's not a neck warmer
but a hair warmer.)

148
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,880
And the back of your neck
doesn't get sunburned.

149
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,410
- You're right.
- I'm sure.

150
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,890
Have you done
your hair like this before?

151
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,040
No. I've never.

152
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,560
You've stolen a bike
with that hair before, right?

153
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,710
What? No.

154
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,950
What's wrong with this hair?

155
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
What does his hair
have to do with stealing a bike?

156
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,930
I think I've seen a guy
who looks exactly like you.

157
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,200
(The visual of a bike stealer
with a long mullet)

158
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,500
What are you, a detective?

159
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,660
I don't know.
Maybe I'm a gang member.

160
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,570
- You're always a gang member.
- Actually,

161
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,770
no matter which movie theme we have,
I look like a gang member.

162
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,960
So you're like a problem solver.

163
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,580
I play the same role every time.

164
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,740
- By the way.
- What?

165
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,540
You look good. Maybe it's because
you've won the Grand Prize.

166

("2020 SBS Entertainment Awards,

Entertainment Awards.)

172
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,010
(With the encouragement of
his younger colleagues...)

173
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,470
(and the embrace of
his older colleagues,)

174
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,750
(he won the Grand Prize
of 2020 Entertainment Awards!)

175
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,520
I didn't think I would
feel this way because...

176
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,560
(I didn't think I would
feel this way because...)

177
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,090
(No one's ever seen
Jong Kook's tears in 10 years.)

178
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,140
Actually, as I see the other members
of Running Man...

179
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,270
Seeing the other members
of Running Man was overwhelming.

180
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,330
(The members who encouraged him
for the last 10 years)

181
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,600
You all did a terrific job.

182
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,140
They should take a lot of
the credit for this award.

183
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,040
So I'd like to thank them.

184
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,060
- Don't do this.
- Kim Jong Kook!

185
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,280
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Kim Jong Kook!

186
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,830
- We should toss you into the air.
- No, don't.

187
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,130
- Here we go.
- Don't!

188
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,350
I said no!

189
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,430
Don't!

190
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,160
Don't do this!

191
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,290
- We should.
- Don't!

192
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,160
- Don't toss me.
- Why not?

193
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,530
Just don't do this.

194
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,960
We're six people.
And we can't toss one man?

195
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,030
- We can do this.
- I said no.

196
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,440
Come on. We can do this.

197
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,950
- Let go of me.
- Come on. Let's do this.

198
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,700
- Stop this.
- It's so funny.

199
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,380
- Why toss me?
- What's wrong?

200
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,770
Why can't we congratulate you?

201
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,390
- My goodness.
- Don't congratulate me.

202
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,710
- What's this?
- Don't do this.

203
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,910
Listen to me. Like I said before...

204
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,390
I always had to consider
the next winner,

205
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,430
which was the Grand Prize.

206
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,150
So I always had to
cut my acceptance speech short.

207
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,390
- I see.
- But this time, I was at the end.

208
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,660
So I wasn't used to
a longer acceptance speech.

209
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,290
- It was burdensome.
- Yes, it was.

210
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,270
- It was burdensome.
- But you were the last winner.

211
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,460
Because you won the Grand Prize!

212
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,460
Kim Jong Kook!

213
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,740
- Don't do this!
- Kim Jong Kook!

214
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,770
I said no!

215
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,140
- This won't work.
- Darn it!

216
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,240
(Darn it!)

217
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,250
Why is this so hard?

218
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,080
Tossing you isn't that difficult!

219
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,710
Do you think we'll drop you?

220
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,190
- What's the big deal?
- My goodness.

221
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,710
- By the way, Yang Se Chan.
- What?

222
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,120
You only cried
when Jong Kook won the prize.

223
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,130
- You cried?
- No, I didn't.

224
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,150
- Come on. You did.
- I didn't.

225
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,350
But you didn't cry
when I won a prize!

226
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,520
Come on. I didn't cry.

227
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,830
- He cried.
- No...

228
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,000
- No, I didn't.
- Well,

229
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,530
- it's okay to cry.
- I've never felt that way.

230
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,400
Watching someone I know
feeling overwhelmed made me...

231
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,700
- feel like crying.
- I know.

232
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,580
I was so overwhelmed at that moment.

233
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,880
I saw you holding back tears too.

234
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,040
- Right.
- You saw it too?

235
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,120
I was holding back tears because
you guys looked overwhelmed.

236
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,640
Because I was watching all of you.

237
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,180
Wait a minute.

238
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,140
There are other members
who won prizes.

239
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,220
Yes, that's right.

240
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,410
("Haha from 'Running Man'
wins Top Excellence Award!")

241
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,960
- Let's toss him.
- Yes, let's!

242
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,130
- Let's toss him in the air!
- What are you doing?

243
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,230
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3!

244
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,230
(He just lets them toss him.)

245
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,500
- Gosh, this is great.
- Here you go.

246
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,970
Haha is light.

247
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,740
- He almost went flying.
- Yes, and he let us throw him.

248
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,160
- I should apologize to Ji Hyo.
- Why?

249
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,640
- I was so bewildered.
- I know.

250
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,940
So I mentioned the members
I could see in my acceptance speech.

251
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,910
But Ji Hyo wasn't
where I could see her.

252
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,380
- She had to go present an award.
- I know.

253
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,180
I'd like to thank
the members who supported me.

254
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,120
Jong Kook, Jae Suk,

255
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,490
our youngest members
who brought us luck...

256
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,460
So Min and Se Chan.
And I'd like to thank Kwang Soo too.

257
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,190
I'd also like to thank
my role model, Suk Jin.

258
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,390
(Suk Jin, Jae Suk, Jong Kook,
Kwang Soo, So Min, and Se Chan)

259
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,470
(But he didn't mention Ji Hyo
in his long acceptance speech.)

260
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,890
I'll keep trying my best. Thank you.

261
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,160
(His acceptance speech ended
but Ji Hyo's name wasn't mentioned.)

262
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,170
But Ji Hyo wasn't
where I could see her.

263
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,570
- She had to go present an award.
- I know.

264
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,710
So tell everyone
that you're okay about it.

265
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,900
What?

266
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,270
- Ji Hyo.
- Should I?

267
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,440
- People are texting me about it.
- Really?

268
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,880
They're asking me if we had a fight.

269
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,590
- Why didn't you mention her?
- We're the Mapo Siblings.

270
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,360
- Why would I? Tell them it's okay.
- Yes, do that.

271
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,050
- Say that you're not upset at all.
- But you know what?

272
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,390
- I'm a little upset.
- Hey!

273
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,390
(I'm a little upset.)

274
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,500
- That's it. Kill him.
- We're not the Mapo Siblings.

275
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,660
- Hey!
- Just kill him!

276
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,970
You know what?
Even if she wasn't there,

277
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,110
- you should've mentioned her name.
- He's right.

278
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,770
But actually,

279
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,570
- she mentioned us in her speech.
- Yes.

280
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,170
But she mentioned the older members,
Se Chan, and So Min.

281
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,510
- That was it.
- He's right.

282
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,350
You're right. She did.

283
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,440
- I wasn't going to say this.
- You're right.

284
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,590
I was so upset about it
that I almost cried.

285
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,860
With the older members,
So Min, and Se Chan...

286
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,650
I will keep doing my best.
Thank you.

287
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,690
(Ji Hyo, what about me?)

288
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,920
I was so upset about it
that I almost cried.

289
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,930
I said, "the other members,
Se Chan, and So Min".

290
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,290
Didn't she say, "younger members"?

291
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,970
She said, "older members"!

292
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,140
- No, I didn't.
- Kwang Soo is younger than you.

293
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,010
- Say you're okay with it.
- Yes, say something.

294
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,300
I'm really upset.

295
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,400
(So upset)

296
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,440
I can't even sleep...

297
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,940
because I'm too upset.

298
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,850
It's only natural to mention
all members' names...

299
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,680
- in acceptance speeches.
- You're right.

300
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,750
- Yes.
- That's why...

301
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,410
I listened very carefully
to your acceptance speech.

302
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,490
- You mentioned us as "our members".
- Yes, he did.

303
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,130
Yes, as "our members".

304
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,320
He also talked more about
"My Little Old Boy" than our show.

305
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,630
- I even timed it.
- No, I didn't.

306
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,020
- You're so right.
- That's not true.

307
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,770
- I'm so upset!
- It's not true.

308
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,140
What are you talking about?

309
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,500
And there's another hot topic.

310
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,300
The 2020 SBS Entertainment Awards
presented another prize.

311
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,710
It's called
the Worst Reaction Prize.

312
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,710
- Who? Suk Jin?
- Yes. Suk Jin.

313
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,800
Congratulations, Suk Jin.

314
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,270
- Here we go.
- Ji Suk Jin!

315
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,850
- Why me?
- Ji Suk Jin!

316
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,310
(Suk Jin won
the Worst Reaction Prize!)

317
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,270
- Why me?
- Suk Jin had the worst reaction...

318
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,810
- when he was on camera.
- You're right.

319
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,490
Once he was massaging his hands.

320
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,720
- He acted indifferently.
- Yes, you're right.

321
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,860
- Every time.
- Who was the camera director...

322
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,730
- who got me on camera?
- Why do you ask?

323
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,760
It was strange.
I was focusing on the ceremony.

324
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,500
But when I do something else,
they caught me on camera.

325
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,100
(Doing something else)

326
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,140
(Doing origami)

327
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,890
(Getting into the rhythm)

328
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,140
It was whenever he was doing
something else.

329
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,300
Everyone stood up to give applause.

330
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,430
And Suk Jin sat back down
a bit earlier than us.

331
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,510
Right then,
they got a full shot of us.

332
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,800
Everyone was still standing.

333
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,540
- But Suk Jin was sitting down.
- The worst reaction.

334
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,520
(Suk Jin just sat down quickly.)

335
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,890
I was so surprised when I saw that.

336
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,960
Legendary celebrities
were being awarded.

337
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,860
I only sat down
faster than the others.

338
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,630
But suddenly we were on the camera
at that moment.

339
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,390
Fortunately, you're as old as
those celebrities.

340
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,650
You're in the same age bracket
as they are.

341
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,190
So they were okay about it.

342
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,240
You can continue the conversation
when the chairman arrives.

343
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,890
- All right.
- Why isn't the chairman coming?

344
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,060
We're holding the 2021 Card Shark
Association New Year's Party.

345
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,110
Like you did last time,
you'll have a fierce competition...

346
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,340
- over caramels.
- Gosh, caramels again?

347
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,380
- I see.
- We're doing it again?

348
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,300
Like we did before, we'll elect...

349
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,890
- the chairman of the association.
- All right.

350
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,750
But right now,
the chairman of the association...

351
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,180
is Yoo Jae Suk,
the one who was elected last time.

352
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,730
The chairman will arrive
30 minutes later.

353
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,790
Until then, you will discuss
whether Jae Suk should get to...

354
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,290
keep his position
as the chairman or not.

355
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,690
And if you put 20 caramels
in the box here,

356
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,740
We should submit caramels.

357
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,110
you'll remove him from the position
and elect a new chairman.

358
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,610
So what was the benefit?

359
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,010
- It's not about benefits.
- He can arrange the matches.

360
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,270
And he took all our caramels.

361
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,410
- That's right. He was...
- He took all our caramels...

362
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,910
all of a sudden.

363
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,650
Why did he do that?
Can he do stuff like that?

364
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,550
We can dismiss him
with three caramels each.

365
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,230
We have to submit our caramels.
He will extort them from us anyway.

366
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,360
I put my caramels
in his box by mistake,

367
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,920
and he just took them.

368
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,160
And he placed another bet
with the winner's tip.

369
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,060
- He can't do that.
- That's ridiculous.

370
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,010
He was supposed
to eat or something with it.

371
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,870
I didn't like it when he extorted
caramels from us.

372
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,880
- Right.
- He was like a bully.

373
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,140
He got his own way.

374
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,270
We have to remove him
from the position.

375
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,120
We have to dismiss him.

376
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,040
- Let's get rid of him.
- He always gets his own way.

377
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,680
All right. I'm sure
I'll be the chairman again.

378
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,820
(He was hiding in an attic room
before the members arrived.)

379
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,630
What am I doing here?

380
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,230
- Jae Suk.
- Yes.

381
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,020
As you know, you're the chairman
of the Card Shark Association.

382
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,770
Am I the chairman?

383
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,770
You abused your power
as the chairman.

384
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,900
I didn't abuse my power.

385
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,530
You did.
And you're still the chairman.

386
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,530
You are still in the position.

387
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,900
But do you see the seven
card sharks gathered together there?

388
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,140
I see them.

389
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,350
They think the chairman is...

390
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,680
arriving in 30 minutes.

391
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,180
And they will have a discussion...

392
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,890
about your second consecutive term.

393
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,960
- In there?
- Yes.

394
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,100
I'm sure they will fail
to gather 20 caramels.

395
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,890
If they fail to collect 20 caramels,

396
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,870
you will be the chairman
for another round.

397
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,740
(He can serve two consecutive terms
if they fail to gather caramels.)

398
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:32,270
(The chairman has been
watching the whole thing.)

399
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,300
(They can dismiss Jae Suk
with 20 caramels.)

400
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,670
Three caramels each?

401
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,670
3 times 7 is 21.

402
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,570
I just need 1 person
who doesn't submit 3 caramels.

403
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,990
For your information, the new
chairman will get more power.

404
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,090
We have to dismiss him
no matter what.

405
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,620
Then we should
elect Suk Jin chairman.

406
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,780
- Okay.
- You should pay 10 caramels then.

407
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,890
- Right.
- And we will support you.

408
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,130
Isn't it a good idea?

409
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,100
They will put up...

410
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,790
an easy person to deal with
as the candidate.

411
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,970
- I will support you.
- Isn't it a good idea?

412
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,370
You should submit 10 caramels.

413
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,610
Suk Jin will be
the puppet chairman.

414
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,900
- And Jong Kook will control him.
- The puppet chairman?

415
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,300
- Hey.
- Is he Jong Kook's puppet?

416
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,610
He's a puppet.

417
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,610
You are dressed
like a puppet chairman.

418
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,640
I don't like it.

419
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,540
- I want to be the real chairman.
- You can be the real chairman.

420
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,440
- You're the real chairman.
- It's okay as he doesn't know.

421
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,590
Jae Suk never listens to me.

422
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,180
It really upsets me.

423
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,990
- We will support you.
- We're here to help.

424
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,420
6 times 2 is 12.

425
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,820
You should submit 2 caramels.
I'll submit 8.

426
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,050
- Eight caramels?
- Yes.

427
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,320
- 8? Hang on.
- Just go with 10.

428
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,190
- Submit 10 caramels.
- The numbers don't add up.

429
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,970
And one of us will submit
no caramels.

430
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,600
Whether you submit 5 or 10,
you'll lose them all anyway.

431
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,840
Just give us 10 caramels now.

432
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,240
It's better to submit them now.

433
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,840
At least you will
look cool this way.

434
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,340
- You will look generous.
- You can be generous this way.

435
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,940
- Okay. I'll give 10 caramels.
- Okay.

436
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,210
Good.

437
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,910
- I love it.
- I'm going to teach him a lesson.

438
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,670
Put your caramels in the box.

439
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,750
- We will split the rest.
- Okay.

440
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,910
- Submit 2 caramels each.
- 2 caramels?

441
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,310
- Wait. I want to see him pay.
- One of us don't have to pay.

442
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,780
We have to decide who it should be.

443
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,390
I have a feeling...

444
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,100
that I will lose 10 caramels
and the plan will fall apart.

445
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,420
- Gosh.
- That's not going to happen.

446
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,770
That's not how we want
to start the new year.

447
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,140
I just feel like you won't
submit your caramels.

448
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,640
It's our promise.
We have to keep our words.

449
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,110
- You have my word.
- It's time for action.

450
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,240
- Okay.
- Then...

451
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,140
Suk Jin will be the hero
of our first episode...

452
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,640
- in the year 2021.
- Sure.

453
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,350
It's very meaningful, Suk Jin.

454
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,770
You should be the hero.

455
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,010
It's 10. Let's go.

456
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,310
- I'm submitting 10 caramels.
- You're the best.

457
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,380
Hey!

458
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,640
(As soon as he walks out
with his caramels,)

459
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
(the caramel thieves raid his bag.)

460
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,490
I didn't take any.

461
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,780
- I didn't do anything.
- My gosh.

462
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,130
You punks.

463
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,680
I'm not doing it.
I don't want to do this.

464
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,280
- He doesn't want it.
- I'm not doing this with you.

465
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,520
I don't want to be the chairman.

466
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,190
- Why are you sulking?
- I'm not doing this.

467
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,390
- It's just...
- I don't want it anymore.

468
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,560
As if we planned it all together...

469
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,500
We are really mean.

470
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,790
I took one caramel.

471
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,870
- Give them back.
- I didn't take any.

472
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,340
- I didn't take your caramels.
- Me neither.

473
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,770
- 2, 4, 6...
- I don't have his caramels.

474
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,610
- I swear I didn't take any.
- 2, 4, 6, 8...

475
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,640
- I was going to, but I failed.
- 2, 4, 6, 8...

476
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,770
I'm not doing this.

477
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,140
- Why are you sulking?
- I don't want to do this.

478
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,170
Jae Suk should be the chairman.

479
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,220
What is it that you don't
want to do? This show?

480
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,620
You don't want to be the chairman?

481
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,040
I'm not submitting 10 caramels.

482
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,490
Actually, I want to be chairwoman.

483
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,360
Of course. Honestly,
So Min deserves to be one.

484
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,630
I want to try it.

485
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,760
Let's go with So Min then.

486
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,690
So Min is a little tiring though.

487
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,320
No. I'm... You know what?

488
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,290
I'm like that
when I'm just a member.

489
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,530
But if I become the chairwoman,
I will be nothing but fair.

490
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,560
- Will you submit 10 caramels?
- If I do, can I be the chairwoman?

491
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,970
- Sure.
- We have no reason not to.

492
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,030
You should submit 10 caramels then.

493
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,300
- And we will submit 2 each.
- Sure. You submit 10.

494
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,340
- Can I really trust you guys?
- Of course.

495
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,750
- Let's give it a try. It's good.
- Today?

496
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,110
- I'm serious.
- But my camera...

497
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,450
- But my camera...
- Your camera?

498
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,220
- Your camera?
- Your camera is over there.

499
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,760
- Say hello to it.
- Do you see it over there?

500
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,220
- It's right there.
- Say hi.

501
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,730
Hi. It's right there.

502
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,990
Even the cameraman waved at him.

503
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,620
- He's so kind.
- I was looking for it.

504
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,400
I will submit 10 caramels.
Make sure to elect me chairwoman.

505
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,120
- We promise.
- We're serious.

506
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,290
I'll submit two caramels.

507
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,240
Whoever it is, we need
a new chairperson.

508
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,440
Make sure to elect me as chairwoman.

509
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,030
- You're so cool.
- These are 10 caramels.

510
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,330
- She sounds bold.
- Okay.

511
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,180
I gave 10 caramels.
Make me the chairwoman.

512
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,800
(Letting out a sigh)

513
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,870
Hang on.

514
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,540
(Chairman Yoo is doing something.)

515
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,950
Se Chan.

516
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,610
(Se Chan, I'm watching
you guys now.)

517
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,960
(If I become the chairman,
I'll take good care of you.)

518
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,960
And Kwang Soo.

519
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,380
Are you sure you gave 10 caramels?

520
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,400
- Did you put in 10 caramels?
- Sure.

521
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,930
I can't tell you that.

522
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,560
Seriously, I put in 10 caramels.

523
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,530
Gosh, this is...

524
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,330
- Here are two caramels.
- Make me the chairwoman, Se Chan.

525
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,830
So tell me about your plans.

526
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,240
Kwang Soo didn't put in caramels.

527
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,940
Gosh, seriously.

528
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,600
(Pretending to put it in,)

529
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,100
(Jo Kka Chi deceived everyone.)

530
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,540
Gosh, seriously. You can't do this.

531
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,220
- Don't be like that.
- Gosh, Kwang Soo.

532
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,650
(Before he gets his hand cut off,
he puts it in again.)

533
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,190
- Hey, Kwang Soo.
- Kka Chi, please.

534
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,690
(He submits 1 caramel
against his will.)

535
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,690
- I submitted mine, seriously.
- He didn't.

536
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,960
You will see it later.

537
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,460
Kwang Soo, if you don't
submit your caramels,

538
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,050
- I did.
- we can't get a new chairperson.

539
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,320
You can check the box later.

540
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,060
(What about Se Chan
who got Chairman Yu's message?)

541
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,240
You put in only one caramel.

542
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,670
(He submits only 1 caramel.)

543
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,210
- I put in 2.
- No, it was only 1.

544
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,710
- He submitted only 1.
- I submitted 2.

545
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,740
I didn't know So Min would do this.

546
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,030
So Min is stepping up.

547
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,480
(Chairman Yoo feels betrayed
by So Min.)

548
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,720
(The other three are done
submitting their caramels.)

549
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,490
I never lied.

550
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,080
Please trust me. I will show you...

551
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,380
a fair and beautiful world.

552
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,120
I will announce the results
once Jae Suk arrives.

553
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,460
Kwang Soo, are you sure
you submitted your caramels?

554
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,020
- I did. I'm serious.
- You have to do this.

555
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,520
I really did.

556
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,700
I have only 18 caramels now.

557
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,860
- You are...
- Don't fake it.

558
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,970
I'm putting in one caramel.

559
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,740
- I'm telling you, So Min.
- Hey, Suk Jin!

560
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,510
(He steals caramels from the box.)

561
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,800
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- What are you doing?

562
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,100
Why are you taking the caramels?

563
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,210
Stop it.

564
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,830
- Don't do it.
- Put them back in.

565
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,710
You're really strange.

566
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,800
You can't steal them.

567
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,570
This is mine. It's mine.

568
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,020
You can't steal the caramels.

569
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,610
He doesn't even have skills.

570
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,610
It was so obvious.

571
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,020
- Obviously, he was taking caramels.
- It was obvious.

572
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,280
He's like a man who steals
tithings from church.

573
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,690
What are you doing?

574
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,320
- I have 10.
- He's here.

575
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
He's here.

576
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

577
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,400
- He's Yoo San Seul.
- Is he Yoo San Seul?

578
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,630
(He shows up
looking like a trot singer.)

579
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,630
- All right.
- Hello.

580
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,740
- Have a seat.
- I'm Sally.

581
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,010
(He shows off his power
extending his hand for a handshake.)

582
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,410
Congratulations.

583
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,010
- Hello.
- Hello.

584
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,770
- Hi.
- He's wearing an armband.

585
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,770
- The chairman is really...
- You look great today.

586
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,990
We have to change the world.

587
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,580
I've been abroad for a while.

588
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,260
Where? We can't go abroad.

589
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,780
I was in self-quarantine
for two weeks.

590
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,050
That's how I came back.

591
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,320
Who copied whose mustache here?

592
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,000
- Who was the first?
- You look like twin brothers.

593
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,020
This is my real mustache.

594
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,230
Do you want to see
who copied whose mustache?

595
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,470
The two look like...

596
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,500
(He tries to remove
Suk Jin's mustache.)

597
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,100
- Don't do that to him.
- Get off me.

598
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
(He can't even fight against it.)

599
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,510
- It's gone.
- The mustache is gone.

600
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,800
- Hey.
- It's gone.

601
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,300
- He's a copycat.
- I did it with a lot of care.

602
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,750
- He looks so dull.
- He's a copycat.

603
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,770
- All right.
- Look at them.

604
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,270
Now you can see who copied whom.

605
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,310
Now I know.

606
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,690
How dare you...

607
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,990
He copied Jae Suk.

608
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,490
- Let's sit.
- Okay.

609
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,660
The award winners should sit here.

610
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,190
Don't be like that.

611
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,790
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't say that.

612
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,120
- Stop it.
- Why are you sitting in a corner?

613
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,730
What? Why?

614
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,170
Did you win an award?

615
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,670
- I didn't.
- Then sit over there.

616
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,940
Why does it even matter?

617
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,940
He won the reaction award.

618
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,940
- He won the Worst Reaction Award.
- The Worst Reaction Award.

619
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,910
Just fire him.

620
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,210
- We have the Grand Award winner.
- My goodness.

621
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,250
- Come over here.
- Okay.

622
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,720
- That's enough.
- We have the award winners.

623
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,650
- Thank you.
- All right.

624
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,420
- It never happened to us before.
- This is what we have to do.

625
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,380
I'm sitting here as the chairman.

626
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,000
But why is the sofa so low?

627
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,460
- This is a sitting cushion.
- Is this a sitting cushion?

628
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,590
This is called a cushion sofa.

629
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,520
Are we in a Korean restaurant
or what?

630
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,900
- What?
- This is nice though.

631
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
My gosh.

632
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,860
I don't know
what you guys were doing,

633
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,630
but I heard a babble of voices.

634
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,870
We were talking about you.

635
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,710
I'm Sally today.

636
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,680
We have Se Ri here.

637
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,220
- Pak Se Ri?
- Pak Se Ri.

638
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,250
- Pak Se Ri?
- He's Pak Se Ri.

639
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,340
(He talks about Jong Kook's
doppelganger every once in a while.)

640
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,080
<i>- We will finally win
- We will finally win</i>

641
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,350
(Mr. Se Ri can't take his socks off
because of his muscles.)

642
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,230
- I really like your show.
- Take off his socks.

643
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,320
All right.

644
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,350
Today, with Chairman Yoo Jae Suk,

645
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,770
we are having the 2021 Card Shark
Association New Year's Party.

646
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,130
Before the chairman got here,
the members had a debate...

647
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,600
on Chairman Yu's
second consecutive term.

648
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,630
- There were a lot of complaints.
- I'm very disappointed.

649
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,130
It was meaningless though.

650
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,180
I'm disappointed.

651
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,370
Actually, Chairman Yoo Jae Suk...

652
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,310
was watching and hearing
the whole thing.

653
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,420
- Really?
- Yes. And...

654
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,850
(Really?)

655
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,460
He watched and heard
what you did and said.

656
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,850
That's right. I did.

657
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,260
By the way,

658
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,760
I didn't know that So Min would...

659
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,200
- step up so enthusiastically.
- I see.

660
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,090
- You saw all that, right?
- Yes, I saw everything.

661
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,010
- I was taken aback, to be honest.
- I see.

662
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,770
- I don't know how it'll turn out,
- The one who dreams to be a king.

663
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,530
but please remember
what I tried to do.

664
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,830
You see,

665
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,150
I know what you guys think
as I've worked with you for so long.

666
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,870
The person whom you want
as the chairperson is...

667
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,270
a puppet type.

668
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,340
- You're right.
- That's true.

669
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,460
- Someone not like a chairperson.
- Yes.

670
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,160
- A puppet chairperson.
- Exactly.

671
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,260
- And the most suitable person is...
- Someone who's easy to control.

672
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,520
Seok Sam, you know.

673
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,200
- I know. However, you know what?
- Yes?

674
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,670
- It scratched my pride.
- I know.

675
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,670
- You saw how they robbed me, right?
- Yes, I saw that.

676
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,330
I couldn't trust them,

677
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,970
- so I withdrew my candidacy...
- Yes.

678
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,740
- and recommended another puppet.
- Did you?

679
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,770
Anyway, you will probably be
removed from your position.

680
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,750
(Declaration of war)

681
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,770
- Me?
- Yes. You'll be sacked.

682
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,650
- What if he keeps his position?
- I understand.

683
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,340
We don't know
how things will turn out yet.

684
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,810
Whatever happens,
I can assure you of one thing.

685
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,190
- If I get elected again,
- Yes.

686
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,820
- I'll consider what I saw...
- Of course.

687
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,090
- when I treat each of you.
- Absolutely.

688
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,850
- Of course, you should.
- You saw everything, right?

689
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,170
As soon as I find out
that I'm re-elected,

690
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,170
my revenge begins.
Do you understand?

691
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,560
I didn't even turn in any caramels.

692
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,170
- Is that true?
- Yes, I didn't turn in my caramels.

693
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,170
- Hey, how could you...
- Jong Kook...

694
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,470
- If I get re-elected,
- Yes.

695
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,680
- That won't happen.
- those who voted for a new one...

696
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,950
will have to turn in two caramels
as an association fee.

697
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,180
- All right!
- Sounds great.

698
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,870
- Hey.
- You never let us down, sir.

699
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,020
- You're brilliant as always.
- Do you understand?

700
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,520
- You fools!
- I'd give you mine just for you.

701
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,160
- Trust me. He'll be fired.
- You're amazing.

702
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,460
- Do you understand?
- We don't know that.

703
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,260
I bet we turned in 20 caramels.
You'll definitely be fired.

704
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,260
- It's hard to predict.
- I know who voted earlier.

705
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,520
I promise I will give
those who voted more caramels.

706
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,970
- All right.
- Yes.

707
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,170
We'll find out the result.
If there are 20 caramels in here,

708
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,100
the new chairperson will
automatically be elected.

709
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,480
- Please. I used half what I had.
- If not,

710
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,100
Jae Suk will serve another term
as the chairman.

711
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,180
I took five caramels out.

712
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,980
- Please. There should be 20.
- Yes.

713
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,840
- 10 of those are mine.
- I told you to turn in some more.

714
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,750
- You didn't turn in any, did you?
- I did.

715
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,690
- I turned in three caramels.
- The current number is 11.

716
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,280
You heard him, right?
Haha said he had turned in three.

717
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,930
- He turned in three caramels.
- Did he?

718
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,730
- I was just saying, you know.
- Ms. Chairwoman.

719
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,850
I think there are more in the box.

720
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,930
Ms. Chairwoman.

721
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,620
(Suk Jin is going all-in
on So Min.)

722
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,470
14 caramels so far.

723
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,030
- We need only six more.
- Why are there so many?

724
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,030
Please.

725
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,170
17 caramels so far.

726
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,940
- Just three more caramels.
- I really want to be a chairwoman.

727
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,100
(They need only 3 more caramels
to replace the chairwoman.)

728
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
Three more caramels, please.

729
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,770
19 caramels.

730
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,570
- Just one more, please.
- Really?

731
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,040
(Just 1 more caramel will make
the anti-Jae Suk group succeed.)

732
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,310
- Please. Just one more.
- Who turned in so many caramels?

733
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,850
(What could be the fate
of the Card Shark Association?)

734
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,310
There's no more. I'm relieved.

735
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,760
- No more?
- 19 caramels in total.

736
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,460
(The final result, 19 caramels)

737
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,660
Congratulations.

738
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,930
We'll toss you up. Ready. 1, 2, 3.

739
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,740
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Yoo Jae Suk! Yoo Jae Suk!

740
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,090
- Hooray!
- Thank you.

741
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,830
Congratulations
on being elected again.

742
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,470
- Thank you.
- It's because...

743
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,830
- Why are there no more caramels?
- Congratulations.

744
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,980
Who didn't turn in caramels?

745
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,480
- I was worried a little bit.
- Despite the tense situation,

746
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,270
I openly supported you.

747
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,450
- Thank you for that.
- You know that, right?

748
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,720
- You still have all the caramels?
- Of course, I do.

749
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,950
We did as we were told.

750
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,380
I turned in just one caramel
because I had no choice.

751
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,960
- Please have a seat, everyone.
- Thank you.

752
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,110
Oh, my. My dear Jae Suk.

753
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,350
Move to the other side.

754
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,520
Ha Ryong... Ha Ryong will...

755
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,550
- Ha Ryong. Ha Ryong, you...
- Why did you push me?

756
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,850
- Ji Ha Ryong.
- Why did you push me, sir?

757
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,670
- Mr. Ji Ha Ryong.
- You pushed me...

758
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,330
My gosh. They needed only one more
caramel. That was unbelievable.

759
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,740
First of all, the new members...

760
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,480
- Just as I announced,
- Yes.

761
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,570
- please pay your association fee.
- Right.

762
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,570
Each of you should turn in
two caramels.

763
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,370
- You should pay the fee.
- You should.

764
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,570
- You should pay the fee.
- Now?

765
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,450
- Why must we pay the fee?
- I already told you.

766
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,250
The chairperson
of this association...

767
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,990
- has absolute power...
- This is...

768
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,730
- Hey! You little...
- Darn.

769
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,730
(He slapped him in the face.)

770
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,730
(Jo Kka Chi versus Ji Ha Ryong)

771
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,730
Stop it.

772
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,660
(The fateful fight
over the caramel tax)

773
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,170
(Suk Jin feels humiliated as he got
hit on the head with his own bag.)

774
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,060
- That's enough.
- Look at that.

775
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,670
- How dare you?
- He's actually kicking him.

776
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,410
He's actually hitting him.

777
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,370
(Even the chairman can't stop
their childish fight.)

778
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,600
Suk Jin, we're filming the opening.

779
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,840
- Save it. The shoot just began.
- They're actually fighting.

780
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,610
Stop it, guys. That's enough.

781
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,720
- Hey! How could you...
- Pay your fee.

782
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,220
- Pay your association fee.
- Pay it for now.

783
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,920
- Give me back those.
- Calm down.

784
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,020
- Give me back my caramels.
- Please sit down.

785
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,960
- Give me back mine!
- I'll give them back to you.

786
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,160
- Please sit down.
- If you're drunk...

787
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,060
Excuse me. If you're drunk,
you should go home.

788
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,120
Please go home.

789
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,130
My precious caramels...

790
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,130
(The old man can't get it together
when he's drunk.)

791
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,360
By the way, you have 20...

792
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,670
You still have 20 caramels.
Why did you say you voted?

793
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,670
I received 30 caramels.

794
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,740
Oh, I see.

795
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,710
Give me two caramels for now.

796
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,770
If I turn in two caramels...

797
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,480
Suk Jin, your mic fell off.

798
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,920
- Who will get them?
- Oh, his mic?

799
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,750
Don't worry about it.
He won't be saying anything.

800
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,340
(He won't let him talk either.)

801
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,920
Oh. Mr. Yu, that's impressive.

802
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,380
- You even sorted that out too?
- He's amazing.

803
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,990
- That was impressive.
- You won't even let him talk?

804
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,760
- Of course, I should do it.
- Look at So Min's face.

805
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,280
Isn't her fake smile so funny?

806
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,290
Gosh. Stop it.

807
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,970
I thought she was wearing the mask
we put on at the awards ceremony.

808
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,000
She looked like she was wearing it.

809
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,360
- Make it just one, please.
- Her eyes look so sad.

810
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,830
- And those who supported me,
- Yes.

811
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,480
- I'd like to...
- Yes.

812
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,770
- Yes, sir.
- give you one for each of you.

813
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,040
- Oh, my. Thank you.
- Thank you!

814
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,340
- Thank you for looking after us.
- He's so cool.

815
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,920
- He's the best. Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

816
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,550
- Yoo Jae Suk! Yoo Jae Suk!
- Do you guys have no pride?

817
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,280
- Do you have no pride?
- That's right. We have no pride.

818
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,080
- For a mere caramel...
- Right.

819
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,960
- Please sit down.
- Okay.

820
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,760
Jae Suk, please say New Year
greetings as the chairman.

821
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,020
All right.

822
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,520
- Mr. Yu, you dropped this.
- 2021...

823
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,200
- My, thank you.
- You're welcome.

824
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Please put it on.

825
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,970
You sure are the winner
of the Grand Award.

826
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,770
- You're elegant and sophisticated.
- He's different.

827
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,830
- You speak so elegantly.
- Of course.

828
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,150
- Suk Jin, sit here.
- The year 2021 has come.

829
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,370
- That's okay.
- The new year has begun.

830
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,070
- I insist. You might get piles.
- Yes.

831
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,480
Shut it, you punks!

832
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,150
(Shut it, you punks.)

833
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,650
The chairman is speaking.

834
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,880
- Have you lost your mind?
- That's enough.

835
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,260
- Stop it.
- You little...

836
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,280
Gosh, seriously.

837
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,850
- Anyway...
- Hey, calm down. Take it easy.

838
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,290
- I can't believe them.
- I know.

839
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,200
But we should treat him
as our elder today.

840
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,360
- 2021 has come.
- Yes.

841
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,470
In 2020,

842
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,510
we all struggled
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

843
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,530
I hope all our viewers' lives...

844
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,570
will return to normal
so they can be comfortable again...

845
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,540
in 2021.

846
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,250
- Also...
- He won't stay seated.

847
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,490
- we're going to...
- Sir.

848
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,650
(As the chairman's
boring speech continued...)

849
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,960
- Sir.
- My gosh.

850
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,280
- Gosh, seriously.
- Gosh.

851
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,730
The chairman is giving
his speech now.

852
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,880
Can't I even drink water?

853
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,350
- His speech...
- I am...

854
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,020
- saying greetings to our viewers.
- Exactly.

855
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,560
- He was saying something important.
- I mean...

856
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,470
- He drives me crazy.
- I'll use violence next time.

857
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,270
- Drink it.
- I'll slap you next time.

858
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,740
- It's okay.
- They can edit it out.

859
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,770
- Calm down. It's okay.
- Gosh. Stop it already.

860
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,710
- What are you doing?
- Go back to your seat.

861
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,210
- It's okay.
- Gosh. Why you little...

862
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,150
- What are you doing?
- Suk Jin, go ahead and drink it.

863
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,310
- Mr. Yu.
- Dear viewers,

864
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,870
- happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

865
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,540
(While Suk Jin is drinking water,)

866
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,190
(they made a deep bow suddenly.)

867
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,460
They're getting a full shot.

868
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,350
- They got a full shot.
- Exactly.

869
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,990
- He put only one hand on the floor.
- That's right.

870
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,960
- Go ahead and drink it.
- Hey.

871
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,550
Why did you do it
while I was drinking water?

872
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,000
What's wrong?

873
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,470
I'm always grateful
to our viewers too.

874
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,170
- You can thank them any time.
- Absolutely.

875
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,240
- My gosh.
- Oh, wow.

876
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,770
- That was perfect.
- Yes.

877
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,370
It's the Year of the Ox.

878
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,740
Was anyone born
in the Year of the Ox?

879
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,740
- I was.
- Kwang Soo was.

880
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,680
Oh, Kwang Soo was born
in the Year of the Ox.

881
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,540
- He was born in 1985.
- In 1985, the Year of the Ox.

882
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,180
- I see. You were born in 1985.
- Yes.

883
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,650
To celebrate the start
of the Year of the Ox...

884
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,880
(He's finishing up hastily.)

885
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,380
- But...
- Yes?

886
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,990
Won't you make
any well-wishing remarks?

887
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,090
Last year was the Year of the Mouse.

888
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,960
I was born in the Year of the Mouse.

889
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,820
You're not the only person
who was born in the Year of the Ox.

890
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,470
- My mom was born in the Ox Year.
- So were a lot of other people.

891
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,770
- Really? Your mother was?
- Yes, my mom was.

892
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,360
Why don't you move to Hoengseong?

893
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,670
Why would I move to Hoengseong?

894
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,130
- Imitate an ox at least.
- That's nonsense.

895
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,910
How about you go by
Lee Hoeng Seong...

896
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,480
just throughout this year?

897
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
Lee Hoeng Seong.

898
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,770
- That makes no sense.
- I like the idea.

899
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,480
- How about Lee Beef?
- Lee Beef.

900
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,150
- That sounds great.
- You should go by Lee Beef.

901
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,450
- Lee Beef.
- That's a good name.

902
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,650
How about Lee Sirloin?

903
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,750
"Lee Sirloin"?

904
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,080
(Lee Sirloin got mad
because it's not "Ribeye".)

905
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,350
- Lee Sirloin sounds great.
- I like that name.

906
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,380
- Sirloin isn't the only part.
- I like the name.

907
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,400
- Why would you say that?
- I like the name too.

908
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,960
- Why "sirloin"?
- How about "ribeye"?

909
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,900
He'll be called Lee Sirloin
this year.

910
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,270
- His nickname has been decided.
- Why "sirloin"?

911
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,770
It's a great nickname.
Lee Sirloin.

912
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,290
- This is ridiculous.
- Sirloin is a perfect name.

913
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,410
- I agree.
- He was born in the Ox Year.

914
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,940
- He was born in the Ox Year.
- Today,

915
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,180
we're going to do a race
to celebrate the new year.

916
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,510
It's the 2021 Card Shark Association
New Year's Party,

917
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,250
The Return of Gamblers.

918
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,810
Every one of you begins the race
with 30 caramels.

919
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,380
- But I have only...
- You can obtain more caramels...

920
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,920
through the missions.

921
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,420
The more caramels you have
at the end of the race,

922
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,460
the earlier you can leave
as well as receiving a prize.

923
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,120
- My goodness.
- That's a great reward.

924
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,160
- The bottom three...
- That's tempting.

925
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,090
will receive a penalty
and be the last to go home.

926
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,360
- Oh, boy.
- That's the worst.

927
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,560
- We're in Yangpyeong.
- We're in Yangpyeong.

928
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,830
My house is three hours' drive
away from here.

929
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,290
If you get stuck
in rush hour traffic...

930
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,630
- During rush hour,
- It'll take three hours...

931
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,470
- during rush hour.
- It'll take three hours.

932
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,980
- I should do a really good job.
- The chairperson...

933
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,630
has even bigger power
than the last time.

934
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,770
He will divide you guys into teams
and decide the order of the teams...

935
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,150
- to carry out missions.
- That's great.

936
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,370
Also, for each mission,

937
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,150
he gets to add one rule
and use it for his own benefit.

938
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,960
- He has such a privilege?
- Really?

939
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,550
Being the chairman is awesome.

940
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,880
Absolutely. Congratulations.

941
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,930
- It's awesome.
- You have such a great privilege.

942
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,930
He's practically a king.

943
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:11,020
But if the members don't like
the chairperson,

944
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,290
you can put 20 caramels
in the proposal box...

945
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,940
before the next mission begins
to replace him with someone else.

946
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,670
- That will never happen.
- If you turn in 20 caramels,

947
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,830
you will elect a new chairperson
after the mission ends.

948
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,510
- I bet you won't be replaced.
- Today,

949
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,570
- the winner can go home early.
- Exactly.

950
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,040
So we should save
as many as caramels...

951
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,540
- Don't worry. We hold more chairs.
- I know.

952
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
A few of us already
fell out of his favor.

953
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,050
- Why would we do that?
- You fools.

954
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
- You should join us.
- I'm not worried at all.

955
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,660
- Do you two want to ally with me?
- Let's form an alliance.

956
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,880
- The three of us together.
- Ji Hyo, make up your mind.

957
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,120
She'll definitely ally with us.

958
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,500
- Are you with us?
- You should be.

959
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,470
Why are you forcing
an answer out of me?

960
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,630
- I'm not forcing anything...
- They're falling apart.

961
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,830
- We're outnumbered.
- Let me think about it.

962
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,600
- Did you pay the association fee?
- I did.

963
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,940
Well, they didn't.

964
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,070
- They received caramels instead.
- Okay, I hear you.

965
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,600
I love it. They're arguing
at the beginning of the year.

966
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,110
They must be looking
to win Best Couple in 2021.

967
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,580
Let me pass on the rules.

968
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,880
The new chairperson
won't be put to a vote.

969
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,550
The former chairperson
will write down five names...

970
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,280
on a roulette wheel
with eight blank spaces.

971
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,500
Spinning it will tell us
who the new chairperson is.

972
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,400
- I get it now.
- So it's like this.

973
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,590
The opposing team
may want a change in leadership,

974
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,290
- but one of us could be selected.
- Right.

975
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,000
It won't be easy to make a move.

976
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,330
He'll write down
four names from that side...

977
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,030
and only one from this side.

978
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,070
Then let's head out
to the location...

979
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,570
where the first game
will take place.

980
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,770
- All right.
- Let's go!

981
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,540
- Everyone.
- Yes?

982
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,810
- Gather around.
- Got it.

983
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,610
- Coming.
- We'll be right there.

984
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,750
Unbelievable.

985
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,960
Our fans provided us with beverages.

986
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,720
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

987
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,820
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

988
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,930
We all enjoyed them.

989
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,090
I'm not joking when I say...

990
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,670
that we should be the ones
giving back to our fans,

991
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,090
but they're the ones
sending us coffee.

992
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,670
Thank you for being generous
when we haven't done much for you.

993
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,940
- What the...
- What was that?

994
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,970
Then do something for them.

995
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,940
- Please do something for the fans.
- Be more sincere.

996
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,270
(Suk Jin gets an earful
for chiming in unnecessarily.)

997
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,450
Don't kill the mood.

998
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,710
Act on your words then.

999
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,950
Do something for the fans.

1000
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,770
- You and your empty promises.
- I'm always...

1001
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,220
- grateful.
- He doesn't seem to mean it.

1002
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,840
After the 2020 SBS
Entertainment Awards,

1003
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,520
he complained about
it taking too long.

1004
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,710
But then when
the chief director came by,

1005
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,230
he said, "The ceremony was a blast!"

1006
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,050
What a bootlicker.

1007
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,000
- With his thump up.
- What a bootlicker.

1008
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,500
- You're now making things up.
- So personally...

1009
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,730
Don't just talk the talk anymore
and...

1010
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,230
The proposal box
will always be in the room.

1011
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,230
Hyeong Gu, why are you
eating the caramel?

1012
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,230
(The assistant director was hungry
and ate a caramel.)

1013
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,170
(They get agitated by the news
that he ate their money.)

1014
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,800
You shouldn't eat that.

1015
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,880
Hyeong Gu!

1016
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,340
- You shouldn't eat that.
- Don't eat that.

1017
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,440
- Why would you eat that?
- He ate a caramel?

1018
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,610
Shouldn't you be watching
your weight for the wedding?

1019
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,050
- Hyeong Gu...
- The wedding was postponed.

1020
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,690
- His wedding was postponed.
- Still...

1021
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,380
The January wedding...

1022
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,630
- was pushed to July.
- July?

1023
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,190
You got a few more
months of freedom...

1024
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,800
hence the chubby cheeks.

1025
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,820
Hyeong Gu,

1026
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,590
you seem happy to have it postponed.

1027
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,840
Hyeong Gu,
six months is a long time.

1028
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,960
- How...
- They can register the marriage.

1029
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,170
Is it better to quickly
register the marriage?

1030
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,300
- If I'm being honest...
- Yes?

1031
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,210
You should wait a year...

1032
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,780
- To see how things go?
- Yes.

1033
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,920
- Have you yet to register yours?
- After all this time?

1034
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,650
It's about time you did it.

1035
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,020
How else could I have added
my kids to my family register?

1036
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,610
- I didn't know better.
- What on earth are you saying?

1037
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,960
- I didn't know.
- Suk Jin,

1038
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,380
- register your marriage.
- I already did!

1039
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,300
- I didn't know.
- We might end up doing it for you.

1040
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,090
But I already did.

1041
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,730
(The coffee break ends with
his point of view on marriage.)

1042
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,070
The first mission...

1043
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,440
will only let the brave
win caramels.

1044
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,440
- This is No Room for Cowards.
- This won't be easy.

1045
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,170
- No Room for Cowards?
- No Room for Cowards.

1046
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,000
Each round will see
three of you compete.

1047
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,670
You'll sit under
two water balloons each.

1048
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,610
In turns, you will
be able to launch an attack.

1049
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,520
After betting
the desired amount of caramels...

1050
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,860
- See those 12 lines behind you?
- Sure.

1051
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,280
Only six of them are the real deal.

1052
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,530
- We must cut one at a time.
- You will cut one.

1053
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,400
The balloon that pops
could be yours, someone else's,

1054
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,920
- or none of the above.
- I could pop my own balloon.

1055
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,090
There's a chance
that nothing could happen too.

1056
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,270
If you cut a line that leads...

1057
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,130
to no balloons popping,

1058
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,610
you will receive
the amount that you bet.

1059
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,980
So it's still a win.

1060
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,900
If you pop a balloon
above someone else's head,

1061
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,980
you'll receive double.

1062
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,170
- Double?
- Yes.

1063
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,980
If your balloon pops,
you'll have to pay double.

1064
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,380
(They will lose double the amount
if their balloon pops.)

1065
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,650
The one whose balloon pops...

1066
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,360
will end up paying double
the amount.

1067
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,530
That'd be huge.

1068
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,750
However, you're allowed
to jump out of the way.

1069
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,500
If you think your balloon will pop,

1070
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,690
you may move out of the way.

1071
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,500
- We must say it in advance.
- If you're right,

1072
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,110
you'll receive the amount
that was originally bet.

1073
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,670
If you're wrong,

1074
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,630
you'll have to pay up that amount.

1075
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,170
It's all about trusting your gut.

1076
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,840
Stay seated if you're brave enough.

1077
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,280
- I'm not a coward.
- Neither am I.

1078
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,940
Jump out of the way for no reason
and you'll lose caramels.

1079
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
Then I'll lose two, right?

1080
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,050
You're eliminated when
both your balloons pop...

1081
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,820
and the round ends there.

1082
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,320
The chairperson...

1083
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,090
will split you into groups of three.

1084
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,400
One must play twice though.

1085
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,300
- Please keep that in mind.
- Participating in two rounds...

1086
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,030
It could be an advantage
but also a disadvantage.

1087
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,070
- Right.
- Only if you win caramels.

1088
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,070
I'll have to see
how the round progresses.

1089
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,630
Guys, can you all
take two steps back?

1090
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,400
- 1, 2.
- 1, 2.

1091
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
- You're allowed to give out orders?
- Then...

1092
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,530
Stand at the far end.

1093
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,570
- Move!
- Don't stand in the center.

1094
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,780
Off you go.

1095
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,170
Can you believe him?

1096
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,520
I see.

1097
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,250
Who you compete with
will be crucial.

1098
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,280
Of course.

1099
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,610
It's all up to you, Mr. Yu!

1100
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,710
- Then...
- I hope you'll be generous.

1101
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,380
Sure, I'll try to be fair.

1102
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,750
- Jong Kook...
- Sure thing.

1103
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,190
- Those will be the groups.
- Okay.

1104
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,170
Kwang Soo, announce
how many you'll bet...

1105
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,730
and cut a line.

1106
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,500
It's nice and simple.

1107
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,400
- This is nerve-wracking.
- Kwang Soo,

1108
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,710
betting the right amount
is everything

1109
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,380
Give up if you're scared.

1110
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,380
(What?)

1111
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,650
He didn't convey
any emotion with that.

1112
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,650
- It was mechanical in a way.
- He said the line with no feeling.

1113
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,170
- All right.
- If nothing happens,

1114
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,340
I'll earn the amount
that I bet, right?

1115
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,670
Right, the same amount.

1116
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,190
If no balloons...

1117
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,590
Just do it already!

1118
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,360
- Bet your caramels.
- Bet five and be done with it.

1119
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,090
- Don't be a coward.
- Just do it.

1120
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,630
I'll bet five.

1121
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,750
- 5?
- Yes, 5.

1122
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,650
- That's quite a lot.
- Good.

1123
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,420
Please announce
the number of the line you'll cut.

1124
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,570
I'll...

1125
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,030
(Kwang Soo must choose
which line he'll cut.)

1126
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,530
I'll cut line number eight.

1127
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,800
Would anyone like to step away?

1128
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,000
Would anyone like to
move out of the way?

1129
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,230
Not me.

1130
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,800
You're never successful
at these games.

1131
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,110
I'd like to take this chance.

1132
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,280
There's a good chance
that yours won't pop.

1133
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,980
There's more of a chance
of a balloon not popping.

1134
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,340
- Which one's number eight?
- I'll receive double...

1135
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,070
if someone else's balloon pops.

1136
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,880
- Let's go!
- Let's do this.

1137
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,520
- Please let it pop.
- I'll cut it then.

1138
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,650
(Will Kwang Soo's bet pay off?)

1139
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,420
- I'd love for it to pop.
- Number eight?

1140
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,820
Please let Kwang Soo's balloon pop.

1141
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,530
I think you should
move out of the way.

1142
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,750
- Let Kwang Soo's balloon pop.
- Do it.

1143
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,920
Let's go!

1144
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,360
(Just please don't let it be mine.)

1145
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,130
(A balloon popped!)

1146
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,110
(Jong Kook loses 10 caramels.)

1147
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,480
He earned double the amount.

1148
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,630
You earned double.

1149
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,170
How did he know?

1150
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,250
- The chances were low.
- I earned 10 caramels.

1151
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,610
Kwang Soo receives 10 caramels.

1152
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,690
This is fun.

1153
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,440
- He did it on his first try.
- No way.

1154
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,150
I popped a water balloon
on Kim Grand Award's head!

1155
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,360
- Unbelievable.
- Gosh.

1156
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,150
- Right?
- He made it happen though.

1157
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,420
I now have 10 caramels.

1158
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,590
Suk Jin, how many will you bet?

1159
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,420
He'll go for 10.

1160
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,420
- Yes, 10.
- My gosh.

1161
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,940
- 10 caramels?
- I was like this the whole time.

1162
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,070
It's all about reading
the staff's intentions.

1163
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,500
Number eight was attached
to a water balloon.

1164
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,980
- Then...
- Can you head out...

1165
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,230
and mow the lawn?

1166
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,070
- What?
- Please mow the lawn.

1167
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,170
I'll choose line number 11.

1168
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,110
- The veteran entertainer...
- Line number 11.

1169
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,550
Would anyone like to
move out of the way?

1170
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,820
If I do,
but my balloon doesn't pop...

1171
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,320
- You'll lose caramels.
- I'll lose 10, right?

1172
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,710
- Right.
- That's too much.

1173
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,690
It's a better choice to stay seated.

1174
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,630
- That's too much.
- It's hard to take that chance.

1175
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:53,730
I'll stay seated.

1176
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,800
- You already earned enough, so...
- You'll stay?

1177
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,030
- What about you?
- I'll stay seated.

1178
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,300
- Okay, here we go.
- Cut the line.

1179
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,000
I think his balloon will pop.

1180
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,400
I hope Suk Jin's will pop.

1181
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,000
It'd be most entertaining
to have Suk Jin's balloon popped.

1182
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,270
- That'd be hilarious.
- Let's do this!

1183
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,480
(Suk Jin will lose 20 caramels
if his balloon pops.)

1184
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,570
No balloons popped.

1185
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,050
(He cut a line
that wasn't attached to anything.)

1186
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,500
No balloons popped.

1187
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,020
(Suk Jin earns 10 caramels
which is the amount he bet.)

1188
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,110
You earn an additional amount
of 10 caramels.

1189
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,650
An additional amount?

1190
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,150
- Okay!
- Nice one.

1191
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,750
- All right.
- That's not bad either.

1192
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,460
- No way.
- Good job, Suk Jin.

1193
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,090
It's all about probability.

1194
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,960
There's a higher chance
of mine not popping.

1195
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,800
Hyeong Gu's been given a big role.

1196
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,500
- Look at him.
- Way to go.

1197
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,860
Hyeong Gu, congratulations
on your big role.

1198
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,590
- You were on TV.
- The camera was on you just now.

1199
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,900
You're playing a big role.

1200
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,710
Just don't eat the caramels
while you're there.

1201
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,400
(Hyeong Gu's being accused
of eating all the caramels.)

1202
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,030
- I should go just as big.
- Right.

1203
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,610
- I'll bet 10.
- Of course.

1204
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,980
My gosh.

1205
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,520
There's a low chance
of my balloon popping.

1206
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,480
Line number one's too taut.

1207
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,710
Line number one's too taut.

1208
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,090
Could that be on purpose?

1209
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,130
Jong Kook is at it again.

1210
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,630
- He's sharp with these things.
- He's being perceptive.

1211
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,860
Line number one
is tighter than the others.

1212
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,090
Spoken like someone
with an AB blood type.

1213
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,500
- Line number one?
- Yes.

1214
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,170
I'll step away.

1215
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,670
- Kwang Soo, go ahead.
- I'll step away.

1216
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,500
- I doubt his will pop.
- He's onto something.

1217
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,730
I highly doubt it.

1218
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,440
(If Kwang Soo's balloon pops,
he'll earn 10 caramels.)

1219
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,170
- I think he made the right choice.
- I agree.

1220
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,170
All right. Can I cut it?

1221
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,400
- Sure.
- What if Kwang Soo's pops?

1222
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,070
(Was it wise for Kwang Soo
to step away?)

1223
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,980
(He cut it!)

1224
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,690
Nothing happened.

1225
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,820
Poor Kwang Soo.

1226
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,020
Poor Kwang Soo.

1227
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,460
(If nothing happens,
you lose the amount you bet.)

1228
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,230
- Too bad.
- Kwang Soo ruined his chances.

1229
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,030
Nice!

1230
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,000
(He lost 10 caramels
by pretending to be intuitive.)

1231
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,150
What did I tell you?

1232
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,190
- What he earned earlier...
- Kwang Soo loses 10...

1233
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,460
while Jong Kook earns 10.

1234
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,030
You lost the amount
that you earned earlier.

1235
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,190
- Give me 10.
- Oh, no!

1236
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,340
It serves you right for showing off.

1237
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,460
You seemed like a loser just now.

1238
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,000
- I'm glad.
- It was all for nothing.

1239
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,530
It's your fault for saying
the line was taut.

1240
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,210
I just mentioned how weird it was.

1241
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,050
It was too taut...

1242
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,650
which made me believe
it wasn't attached to anything.

1243
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,090
The balloons will now start to pop.

1244
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,320
They probably will.

1245
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,820
It's all about
stepping out of the way now.

1246
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,250
I'll bet 15.

1247
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,280
My gosh.

1248
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,150
Stepping away might
make you lose big time.

1249
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,270
Betting at least this many will...

1250
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,960
- Right, we can't step away.
- We'll have to stay seated.

1251
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,170
My goal...

1252
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,630
is to pop someone else's balloon.

1253
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,070
- Right.
- Of course.

1254
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,440
The round will be over
if mine goes off.

1255
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,880
The balloons will now
go off left and right.

1256
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,550
Right?

1257
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,710
Sounds intriguing.

1258
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,980
(The spectators are thrilled
to be watching the game.)

1259
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,250
- Which one will it be?
- Let me see.

1260
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,980
Let me see.

1261
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,750
One should know when to step away.

1262
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,090
- Number 9 or 7...
- The chance that mine will pop...

1263
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,300
I doubt that would
lead to yours popping.

1264
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,070
They must not be placed
consecutively.

1265
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,530
You don't know that, you punk.

1266
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,570
- Why would you swear at me?
- Hey.

1267
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,570
How would you know?
It's not like you are...

1268
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,170
one of the staff members, you brat.

1269
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,030
(Kim Grand Award became sensitive
as 15 caramels are on the line.)

1270
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,030
- Hey, Grand Award.
- Why?

1271
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,280
- Kim Grand Award.
- It's not like that.

1272
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,400
- Mr. Yu, he's being unreasonable.
- He suggested...

1273
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,170
a groundless assumption.

1274
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,840
- That's how we play this game.
- You didn't make any sense.

1275
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,050
You should've come up
with something reasonable.

1276
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,710
- Gosh, Kim Grand Award.
- Kim Grand Award.

1277
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,840
You just blabbered nonsense.

1278
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,920
- I'll finish him.
- You'll finish me?

1279
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,360
- Lee Sirloin! Lee Sirloin!
- Sirloin, hurry up.

1280
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,860
- I choose...
- You can do it, Sirloin.

1281
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,500
Okay. I choose number two.

1282
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,030
- I think it'll make one pop.
- I'll go with number two.

1283
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,460
- Number two will pop.
- I think so too.

1284
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,800
- Good choice.
- You won't move, right?

1285
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,800
- 2 or 8.
- I won't move.

1286
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,130
- I can't because I bet 15.
- Let's go for it.

1287
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,670
A man doesn't fear getting splashed.

1288
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,400
- I never turn around.
- I won't move.

1289
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,670
I'll get 30 caramels if I succeed.

1290
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,280
Number two?

1291
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,340
It's taut.

1292
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,670
- It's taut.
- Sirloin, you can do this.

1293
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,610
(The 2 of them are hoping
their balloons won't pop.)

1294
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,590
I think the red one will pop.

1295
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,250
(A balloon popped.)

1296
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,590
- Number two?
- I think the red one will pop.

1297
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,150
(Suk Jin's balloon popped.)

1298
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,250
(He gained 30 caramel
as someone else's balloon popped.)

1299
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,320
Good job!

1300
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,820
(Suk Jin lost 30 caramels since he
stayed and his balloon popped.)

1301
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,860
He's good at this game.

1302
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,860
- He bet 15...
- Nice.

1303
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,940
(He hit his head on the frame.)

1304
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,340
Nice slapstick comedy act.

1305
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,530
- Okay.
- He got lucky.

1306
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,780
- Kwang Soo got lucky.
- He got lucky.

1307
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,570
Did he bet 15 caramels?

1308
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:04,550
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks".

1309
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,670
- Kka Chi.
- That was cool.

1310
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,380
- Then will I lose mine?
- Yes.

1311
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,710
You should give Kwang Soo
30 caramels.

1312
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,940
- I...
- You should pay double.

1313
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,210
- 30 caramels?
- Yes.

1314
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,710
Okay. It's over.

1315
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,020
He's broke already.

1316
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,590
- Will he get a loan?
- That's a lot.

1317
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:17,630
30 caramels?

1318
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,130
- He's broke already.
- The bankrupt man.

1319
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,380
- He's broke now.
- Really?

1320
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,460
- As you must know,
- Here are five caramels.

1321
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,590
when you use up all the caramels
you have,

1322
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,530
you should go out
to the snowy field.

1323
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,960
- You know that, right?
- He'll roll around in the snow.

1324
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,500
Yes, he'll roll around in the snow.

1325
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,270
- Did I give you 3 or 4 times?
- 5 caramels each time.

1326
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:34,000
I think he'll have to
get a loan soon.

1327
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
- Can a bankrupt person go home too?
- He should find a loan shark.

1328
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,130
You gave me the right amount.

1329
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,900
Can I get a loan?

1330
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,670
- We'll give you a loan.
- Okay.

1331
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:41,780
I can't bet just one caramel.

1332
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,880
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

1333
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,340
You should pay your association fee.

1334
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,710
- That was unexpected.
- Pardon? But I...

1335
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,280
- I supported you.
- When you earn a lot of caramels,

1336
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,750
- Hold on a second.
- you should pay the fee.

1337
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,820
Don't you remember me?

1338
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,230
You should pay your association fee
no matter what.

1339
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,650
- He's right, Kwang Soo.
- You should pay it.

1340
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,460
- We're using water and everything.
- Exactly.

1341
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,670
- It will all be...
- But earlier...

1342
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,190
- It'll be used for the association.
- That's how we get the supplies.

1343
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:04,230
- But I already paid one caramel.
- That's not how it works.

1344
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,500
- 2 caramels per 10.
- Wait.

1345
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,530
You have to pay five caramels.

1346
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,280
Why did the fee go up
to five caramels suddenly?

1347
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,940
- You have to pay five.
- Why did it suddenly change?

1348
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,800
You earned a lot.
You just gained 30 caramels.

1349
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,550
The interest is 2 caramels
per 10 caramels of principal.

1350
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,650
- What?
- Two caramels.

1351
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,020
Give me 20 caramels.

1352
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,880
I should go big. This won't work.
I'll recover my funds.

1353
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,420
- I will use this money...
- Wait, Suk Jin.

1354
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,000
to help out members
who struggle financially.

1355
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,250
- It's like a tax, right?
- Sounds great.

1356
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,320
Yes, you can say that.

1357
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,320
- Sounds great.
- Those who struggle financially...

1358
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,630
- Wait.
- Why?

1359
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:33,900
- Never mind. Continue.
- What is it?

1360
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,000
It's nothing. Continue.

1361
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,570
How dare you cut the chairman off?

1362
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,730
We were...

1363
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:39,800
(Here comes the bootlicker.)

1364
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,500
(Our chairman is speaking
right now.)

1365
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,750
- Hey, hey!
- What's that?

1366
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,110
(What he did made everyone frown.)

1367
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,710
- I can't believe him.
- What's wrong with you?

1368
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,320
Those are new pants.

1369
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,520
That brat.

1370
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,520
- Gosh, seriously.
- My gosh.

1371
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,030
I'm sorry.

1372
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,320
- Gosh, that brat.
- Why did you do that?

1373
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,860
I'm so sorry.

1374
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,670
He spilled coffee on his new pants.

1375
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,770
- My goodness.
- He's unbelievable.

1376
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,440
- Gosh.
- Go back to your seat.

1377
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,800
I apologize for what he did.

1378
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,900
Suk Jin.

1379
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,840
- Yes?
- You asked for 20 caramels.

1380
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,610
Why did you leave
when I gave you only 10?

1381
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,300
- Well, he...
- He's hopeless.

1382
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,670
(Sadly, the slow-witted Suk Jin
miscalculated.)

1383
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,110
He's going to lose anyway.

1384
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,750
- I'm worried about him.
- How could you deceive me?

1385
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,320
(Here's how he left when he received
only half what he asked for.)

1386
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,650
(Suk Jin clearly asked
for 20 caramels.)

1387
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,610
(The staff meant to give him
10 caramels twice.)

1388
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:31,780
(But he left after receiving
a handful of caramels.)

1389
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,030
(Walking away)

1390
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,590
- Gosh.
- I'm worried about him.

1391
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,150
- How could you deceive me?
- I didn't.

1392
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,170
- How could you deceive the cast?
- You should have done it.

1393
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,170
Why would you try to deceive us?

1394
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,270
He deceives himself
and feels satisfied.

1395
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:42,300
Exactly.

1396
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,170
(Suk Jin who made a fool
of himself will bet this time.)

1397
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,900
Moving on, it's Suk Jin's turn.

1398
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,780
I will go all-in.

1399
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,440
- Seriously? How many do you have?
- I have 21.

1400
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,940
- Are you serious?
- That's too risky, Suk Jin.

1401
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,250
- But this is...
- I can't move this time.

1402
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,780
But if you bet all you have...

1403
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,020
- I have a chance...
- You should think carefully.

1404
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,150
- You might go broke.
- Listen to me.

1405
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,440
You might end up in the snowy field.

1406
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,020
- No, I won't.
- You'll have to get another loan.

1407
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,520
I was defeated once.

1408
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,110
So I should get back at him.
There's a high probability...

1409
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,980
that their balloons will pop
or none will pop.

1410
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,590
I'll most likely win this time.

1411
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,800
But it's too risky.

1412
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,030
You know, a thought just
crossed my mind.

1413
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,400
- What is it?
- Are you trying to go home late?

1414
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:19,070
- I mean, he might have planned...
- He made a meticulous plan.

1415
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:23,210
No wonder why he left his bag open
as if he wanted us to steal it.

1416
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,650
- It's odd.
- Hang on.

1417
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:27,170
I miss my wife at this very moment
although I'm shooting a show.

1418
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,280
(If you say so.)

1419
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,920
- Are you referring to Chaser?
- Yes, I am.

1420
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,420
I miss my Chaser so much.

1421
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,190
- You do?
- Ms. Chaser.

1422
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,250
Yes.

1423
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,360
You mean, Ms. Chaser?

1424
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,380
My dear Chaser.

1425
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,230
Don't worry. You'll find yourself
naked in the snowy field...

1426
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,690
in 10 minutes.

1427
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,690
Without wearing pants.

1428
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,360
- The staff didn't tell me that.
- Reporter Yang Se Chan.

1429
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,420
Yes, this is Yang Se Chan.

1430
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,900
- Tell us the next news.
- Up next,

1431
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,840
Ji Suk Jin is rolling around
in the snow with no pants.

1432
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,070
(Sighing)

1433
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,940
It is assumed that he took off
his pants of his own accord.

1434
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,230
That's all.

1435
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,750
Are there any signs
that someone else did it to him?

1436
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,300
No, there's none.

1437
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,050
With caramels stuck in there...

1438
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,570
It sounded...

1439
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:04,820
like it was actually happening.

1440
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,610
- When you're ready...
- Hurry up and cut the string.

1441
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:08,110
I choose number five.

1442
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,710
- Number 5?
- He chose number 5.

1443
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,360
- I'll have to give you 42 caramels.
- Yes.

1444
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,230
Well, I have no choice.

1445
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,280
- 21 caramels.
- Okay.

1446
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,150
I'll clear my debt
with what I earn this time.

1447
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,150
- Okay.
- In the next round...

1448
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:19,590
- The interest is four, right?
- Yes.

1449
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,170
(What could be the fate
of line number 5?)

1450
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,940
(It was a fake line!)

1451
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,940
Okay!

1452
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,130
(As no balloon popped,
Suk Jin keeps the 21 caramels.)

1453
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,380
- I get caramels too, right?
- Okay!

1454
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,440
(Relieved)

1455
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,900
(He beat the odds
and picked the fake line.)

1456
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,170
I can't believe no balloons popped.

1457
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,550
- I think the staff members...
- That's amazing.

1458
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,520
I think the staff members
find it weird.

1459
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,980
- What? Why?
- Why didn't any of them pop?

1460
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,150
Was one of them supposed to pop?

1461
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,750
- But... Hold on.
- Okay.

1462
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,320
- It's weird.
- Can you all stand up?

1463
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,820
- Why?
- Something went wrong.

1464
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,150
Did something go wrong?

1465
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,030
(They're standing up carefully
as the staff asked.)

1466
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,230
(Standing awkwardly)

1467
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,860
- Are you grabbing the line?
- Please step aside.

1468
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,170
- Pardon?
- Please step aside.

1469
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,170
Move to the side, please.

1470
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,190
- Move to the side.
- I bet something went wrong.

1471
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,770
- You're holding the line, right?
- Hang on.

1472
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,070
(He's holding the line?)

1473
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,900
- Right. He's stepping on it.
- Move your foot.

1474
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:08,280
(As soon as he moved his foot,
he got splashed by water.)

1475
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,940
(His underhanded foot skill
shocked everyone.)

1476
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,190
- Gosh, seriously.
- Gosh.

1477
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,550
- Oh, yes!
- That brat.

1478
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,980
- He's a swindler.
- Let's go.

1479
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,190
(He stepped on the line
before the line was cut.)

1480
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,920
(When the line he was stepping on
was cut,)

1481
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,530
(he maintained his poker face.)

1482
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,500
- He's a swindler.
- Gosh.

1483
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,420
- What a swindler.
- What a swindler.

1484
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,320
- He was stepping on the line.
- No wonder, something felt weird.

1485
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,340
- That swindler.
- It was impossible to happen.

1486
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,170
His balloon was supposed to pop
when I cut line number five, right?

1487
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,570
That punk is a swindler.

1488
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,980
- Gosh, that swindler.
- He was stepping on the line.

1489
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,840
Can't we report him to the police?

1490
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,440
- Shouldn't we report him?
- Shouldn't he be arrested?

1491
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,550
This is really serious.

1492
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,380
- He cheated.
- Give me 40 caramels.

1493
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,590
- I mean, 42 caramels.
- I owe him 42 caramels?

1494
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,090
2, 4, 6, 8...

1495
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,210
Give me one more.

1496
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,590
- Congratulations, Suk Jin.
- Have one.

1497
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,460
- Thank you.
- You shouldn't give them away.

1498
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,690
- Why? Why?
- Give me all five of them.

1499
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,150
Kwang Soo paid
the association fee too.

1500
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,070
- What kind of chairman he is?
- Give me...

1501
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,320
- Give me three more caramels.
- He's like a hunter.

1502
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,530
- Why?
- He's like a hunter.

1503
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,270
- You see...
- You should pay the interest.

1504
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,530
- The interest? Four, right?
- I'll help you out...

1505
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,500
- if you struggle. Don't worry.
- Here are four caramels.

1506
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,630
You should pay the principal too.

1507
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,230
- Pardon?
- The principal of 20 caramels.

1508
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:13,050
- Should I give you that too?
- Of course.

1509
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,380
(He forgot about the principal.)

1510
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,840
- You must repay what you borrowed.
- What are you trying to do?

1511
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,860
You want to pay only the interest?
Not the principal?

1512
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,880
He doesn't want to pay it.

1513
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,960
Here you go.

1514
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:26,360
Gosh. I forgot about the principal.

1515
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,460
Gosh, seriously.

1516
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:28,630
It's neck and neck.

1517
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,800
- It'll end when one of them is out.
- Okay.

1518
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,030
I'll go all-in,
but I don't know how many I have.

1519
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,030
Please!

1520
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,170
(He cut the line he chose
with his heart throbbing.)

1521
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,300
None popped.

1522
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:39,670
- None popped.
- Gosh.

1523
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,210
Decide whether or not you want to
move out of the way.

1524
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,610
- I won't.
- I'll move.

1525
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,170
- You'll move?
- Yes.

1526
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,210
It's taut.

1527
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:48,340
- Oh, boy.
- Okay!

1528
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,320
Kwang Soo gained 26 caramels,
and Suk Jin lost 26 caramels.

1529
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,340
And Jong Kook lost 13 caramels.

1530
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:55,780
Good game.

1531
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,730
- Nice.
- We'll begin the second round.

1532
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,730
- Now?
- Yes.

1533
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,530
Se Chan, Haha, and So Min.
In this order.

1534
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,420
I'm getting nervous somehow.

1535
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,770
I'm the 1st one to go. I'll bet 20.

1536
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,030
Betting 20 is normal.

1537
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,030
- Personally...
- I would bet 30 at the start.

1538
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,960
- You should go all-in.
- You should've bet all you had.

1539
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,030
- Exactly.
- You're a man.

1540
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:12,360
- I choose number nine.
- You should stay.

1541
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,670
- Okay.
- Go, Yang Kka Chi.

1542
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,340
- Please!
- Go, Yang Kka Chi!

1543
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,440
You will all stay, right?

1544
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,050
- Yes, we'll stay.
- Is this number nine?

1545
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,800
There's no way any of them will pop.

1546
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,480
- Exactly.
- Right?

1547
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,280
- You can't move if you bet 30.
- I thought the same but failed.

1548
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,280
1, 2, 3.

1549
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,820
(So Min's balloon popped.)

1550
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,650
(Yang Kka Chi succeeded
in attacking.)

1551
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,250
- It ends if I make hers pop too.
- I wish I had gone all-in.

1552
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,460
The balloon over this seat popped
in the previous round too.

1553
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,300
You should give him 40 caramels
as he bet 20.

1554
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,630
I have only 18 caramels.
Can I get a loan?

1555
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:44,000
- You have 18?
- Yes.

1556
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,030
You shouldn't have tried to
become the chairperson.

1557
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,630
We'll lend you 30 caramels.

1558
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,480
- 30 caramels?
- They charge a 20 percent interest.

1559
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,150
You have to pay 2 in interest
for every 10 in principal.

1560
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,210
It's ridiculous.

1561
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,340
Which line should I pick?

1562
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,820
Excuse me for a second.

1563
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,380
- Here.
- Well...

1564
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,280
- Mr. Yu.
- Se Chan.

1565
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,860
I'll give you five caramels now.

1566
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,090
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1567
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,150
You pay the fee
for the association's sake.

1568
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,920
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

1569
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,630
You guys have experience.
What should I do?

1570
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,300
Haha, how many bullets do you have?

1571
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,920
- I have 30 now.
- 30?

1572
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,500
Why would you call it a bullet?

1573
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,860
It's a caramel.

1574
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,460
- It's a caramel.
- Oh, right.

1575
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,670
- I have 30 caramels.
- Why would he call it a bullet?

1576
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,070
- Don't bet too many at the start.
- Is it like professional lingo?

1577
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,110
But one balloon popped.

1578
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,650
- It increased the probability.
- Your turn will come again.

1579
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,500
- Right.
- Bet a large amount next time.

1580
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,520
Then shall I bet just 10?

1581
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,440
- You should bet 30 caramels now.
- That's too risky.

1582
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,420
There's a 20 percent chance
your balloon will pop.

1583
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,960
I would bet 30 if I were you.

1584
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,250
- Okay. I'll bet 20 like he did.
- Good. You should bet that much.

1585
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,320
(He mustered up the courage.)

1586
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,820
(He decided to bet 20 caramels.)

1587
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,820
Number one.

1588
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:42,960
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

1589
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,170
Please don't let it be my balloon!

1590
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,000
I think number one is yours.

1591
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,270
I have a strong hunch.

1592
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,940
Please.

1593
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,770
- I can't change it now, right?
- That's right.

1594
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,670
(You will lose 40 caramels
if you get hit with a balloon.)

1595
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,170
(Whose line is number 1?)

1596
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:01,380
So Min is in danger.

1597
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,480
Will it be me again?

1598
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,780
If it's me,
I will be incredibly unlucky.

1599
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,590
- It can't be you.
- What a way to start 2021, right?

1600
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:08,780
For goodness' sake.

1601
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,250
(An unlucky man)

1602
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,250
- There you go.
- Nice!

1603
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,280
This is the worst way
to start the year.

1604
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,650
I am completely broke!

1605
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,460
What did I tell you?

1606
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,400
- I told you to wait for a round.
- I told you.

1607
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
- Seriously.
- Why didn't you listen?

1608
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
I had a hunch.

1609
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,570
This is the worst way
to start the year.

1610
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,770
I told you.

1611
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,900
I told you to wait for a round.

1612
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,300
- I had a hunch.
- Why didn't you listen?

1613
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,900
Seriously.

1614
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,750
I can't believe this happened to me.

1615
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,570
- Hey.
- Give me 40 caramels.

1616
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:36,750
- I told you that it's yours.
- 40 caramels?

1617
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,380
I told you to wait for a round.

1618
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:41,420
- He is so unlucky.
- Seriously.

1619
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,190
2021.

1620
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,960
- 10.
- I will loan you 10 caramels.

1621
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,090
You need to lend me more.

1622
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,250
I plan to bet everything
on the next round.

1623
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,190
Lend me as many as you can.

1624
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:52,400
- How many can you lend me?
- Haha.

1625
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,630
Haha, get a hold of yourself.
Haha! Haha!

1626
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,170
Let go of me, you jerk!

1627
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,840
Haha!

1628
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,400
Let go of me, you jerk!
Let me play one more round!

1629
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,530
Haha, please don't do this!

1630
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,710
- Come on.
- Give me the caramels.

1631
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,780
Haha! Get a hold of yourself!

1632
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,420
- Give me the caramels.
- You can receive them over there.

1633
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,710
- 40 caramels.
- Hey.

1634
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,380
We won't be able to change
the chairperson...

1635
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,380
if we go broke.

1636
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,860
- Give me 50 caramels.
- We need to save them up for later.

1637
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,460
It looks like I will continue to be
the chairman.

1638
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,250
We won't be able to change
the chairperson.

1639
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,650
It looks like I will continue to be
the chairman.

1640
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,230
This is So Min's chance.

1641
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,030
I will bet nine caramels.

1642
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,900
Would someone lend me one caramel?

1643
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,800
So Min, I will lend you 10 caramels.

1644
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,730
If you win caramels, give me some.

1645
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,800
- Okay, okay.
- Let's bet five caramels each.

1646
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,900
- Forget it.
- Listen, everyone.

1647
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,110
As the chairman, I will tell you
that you aren't allowed...

1648
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,550
- to make investments.
- No?

1649
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,420
- Why not?
- Why not?

1650
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,940
It's a common practice.

1651
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,920
- It isn't allowed.
- We need to replace him.

1652
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,520
- It's a common practice.
- It isn't allowed.

1653
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,190
Let's collect 20 caramels.

1654
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,780
- It isn't allowed.
- I only have nine caramels.

1655
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,150
Take out a loan then.

1656
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,190
I have 9 caramels left
from the loan of 30 caramels.

1657
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,280
- Did you take out a loan already?
- Yes.

1658
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,690
Had it been the last round...

1659
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,500
- So Min.
- I am done.

1660
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,630
So Min, I have caramels
from the association.

1661
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,030
Seriously.

1662
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,300
(Rummaging)

1663
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,000
I will give you nine caramels.

1664
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
- Nine caramels?
- Thank you.

1665
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,880
If you win more caramels,
pay the association fee.

1666
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,400
- Move out of the way.
- Of course. Thank you.

1667
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,980
What?

1668
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,210
I can't believe you.

1669
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,670
When I wanted to invest...

1670
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,020
These caramels belong
to the association.

1671
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,320
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

1672
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,780
Didn't you take these caramels
from us?

1673
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,780
- Hold on.
- Give me back five caramels.

1674
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,980
Didn't you take these caramels
from us?

1675
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,460
- Hurry up.
- Hold on.

1676
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,480
- I mean...
- This is absolutely ridiculous.

1677
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,690
I turned in five caramels earlier.

1678
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:28,400
Let's change the chairperson!

1679
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,590
- Hold on.
- You didn't let me invest.

1680
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,000
- Seriously.
- Why didn't you let me invest?

1681
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,090
You acted all benevolent
with our caramels.

1682
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:35,190
Listen.

1683
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,270
You can do the same thing
when you become the chairperson.

1684
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:39,610
- Listen.
- Is it so hard to understand?

1685
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:40,900
- Let's change it.
- What?

1686
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,170
- "It"?
- It.

1687
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,840
- "Let's change it"?
- Hold on. "It"?

1688
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,380
- "It"?
- What's wrong with "It"?

1689
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,750
- "It"?
- Grab him!

1690
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,780
(Grab him!)

1691
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,210
- What?
- "It"?

1692
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,280
Hey, aren't you upset?

1693
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,980
I will beat him up.

1694
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,650
- "It"?
- Be careful.

1695
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,190
- Be careful what you say.
- All right.

1696
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,690
- Don't call him "It".
- I am still the chairman.

1697
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,880
All right.

1698
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,360
- Gosh, this won't do.
- I will give you...

1699
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,150
nine caramels.

1700
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,460
20 caramels went in.

1701
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,360
If I fail again,
I will have to roll in the snow.

1702
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,920
Number two will be a good choice.

1703
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,840
I will pop the number 11.

1704
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,460
- Number 11.
- Number 11.

1705
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,630
If you pop your balloon,
I won't have a chance.

1706
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,940
It's pulled tight. Here I go.

1707
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,210
Here I go.

1708
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,800
Get up as soon as you cut it.

1709
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,020
- Yes!
- Okay!

1710
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,020
(She succeeded to have her revenge.)

1711
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,360
(So Min acquired
twice the caramels she bet.)

1712
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,650
- That was incredible.
- Nice, nice.

1713
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:34,730
Congratulations.

1714
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:35,920
- Sir.
- All right.

1715
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,800
It was my idea,

1716
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,500
- so please give me some caramels.
- All right. Take a seat.

1717
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,500
You need to turn in 40 caramels.

1718
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,900
- 40 caramels?
- Yes.

1719
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,300
The five caramels I turned in...
Jae Suk, hold on.

1720
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,610
- Did you see that?
- Give me back the five caramels.

1721
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,900
- Give me back the five caramels.
- Why?

1722
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,670
I am broke. Jae Suk.

1723
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,780
- Five caramels.
- I will take care of it...

1724
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,420
once I get back what I invested.

1725
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,110
I don't have any caramels left!

1726
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,190
- Suk Jin, you earned a lot, right?
- No, I didn't.

1727
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,480
No? You did, right?

1728
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,920
- I am in the negative.
- No, I didn't. Jong Kook did.

1729
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,250
- Did you earn a lot?
- No.

1730
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:09,650
Who took all the caramels?

1731
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,500
Four caramels.

1732
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,900
Five caramels.

1733
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,800
Did the chairman take
all the caramels?

1734
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,840
- What?
- No one profited.

1735
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,800
- Everyone is in the negative.
- What kind of a game is this?

1736
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,800
- Who took all the caramels?
- What?

1737
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,940
- Seriously.
- Jae Suk took all of them.

1738
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,210
Who profited?

1739
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,550
After each round,
you will see that no one profited.

1740
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,550
- That's how it is.
- It's so fascinating.

1741
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:30,570
Only the production crew
and I are profiting.

1742
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,610
- Why is the chairman...
- You need to turn the tables.

1743
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,190
- 20 caramels?
- Se Chan.

1744
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,280
- Yes?
- Take out a loan.

1745
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,920
Take out a loan of 20 caramels
and bet everything.

1746
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,380
Can I take out a loan now?

1747
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,150
- Of course.
- I will take out a loan.

1748
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,550
Bet everything.

1749
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,270
How big of a loan can I take out?

1750
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,530
How many caramels?

1751
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,900
20 caramels.

1752
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,400
Kwang Soo will stand surety for me.

1753
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,800
- 20 caramels.
- Stand surety for me.

1754
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,530
- Is that a thing?
- Give me 10 more caramels.

1755
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:54,900
If Se Chan fails to pay back,
you must pay back twice the amount.

1756
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,880
- Kwang Soo.
- For goodness' sake.

1757
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,400
You can get a loan of 20 caramels.

1758
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,300
- Okay. 20 caramels.
- Bet all of them.

1759
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,940
- Bet 24 caramels.
- I will bet 40 caramels.

1760
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,440
Excuse me.

1761
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:06,480
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

1762
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,520
How many caramels will you give me
if I invest eight caramels?

1763
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,590
You can't make...

1764
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,250
- a personal investment.
- You can't do that.

1765
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,750
Only caramels from the association
can be invested.

1766
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,730
- Caramels from the association.
- We need a new chairperson!

1767
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:17,000
Suk Jin, I will give you 3 caramels
if you give me 8 caramels.

1768
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,030
No, thank you.

1769
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,670
- I won't give you any then.
- Sit down.

1770
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:22,770
All right. Which line will it be?

1771
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,900
Which line made my balloon pop
earlier?

1772
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,530
Which numbers remain?

1773
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,380
Number 1... No, numbers 2, 3, 5...

1774
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,650
You were number 11.

1775
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,750
It would be best...

1776
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,110
if Se Chan pops
Haha or So Min's balloon.

1777
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,420
That's right. It would be best.

1778
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,110
- Something in the middle.
- No, no.

1779
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,920
- No.
- The numbers go up to 12, right?

1780
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,690
- Okay. Something in the middle.
- Let's have another round.

1781
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:43,820
Out of the numbers...

1782
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,360
(He sticks out his mouth
and decides on a number.)

1783
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,230
- We should have another round.
- Number six.

1784
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,250
There you go.

1785
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:50,400
- Number six is dangerous.
- It's a good number.

1786
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:51,730
- It's in the middle.
- A balloon will pop.

1787
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,460
If I were you...

1788
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,300
- I hope it isn't my balloon.
- Please.

1789
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:56,940
(What will be the fate
of line number 6?)

1790
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,940
Two.

1791
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,460
(What will be the fate
of line number 6?)

1792
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,840
(He got a fake line.)

1793
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,210
It isn't half bad.
Be glad you took out a loan.

1794
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,710
- That's right. It isn't half bad.
- See?

1795
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,110
- 20 caramels.
- 40 caramels.

1796
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,050
He got a lot of caramels.

1797
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,210
- Do I get all of these?
- Of course.

1798
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,320
He doesn't know the rules well.

1799
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,280
He became rich.

1800
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,090
(1 caramel drops.)

1801
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,820
(Picking up)

1802
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,860
He went all-in.

1803
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,420
16 caramels.

1804
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:23,030
Hey, beggar!

1805
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,300
(Hey, beggar!)

1806
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,090
Bring it over here.
Bring it over here.

1807
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:29,500
How could you call me a beggar
just because I don't have caramels?

1808
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,500
Bring it over here.

1809
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,130
How could you call me a beggar
just because I don't have caramels?

1810
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,670
Bring me the caramel you picked up.

1811
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,800
This is the world of caramels.

1812
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,500
You said it so awkwardly.

1813
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,480
I am proud of him.

1814
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,050
That's how you do it.
That's how you bet.

1815
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,820
Who is next?

1816
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,880
- So Min.
- Okay.

1817
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,110
- So Min, bet everything.
- I will go all-in.

1818
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,880
- She needs to go all-in.
- I will go all-in.

1819
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,550
You can't help but go all-in
when you play this game.

1820
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:53,880
It's highly unlikely...

1821
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,300
that I will be terribly unlucky
and pop my own balloon.

1822
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,170
(In that case)

1823
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,630
So Min, I will give you
some caramels from the association.

1824
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,670
- Really?
- It's a dangerous investment.

1825
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,570
Let's do this.

1826
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,710
- Really?
- Okay.

1827
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,210
I don't know how many there are.

1828
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:11,300
This way, all of us can win.

1829
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,400
- Don't you agree?
- Jae Suk, don't bet so many.

1830
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,900
- Let's bet everything.
- Take some out.

1831
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,020
Hold on. Hey, are those yours?

1832
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,590
These aren't your caramels.

1833
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:20,980
- Hold on.
- How many are there?

1834
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,650
Get lost, you jerk.

1835
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:23,920
Hold on.

1836
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,630
This is the association fund.

1837
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,030
- Don't act all benevolent...
- You are embezzling.

1838
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:29,190
- with the association fund.
- Listen.

1839
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,270
If you need help, throw a caramel.

1840
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,300
Then I will take care of the matter.

1841
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:36,400
He is a problem solver.

1842
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:38,800
- I have a question.
- Throw a caramel.

1843
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,670
Here you go.

1844
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,900
- These are mine.
- How many are there?

1845
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,130
These are mine.

1846
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:44,670
15 caramels.

1847
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:47,110
I will add these to 15 caramels.
I will go all-in.

1848
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,420
This has to go well.

1849
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,440
- Number five.
- I think a balloon will pop.

1850
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,190
- Someone's balloon will pop.
- Of course.

1851
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:54,880
- Guys.
- The odds are good.

1852
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,020
- Number five.
- This could be interesting.

1853
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,820
I invested the caramels
at the right time.

1854
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,530
It was a good decision.

1855
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,630
- Here I go.
- You invested at the right time.

1856
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,190
- I will dodge.
- Will you dodge?

1857
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:05,630
- But So Min is quite unlucky.
- Will he dodge?

1858
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,630
I will dodge. If I get hit,
I pay twice the amount.

1859
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,300
- But...
- I might not get hit, right?

1860
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,300
If you don't get hit,
you will pay the exact amount.

1861
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,530
- Let's go.
- Here I go.

1862
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,710
Someone's balloon will pop.

1863
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,730
It will be interesting.

1864
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,170
(Will it be Haha,
the one who dodged?)

1865
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,750
(Will it be Se Chan,
the one who didn't dodge?)

1866
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,420
(Will it be So Min herself?)

1867
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,040
In that case, the two of you...

1868
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,690
(Is it Se Chan again?)

1869
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:37,610
(So Min is Se Chan's killer.)

1870
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,880
- Yes!
- Yes!

1871
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,750
- That was incredible.
- Nice.

1872
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,190
(The chairman's investment
was successful as well.)

1873
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,750
For goodness' sake! What is this?

1874
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,860
This is a good result
for all the members.

1875
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,900
Thank you.
It was a good investment.

1876
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,130
(The caramels go
into the chairman's pockets.)

1877
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:53,290
Who will play the last round?

1878
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:54,500
- Me! Let me play again.
- There is an opening...

1879
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,400
- for one person.
- Me!

1880
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,940
Haha doesn't have any caramels.

1881
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:01,040
Let me take out a loan.

1882
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,080
You should stop.

1883
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,650
Please let me play one more round!

1884
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:06,150
One more round!

1885
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:07,170
- Listen.
- Get a hold of yourself!

1886
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,540
One more round!

1887
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,980
The association has
a lot of caramels, so...

1888
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,520
Please let me play one more round.

1889
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,460
- One more round!
- I could go again.

1890
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:18,060
- Excuse me, Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

1891
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:19,600
- Drag out the two of them.
- Okay.

1892
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,830
Come here.

1893
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:21,860
One more round!

1894
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,060
- You jerk!
- One more round!

1895
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:24,460
Stop it.

1896
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:26,440
I had over 100 caramels.

1897
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,000
You should know when to stop.

1898
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,170
Do you want to play a round?

1899
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:30,360
Yes, I do.

1900
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,040
This is insane.

1901
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,730
I really want to play a round.

1902
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:35,500
- I will do it.
- I want to send him...

1903
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,170
- out to the snow.
- I will do it.

1904
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,170
- He should experience the cold.
- I really want to play a round.

1905
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:41,350
- What's wrong with you?
- I will bet my life on this round.

1906
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,480
- Come here.
- Okay.

1907
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,420
Come here. I will give you a chance.

1908
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,980
Let's do this.

1909
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,630
I will bet my life.

1910
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:51,630
I want to play one more round.

1911
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:53,750
I will take out a loan
and bet everything.

1912
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,020
Going all-in is the way to go.

1913
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,770
- The odds are the best.
- The odds are the best.

1914
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:00,270
I will go all-in.

1915
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,670
- The first try is the best.
- Yes.

1916
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,500
- He can come up with a rule, right?
- That's right.

1917
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:08,210
- You haven't made one yet, right?
- I haven't made one yet.

1918
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,610
- You can go twice that way, right?
- He can do what he wants.

1919
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:12,040
Can he make a rule...

1920
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,420
- after something occurs?
- He can't do that.

1921
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:14,810
He can say, "Let's redo it."

1922
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,310
- Can he say that?
- I knew it.

1923
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,210
- He has an advantage.
- What?

1924
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:20,290
Can he say, "Let's redo it"?

1925
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,130
- That's...
- Let's go.

1926
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:23,580
(Round 3 begins.)

1927
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,250
He poured them in.

1928
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,290
(Both Ji Hyo and Jae Suk had
1 balloon popped.)

1929
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:27,730
I will use the association fund
as well.

1930
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,290
- Why would you use that?
- It's the association fund.

1931
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:30,920
There is nothing wrong
with using the association fund.

1932
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,690
- It's an investment.
- It's the association fund.

1933
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,210
How many caramels do you have...

1934
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:36,670
as the association fund?

1935
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,580
- There must be about 50 caramels.
- There are a lot.

1936
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:41,170
Can't you reveal
how many caramels there are?

1937
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:42,380
I can reveal it.

1938
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,540
- I haven't used any of them yet.
- Okay.

1939
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,270
Everyone,

1940
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,540
I will bet these caramels.

1941
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,190
I will use the chairman's chance...

1942
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,980
- and make a rule.
- Really?

1943
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,080
Will he ask
for twice the amount he bet?

1944
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,560
(He is as powerful as ever.
Which rule will he ask for?)

1945
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,960
- Can you tell me the numbers?
- Yes.

1946
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,270
(Does he mean the numbers
behind the balloons?)

1947
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:03,330
The numbers?

1948
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,500
Can he do that?

1949
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,940
This is ridiculous!

1950
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:08,270
What is this?

1951
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:10,630
(The chairman's power
makes their jaws drop.)

1952
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,230
- What is this?
- The numbers?

1953
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,380
What do you mean?

1954
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:15,080
It's the chairperson's rule.

1955
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,980
The chairperson has too much power.

1956
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,710
He has too much power.

1957
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,690
(Jae Suk gets the numbers
from the production crew.)

1958
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:23,810
(He saw all the numbers
as the chairman.)

1959
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:24,920
He will remain the chairman.

1960
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,310
(He knows what could happen.)

1961
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:29,730
I am torn. If they dodge...

1962
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,900
This is a match of the brains.
A psychological game.

1963
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,860
You have to put on your poker face.

1964
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,060
This is hard.

1965
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,900
Will he get Ji Hyo or Suk Jin?

1966
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,440
Will he end the game?

1967
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,360
I decided whether or not
I will dodge.

1968
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:47,080
One of them will end up in the snow.
This is bad.

1969
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,210
(44 caramels are on the line.
What will be Jae Suk's choice?)

1970
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:51,980
In that case,

1971
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,810
I will skip this turn.

1972
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:55,310
- What?
- I choose number seven.

1973
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,110
"I will skip this turn"?

1974
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:59,520
("I will skip this turn"?)

1975
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,380
- My goodness.
- That's something we didn't expect.

1976
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,980
- This time,
- "I will skip this turn"?

1977
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,360
I will skip the turn.

1978
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,420
- Since Kim Grand Award is...
- You will skip the turn?

1979
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,520
- You will skip the turn?
- Yes.

1980
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,060
I will skip the turn.

1981
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,190
- He is playing a trick.
- Shall I go ahead and cut a line?

1982
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,360
No. Hold on.

1983
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:14,190
Will you listen to him or...

1984
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,810
That means he won't cut
one of our lines.

1985
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:17,830
That's right.

1986
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,130
But...

1987
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,350
I think he will cut
one of our lines.

1988
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:24,000
I will dodge!

1989
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,670
He said he will skip the turn.

1990
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:27,770
- Number seven.
- I will win.

1991
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:28,880
Ji Hyo, aren't you going to dodge?

1992
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,040
(If Suk Jin's balloon doesn't pop,
he must pay 44 caramels.)

1993
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:31,310
I...

1994
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,080
It's too late now.

1995
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:34,920
1, 2...

1996
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,460
(Ji Hyo decided not to dodge.
What did Jae Suk's words mean?)

1997
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:38,690
1, 2...

1998
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:40,630
(Silent)

1999
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:42,060
- Did he really skip the turn?
- He skipped the turn.

2000
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,230
- Did he really skip the turn?
- He skipped the turn.

2001
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,500
(I told you that I will do it.)

2002
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,560
Suk Jin needs to pay up, right?

2003
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,730
- Good job.
- He needs to pay up.

2004
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:51,130
Did you really skip the turn?

2005
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:52,830
- Good job.
- All right.

2006
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,850
I skipped the turn.

2007
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,980
It's like playing rock...

2008
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:00,040
- after saying, "I will play rock."
- I am amazed.

2009
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,110
- Suk Jin got fooled.
- He caught 2 birds with 1 stone.

2010
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,420
- Suk Jin got fooled.
- He won caramels...

2011
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,480
while Suk Jin lost caramels.

2012
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,250
Suk Jin's line still remains.

2013
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,310
- It still remains.
- That's right.

2014
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,920
Why didn't you believe my words?

2015
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,130
Jae Suk, should we throw him
into the snow?

2016
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,690
Not yet. The game is ongoing.

2017
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:16,190
He might turn the tables.

2018
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:18,290
I was winning.

2019
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,830
What is Suk Jin going to do?

2020
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,190
This is...

2021
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:24,110
This is incredible.

2022
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,610
- "I will skip this turn."
- The game is still ongoing.

2023
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:29,000
- I will give you two caramels.
- Why?

2024
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,540
Please give me a number.

2025
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:32,380
He can't do that.

2026
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,350
(She begs for a number
with 2 caramels and a smile.)

2027
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:36,920
- She wants to know her number.
- He can't do that.

2028
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,560
- I am sorry.
- Jae Suk knows the numbers.

2029
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,210
- Jae Suk knows the numbers.
- Jeoktoma.

2030
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:41,480
- I am sorry.
- I will give you two more caramels.

2031
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,650
- He can't do that.
- I can't do that.

2032
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,360
- She is cute.
- She can't do that.

2033
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,360
- She is cute.
- It's understandable.

2034
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,020
- I am sorry.
- You had the right approach.

2035
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,130
My goodness.

2036
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,290
But...

2037
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:51,460
I...

2038
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,460
- 10 caramels?
- 10 caramels. Hold on.

2039
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:54,600
- 10 caramels?
- Decide on the number first.

2040
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,310
It's my business.

2041
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,000
She got mad at Suk Jin.

2042
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,110
- It's your business.
- Yes.

2043
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:02,080
I just got absorbed in the game.

2044
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,110
(The two of them become
overly sensitive.)

2045
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,110
Would you recommend me a number?

2046
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:05,770
He can't do that.

2047
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:07,250
Number five.

2048
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,310
- Number five?
- Yes.

2049
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:10,290
Number five? I will dodge.

2050
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,560
This is a psychological game.

2051
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:14,650
I need to use my brain.

2052
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,480
It will be unbelievable
if Ji Hyo's balloon pops.

2053
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,600
- I think your balloon will pop.
- It will be okay if it doesn't pop.

2054
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,690
What?

2055
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:26,000
She is out.

2056
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:27,690
She is out.

2057
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:29,830
For goodness' sake.

2058
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:31,770
Ji Hyo will end up in the snow.

2059
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,770
- Hey.
- No, no!

2060
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:35,980
(There is a place
for the broke gamblers.)

2061
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,210
She is getting sent
to the snowy field.

2062
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,150
- Gosh, Ji Hyo.
- No.

2063
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:40,440
Come on.

2064
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,850
(Ji Hyo gets dragged
to the snowy field.)

2065
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,940
Stop it. I am in the snow already.

2066
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,190
(Rolling)

2067
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,750
- Go.
- Get lost.

2068
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,420
- Get lost.
- Don't come back here.

2069
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:52,130
Let me join you guys.

2070
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,400
- Get lost.
- Let me join you guys.

2071
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:56,100
She rolled in the snow.

2072
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,670
(The brothers come back
after finishing the task.)

2073
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:00,060
Gosh, I didn't know.

2074
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:02,770
- I need a bigger bag.
- Jae Suk.

2075
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:04,400
- Put some in the safe.
- This is no joke.

2076
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,580
We need to change the chairperson.

2077
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,710
We need to change the chairperson
and use the caramels.

2078
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:11,850
I put some caramels
in the proposal box.

2079
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,110
- Me too.
- Darn it.

2080
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,150
The thing is,

2081
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:17,810
all of us have
only a handful of caramels.

2082
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:19,480
- They are our tear-soaked caramels.
- I know.

2083
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,210
- We need to take his caramels.
- It's better to switch it.

2084
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:22,580
Guys.

2085
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:23,730
- Yes?
- Yes?

2086
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:25,790
Are you trying to get
a new chairperson?

2087
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:27,400
- No, no.
- No. What are you saying?

2088
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,160
- Of course not.
- I am very satisfied.

2089
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,230
I respect you.

2090
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:32,100
They have gathered around...

2091
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,570
- to come up with a scheme.
- That's right.

2092
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,830
- There is no other explanation.
- No, no.

2093
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,240
- The first mission is complete.
- Okay.

2094
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:40,000
Let's check the proposal box
before the second mission.

2095
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:43,450
Dealer, please announce
the number of caramels.

2096
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:46,670
(If there are 20 caramels,
the chairperson will be replaced.)

2097
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,280
(How many caramels
are in the proposal box?)

2098
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,450
In the proposal box,

2099
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,920
(Please!)

2100
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,580
there are 20 caramels.

2101
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:59,290
Did you put in caramels?

2102
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,420
20 caramels?

2103
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:02,270
- Really?
- Who put them in?

2104
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:03,900
- Exactly 20 caramels?
- Who put them in?

2105
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:05,460
Who put them in?

2106
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:08,330
(Jae Suk's tyrannical behaviors
upset the younger members.)

2107
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:09,940
I will put in five caramels.

2108
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:12,500
(So Min put in 5 caramels.)

2109
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,040
(Kwang Soo put in 5 caramels.)

2110
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,410
(Se Chan put in 5 caramels.)

2111
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:21,850
(So Min put in 10 caramels.)

2112
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,690
Since there are
20 caramels in total,

2113
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,120
the chairperson will write down
the five candidates.

2114
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,920
- Okay.
- When did everyone turn them in?

2115
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:32,730
The former chairperson will put down
five names...

2116
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:34,750
in the roulette with eight slots.

2117
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,570
- Trust me and write my name.
- You can trust me too.

2118
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:41,070
The new chairperson should be
someone without many caramels.

2119
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:42,370
I don't have any caramels.

2120
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:43,570
I will write down Ji Hyo's name.

2121
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:44,740
I don't have any caramels.

2122
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,170
- Remember me.
- Jae Suk.

2123
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:47,630
- Jae Suk.
- Think of me as a parrot.

2124
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,150
Jae Suk, earlier...

2125
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:50,370
You should write my name down,

2126
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,570
don't you think?

2127
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,870
Listen.

2128
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,320
You know how much I supported you.

2129
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,850
I know that, but...

2130
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:59,360
His tone is too rebellious.

2131
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,860
Okay. I will write your name.

2132
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,160
- You are making it hard.
- You should write it.

2133
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,580
You won the Grand Award.

2134
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,600
- You supported me well.
- That's right.

2135
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,600
- Jae Suk, I am the one...
- At the beginning...

2136
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,420
who supported you from the start.

2137
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,370
- I will write your name, Se Chan.
- Okay!

2138
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,990
Kwang Soo, talk to him. Okay.

2139
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,460
- The thing is,
- You know what I did.

2140
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:16,030
I supported you from the start.

2141
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:18,070
- I don't have many caramels.
- I am begging you.

2142
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,440
Kwang Soo put caramels
in the proposal box.

2143
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,280
Come on.

2144
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,980
You put caramels
in the proposal box.

2145
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,480
- He did that.
- Me?

2146
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,520
- Me?
- He put a lot of caramels.

2147
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,320
- I didn't do that.
- I received a tip-off...

2148
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,520
that you put in caramels
in the proposal box.

2149
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,280
- I can't write your name.
- That's right.

2150
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,950
- Isn't that right?
- So, I...

2151
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,820
I got a loan, so I don't have
any money.

2152
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,530
I swear that I saw So Min put it in.

2153
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,320
- I also saw Se Chan do it.
- It's not me.

2154
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,420
- I don't have any.
- Okay.

2155
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,100
- There are five people.
- Okay.

2156
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,490
- Is that it?
- Let's go.

2157
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,490
- I'm satisfied with one spot.
- It was done fairly.

2158
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,940
(The nomination for the next
chairperson is complete.)

2159
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:48,310
- You can only do it one time.
- Let's do it once.

2160
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,630
But you...

2161
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:53,610
Did you put a caramel in
but didn't get in the candidates?

2162
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,410
- Did you put it in?
- But...

2163
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,700
I put it in.

2164
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,650
He hid it.

2165
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:00,820
- I paid all the association fees.
- Okay.

2166
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:02,350
- Okay.
- But...

2167
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:04,040
I didn't gain anything.

2168
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,490
Okay, let's go then.

2169
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:07,280
- Let's go.
- I'm going to start.

2170
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,860
- Who will succeed me...
- Please...

2171
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,420
as the next association chairman?

2172
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,960
Let's go.

2173
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:17,920
- Let's go.
- I just want to do it once.

2174
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:20,490
- Honestly, I have no greed.
- I...

2175
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:22,370
(The roulette is spinning.)

2176
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:23,570
But the association chairman is...

2177
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:24,870
- The chairman is really powerful.
- The chairman is...

2178
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,000
- really powerful.
- The chairman has strong authority.

2179
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,330
Do you have any objections?

2180
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:30,070
It's me.

2181
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,480
- Kim Grand Award.
- Kim Grand Award.

2182
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,910
(The next association chairman is
Kim Grand Award.)

2183
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:37,740
- Kim Grand Award.
- Kim Grand Award.

2184
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,820
- Don't do it.
- Come here.

2185
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:41,280
- Kim Grand Award.
- Yes.

2186
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:44,030
- I made you the next chairman.
- This is...

2187
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:45,360
I didn't...

2188
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,790
Go away!

2189
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,770
- He's mistreating you.
- Yes.

2190
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:49,960
- Kim Grand Award.
- Yes.

2191
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,790
- I just touched him.
- Today...

2192
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:54,270
- This is the world I wanted.
- I said I didn't want anything...

2193
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:55,500
- Kim Grand Award.
- Gosh.

2194
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,910
- Kim Grand Award.
- I'll take him away.

2195
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,240
- It would have been me...
- What are you doing?

2196
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,170
- if it stopped one step further.
- He's out.

2197
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:02,410
Who is that guy?

2198
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:03,610
What does he do for a living?

2199
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,280
You disloyal punks!

2200
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:08,240
Let me go. You disloyal punks!

2201
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:10,650
- Roll him around.
- You disloyal punks!

2202
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,690
- Hey.
- That's enough. Let's go.

2203
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:13,820
- Hey.
- Let's go.

2204
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:16,120
You disloyal punks! Hey!

2205
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,120
Gosh, those punks...

2206
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:19,790
You disloyal punks!

2207
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,230
- Chairman.
- Chairman.

2208
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:22,270
We got rid of the rotten part
of the past.

2209
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:23,600
- Close the door.
- Okay.

2210
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,370
- Good.
- Close the door.

2211
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:26,600
(He's suddenly considered
a deep-rooted evil.)

2212
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,410
Hey, you two with the mullets.

2213
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:31,530
- You're the one who likes snow.
- Oh, my.

2214
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,170
- Kim Grand Award.
- Yes?

2215
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:36,310
I made you the chairman.

2216
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,310
I know it.

2217
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:39,540
- You know it, right?
- Yes, I know it.

2218
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,820
He even drew a mustache on
with a permanent marker.

2219
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,520
I can't believe
I ended up like this.

2220
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,660
Yes, let's see how you do.

2221
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,450
I'm going to rise again.

2222
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,230
- I'm going to rise again.
- That's enough.

2223
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:53,030
So Min, can you give me one?

2224
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:54,450
- I have 0.
- Do you have 0?

2225
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:55,990
I'll give you the rules
for the next mission.

2226
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:58,900
For the next mission, if you get
the least number of members...

2227
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,830
in a room,
you will get more caramels

2228
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:03,070
- It's a cozy meal.
- This is driving me crazy.

2229
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,810
In a moment, you will move
one person at a time.

2230
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:06,810
You will go into 1 of the 3 rooms.

2231
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:08,740
Each person will take turns
to choose a room.

2232
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:11,570
The members who chose the room
with the least number of members...

2233
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:13,710
will get three times
the amount they betted.

2234
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:16,040
(The room with the least members
gets 3 times the amount of the bet.)

2235
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,190
(If they just choose well, they will
get 3 times the amount of caramels.)

2236
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:19,250
- Three times?
- Yes.

2237
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,020
I'm curious. Can I get a loan?

2238
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,120
I don't have any.

2239
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,450
- I only have debt.
- I also only have debt.

2240
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:25,620
I'll give you a loan of 20 each.

2241
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,990
- Okay, give them to me.
- What will you give 20 each?

2242
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,290
- It's a loan.
- It's a loan.

2243
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:30,160
- Okay.
- Why are you so excited?

2244
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,960
I also wanted to get it.

2245
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,370
- He wants more caramels.
- He's sensitive.

2246
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,030
It's because I'm so upset.

2247
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:39,200
- This mission is really good.
- Yes.

2248
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,700
- I can get a lot at once.
- That's right.

2249
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:42,850
Hey, you can do this.

2250
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:44,350
You can go to room 1 and say,
"Don't come to room 1."

2251
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,910
"Hey, you can do this"?

2252
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:50,320
- "Hey, you can..."
- Roll him in the snow!

2253
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,710
- Come here.
- I mean...

2254
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:54,450
- Isn't "Hey, you" too informal?
- Yes.

2255
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,660
- You're the chairman.
- That's right.

2256
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:57,920
(Breaking News, "Ji Suk Jin rolls
around in the snow with no pants")

2257
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,530
Up next, Ji Suk Jin...

2258
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:01,770
is rolling around
in the snow with no pants.

2259
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,070
- Yes.
- Roll him.

2260
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:05,030
It is assumed that he took off
his pants of his own accord.

2261
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:06,240
That's all.

2262
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,070
He's a funny man.

2263
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:11,070
Are you really going to live
like that?

2264
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:12,530
- "Hey, you" was too informal.
- It was.

2265
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:13,830
- We took care of him.
- As a matter of fact...

2266
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:15,650
My title is the chairman.

2267
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:17,110
- But Kim Grand Award,
- Yes?

2268
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,070
I'm a little upset.

2269
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:20,350
- I made you the chairman.
- Hey.

2270
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:21,370
- You're amazing.
- Attention!

2271
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:24,650
How dare you
lean on one foot like that?

2272
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:26,020
- What are you doing?
- Roll him.

2273
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,450
How dare you lean on one foot?

2274
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:29,690
- He leaned on one foot.
- How dare you!

2275
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,190
- I was really surprised.
- Are you okay, Jong Kook?

2276
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:33,100
I never saw someone
lean on one foot.

2277
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:36,320
(The mullet gang is back on the move
because he leaned on one foot.)

2278
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,240
How dare you lean on one foot?
Get lost.

2279
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:42,310
I'll do something about them.

2280
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,370
I'm so mad.

2281
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,130
He will never be able to lean
on one foot again.

2282
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:47,440
(He comes back
while flipping his mullet.)

2283
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:49,780
- We scolded him good.
- That was really...

2284
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,280
Gosh, these mullets are really...

2285
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,910
- "Mullets"?
- "Mullets"?

2286
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:57,120
If I become the chairman,
I'll do something about you.

2287
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:01,020
(Kwang Soo provokes Jae Suk
by pretending to spit on him.)

2288
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,450
(A hand-to-hand fight breaks out.)

2289
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:04,450
- Jong Kook, he used violence.
- Violence?

2290
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:05,730
- You used violence.
- Oh, my.

2291
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,100
Oh, my.

2292
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,320
These are hair extensions.

2293
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,290
(He timidly punishes
the mullet gang.)

2294
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:12,790
- Gosh, they're really...
- I'm sorry,

2295
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:15,160
but why do you keep
standing next to me?

2296
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,940
You're warm.

2297
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:19,000
- You're warm.
- Mustache Brothers, just leave.

2298
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,070
What?

2299
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:22,170
- You Mustaches...
- You Mullets...

2300
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,950
- You Mullets...
- You'll fight with the Mullets?

2301
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:25,370
You Mullets...

2302
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:27,450
(The kiddie fight started again.)

2303
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:28,880
You Mullets are really...

2304
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:30,380
- You...
- You...

2305
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:32,320
- Mustache Brothers...
- Okay, good.

2306
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:34,060
- Good job.
- Did my mustache get erased?

2307
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,120
- How dare you touch my mullet?
- No, it didn't get erased.

2308
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,450
Okay, first...

2309
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:40,450
For the order,
I think the ex-chairman...

2310
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,920
should start first.

2311
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,920
Please put me at the end.

2312
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,830
- He talks too much.
- Do you want this to be your end?

2313
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,940
- What do you want to do?
- Okay.

2314
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:51,910
- He should go second then.
- Yes.

2315
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:52,940
That's right.

2316
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,740
- The two Mustaches should go first.
- He should go second.

2317
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:58,350
- I'll go first.
- I put almost 10 caramels in.

2318
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:59,520
- Really?
- Yes.

2319
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,350
I really hate lies.
Do you know that or not?

2320
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:04,190
- I really put them in!
- Violence and...

2321
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,910
Hyeong Gu, tell him for me.

2322
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,360
First...

2323
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:08,660
He's third then.

2324
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:10,250
You should go third.

2325
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:12,900
- The fourth is...
- Conscientiously, I'll go next.

2326
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,290
I'll go next conscientiously.

2327
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,620
- I like things like this. Okay.
- Thank you.

2328
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:19,270
I'll go next.

2329
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,910
(He wasn't aware of it.)

2330
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,500
(Drop)

2331
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,310
(He got his bag strap cut off
with his eyes wide open.)

2332
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:29,310
(He's really happy.)

2333
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:30,810
- Gosh.
- That's unbelievable.

2334
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,280
He cut it off.

2335
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,350
- Why did you cut it off?
- What did he do?

2336
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:36,080
- What did he do?
- I saw this on the news.

2337
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,280
This is like...

2338
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,880
What is this?

2339
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,210
This is...

2340
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:42,360
Last time, Tae Hyun...

2341
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,450
He's really a piece of trash
if he did that.

2342
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:45,950
- What?
- I can't believe it.

2343
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:46,950
- I don't know.
- What is he going to do?

2344
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:48,100
Okay, good.

2345
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,030
- We will start with number one.
- Yes.

2346
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,870
Tell us how much you will bet,
and just go by yourself.

2347
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:53,330
- I'm in trouble.
- Can we see how much he bets?

2348
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:54,570
Yes, we will start right away.

2349
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:56,070
This is all luck.

2350
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,770
Okay, all-in.

2351
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,370
- All-in.
- How many do you have?

2352
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:00,530
(Jae Suk goes all-in.)

2353
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:01,950
Wait a minute, but this is...

2354
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,980
If we put all of them in,
we can't change the chairman.

2355
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,490
Wait a minute. The chairman... Okay.

2356
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,490
- Okay.
- So let's put all of them in.

2357
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:13,520
- So let's put all of them in.
- I heard you.

2358
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,280
Okay, I will start then.

2359
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,030
Gosh, this is all luck.
We can't do anything about it.

2360
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:21,900
(He needs caramels to get back
the spot of the chairman.)

2361
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:25,630
- Where is it?
- Take this lunchbox,

2362
01:17:25,630 --> 01:17:27,070
and go to the second floor.

2363
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,940
- So do I choose 1 room?
- Yes, there are 3 rooms.

2364
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,570
(Jae Suk goes first.)

2365
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:37,070
(He has to predict a room where
the members will go the least.)

2366
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:40,410
(Thinking carefully)

2367
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,150
(After deep deliberation,
he chose...)

2368
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:47,710
(room number 1 which appears
right away on the 2nd floor.)

2369
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,320
Please...

2370
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,790
- I'll put 20 in.
- Okay.

2371
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:56,030
Ji Suk Jin, please get going.

2372
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:01,200
- There's a proposal box.
- Yes.

2373
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:03,570
Here.

2374
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:05,500
(He dreams of reclaiming
the spot of chairman.)

2375
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:09,610
(Suk Jin turns in 12 caramels.)

2376
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:14,280
Let me be chairman one more time.
We need to change the chairperson.

2377
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,780
(He has to avoid the room
Jae Suk is in before everything.)

2378
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:20,410
Room number 2 and 3...

2379
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:25,030
(His hands become polite at
the sound of Suk Jin's footsteps.)

2380
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,230
(It's a mission that will get them
three times more caramels.)

2381
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,160
(He's in the middle of a lonesome
high-degree psychological warfare.)

2382
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,900
People will skip number one.

2383
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,330
(This person didn't skip number 1.)

2384
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:38,440
Will you make a decision?

2385
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:42,000
People won't go in number one.

2386
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,480
- Gosh, I really can't believe it.
- Gosh.

2387
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,070
(A grand failure of
the psychological warfare)

2388
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:51,240
- Why did you choose number one?
- Why are you here?

2389
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:54,160
Gosh, you're really
driving me crazy.

2390
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,420
You should have skipped number one.

2391
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:58,620
How could you go in number 1
when you started 1st?

2392
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,820
- It's over.
- Gosh.

2393
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:02,730
I can't believe it. It's okay
if no one else comes in.

2394
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:05,940
How could you...
You're really driving me crazy.

2395
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,370
(Kwang Soo enters third.)

2396
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,460
Hello.

2397
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:18,610
(He also aimed for a big one
and bet 20 pieces.)

2398
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:19,670
All right.

2399
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,710
If there is one more person,
the possibility will be slim.

2400
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:25,520
(Will he be able to
escape being unlucky...)

2401
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,660
(and get a big fortune of caramels?)

2402
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:31,660
(Kwang Soo stopped
in front of room number 1.)

2403
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,420
(Will Kwang Soo also
go into room number 1?)

2404
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:38,530
It's okay to knock, right?

2405
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:39,660
I won't talk.

2406
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,870
(He starts a knocking game
with room number 2,)

2407
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:43,270
(walking on eggshells.)

2408
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:46,200
(He's also knocking on the hearts
of the Mustache Gang.)

2409
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:51,370
(After knocking up to
room number 3...)

2410
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,120
I choose this room.

2411
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,020
(He seems to have made
a decision. Where did he head to?)

2412
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,910
(Kwang Soo also chose
room number 1.)

2413
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:01,990
- Gosh, seriously...
- Gosh.

2414
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:03,530
Hey!

2415
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,030
What is really wrong with you?

2416
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:08,320
Are you out of your mind?

2417
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,770
Are you really out of your mind?

2418
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,990
- We're over.
- I chose the wrong room.

2419
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,130
I turned a lot of caramels in.

2420
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:16,200
How many?

2421
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,630
- I turned 20 in.
- Me too.

2422
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:19,200
I went all-in.

2423
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:23,110
- It's already over for us.
- It's over for us.

2424
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,650
But didn't number one
just feel right for some reason?

2425
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:26,870
Yes, I felt drawn to it strangely.

2426
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:28,570
That's impossible.

2427
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:30,020
- Is this possible?
- Gosh.

2428
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,490
(The room with the least number
of people will win.)

2429
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,190
(What are the choices
of the remaining 5 people?)

2430
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,620
(The fate of the card sharks...)

2431
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,780
(depend on a single choice.)

2432
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,290
(The final match of the card sharks
starts properly now.)

2433
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,700
(They have nothing to lose now.)

2434
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:43,290
(It's a betting war
with their pride on the line.)

2435
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,600
You can't see anything, can you?

2436
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,070
(The last match of the gamblers.
What will the ending be?)

2437
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:48,100
(And...)

2438
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:51,000
(The production objective of Running
Man remained the same for 10 years.)

2439
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,370
(There's a need to change it.)

2440
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:54,830
(The members' characters also
remained the same for 10 years.)

2441
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:56,110
(He's the dad of three kids.)

2442
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,310
(He's an old fossil now.)

2443
01:20:57,410 --> 01:20:58,870
This should really change.

2444
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:00,850
(That's why they will write
their own characters.)

2445
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:02,950
- I thought it was like this.
- What?

2446
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,380
(The last program of Yoo Jae Suk
who is facing his retirement...)

2447
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,910
(after 21 years of his career?)

2448
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,620
(Open your eyes.
Fun on a big scale will come.)

2449
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:08,920
(Open your mouth.
Laughter on a big scale will come.)

2450
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,380
That's good.

2451
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:12,920
(They wrote the production objective
according to their preference.)

2452
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,200
"He has a lot of greed
hidden behind his appearance."

2453
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,530
(Amid the exchange of well-wishing
remarks, they even wrote...)

2454
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:16,820
(the member's introductions
according to their preference.)

2455
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:20,100
(Only 1 of their production
objectives can be chosen.)

2456
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,500
(In whose hands will the 10-year-old
production objective get changed?)

2457
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,200
(Production Objective Race:
Running Man Rewritten)
