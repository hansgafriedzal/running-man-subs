1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,100
(It is snowing in large snowflakes
to turn the whole world white.)

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,770
- Old Fossil?
- I'm okay with anything else.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,810
- What's wrong with Old Fossil?
- I really hate it.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,020
That's my least favorite nickname.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,380
You're old enough to be called
an Old Fossil.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,260
If you were born in the Joseon era,
you would've been dead already.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,450
- Suk Jin.
- The average life expectancy was...

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,380
You would've been reborn already.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,060
(They are sharing snow-white
feelings in the morning as always.)

10
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,220
You're probably right.

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,220
(They are sharing snow-white
feelings in the morning as always.)

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,670
Gosh, it's chilly. Hello.

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,490
- Hello.
- This is amazing.

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,560
Hello.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,830
- Hello.
- Gosh, it's cold.

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,940
- We got this again.
- I feel all warm inside.

17
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,110
Hello.

18
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,970
- It's from the fans.
- The fans sent us coffee again.

19
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,110
It's really warm. Thank you.

20
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,110
- Thank you.
- We keep getting stuff...

21
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,940
- from the fans. I'm so grateful.
- They don't have to do this though.

22
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,290
But we feel really sorry
to keep taking stuff like this.

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,890
Anyway, we should enjoy it
with due gratitude.

24
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,550
- That's true.
- We are very thankful.

25
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,830
- But if we take this,
- It's really warm.

26
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,120
other fans might feel like...

27
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,120
- they have to send something.
- They'd want to send something too.

28
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,930
- They might feel burdened.
- So,

29
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,970
- it's really okay.
- Sure.

30
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,660
It's us who should be
treating the fans.

31
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,300
You were the first one in line
to get coffee though.

32
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,500
What? A zebra is talking.

33
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,670
What? My gosh.

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,400
- Zebra.
- Zebra.

35
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,250
He's just a filthy horse.

36
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,620
No, it's a zebra.

37
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,950
Isn't this a military drill uniform?

38
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,090
- No.
- It's yellowish.

39
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,510
I thought he was wearing a military
drill uniform from a distance.

40
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,690
- A military drill uniform?
- Gosh.

41
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,250
Did you guys check
the updated website?

42
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,390
I did. I didn't like it though.

43
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,500
Why did you do that?

44
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,090
Your profile picture is ridiculous.

45
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,030
The number of visitors to
our website has increased sharply.

46
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,200
- Really?
- It's the talk of the town.

47
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,030
- They want to check the updates.
- The server went down.

48
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,400
- Really? The server went down?
- Seriously?

49
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,840
- It went down?
- Thank you so much.

50
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,950
What is this? It's a cartoon.

51
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,280
It's time to change this.

52
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,040
Your photo is the worst.

53
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,310
- What's with the photo?
- What about it?

54
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,510
Mine is a picture of me
with a runny nose.

55
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,860
Then you should've won the race.

56
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,090
His picture is like an idol star
cartoon character.

57
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,920
Yes, he's the only one
with an animated character.

58
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,420
Actually, Writer Yaongyi
drew that for me.

59
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,170
Why didn't the writer
draw something for the rest of us?

60
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,260
Hey.

61
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,830
- Why would the writer...
- Writer Yaongyi, how could you?

62
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,440
Why would Writer Yaongyi
draw your character?

63
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,170
Sister Ongyi,
draw something for us too!

64
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,840
She's much younger than you.

65
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,000
Younger sister.

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
- She's not older than me?
- No way.

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,340
I'm so sorry.

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,710
Jae Suk, why did you use
that picture of Jong Kook?

69
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,070
Why is his nickname "Kim Nipple"
when we can't see his nipples?

70
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,840
When he wears sleeveless
shirts in summer...

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,910
Right. You can see them
from the side.

72
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,410
Yes, you can see them from the side,
so he's "Kim Nipple".

73
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,520
- I didn't know they showed.
- Of course they do.

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
I didn't know that.

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,490
When you're talking with us,

76
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,590
your nipples are peeking out
like this.

77
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,250
- Like they're shy or something.
- I see.

78
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,530
I've seen a picture of myself
that was taken at the airport.

79
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,060
- And I saw them.
- Really?

80
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,470
So I thought,
"My gosh, I should be more careful."

81
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,870
- I've seen them a lot.
- Gosh, that's not right.

82
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,870
You're called
"Kim Nipple" domestically.

83
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,210
But you are
"Nipple Kim" internationally.

84
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,400
("Kim Nipple" for domestic market,
"Nipple Kim" for export market)

85
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,280
- "Nipple Kim".
- It's cute.

86
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,340
- It's the other way around.
- Yes, the other way around.

87
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,500
Nipple Kim.

88
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,650
So today,

89
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,370
you will have
the Sister's Diary Race.

90
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,120
Guests who will play the role of
your older sisters are here.

91
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,190
- Really?
- Older sisters?

92
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,520
Someone old enough
to be my older sisters?

93
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,850
Is Sa Yeon here again?

94
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,690
- Maybe Park Mi Sun is here.
- Please come in.

95
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,150
Older than me?

96
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,820
(The sisters who have
such old younger siblings?)

97
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,650
- Hello.
- Gosh, hello.

98
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,400
- My goodness. Hello.
- They really are older sisters.

99
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
We enjoy their dramas so much.

100
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,840
Gosh, thank you for coming.

101
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,970
Hello.

102
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,810
(She's Park Bo Gum's loyal manager
in "Record of Youth".)

103
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,630
(She is amazing in all genres.)

104
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,370
(Shin Dong Mi, the actress
with 24 years of experience)

105
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,470
Hello.,

106
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,910
This is unbelievable.

107
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,190
(She changes herself for each
character like a chameleon.)

108
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,990
(She's charismatic
in "Good Manager" too.)

109
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,560
(The irreplaceable and indispensable
actress, Kim Jae Hwa)

110
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,300
Hello.

111
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,660
Oh, hello.

112
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,530
(She's in every hot drama
these days!)

113
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,590
(She plays Court Lady Choi
in "Mr. Queen".)

114
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,740
(The scene-stealer
in "Crash Landing on You")

115
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,650
(Actress Cha Chung Hwa
guarantees a drama's success.)

116
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,940
Oh, hello.

117
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,970
- Hey, Chung Hwa.
- Hello.

118
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,410
This is unbelievable.

119
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,780
- I loved "Crash Landing on You."
- Thank you.

120
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,460
Let me introduce them to you.

121
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,430
- Amazing.
- Kim Jae Hwa, Shin Dong Mi,

122
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,560
and Cha Chung Hwa.

123
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,780
(Kim Jae Hwa,
Shin Dong Mi, Cha Chung Hwa)

124
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,590
Big sister!

125
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,530
Let's talk to Jae Hwa first.

126
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,820
It's so nice to have you here.

127
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,630
- I'm glad to be here. Hello.
- It's amazing.

128
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,670
It's the first time I've seen her.

129
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,940
Yes, this is the first time
we're meeting in person, right?

130
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,260
Yes, it is the first time.

131
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,830
How did you feel
to be invited to Running Man?

132
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,440
- To be honest, I was surprised.
- All right.

133
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,050
I thought, "Why would they
want me on their show?"

134
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,140
You're too modest.

135
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,370
(Her shy but genuine laughter)

136
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,120
Because I'm not that popular.

137
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,880
- You think you're not?
- No.

138
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,250
Being here means you are popular.

139
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
(You're right!)

140
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,490
Thank you.

141
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,660
That's nice.

142
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,360
I like their reactions.

143
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,000
They have great reactions.

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,660
- You're right.
- Such strong reactions.

145
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes, she keeps clapping.

146
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,190
Very strong.

147
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,700
I think Chung Hwa and Jae Hwa
are similar characters.

148
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,330
But Dong Mi is...

149
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,110
- She's just nervous.
- She doesn't know where she is.

150
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,830
She doesn't know
what she's doing here.

151
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,370
(Big sister Dong Mi
looked nervous from the start.)

152
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,440
(Strong reaction 1)

153
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,480
(Strong reaction 2)

154
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,770
(Walking on eggshells)

155
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,380
(She's even conscious of Suk Jin,
which has never happened before.)

156
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,690
Yes, you're right.

157
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,730
Let's talk about Jae Hwa.

158
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,820
I've seen her on "Radio Star".

159
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,230
She imitated animal sounds
on the show.

160
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,560
- It was quite popular for a while.
- Right.

161
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,870
- I've seen it too.
- Which animals?

162
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,100
Just show us then.

163
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,560
Well, it's really nothing.

164
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,700
It's nothing. Chicken.
Chicken sounds.

165
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,260
- Chicken sounds?
- Okay, chicken sounds.

166
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,830
Gosh, wait a minute.

167
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,700
(My goodness.)

168
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,070
Gosh, wait a minute.

169
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,850
- My goodness, guys.
- She's really good.

170
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,310
She's amazing.

171
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,550
- So good.
- But why the arm?

172
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,190
What's with the arm?

173
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,580
Because it's weird to do it
while standing still.

174
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,620
(She can't belt it out
with tension in her body.)

175
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,080
- I can't do it right.
- I understand.

176
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,560
- But when you move your arm?
- Yes.

177
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,100
- To control the volume.
- Right.

178
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,120
(Cock-a-doodle-doo!)

179
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,600
Yes, it sounds different.

180
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,870
(It feels fresh
as if it's the crack of dawn.)

181
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,890
(A new kind of personal talent)

182
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,560
- It's so funny.
- Is there anything else?

183
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,960
- I did elephant sounds too.
- Elephant? Okay.

184
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,770
Kwang Soo can imitate
elephant sounds too.

185
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,370
Why don't you show us?

186
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,910
I have never imitated
elephant sounds in my entire life.

187
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,250
Suk Jin, were you
confused with someone else?

188
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,370
Haven't you imitated
elephant sounds before?

189
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,850
Actually, Sae Ho did that...

190
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,810
- when he was on our show.
- I see.

191
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,010
Oh, it was Sae Ho.

192
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,490
So why haven't you tried it?

193
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,660
Then you should start today.
Why haven't you tried it?

194
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,930
- Why haven't you?
- Me?

195
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,800
Try it.

196
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,060
You're good.

197
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,600
- He's good.
- Yes, you're good.

198
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,370
Jae Hwa, why don't you show us?

199
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,890
My goodness.

200
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,630
(Howling)

201
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,370
- My goodness.
- Isn't it a wildcat?

202
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,460
It's too much.

203
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,760
It sounds like an elk.

204
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,130
Didn't it sound like
she was blowing her nose?

205
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,070
- I'm sorry.
- Try chicken again.

206
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,270
Chicken.

207
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,140
(Regaining her reputation
with the chicken sound)

208
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,810
(It becomes an all-round cheat key.)

209
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,940
I love how she moves her arm.

210
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,810
Yes, her arm.

211
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,080
- It's so funny.
- Yes.

212
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,380
I love how you move it.

213
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,790
- They're good.
- It's funny.

214
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,490
It seems like you're about
to transform into something.

215
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,230
- Yes, you're right.
- Here we go!

216
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,320
(A perfect harmony of voice,
facial expression, and movement)

217
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,750
Gosh, I'm going to laugh
every time I think about this.

218
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,430
- Yes, she's the best.
- Every time it pops into my head.

219
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,600
Next is Cha Chung Hwa.

220
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,100
- Hello.
- It's good to be here.

221
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,460
(So lively)

222
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,870
Actually,

223
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,270
Cha Chung Hwa is currently...

224
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,870
starring in "Mr. Queen",
and she did...

225
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,250
- "Crash Landing on You".
- Yes, I know.

226
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,440
I loved the show.

227
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,710
So Chung Hwa...

228
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,550
- you were on tvN dramas too.
- Yes, tvN.

229
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,640
And you were so amazing
in all of them.

230
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,860
I guess you get along well
with tvN dramas, right?

231
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,510
(Flustered)

232
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,860
You get along well with them too.

233
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,730
- You're on many shows there too.
- What are you doing?

234
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,800
Isn't this an SBS show?

235
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,300
It's okay to talk about
other broadcasting stations.

236
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,000
- Really?
- Yes, of course.

237
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
You're on two tvN shows.

238
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,260
- Two shows?
- Maybe you get along well.

239
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,440
Stop talking.

240
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,960
Maybe you don't get along well.

241
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,330
And Chung Hwa...

242
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,700
has great facial expressions.

243
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,070
- She has great expressions.
- I can see that.

244
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,700
A happy face or a sad face.

245
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,710
- Well...
- Kwang Soo's good at that.

246
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,940
Yes, of course.

247
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,210
- I can do it.
- Happy and sad at the same time.

248
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,920
- He's good.
- Yes, he can do it.

249
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,310
He can express happiness
and sadness at the same time.

250
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,360
- Sure.
- He can do it.

251
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,450
Yes, Kwang Soo can do it.

252
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,490
The picture of him on the website
is exactly that.

253
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,890
- Yes, you're right.
- His expression is so funny.

254
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,930
He looks happy and sad
at the same time.

255
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,750
So show us the expression
of happiness and sadness.

256
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,460
- I don't know if I can do this.
- One...

257
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,690
- 2, 3. Cue.
- Can he do it?

258
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,690
(He's happy and sad
at the same time.)

259
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,060
He's sad. Sad.

260
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,240
Now he's happy.

261
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,410
Now be happy and sad
at the same time.

262
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,630
(Happy and sad at the same time)

263
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,740
That's it.

264
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,940
That's it!

265
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,910
Right there!

266
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,270
Is this it?

267
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,140
- I should remember the feeling.
- This is it!

268
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,750
- That's it!
- Hold it.

269
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,880
- Take a picture.
- Wait.

270
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,250
- Hold it!
- Wait!

271
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,120
Okay, take it.

272
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,160
That's good.

273
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,660
This is it.

274
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,850
This is great.

275
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,220
This is it.

276
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,090
I really hate the expression though.

277
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,160
- I really hate it.
- You can't see it anywhere else.

278
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,770
- So Chung Hwa.
- Yes.

279
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,040
- Can I ask you to show us?
- Show you what?

280
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,540
Why don't you start with happiness?

281
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,670
(Starting with happiness)

282
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,860
I'm happy but sad.

283
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,970
(Begins a one-woman play,
happy but sad to win an award)

284
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,010
Gosh, she's good.

285
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,330
- That's it.
- Yes.

286
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,650
- That's it.
- So good.

287
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,910
It's when you win an award.

288
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,010
Thank you so much.

289
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,550
Happy but sad.

290
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,240
- Show us happiness.
- She's amazing.

291
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,440
- Happiness?
- Gosh.

292
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,190
(Suddenly flips the mood completely)

293
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,260
It's happiness.

294
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,080
- Now sadness.
- Yes, sadness.

295
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,580
Now happy and sad.

296
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,760
Stop it.

297
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,980
(Stop it!)

298
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,800
(Punching)

299
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,450
She tried to punch him.

300
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,170
- My goodness.
- She tried to punch him.

301
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,220
Good reaction.

302
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,440
Actually, Chung Hwa is showing us
one of Rain's dances.

303
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,640
Seriously?

304
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,100
- Amazing.
- We should see it.

305
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,560
(She's giving
a dance performance too?)

306
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
- Show us.
- Chung Hwa.

307
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,230
- Actually, I didn't prepare it.
- Go ahead.

308
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,810
Chung Hwa is...

309
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,070
- good at dancing.
- She is?

310
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,650
- She is.
- Really?

311
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,880
Gosh, my socks.

312
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,550
- Okay.
- Wait.

313
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,190
- Calm down.
- All right.

314
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,950
- Excuse me.
- Let me...

315
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,690
- Dong Mi, you look uncomfortable.
- No.

316
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,430
Because you have to do something
after she gives her performance.

317
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,720
Just wait for a while.

318
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,430
Everyone is showing their talents.

319
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,590
- So you're...
- You don't have to.

320
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,490
- I don't have any talent.
- That's all right.

321
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,170
- Because of my legs. Just in case.
- All right.

322
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,490
(Talented Chung Hwa
is ready to give a performance.)

323
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,100
I'm not really good at dancing
so I'll do facial expressions.

324
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,280
So she's dancing with her face?

325
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,410
(Facial expressions
followed by a facial dance?)

326
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,200
Music. Cue.

327
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,970
("Switch to Me" by Rain,
duet with JYP)

328
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,280
(The facial expression is now on.)

329
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,940
She's lip-syncing.

330
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,890
(Drawing the audience in
as soon as she starts)

331
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,430
It's totally my style.

332
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,090
(Exactly to their tastes)

333
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,320
This is amazing.

334
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,190
She's good.

335
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,640
So cool.

336
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,460
Let's dance!

337
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,460
(Bounce, bounce)

338
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,510
(Powerful dance)

339
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,600
Gosh, she's good.

340
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,010
She's so good.

341
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,570
(She's a great dancer.)

342
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,020
(No one expected her
to be this good.)

343
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,110
She's good.

344
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,710
- Cha Chung Hwa!
- You're amazing!

345
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,990
So good.

346
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,630
(These guys have
nasty dance DNA in them.)

347
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,590
(The scene of discovering a guest
with super high spirits)

348
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,940
Gosh, she's really good.

349
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,970
(Introducing herself with
a performance like in the old days)

350
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,200
(A perfect ending shot)

351
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,290
(Can't help but give her a big hand)

352
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,520
She's so good!

353
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,710
(A shameless fan service)

354
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,980
I'm a big fan!

355
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,790
(She shamelessly
stole So Min's heart!)

356
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,720
- Amazing.
- She's like a comedienne.

357
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,990
Chung Hwa, you did it.

358
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,220
<i>- Switch to me
- Switch to me</i>

359
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,040
(Chung Hwa knows exactly
what these comedians want.)

360
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,730
- She's an amazing dancer.
- Isn't she?

361
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,100
Thank you.

362
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,810
But this is what Se Chan said.

363
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,600
He said, "She's like a comedienne."

364
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,840
Yes, if you didn't
become an actress,

365
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,740
I'm sure you'd be a senior comedian.
I'm sure of it.

366
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,780
My heart is still pounding.
She was so cool.

367
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,340
- That was amazing.
- Right.

368
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,420
(While everyone is impressed
by her boldness and dance skills...)

369
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
(Restless)

370
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,950
- It was unbelievable.
- If we knew...

371
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,060
she'd be that good,
we would've let Dong Mi go first.

372
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,660
Good luck!

373
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,900
- You can do this!
- You can do this!

374
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,900
(In the middle
of the crazy dance party,)

375
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,490
(there was one person
who couldn't enjoy the moment.)

376
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,410
(She looks depressed
as things are heating up.)

377
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,880
Dong Mi doesn't know what to do.

378
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,730
- She's under a lot of pressure.
- You can do this!

379
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,410
- You can do this!
- It's not over yet!

380
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,050
I heard Dong Mi has a connection
with one of us.

381
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,190
- She did a drama with Ji Hyo.
- Right.

382
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,440
I saw you two hug each other.

383
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,290
- They seemed really excited.
- They seemed close.

384
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,320
I was surprised
to see Ji Hyo hug someone.

385
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,030
(Ji Hyo is known for her calmness,
but she hugged Dong Mi right away.)

386
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,850
That's surprising.

387
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,690
Dong Mi and I did
two dramas together.

388
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,540
- Right.
- Really?

389
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:48,910
(Ji Hyo and Dong Mi were sisters
in the drama, "Ex-Girlfriend Club".)

390
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,640
you should've paid my money back.

391
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,010
(They're close enough
to send a coffee truck.)

392
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,610
You two look like sisters.

393
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,880
- They look similar.
- Right.

394
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,110
Dong Mi, what was your first
impression of Ji Hyo?

395
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,190
- Ji Hyo?
- Yes.

396
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,260
She's really pretty.
And she's so nice.

397
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,300
(She's just a pretty
and nice friend.)

398
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,630
You don't sound very close.

399
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,590
She doesn't seem
to have much to say.

400
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,860
- Tell us more about her.
- It's like she's making things up.

401
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,540
What else is there
other than that she's pretty?

402
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,670
- Dong Mi, tell us.
- Say more.

403
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,010
I want to know more about Ji Hyo.

404
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,880
Ji Hyo is pretty and...

405
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,010
You already said that.

406
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,510
I guess she's just pretty.

407
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,880
I was surprised
by how easy-going she was.

408
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,150
It's true that Ji Hyo is easy-going.

409
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,790
Can I ask you something? She doesn't
often answer your calls, right?

410
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,760
Actually, I rarely call her.

411
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,290
After we complained that
Ji Hyo rarely answers our calls,

412
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,760
her life has been a lot easier.

413
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,630
- That's true. It's a lot easier.
- Everyone knows that now.

414
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,530
- Right?
- No one blames me...

415
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,690
for not answering
their calls anymore.

416
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,170
- I know.
- They've accepted it.

417
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,670
She's always like that.

418
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,600
- Thank you.
- It's become her character.

419
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,510
- She even thanks us.
- I heard Dong Mi...

420
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,600
released a duet song with her
husband for remembrance's sake.

421
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,880
Really?

422
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,780
- That sounds interesting.
- No.

423
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,940
- Just a little.
- The sound echoes around in here,

424
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,940
- so it's good to sing.
- This is perfect.

425
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,340
- It's a good place to sing.
- It echoes.

426
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,660
What do I do?
I'll sing the duet song then.

427
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,920
- The duet song? Cool.
- Yes.

428
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,690
(She says yes feeling
she has to do something.)

429
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,980
She looks like a music professor.

430
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,160
What do I do?

431
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,950
It's okay. We have
the chicken sound.

432
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,030
- Don't worry.
- It was really cool.

433
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,270
We have Jae Hwa.

434
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,670
She will cut in right away.

435
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,140
They both did a really good job.

436
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,860
They are like Lee Kyung Sil
and Lee Sung Mi of the big screen.

437
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,700
They are a duet.

438
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,970
(Playing the part of Lee Kyung Sil
and Lee Sung Mi)

439
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,280
If they are Kyung Sil and Sung Mi,

440
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,550
Dong Mi is Park Mi Sun.

441
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,280
- That's perfect.
- It sounds about right.

442
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,650
It suits her, right?

443
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,210
- She's like Mi Sun.
- Good.

444
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,020
- Do you like it?
- I like it.

445
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,660
- I love it.
- I like the three comediennes,

446
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,980
but Mi Sun is my favorite.

447
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,030
And we have Yang Hee Eun here.

448
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,720
(I'm Ji Hee Eun.)

449
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,960
Can you sing a little for us?

450
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,430
(They are excited
to hear Dong Mi's song.)

451
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,330
(You're like a wildcat)

452
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,410
(Giggling)

453
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,040
(What?)

454
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,780
(You are so sharp)

455
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,340
(But I love you)

456
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,310
(They don't know how to react.)

457
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,050
What do I do?

458
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,610
Seriously, what should we do?

459
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,190
I'd like to ask our viewers.

460
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,260
(Viewer-participation event)

461
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,080
What would you do
if you were in our situation?

462
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,660
(Embarrassed)

463
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,800
- You did a good job.
- Make the chicken sound for me.

464
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,560
- The chicken sound.
- I'd like to ask our viewers.

465
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,630
Go dance for me.

466
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,330
Like Dong Mi said...

467
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,560
She told me to dance.

468
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,360
- Who?
- Dong Mi.

469
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,040
She told me
to make the chicken sound.

470
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,470
Oh, dear.

471
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,180
Dong Mi... Dong Mi was...

472
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,340
so embarrassed...

473
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,420
"I wish I could go back in time."

474
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,980
So we have Dong Mi here.
Please give them a big hand.

475
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,420
Thank you.

476
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,060
Good start!

477
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,220
(The three actresses' story
on Running Man begins now.)

478
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,060
Like I said earlier,

479
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,530
we are going to have
the Sister's Diary Race today.

480
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,860
Each family will get money
according to the results...

481
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,590
of each mission.

482
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,810
The three people with the most money
will win the prize at the end.

483
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,940
And the one with the least money
will get a penalty.

484
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,050
But the sisters will distribute
the money as they like.

485
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,150
If her siblings have
a problem with that,

486
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,050
they can use their chance
to redistribute the money.

487
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,340
But the chance might increase...

488
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,610
the number of people
to get a penalty,

489
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,810
so you should be careful.

490
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,290
(The chance might make
more people get a penalty.)

491
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,430
So you're saying
we're playing one-on-one.

492
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,030
This is an individual game.

493
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,170
The sisters have...

494
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,330
already picked
the siblings they want.

495
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,330
Really?

496
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,860
The sisters will call
the names of their siblings...

497
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,640
and hand out name tags
that show their order.

498
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,340
For your information, the sisters
decided the order too.

499
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,780
I see.

500
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,940
(Who are the siblings
that they picked?)

501
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,380
I envy you.

502
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,340
I'm sorry, but I don't
talk to the youngest member.

503
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,210
(They are done
deciding the order of siblings.)

504
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,110
I wish I had Haha
and Kwang Soo under me.

505
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,930
Why am I the youngest one here?

506
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,130
I should've tussled with them.
Gosh, those punks.

507
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,760
- What?
- Nothing.

508
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,960
(A tussle?)

509
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,340
(Nothing.)

510
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,460
Hello, Jae Suk.

511
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,530
(Polite)

512
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,800
(The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
of the Cha Family)

513
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,880
You were talking to Suk Jin, right?

514
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,700
No, Suk Jin is also
my older brother.

515
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,850
I was just wondering
why I'm the youngest here.

516
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,890
So Min, it might be easier
to be the youngest.

517
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,160
(The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
of the Shin Family)

518
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,750
The fourth? I don't think so.

519
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,430
Imagine that Jong Kook
is your younger brother.

520
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,490
- It would be horrible.
- I'd feel uncomfortable.

521
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,370
- It'd be suffocating.
- I'm so uncomfortable.

522
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,630
Suk Jin, hurry and come.

523
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,940
- Suk Jin.
- This is crazy.

524
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,370
Suk Jin, I'm the youngest one
in our family.

525
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,030
Suk Jin, you should hurry.

526
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,030
(He doesn't seem to like
the set-up for today.)

527
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,040
- I have to take care of my family.
- People would think...

528
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,270
you're the oldest one here.

529
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,940
I knew you'd get scolded.

530
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,150
Come here.

531
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,210
- What are you?
- Why do you ask?

532
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,510
- I'm the second.
- You're not my family.

533
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,050
- That's true.
- You...

534
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,280
He's one year younger than me.

535
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Right. We're a year apart.

536
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,450
- What about me?
- You're three years younger.

537
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,520
So is he older than me?

538
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,490
(So is he older than me?)

539
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,550
Sure, Suk Jin.

540
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,760
- You should listen to your brother.
- Come here.

541
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,570
- This is old-fashioned.
- I've never seen you growing up.

542
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,260
- Did you visit my house?
- He lives next door.

543
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,000
I live next door. We're neighbors.

544
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,840
What's wrong with you?

545
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,030
Will you hurry?

546
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,240
(The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
of the Kim family)

547
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,240
Hey, will you hurry?

548
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,740
(What?)

549
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,150
- Me?
- We both are the second.

550
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,160
- We're of the same age.
- Yes, we are.

551
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,390
We are both the second.

552
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,660
Are we the same age?

553
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,190
No, he says we're not the same age.

554
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,480
He says he's older than us.

555
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,290
You should get a haircut.

556
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,990
What's my age?
Am I younger than him?

557
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,330
- Sure.
- He's older than you.

558
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,960
- Let me take care of this.
- Is he older than me?

559
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,140
(Let me take care of this.)

560
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,690
- Let me take care of this.
- Is he older than me?

561
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,110
Who do you think you are, you punk?

562
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,770
(The third son, Suk Jin is
scolded by Kwang Soo.)

563
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,700
That's enough. Stop it.

564
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,610
- How dare you.
- You should teach him better.

565
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,320
He's six months older than you.

566
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,040
- Older than me?
- I'm older than you.

567
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,120
He's older than you.

568
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,190
This is really confusing.

569
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,280
Haha looks so cute.

570
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,660
You do look like
the youngest member.

571
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,020
You don't seem
like you were born in 1979.

572
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,780
- Me?
- Were you born in 1980?

573
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,160
- No.
- He was born in 1979.

574
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,330
Wasn't it 1980?

575
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,860
How old are you?

576
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,290
I was born in 1980.

577
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,460
Oh, you're not...

578
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,600
(Polite)

579
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,110
(You're not older than me.)

580
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,800
- Haha, you're so mean.
- She's younger than you.

581
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,840
You're unbelievable.

582
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,940
Haha, you were born in the 1970s,
but we were born in the 1980s.

583
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,440
- You too?
- Yes.

584
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,350
- Are you both younger than Haha?
- What?

585
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
It's not like that.

586
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,210
(The actresses are having fun
teasing Kwang Soo.)

587
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,280
It's not like that.

588
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,090
- She looks so serious.
- Hey.

589
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,320
She has various facial expressions.

590
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,330
Be nice to my big sister.

591
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,360
- What are you?
- Watch your mouth.

592
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,020
Why are you being like that
to my sister?

593
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,290
- Let me take care of this.
- Just have a seat.

594
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,070
- Sit down.
- What are you?

595
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,900
(What are you?)

596
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,840
(He wants to keep
pinching Suk Jin's cheek.)

597
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,700
- How dare you.
- How old are you?

598
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,700
Hey, what time do you think it is?

599
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,730
- No, I...
- At ease.

600
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,000
- My sister isn't here yet.
- Let me pinch your nipples.

601
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,110
(Pinching his nipples)

602
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,350
At ease.

603
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,350
Stand straight. What do you
think you are doing now?

604
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,770
Everyone's here already.
You're the youngest one here.

605
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,150
- You pinched my nipples.
- If you don't behave today,

606
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,620
- I'll tear them off.
- But you can't pinch my nipples.

607
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,160
Kim Nipple, just sit.

608
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,250
- But my nipples...
- Kim Nipple.

609
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,220
- Kim Nipple?
- That sounds cute.

610
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,490
- You should hurry.
- Jong Kook, you're younger than me.

611
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,550
- Really?
- Yes.

612
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,670
You're not my family anyway.

613
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,960
(He's not afraid of other families.)

614
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,400
- But I'm older than you.
- Teach her a lesson.

615
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,300
- Why would age matter?
- You should be polite to me.

616
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,700
You're older than me,

617
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,440
but you're not my family.
I don't care.

618
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,910
Do you want me
to pinch your nipples?

619
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,500
- Come here.
- Come here.

620
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,800
I can't believe this.

621
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,920
- Dong Mi.
- I'm older than you.

622
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,010
Will you hurry?

623
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,680
- Well, Dong Mi.
- Stay quiet.

624
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,040
Dong Mi. I'm sorry to say this,

625
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,710
but why are you so shy
around your family?

626
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,820
- They are your family.
- We're family.

627
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,630
My sister is shy around strangers.

628
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,860
- You should hurry.
- Okay.

629
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,490
You should give me a chair.

630
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,600
Won't you take care
of your younger brother?

631
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,690
You can't take all the chairs.

632
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,630
The guys next door...

633
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,790
keep yelling at me.

634
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,340
- Who?
- Hey, shut your mouth.

635
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,870
Hey, stop that.
Don't you dare yell at my brother.

636
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,180
(What did you say?)

637
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,910
Will you let her
talk to me like that?

638
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,350
- Things are overheating.
- Will you let it slide?

639
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,820
- It's getting overheated.
- I can't let it slide.

640
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,740
- I like your ad-lib these days.
- Well done.

641
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,510
- I like that.
- Hey.

642
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,820
I like her ad-lib. It's really good.

643
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,050
That's true though.

644
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,330
I mean, it just sounded right.

645
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,550
I think that was appropriate
for the situation.

646
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,430
- Well done.
- I'm serious.

647
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,950
This is what older sisters do.

648
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,870
Gosh, you little...
You're no match for me.

649
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,760
Don't mess with her.

650
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,690
I'm so ashamed of our third.

651
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,730
Let me tell you
about the first mission.

652
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,880
It's called Mouth Shape Acting...

653
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,970
which requires your sharp sight
and acting skills.

654
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,040
Mouth Shape Acting?

655
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,980
You have to guess a famous quote
from a movie or a drama...

656
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,660
only by looking at the shape
of the mouth to succeed.

657
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,360
("Is this the best you can do?
Are you sure?")

658
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,090
Is this the best you can do?
Are you sure?

659
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,100
- Those who watched many dramas...
- That's easy.

660
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,930
- would be at an advantage.
- We know a lot of movies.

661
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,400
- I'm not good at a game like this.
- I'm not confident.

662
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,600
I'm really bad at this.

663
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,190
I never watch any dramas.
I'm in trouble.

664
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,960
- You watched a lot, right?
- I only watch the ones I acted in.

665
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,170
Really?

666
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,380
One more thing.
When you say the answer,

667
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,700
if you act realistically as well,
you receive two points.

668
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,740
- If we act realistically?
- Yes.

669
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,440
We have many actresses
on our team, right?

670
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,970
Our team will do incredibly well.

671
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,080
Se Chan is good at acting
in comedy skits too.

672
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,390
We have 1 comedian
and 2 actresses on our team.

673
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,950
- We'll definitely win.
- I can act too.

674
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,390
- Jong Kook is good at acting too.
- Jae Suk and Suk Jin are...

675
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,480
(These 2 members make
their team members worry.)

676
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,550
really bad at acting.

677
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,790
The eldest sister of the team
that gets the right answer...

678
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,990
will choose one person on another
team and hit that person with this.

679
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,990
You can deduct one dollar
from the person's allowance.

680
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,870
(The eldest sister of the team
that gets the right answer...)

681
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,730
(can deduct 1 dollar
from 1 person's allowance.)

682
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,800
(1 dollar will be deducted.)

683
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,340
- Now...
- A legendary scene.

684
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,800
- Yes. Okay.
- The mouth shape.

685
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,440
- The question will be revealed.
- I'm good at this. Don't worry.

686
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,800
- We can do this.
- That's ridiculous.

687
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,580
- I specialize in this.
- That's not true.

688
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,580
(Jae Suk is all talk
as soon as the game begins.)

689
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,080
- That's ridiculous.
- I specialize in this.

690
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,480
- That's not true.
- What?

691
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,710
(Who is that?)

692
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,210
- That's Ha Jung Woo.
- Ha Jung Woo?

693
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,280
- No, that's not him.
- No. He has chubby cheeks.

694
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,480
- Should we guess a whole sentence?
- Could he be Im Won Hee?

695
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,190
- It's a famous line.
- No, I don't think so.

696
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,220
- The actor from the movie...
- Kim Yun Sik?

697
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,900
- Kim Yun Sik?
- You mean, Kim Yun Seok.

698
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,600
Is it a complete sentence?

699
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,100
- It's...
- It's a famous line.

700
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,400
This is a scene where the actor
is saying the line.

701
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,690
- Who is that?
- Let me answer.

702
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,170
- Go ahead.
- "Hey!"

703
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,370
("Hey!")

704
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,640
- No, there should be more.
- Let me answer.

705
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,770
Yes? That's not correct.

706
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,110
Let me answer. The answer is
"Why does it matter?"

707
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,110
("Why does it matter?")

708
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,820
Let me answer. "You live
in Namcheon-dong, don't you?"

709
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,120
- That's not the answer, you brat.
- Is it correct?

710
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,390
No, that line doesn't end like that.
Let me answer.

711
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,780
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

712
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,010
- Listen to me.
- Let me answer.

713
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,210
- He said...
- "Listen, you punk!"

714
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,590
- "I was..."
- Incorrect.

715
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,660
No, that's not it.

716
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,950
- It doesn't end with "don't you".
- Imitate the actor.

717
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,130
From the beginning.

718
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,720
- Go ahead.
- "Hey! You live..."

719
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,760
"in Namcheon-dong, right?"

720
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,490
(She seems sure.)

721
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,690
"You live in Namcheon-dong, right?"

722
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,440
- "Right?"
- Let me answer.

723
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,530
- Is it not the correct answer?
- Let me answer.

724
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,440
- Doesn't it end with "right"?
- It wasn't correct.

725
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,200
I'll start from the beginning.
"Let go of me, you punk!"

726
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,110
He doesn't say a swear word.

727
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,270
- But I wasn't finished.
- Hey!

728
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,320
- I mean, before he said it...
- Let me answer.

729
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,010
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

730
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,920
- Let me answer.
- Let her answer.

731
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,190
- Chung Hwa.
- "Hey!"

732
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,920
"Your uncle that jerk... He..."

733
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,190
Stop it.

734
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,690
- That was so funny.
- Let me answer.

735
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,780
- I remember now.
- Let me answer.

736
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,860
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

737
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,490
- Let me answer.
- Jong Kook, go ahead.

738
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,760
"Your captain lives
in Namcheon-dong, right?"

739
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,100
- Correct!
- All right!

740
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,960
- Chung Hwa, that was close.
- It was "captain", not "uncle".

741
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,600
- It was "captain".
- Okay!

742
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,800
- "Your captain..."
- "Your captain".

743
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,570
- "Your captain..."
- That's right.

744
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,080
- Oh, right.
- Darn.

745
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
(The scene from "Nameless
Gangster: Rules of the Time")

746
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,110
Your captain lives
in Namcheon-dong, right?

747
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,970
- Yes, he does.
- Listen. Your captain and I...

748
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,380
I knew all the lines in that scene.

749
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,590
We'll give Jong Kook's team
two points.

750
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,590
- Okay!
- Oh, yes!

751
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,090
Dong Mi, choose one younger sibling
and hit the person in the head,

752
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,450
and one dollar will be deducted.

753
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,660
- We were so close to the answer.
- Dong Mi.

754
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,550
- You can choose anyone.
- He's been acting up too much.

755
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,750
- He keeps getting up like that.
- He's been acting up.

756
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,290
Oh, no. My little brother.

757
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,460
He's been acting up too much.
Good choice, Dong Mi.

758
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,600
Why him?

759
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,940
- What's wrong with her?
- Gosh, seriously.

760
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,500
- Don't act up.
- I don't like you.

761
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,030
My little brother who was born
in 1966.

762
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,440
The score is 2 to 0 to 0.

763
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,700
- She said "uncle".
- What a shame.

764
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,300
- We got two points.
- Right. It was "captain".

765
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,910
- I remember that now.
- Jong Kook acted well too.

766
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,380
- Here goes your second question.
- I'll get this one right.

767
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,180
- Great. Let's do this.
- Here goes the question.

768
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,280
- Hey! I mean, let me answer.
- Let me answer.

769
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
(Hey! I mean, let me answer.)

770
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,590
- Who could that be?
- Whose mouth is that?

771
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,390
- Whose mouth is that?
- I think it's Kim Rae Won.

772
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,290
- Kim Rae Won. What movie was it?
- Rae Won?

773
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,290
- What scene is it?
- Who is that?

774
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,290
- Is it from a drama?
- Isn't that Park Shin Yang?

775
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,690
- Really?
- Or not.

776
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,100
- I think he's quite old.
- I have no idea.

777
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,790
If you don't know,
we'll show you the next level hint.

778
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,840
- We'll show you more of the photo.
- Please do that.

779
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,410
- Show us.
- Okay. The next level hint.

780
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,340
- Let me answer.
- He's Park Shin Yang, right?

781
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,880
- Let me answer.
- He's Park Shin Yang, right?

782
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,850
"Baby, let's go. Baby, let's go!"

783
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,080
"Baby, let's go!"

784
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,850
- You're awesome.
- Hey, Jong Kook.

785
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,550
Baby, let's go.

786
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,590
(The scene from "Lovers in Paris")

787
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,950
What... Are you talking to me?

788
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,220
Baby, let's go.

789
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,490
(Baby, let's go.)

790
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,870
- You're awesome. Great job!
- It was Shin Yang as I thought.

791
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,070
It was Shin Yang as I thought.

792
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,460
- Suk Jin, what was that?
- What is wrong with us?

793
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,760
Why didn't you say the answer?

794
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,170
- I didn't watch many dramas.
- The Cha Family! The Cha Family!

795
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,180
- The Cha Family! The Cha Family!
- The Cha Family! The Cha Family!

796
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,880
- No, wait.
- Choose Suk Jin.

797
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,650
You should keep picking someone
on the same team.

798
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,800
- That's a good idea.
- We're competing with each other.

799
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,180
- Wait.
- Why do you hit only me?

800
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,010
- Dong Mi, come on.
- Dong Mi, this is unfair.

801
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,190
My gosh. Dong Mi.

802
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,540
- Dong Mi, come back now. Good job.
- Good choice.

803
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,090
- Why did you pick our team again?
- Good job.

804
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,710
Why would you keep picking
our team, Dong Mi?

805
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,980
I can choose anyone I want.

806
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,860
- This is war. Okay.
- This is war.

807
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,480
- This is war. Bring it on.
- Listen to me.

808
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,490
It's not about your family. We have
issues with that particular person.

809
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,720
- That's right. What?
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

810
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,030
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

811
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,870
- Stop it. How dare you?
- How dare you?

812
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,370
- "How dare you?" My gosh.
- Be respectful to my family.

813
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,110
You want a fight between
your family and mine?

814
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,470
- Why not?
- Let's do that.

815
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,970
- You want a fight?
- Oh, goodness. Wait, Chung Hwa.

816
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,680
Why would you come only at me?
Oh, goodness. Wait, Chung Hwa.

817
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,580
(Oh, goodness. Wait.
Why would you come only at me?)

818
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,240
I must be the easiest target
for her.

819
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,180
- This is not necessary.
- He's the easiest target.

820
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,010
- Come on. Let's not do this.
- Calm down.

821
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,590
Jae Hwa, imitate a rooster again.

822
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,780
(Cock-a-doodle-doo!)

823
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,130
(The rooster declared peace.)

824
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,590
- That was good.
- Please sit down.

825
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,980
- Good job, Jae Hwa.
- I love it.

826
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,900
- That was great.
- I couldn't complain to Dong Mi.

827
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,330
It always makes me laugh.

828
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,130
It didn't make our hearts flutter,
so we'll give you only one point.

829
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,400
Why? I mean, why?
It made my heart flutter.

830
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,460
If we act well, will you give us
one point?

831
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,460
We'll give you one point
if your acting satisfies everyone.

832
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,270
- Make their hearts flutter.
- Really? Then we'll try it.

833
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,680
- Try what?
- Say, "Baby, let's go."

834
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,970
If you fail, you'll lose one point.

835
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,000
Suk Jin, give it a try.

836
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,270
(Suk Jin will try
because his eldest sister made him.)

837
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,440
(Ji Suk Jin as Park Shin Yang,
wearing glasses like Shin Yang)

838
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,090
(Jeon So Min as Kim Jung Eun,
99 percent similar to Jung Eun)

839
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,920
(How will he pull off
this romantic and chic line?)

840
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,360
- "Baby, let's go..."
- Never mind. It's okay.

841
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,980
- Why...
- It's okay.

842
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,020
(Never mind. It's okay!)

843
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,720
His team members gave up.

844
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,400
- That won't work.
- I tried to be gentle.

845
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,600
- Why did you...
- What was that?

846
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,170
- Why did you speak so quietly?
- That was...

847
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,070
- I mean...
- how we speak to an actual baby.

848
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,700
Like a grandfather talking
to his grandchild.

849
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,940
- "Baby, let's go. Oh, my baby."
- Hey.

850
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,800
Hey, he's my little brother.

851
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,440
- Don't say such a thing.
- Your little brother?

852
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,350
- He was born in the 1990s.
- Why should I even care?

853
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,010
- You little...
- What? Keep talking.

854
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,090
- Your eyebrows are too far apart.
- What?

855
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,920
My eyebrows...

856
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,980
I look just like my mom.
I take after her.

857
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,710
Hey, don't talk about
your real family.

858
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,980
(I look just like my mom!
I take after her!)

859
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,780
(He's explaining the laws of
genetics in an angry tone of voice.)

860
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,430
- You look just like your mom too.
- Come on. Stop it.

861
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,900
- Let's not mention our families.
- Calm down.

862
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,190
Don't talk about our real families.

863
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,370
- I look just like my mom.
- Let's not talk about our families.

864
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,490
- Hey.
- We shouldn't...

865
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,900
My gosh. His eyebrows really are
so far apart.

866
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,640
Dong Mi just said his eyebrows
really are far apart.

867
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,730
- Haha.
- His eyebrows really are far apart.

868
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,970
I must say, his eyebrows
really are far apart.

869
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,580
You look just like your mom too.

870
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,610
Gosh, Haha. Don't talk about
our real families.

871
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,010
- Do not mention our families.
- That was unexpected.

872
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,390
Will there be any actresses?

873
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,420
- Any questions of an actress?
- There will be.

874
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
- Yes, there will be.
- Are you confident with actresses?

875
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,450
- Just in case.
- But you didn't say...

876
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,750
You didn't say anything until now.

877
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,860
She doesn't know anything.

878
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,990
All she did was imitate a rooster.
Am I right?

879
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,990
(All she did was imitate a rooster.
Am I right?)

880
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,100
(The rooster sound resonated
in the studio so many times.)

881
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
Ms. Rooster.

882
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,730
- By the way, Jae Hwa...
- Did we receive money?

883
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,730
I don't know why,
but Jae Hwa seems like...

884
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,730
someone I've seen
in my neighborhood.

885
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,340
- I feel the same way.
- I feel familiar with her too.

886
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,680
- Actually, many people say...
- You feel familiar with her, right?

887
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,700
- that I look like their aunts.
- Exactly.

888
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,940
I feel so familiar with her.

889
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,270
You look like my aunt
on my mother's side.

890
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,850
- She looks like my aunt.
- Really?

891
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,440
- I feel so familiar with her.
- Thank you.

892
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,920
Here goes the next question.

893
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
(It's time for the next question!)

894
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,750
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

895
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,090
- Let me answer.
- Me! Me!

896
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,290
- Jae Hwa was faster.
- That's Na Moon Hee's scene.

897
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,400
"Pumpkin sweet potato!"

898
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,960
(Na Moon Hee's
"Pumpkin sweet potato!)

899
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,990
Why?

900
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,870
We knew the answer too. Darn it.

901
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,260
- We got one question right.
- I did it!

902
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,530
(They're celebrating
by imitating a rooster!)

903
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,340
Pumpkin sweet potato.
Pumpkin sweet potato!

904
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,110
(The scene from "High Kick!")

905
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,080
Pumpkin sweet potato!
Are you happy now?

906
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,580
- Nice!
- That was good.

907
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,920
She's so cheerful and energetic.

908
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,980
- We should get some points.
- I want to get a question right.

909
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,190
- We really should.
- I bet we'll get two points.

910
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,190
- I did it.
- You get two points. It was great.

911
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,550
- Okay!
- Thank you.

912
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,550
Here you go.

913
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,790
How could you give them an extra
point because she has a loud voice?

914
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,130
How well she imitated the actress
is important.

915
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,690
- Take this!
- It's important.

916
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,690
(He dodged it successfully.)

917
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,170
- Hey, you can't dodge it.
- I didn't get hit.

918
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,800
- I didn't get hit.
- Why would you dodge it?

919
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,110
(The crazy combination
of dodging and being cheeky)

920
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,110
Gosh, he dodged again.

921
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,440
(The crazy combination
of dodging and being cheeky)

922
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,380
He dodged all her attacks.

923
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,270
(Hitting)

924
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,820
- Oh, gosh.
- I'm sorry.

925
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,590
She hit me with her fist.
With her fist.

926
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,850
You made her upset.

927
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,090
- Gosh, seriously.
- Jae Hwa did a great job.

928
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,550
- Are you giving this to us?
- What a shame.

929
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,720
We can't seem to get questions right
even when we know the answer.

930
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,930
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

931
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,860
- Don't worry.
- I knew all the answers.

932
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
Show them the photo.

933
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,790
- Who could that be?
- What's that?

934
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,100
- Isn't that Haha's mouth?
- Ants...

935
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,370
Isn't that Haha's mouth?

936
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,460
- Let me answer. It's you.
- Let me answer.

937
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,670
- Let me answer.
- Haha, go ahead.

938
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,910
- 3, 2, 1.
- Ants...

939
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,910
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

940
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,580
- Oh, right.
- What's that?

941
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,920
<i>I got a mosquito bite on my foot</i>

942
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,440
(The scene from
"High Kick Through the Roof")

943
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,590
(The eldest sisters don't seem
to have figured out.)

944
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,330
- 3, 2, 1.
- It's Kwang Soo.

945
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,890
The mosquito song. Let me know.

946
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,130
(They know the answer, but...)

947
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,990
- Mosquito... What was it?
- Three.

948
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,330
<i>- Because it was itching
- I got a mosquito bite</i>

949
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,990
<i>A mosquito bite, it was itching</i>

950
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,990
(Big Nose Mosquito can't control
his arms and legs.)

951
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,170
Oh, no. Why...

952
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,410
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

953
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,700
<i>I got a mosquito bite last night</i>

954
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,080
<i>It itched</i>

955
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,700
- Okay!
- Good job.

956
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,380
- Why didn't you recognize yourself?
- I didn't know.

957
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,540
- It was you!
- Oh, yes!

958
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,270
- I said the same thing.
- 1, 2...

959
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,680
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

960
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,980
(The 3 siblings of the Kim Family
are roaring.)

961
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,280
- My gosh.
- That was...

962
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
Oh, my. I didn't know.

963
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,590
Why didn't you recognize yourself?

964
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,820
Does my mouth look like that?

965
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,360
- Yes. It looks ugly.
- I thought it was chicken gizzard.

966
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,190
He's the one who should be called
Mr. Dirty Mustache.

967
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,900
- Don't call me that.
- You called me Mr. Dirty Mustache.

968
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,600
- No.
- Kwang Soo should be called that.

969
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,830
- Gosh. I didn't know.
- We knew the answer.

970
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,690
- He and Suk Jin... I mean,
- But I didn't know the lyrics.

971
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,730
Jae Suk and Suk Jin knew
all the answers,

972
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,570
but they couldn't say
the exact lines.

973
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,270
<i>- I got a mosquito bite
</i>- That's because...

974
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,080
- we're too nervous, So Min.
- Wasn't that the answer?

975
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,770
- Don't be nervous.
- But they knew the answers.

976
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,270
- Don't be nervous.
- It's because we're too nervous.

977
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,040
We're always one second behind.

978
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,320
- Okay, we'll move on.
- Here's the next one.

979
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,820
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

980
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,120
- Answer it.
- Let me answer!

981
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,510
- Let me answer.
- Answer it!

982
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,690
- Hold on.
- Let me answer.

983
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,050
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer. Jang Hyuk!

984
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,390
Jang Hyuk.

985
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,950
3, 2, 1.

986
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,830
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

987
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,960
"As if. I'll buy you instead."

988
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,260
What?

989
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,600
Just stay still, will you?

990
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,370
- "How much..."
- Just stay put.

991
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,200
- You're embarrassing me.
- But I'm right.

992
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,230
"As if."

993
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,340
His teeth aren't straight.

994
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,410
It has to be Jae Suk's.

995
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,680
- Yes, Jae Suk's.
- No, it's not me.

996
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,740
- Yours...
- I think he's right.

997
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,080
- Mine is worse.
- I think you're right.

998
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,440
- Can't you tell?
- No.

999
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,710
Here's the next clue.

1000
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,120
(The 2nd clue)

1001
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,550
- Wait, it's Choi Min Su.
- Let me answer!

1002
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,550
"Am I trembling?"

1003
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,690
- That's not it.
- Let me answer!

1004
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,450
- Let me answer!
- Is that not it?

1005
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,360
"I thought I'd be able
to have you."

1006
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,790
- That's the one.
- "I thought..."

1007
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,260
- Okay!
- Are you kidding me?

1008
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,460
Nicely done.

1009
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,730
- I should've answered instead.
- It was Choi Min Su.

1010
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,990
(Suk Jin keeps throwing away
his team's chances.)

1011
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,170
- I...
- Nicely done.

1012
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,700
I made it sound like the original.

1013
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,030
"I thought I'd be able..."

1014
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,680
- "to have you."
- You're so good.

1015
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,380
"Because you're mine!"

1016
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,540
- "Because you're mine!"
- My gosh.

1017
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,940
- I thought I'd be able to have you.
- So that was the one.

1018
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,350
- He's so good.
- Can you believe it?

1019
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,780
- He's really good.
- I know.

1020
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,010
I can't believe it.

1021
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,620
- He's so good.
- That's my brother for you.

1022
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,510
- How did you know?
- He's good, isn't he?

1023
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,890
"I thought I'd be able to have you."

1024
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,550
I have the worst brothers!

1025
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,100
That team's on a roll.

1026
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,790
She needs to hit someone.

1027
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,690
Don't you dare hit me.

1028
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,030
(She chooses him to hit.)

1029
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,190
Nice one.

1030
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,840
You're going to pay for that.

1031
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,970
Just wait and see
how I get my revenge.

1032
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,910
He never manages to though.

1033
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,040
He's too weak.

1034
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,240
- That's how he always is.
- He's all words.

1035
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,650
- An opportunity never comes.
- There's nothing he can do.

1036
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,850
(Suk Jin's threats can be ignored.)

1037
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,010
We'll get it right this time.

1038
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,320
Let's get it right this time.

1039
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,420
Let's focus, okay?

1040
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,120
- Say that we'll answer first.
- I was the fastest earlier.

1041
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,280
Here we go.

1042
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,450
Here's the next question.

1043
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,720
Let me answer!

1044
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,950
(So Min quickly announces
that her team will answer.)

1045
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,950
(The Cha Family
gets the chance to answer first.)

1046
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,720
- "Hey, it's a goal."
- No.

1047
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,030
That's not it.

1048
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,460
(Why would it be
a soccer commentator?)

1049
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,370
"Hey, it's a goal."

1050
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,960
- Is that not it?
- Me!

1051
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,140
(Of course, it's wrong.)

1052
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,300
I know what it is.

1053
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,110
- Hurry.
- How can one know what this is?

1054
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,700
- "Double or nothing."
- Se Chan!

1055
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,120
- I think you're right.
- Okay, go for it.

1056
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,320
"Double or nothing."

1057
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,780
Nice!

1058
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,150
("Double or nothing"
is the correct answer.)

1059
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,120
- Really?
- I can't believe it!

1060
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,950
"Double or nothing."

1061
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,530
"Double or nothing."

1062
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,780
(The Shin Family wins two points!)

1063
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,800
How can one know that?

1064
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,150
- No way.
- How did you know?

1065
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,630
(Se Chan, the teeth whisperer)

1066
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,130
You're amazing.

1067
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,220
I just got that feeling.

1068
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,400
I'm just perceptive, that's all.

1069
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Double or nothing.

1070
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,530
(From the movie "Tazza")

1071
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,340
How can one know?

1072
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,440
You're killing me.

1073
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,170
- Shouldn't we at least get one?
- What do we do?

1074
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,970
- Let's at least get one right.
- We're still at zero points.

1075
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,280
- You've got to be killing me.
- We're at zero points.

1076
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,740
This isn't the quiz for us.

1077
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,190
- This...
- This isn't the quiz for us.

1078
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,260
So Min, I bet it's uncomfortable
on that team.

1079
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,150
- I don't know other people's lines.
- We're still at zero points.

1080
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,030
- Don't you worry.
- My team...

1081
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,550
Our family's a mess.

1082
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,220
- Our family...
- We're still at zero points.

1083
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,420
Not yet.

1084
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,760
- We're still in this game.
- Not yet.

1085
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,200
Our big sister
isn't doing much though.

1086
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,570
- All she does is hit people.
- Just look at her.

1087
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,570
She's like the family's cheerleader.

1088
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,070
This next round will be...

1089
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,240
just for the big sisters.

1090
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,440
- Okay.
- Just the big sisters.

1091
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,150
- We'll help.
- But I'm terrible at this.

1092
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,780
(Their pride is on the line.)

1093
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,880
- Here we go.
- But...

1094
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,170
We won't give you any hints.

1095
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,170
- I have face blindness.
- All right.

1096
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,050
How can one guess
by just looking at the mouth?

1097
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,590
- She says she has face blindness.
- Face blindness?

1098
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,860
She's ill, you know.

1099
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,880
Who has face blindness?

1100
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,530
Don't you lie.

1101
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,050
- I'm not kidding.
- Seriously?

1102
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,420
I truly have face blindness.

1103
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,590
I mean it.

1104
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,590
Well, our sister has
anger management issues.

1105
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,530
Dong Mi's the type to quietly lie.

1106
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,360
I mean it. I'm not kidding.

1107
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,670
Are you sure you're not
just out of it?

1108
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,740
Seriously?

1109
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,170
(Seriously?)

1110
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,530
(She elegantly threatens him.)

1111
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,840
- What...
- She says it elegantly though.

1112
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,380
This is only for the big sisters.

1113
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,820
- Right, go for it.
- Give us the question.

1114
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,070
Let's do this.

1115
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,550
Go, Jae Hwa!

1116
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,840
(The pride of their families
is on the line.)

1117
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,780
- What...
- Isn't that me?

1118
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,530
- Who's that?
- Who's this?

1119
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,590
- Maybe...
- Please keep your voices down.

1120
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,820
(Everyone seems to be clueless.)

1121
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,420
It's a woman.

1122
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,240
Yes, you're right.

1123
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,170
You can't tell her.

1124
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,570
We can't?

1125
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,130
- Those are the rules.
- Got it.

1126
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,530
- I...
- If no one knows,

1127
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,010
- I'll give you the next clue.
- Sure.

1128
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,280
- Here it is.
- I don't think that's it.

1129
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,200
- What...
- You know what it is!

1130
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,450
Yes, it's you.

1131
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,570
You know what it is!

1132
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,720
Please keep your voices down.

1133
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,820
Let me answer!

1134
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,840
"I can shoot!"

1135
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,090
(I can shoot!)

1136
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,590
(From the movie "Tazza")

1137
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,150
You're not wrong but...

1138
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,860
- She got it right.
- Can you say it again?

1139
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,950
- I never saw the movie.
- This...

1140
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,050
"I can shoot!"

1141
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,800
(It's not similar at all.)

1142
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,860
- Have you not seen the movie?
- No.

1143
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
- Let me answer.
- I never saw the movie.

1144
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,630
That should count
as a correct answer.

1145
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,260
- Let me answer.
- Unbelievable.

1146
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,670
- Which movie is it from?
- Dong Mi?

1147
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,200
- That's the one.
- Go ahead.

1148
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,110
- "I can shoot!"
- Are you kidding me?

1149
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,470
Are you serious?

1150
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,320
- Seriously?
- Let me answer!

1151
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,880
- Jae Hwa, you're up.
- Seriously?

1152
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,150
"I can shoot!"

1153
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,010
- Let me answer.
- Jae Hwa, go ahead.

1154
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,010
"I can shoot!"

1155
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,360
Nicely done.

1156
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,420
That wasn't it.

1157
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,150
"I can shoot!"

1158
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,200
- It's not right.
- Let me answer.

1159
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,360
Chung Hwa, go ahead.

1160
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,700
(The Cha Family
gets another chance.)

1161
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,800
(Eyes are wide.)

1162
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,090
She's just putting on an act.

1163
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,130
"I..."

1164
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,200
"I can shoot."

1165
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,570
- Seriously?
- That's not it!

1166
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,110
- No way.
- You haven't seen the movie.

1167
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,700
- Jae Hwa.
- No one saw the movie.

1168
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,070
"I can shoot."

1169
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,740
- No, that's not the right tone.
- It's not.

1170
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,070
- "I can shoot."
- No way.

1171
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,050
- That's not right.
- "I can shoot."

1172
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,340
It was similar this time.

1173
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,490
That wasn't right.

1174
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,990
- There.
- It wasn't bad.

1175
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,150
- It's from "Tazza".
- Right.

1176
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,650
"I can shoot."

1177
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,190
So Min's good at this. Show them.

1178
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,420
"I can shoot."

1179
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,150
- Show them.
- "I can shoot."

1180
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,490
That's the correct tone?

1181
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,590
(It's supposed to be
in a melancholy tone.)

1182
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,820
We almost had it this time.

1183
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,740
This is how it's done.
"I can shoot."

1184
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,070
"Lower that gun."

1185
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,840
"I can shoot, you know.
I can shoot."

1186
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,300
I can shoot as well.

1187
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,610
- That's how it's done.
- Of course.

1188
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,110
(That's how it's done.)

1189
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,240
"I can shoot."

1190
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,970
Your tone was all wrong.

1191
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,220
"I can shoot." That was just wrong.

1192
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,760
- "I can shoot."
- "I can shoot."

1193
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,650
It was adorable though.

1194
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,950
Is it okay for us
to take all the points though?

1195
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,920
I'm sorry,
but can I have my seat back?

1196
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,300
(I'm sorry,
but can I have my seat back?)

1197
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,670
- Seriously?
- Oh, sorry.

1198
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,320
- Don't forget our youngest.
- Where did my seat go?

1199
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,840
- Sorry about that.
- You were hoarding the chairs.

1200
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,170
- Get ready.
- Here's the last question.

1201
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,360
- Let's get it right this time.
- It's the last question.

1202
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,110
- Let's get it right.
- Let's at least get one.

1203
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,800
We're still at zero points.
Wait, who's this?

1204
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,340
Wait, who's this?

1205
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,470
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1206
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,720
Three...

1207
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,450
"Do I have the face of a king?"

1208
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,320
That's what I thought too.

1209
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,880
I knew it as well.

1210
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,450
I knew it too.

1211
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,130
Okay!

1212
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,760
(We did it.)

1213
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,590
(The Kim Family scores 2 points.)

1214
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,400
- In 2, 3, 4.
- 2, 3, 4.

1215
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,990
(They can't leave out
the rooster sound.)

1216
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,760
(From the movie "The Face Reader")

1217
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,630
- The tone wasn't right though.
- Right.

1218
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,740
- "Do I have the face of a king?"
- Exactly.

1219
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,450
- That's how it should be.
- The acting was off.

1220
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,220
Anyone who says it better
will receive a point.

1221
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,240
- Chung Hwa, you're up.
- Go for it.

1222
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,780
"Do I have the face of..."

1223
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,320
Will you please watch some movies?

1224
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,420
- She must not watch movies.
- Try watching some movies.

1225
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,920
(All she does is give wrong answers
with over-the-top acting.)

1226
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,300
- Jae Hwa, go ahead.
- I'll give it a go.

1227
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,590
"Do I..."

1228
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,820
- Are you sure about this?
- "have the face of a king?"

1229
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,220
- You haven't seen it, have you?
- Go ahead.

1230
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,260
Of course, I've seen it.

1231
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,940
Why haven't you watched any movies?

1232
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,260
- I have.
- I have too,

1233
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,940
- but my voice...
- Go ahead.

1234
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,780
(Suk Jin's getting into character.)

1235
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,280
- Suk Jin's going to try it.
- Let's hear from Suk Jin.

1236
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,510
- Let's see.
- I'm curious.

1237
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,450
(Determined)

1238
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,170
"Do I have the face of a king?"

1239
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,380
(He's just doing a voice impression
of himself.)

1240
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,780
You just said that
in your own voice.

1241
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,990
That's just your own voice.

1242
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,780
"Do I..."

1243
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,420
"have the face of a king?"

1244
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,860
That was perfect.

1245
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,920
- Perfect.
- Nice!

1246
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,470
- We're at zero points.
- It isn't over yet though.

1247
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,130
- What do we do?
- We have more games to play.

1248
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,570
- Is there more?
- Of course.

1249
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,570
- There are more games.
- Let's do this.

1250
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,440
There's only a one-point difference
between the winner and runner-up.

1251
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,170
(The result of the game)

1252
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,300
The winner is...

1253
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,840
- It's definitely not us.
- It's already over for us.

1254
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,970
- It's not us.
- It can't be us.

1255
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,920
- The winner is...
- It's us.

1256
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,570
Get ready to cry like a rooster.

1257
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,340
- The Shin Family.
- Okay!

1258
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,780
"I can shoot."

1259
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,760
- "I can shoot."
- "I can shoot."

1260
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,690
- "Don't be ridiculous."
- The next game...

1261
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,880
We'll just do well in the next game.

1262
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,990
- Right.
- Okay.

1263
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,590
- There are more games to play.
- It's all right.

1264
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,950
Our family's in shambles.

1265
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,760
- Nice.
- That was a tricky game.

1266
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,920
We're off to a good start.

1267
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,090
Now,

1268
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,470
it's time for the first
allowance round.

1269
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,570
My allowance.

1270
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,360
The big sisters
will enter the room first...

1271
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,400
and choose 1 out of
the 5 allowance pouches.

1272
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,470
You'll split the money you find...

1273
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,970
with your siblings.

1274
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,150
I believe in our sister.

1275
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,110
Since the Shin Family won,

1276
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,590
the five pouches...

1277
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,880
will have from 60 dollars
to 100 dollars respectively.

1278
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,450
- That's not bad.
- From 60 to 100 dollars.

1279
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,880
The team in second place...

1280
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,630
will get to choose
from 40 dollars to 80 dollars.

1281
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,720
Your team will get from
10 dollars to 50 dollars.

1282
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,990
We're off to the worst start.

1283
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,300
So the big sisters will enter
the room and pick one first.

1284
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,360
You'll check the amount
that you chose.

1285
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,700
Only I can know?

1286
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,970
You're allowed to pocket...

1287
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,840
some of the money yourself.

1288
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,110
Once you're done...

1289
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,550
sorting out all the money,

1290
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,950
the other siblings
will enter the room.

1291
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,720
- Together? Not in turns?
- Yes, together.

1292
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,380
- The siblings will enter together.
- And then what?

1293
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,150
Then the big sister...

1294
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,150
will reveal
what she'll give the siblings.

1295
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,420
I'm supposed to tell them?

1296
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,590
They could lie about the amount...

1297
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,030
after pocketing some themselves.

1298
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,320
If you're not pleased...

1299
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,920
with the amount you received,

1300
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,200
you can negotiate
with your big sister.

1301
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,420
- Okay.
- Got it.

1302
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,760
If you're not pleased
after the negotiations,

1303
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,900
you can use a chance.

1304
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,300
It can be used
when two or more siblings...

1305
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,630
- agree to it.
- Got it.

1306
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,280
So the siblings have some power too.

1307
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,440
The Mom Chance...

1308
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,700
can be used
if you think that your big sister...

1309
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,880
is lying.

1310
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,380
Then you can divide the money
she hid for herself...

1311
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,340
and her allowance equally.

1312
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,340
(The younger siblings will take
her money if it succeeds.)

1313
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,880
- What if she didn't lie?
- If she didn't lie,

1314
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,780
she gets the money
that her younger siblings have.

1315
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,990
(If it fails, the eldest sister gets
half the money her siblings have.)

1316
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,420
But I need
the other siblings' consent, right?

1317
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,200
Correct. More than two siblings have
to agree on using the Mom Chance.

1318
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,920
2 siblings on this team,
and also 2 siblings on that team.

1319
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,900
- Or you can use the Dad Chance too.
- "The Dad Chance"?

1320
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,440
If you're not happy with the amount
your sister gave you...

1321
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,760
regardless of whether or not
she lied,

1322
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,260
you can use the Dad Chance.

1323
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,610
For example, your sister
picked 100 dollars.

1324
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,340
You can give the full amount
to one sibling in your family,

1325
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,570
and no money to the others
based on a draw.

1326
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,780
- That sounds great.
- Okay.

1327
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,470
- The Dad Chance is good.
- I love it.

1328
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,740
- It's great.
- However,

1329
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,110
each time you use the Dad Chance,

1330
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,780
one more person will get a penalty
at the end of the show.

1331
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,090
- That's great.
- But it's too risky.

1332
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,360
The Dad Chance is so risky.

1333
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,260
- Indeed.
- I'm not sure about it.

1334
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,260
(Each time they use the chance,
1 more person will get a penalty.)

1335
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,400
I like the Dad Chance.

1336
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,800
It's our style.
I like the Dad Chance.

1337
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,570
But you may lose the allowance
you received if you get unlucky.

1338
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,670
- Understood.
- Okay.

1339
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,240
- We won't get much money anyway.
- That's true.

1340
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,530
She may pick a good one.

1341
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,700
Pick a good one?

1342
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,130
Our family has class.
We should trust Dong Mi.

1343
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,740
- Of course, we trust Dong Mi.
- Yes.

1344
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,570
I mean, she didn't contribute
much to winning.

1345
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,670
- I'm sure she'll be reasonable.
- "I can shoot."

1346
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,550
Now, the big sisters will leave.

1347
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,150
- Let's go!
- Chung Hwa, go on.

1348
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,650
- Okay.
- Dong Mi.

1349
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,130
- Dong Mi, we trust you.
- Good luck.

1350
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,650
I know, right?

1351
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,490
From 40 to 80 dollars...

1352
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,200
- If I pick 80 dollars, I will...
- Yes.

1353
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,900
pocket some of it.

1354
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,490
If you pick 80 dollars?
How many siblings do you have? 2?

1355
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,070
- I have two siblings.
- My sisters.

1356
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,940
- Dong Mi.
- Hi, Dong Mi.

1357
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,300
What are you going to do?

1358
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,340
- If I get a larger amount,
- Yes.

1359
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,610
- I'll pocket some of it.
- I see.

1360
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,240
- I'll do the same.
- You'll pocket some too?

1361
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,950
Right.

1362
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,450
This is an individual game.

1363
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,550
- That's right.
- Exactly.

1364
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,010
- It's an individual game after all.
- True.

1365
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,590
And they would betray us anyway.

1366
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,320
Even if we were family.

1367
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,510
- I have a feeling somehow.
- Really?

1368
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,690
(Chung Hwa knows Running Man
so well.)

1369
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,360
- I think we should pocket money.
- I see.

1370
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,990
- It's an individual game.
- We're competing too.

1371
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,490
- Try not to lose your money.
- Of course.

1372
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,470
- Good luck.
- 1, 2, 3.

1373
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,760
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

1374
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,970
Please come this way.

1375
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,990
- Bye. Good luck.
- Good luck.

1376
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,940
(Will they pick a large amount
so they can pocket some money?)

1377
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,610
Can I pick one of these?

1378
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,340
Yes. There are 100, 90, 80, 70,
and 60 dollars in those 5 pouches.

1379
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,380
You can choose one of them.

1380
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,340
I see.

1381
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
All right.

1382
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:10,590
I pick this one.

1383
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,320
I don't think
there's much money in here.

1384
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,860
(How much money could there be
in the pouch she picked?)

1385
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,630
Wait. 1, 2... And 7.

1386
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,420
I have 100 dollars.

1387
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,240
You picked 100 dollars.

1388
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,090
I picked 100 dollars.
What should I do?

1389
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,130
I must make a smart decision.

1390
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,570
(How much money will she
give to her siblings?)

1391
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:33,300
- 100 dollars...
- And the amount for your siblings.

1392
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:38,170
(The Cha Family gets to choose
from 50 to 10 dollars.)

1393
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,650
This one.

1394
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,690
Please let me have 50 dollars.

1395
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,690
(Chung Hwa desperately hopes
to get the largest amount.)

1396
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,050
What do I do?

1397
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:49,720
What am I going to do?

1398
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,720
I choose this one.

1399
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,220
(The Kim Family gets to choose
from 80 to 40 dollars.)

1400
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,300
My goodness.

1401
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,220
What do I do?

1402
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,400
I didn't expect... What should I do?

1403
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,030
Gosh, seriously. What should I do?

1404
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,110
(Jae Hwa got flustered to find out
the amount. How much did she get?)

1405
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,340
I think Jae Hwa needs to
go through a harsh initiation.

1406
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,670
We should teach her
what a variety show is like.

1407
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,700
- Okay. If we don't like the amount,
- Yes.

1408
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,170
- let's use the Dad Chance.
- Okay.

1409
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,780
- Come in.
- Jae Hwa!

1410
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,190
Come on in, my brothers.

1411
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,610
- Did you pick a good one?
- Jae Hwa.

1412
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,220
(You picked a good one, right?)

1413
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,720
- I'm not suspicious of you at all.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1414
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,260
- For what?
- You trust me, right?

1415
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,920
- Yes, I do.
- Sit down for now.

1416
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,070
- I trust you.
- Actually, I...

1417
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,970
We got to choose
from 80 to 40 dollars.

1418
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,170
- From 80 to 40 dollars?
- I see.

1419
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,630
So the smallest amount is
40 dollars.

1420
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,240
But I...

1421
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:40,300
I tried to measure the thickness
of the pouches.

1422
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,780
- I see.
- But...

1423
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,970
unfortunately, I chose...

1424
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,720
40 dollars.

1425
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,860
(The smallest amount?)

1426
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,860
- You chose 40 dollars?
- So...

1427
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,050
So I'll give you guys...

1428
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:57,320
(She can't even look them
in the eyes...)

1429
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,550
(while giving 10 dollars
to each of them.)

1430
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,950
Let's divide the money like this
for now.

1431
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:04,320
Wait. You picked the smallest amount
among the five pouches?

1432
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,760
- Yes. You have to believe me.
- It just happened that way?

1433
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,010
You want us to believe you?

1434
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,740
- I'm being honest. They all know.
- I'm sorry...

1435
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,900
I'm sorry, but can Haha and I
sit together?

1436
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,510
Wait. No, hang on a second.

1437
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,340
(He's trying to isolate her.)

1438
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,880
Wait. You should see what I'll do
with the remaining amount.

1439
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,820
I'm going to...

1440
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,090
You picked 40 dollars
even when you touched the pouches?

1441
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,690
- Yes.
- You checked the thickness.

1442
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,450
- You touched every pouch, right?
- Yes, I touched all of them.

1443
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,950
I thought it was the one
with 80 dollars in it.

1444
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,920
- So who gets the extra 10 dollars?
- I think...

1445
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,720
the youngest one should have it.

1446
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,920
Thank you, Jae Hwa.

1447
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,220
You even gave him that money?

1448
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,530
I have three children.

1449
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:37,590
(The 2nd child Kim Kwang Soo is
about to snap.)

1450
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:38,740
- That's one of the reasons.
- Thank you.

1451
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,630
How do we use
the Mom and Dad Chances?

1452
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,760
- Can we just tell you?
- If Haha agrees, you can use it.

1453
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,440
You better not use it...

1454
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,940
because I'm innocent.

1455
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,150
Do you mind if we discuss this
without you?

1456
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,950
- Will you really be like this?
- Just for a moment.

1457
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,010
Sure. Go ahead.

1458
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,740
- I won't hear you guys.
- Even if we use the Dad Chance,

1459
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,510
and one more person
receives the penalty,

1460
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:56,720
you won't be that person.

1461
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,550
That's not true.
Besides, I trust Jae Hwa.

1462
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,690
(He betrayed Kwang Soo right away.)

1463
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,450
- What you said on our way here...
- It's not like that.

1464
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,530
- You should keep it together.
- I trust...

1465
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,700
- Right. You should trust me.
- Hold on.

1466
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,720
- Little brother.
- Kwang Soo,

1467
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,860
can't you trust her?

1468
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,740
Listen to me.

1469
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,860
If you guys use a chance, I'll be
the only one to benefit from it.

1470
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,900
- Because I'm innocent.
- Right. You're being honest.

1471
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,170
You looked me in the eyes
as you walked in.

1472
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,670
- You two should discuss this.
- Then let's do this.

1473
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,900
(But Kwang Soo seems to want to
use the Mom Chance.)

1474
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,240
If you agree to be the youngest
instead of me,

1475
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,240
(If he agrees to be the youngest,
Haha will agree on using it.)

1476
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,610
I'll agree on using a chance.

1477
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,610
Being the second eldest is
too much for me, to be honest.

1478
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,320
I mean it.

1479
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,510
It suits you better.

1480
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,280
I agree on using the Mom Chance...

1481
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,360
in return for switching our orders.

1482
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,130
- We'll use the Mom Chance, right?
- The two of you are...

1483
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,800
- suspicious of your sister,
- Yes.

1484
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,490
so you decided to use
the Mom Chance, right?

1485
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,030
Your sister Kim Jae Hwa...

1486
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,360
(If she lied,
they'll get her money.)

1487
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,440
did...

1488
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,300
(If she didn't lie,
she'll get their money.)

1489
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,700
- not lie to you.
- Gosh.

1490
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,740
(Jae Hwa told them the truth.)

1491
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,840
You mean jerk.

1492
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,340
I told you to believe her.

1493
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,670
- Did you really pick 40 dollars?
- Because she really picked it,

1494
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,240
- things turned out this way.
- I really picked 40 dollars.

1495
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,720
I think I was wrong.

1496
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,950
(Earlier on, Jae Hwa picked
the smallest amount, 40 dollars.)

1497
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,050
40 dollars.

1498
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,550
I'll make them doubt me...

1499
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,880
and use the Mom Chance
or the Dad Chance.

1500
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,490
I'll give 10 dollars
to each of the 3 of us,

1501
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,360
and I'll give Haha extra 10 dollars.

1502
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,070
- 40 dollars out of the 5 pouches?
- Yes.

1503
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,800
Also, I knew you guys would
use the Mom Chance.

1504
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,400
I planned this to get more money.

1505
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,070
Look how messed up our family is.

1506
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,170
- Look who's talking.
- I mean,

1507
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,510
I need more money.

1508
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,650
10 dollars isn't enough.
Hurry up and give me the money.

1509
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,320
You have to give her half
the amount you have.

1510
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,550
- Should I give her 10 dollars?
- Yes.

1511
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,780
- Thank you.
- We'll break the bill.

1512
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,920
(10 dollars from Haha,
5 dollars from Kwang Soo)

1513
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,950
Thank you.

1514
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,650
You see, I did this to make it fun.

1515
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:45,590
1... 10 dollars. 20 dollars...

1516
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,220
1, 2, 3, 4...

1517
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,760
I didn't know she was so cheeky.

1518
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,340
I'm sorry, but by doing this,

1519
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,570
I got an extra 25 dollars.

1520
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,470
This is how you should
make a deal.

1521
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,800
- That was smart.
- I know, right?

1522
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,610
(While the Kim brothers got tricked
by their sister Jae Hwa...)

1523
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,840
- Chung Hwa.
- Announce the amount, Chung Hwa.

1524
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,880
How much money did you pick?

1525
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,470
- Be honest with us.
- How much?

1526
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,650
- Come on. Tell us now.
- 20 dollars.

1527
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,220
- How much?
- 20 dollars.

1528
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,690
- But I think I did a good job.
- 20 dollars...

1529
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,860
It's not good.
It's not even the average.

1530
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,490
- The maximum amount was 50 dollars.
- Yes.

1531
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:15,690
So I asked to break the bills
into 20 1-dollar bills,

1532
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:16,820
so we could
divide the money equally.

1533
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,130
- Chung Hwa.
- Yes?

1534
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,530
- Did you really choose 20 dollars?
- Yes.

1535
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:20,650
That's weird.

1536
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:23,220
- 20 dollars is easy to divide.
- Chung Hwa, look me in the eyes.

1537
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,840
- They don't believe me. I'm upset.
- It's because...

1538
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,470
it's not easy to pick the amount
that you can divide easily.

1539
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,740
- Absolutely.
- That's why I changed the bills.

1540
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,970
Can you look me in the eyes?

1541
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,940
- How much money did you choose?
- 20 dollars.

1542
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,550
- All right.
- He liked it.

1543
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:36,740
I picked 20 dollars.

1544
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,900
- Suk Jin liked it.
- That was natural.

1545
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,970
- I really picked 20 dollars.
- It really was natural.

1546
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:43,050
It was natural,
but she's a great actress.

1547
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,550
Because this is my first time
on a variety show,

1548
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,610
- I want to ride on your coattails.
- That makes me suspicious of her.

1549
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,990
- It's so easy to divide equally.
- We've never divided team money...

1550
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,590
equally like this on Running Man.
I'm taken aback.

1551
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,700
- Really?
- Yes.

1552
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,950
But I'm suspicious of her
because it's...

1553
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,970
- I think we should trust her.
- I think we should trust her too.

1554
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,760
- Trust her. I think it's true.
- Let's trust her.

1555
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,340
I want to use the Mom Chance.

1556
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,440
- The Mom Chance?
- You can't decide alone.

1557
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,570
- You need our consent.
- More than two siblings.

1558
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,700
Trust me and don't use it.

1559
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,200
- Shall we not use it?
- Come on. Trust me.

1560
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,880
- Let's not use a chance now.
- Let's not use it.

1561
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,900
- Let's use it next time.
- Right.

1562
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,010
- So you decided not to use it?
- We won't use it.

1563
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,340
- We won't use any chances.
- We'll trust her.

1564
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,340
The siblings of the Cha Family...

1565
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,550
didn't use any chances and gained
the amount Chung Hwa gave you.

1566
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,550
- That's right.
- Yes.

1567
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,380
- Each of you received five dollars.
- It's not a lot.

1568
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,510
- That's right.
- This is...

1569
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,690
Also, the eldest,

1570
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,490
- Chung Hwa, actually got...
- Yes?

1571
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:24,530
How much did she get?

1572
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,620
(And the eldest, Chung Hwa...)

1573
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,640
a total of 35 dollars.

1574
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,080
You see?

1575
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:43,180
- You see?
- Hey!

1576
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,430
I didn't know you'd share this.

1577
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:48,350
My goodness, I feel so betrayed!

1578
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:49,990
Chung Hwa picked 50 dollars.

1579
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,200
- You see?
- Chung Hwa!

1580
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,200
(Actually, Chung Hwa picked
the highest amount.)

1581
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,490
Why would you tell them?

1582
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:55,930
- That's how this works.
- You never told me that!

1583
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,600
What on earth?

1584
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,640
(Chung Hwa's trick
that's been revealed to everyone)

1585
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,370
(A while ago)

1586
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,370
No way!

1587
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,810
I have no choice
but to take 30 dollars.

1588
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,470
Chung Hwa, I'm a bit hurt.

1589
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,640
We should've used
the Mom Chance, So Min.

1590
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,140
Why didn't you tell me about that?

1591
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,910
- I forgot.
- That's crazy!

1592
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:17,290
- But that's...
- I got this. I got this, okay?

1593
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,680
Fine! I don't care about family now.

1594
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,990
In the next round...

1595
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,370
Oh, no. I should've picked
a lesser amount!

1596
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:25,830
I picked 100 dollars,
what should I do?

1597
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:28,930
What should I do?

1598
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,260
(She's having a lot of thoughts
after picking a large sum of money.)

1599
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,330
Well...

1600
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:34,510
- We're coming in!
- Okay!

1601
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,810
I should take off my shoes, right?

1602
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,200
- My sister...
- My siblings who I'm proud of.

1603
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,040
- My sister...
- Dong Mi.

1604
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,450
- Did you pick a good one?
- My siblings who I'm proud of.

1605
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:43,680
Did you pick a good one?

1606
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,290
- My siblings who I'm proud of.
- Did you pick a good one?

1607
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,490
(Jong Kook checks
the smell of Se Chan's feet.)

1608
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,990
Why is he smelling that?

1609
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:52,660
- Wait a minute. Hey, Kim Nipple.
- Then...

1610
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,060
How dare you smell my shoes?

1611
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:57,370
Se Chan, your socks
are already so dirty.

1612
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:58,560
No, they seem fine.

1613
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,100
- Are they?
- They smell nice today.

1614
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,370
Ji Hyo, smell this.

1615
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,370
- No. Come on, Se Chan.
- What's wrong with you?

1616
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,560
- I'll teach you a lesson.
- I can't love your smelly feet.

1617
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,410
So... Did you pick a good one?

1618
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:10,910
I'm really bad at these things,
but I picked a good one.

1619
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,850
- Really?
- Yes, I picked a good one.

1620
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,080
I picked a very appropriate one.

1621
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,120
Appropriate?

1622
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,140
- That means she picked 60 dollars.
- That sounds not right.

1623
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,740
- 80 dollars? 60 dollars?
- I picked a very appropriate one.

1624
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,680
Dong Mi isn't talented in anything,

1625
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,680
- Right. I picked a perfect one.
- but I guess she picked a good one.

1626
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,260
- That's great.
- What did you pick?

1627
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,560
- How much did you pick?
- For Se Chan...

1628
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,930
Yes? Are you giving it out now?

1629
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:27,990
- Yes, of course.
- Right.

1630
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,430
- Se Chan...
- Se Chan did an excellent job.

1631
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:30,930
- He did.
- Thank you.

1632
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,200
- I'll give you 20 dollars.
- 20 dollars?

1633
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,990
- 20 dollars?
- 20 dollars? I'm happy with that.

1634
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,160
- And Ji Hyo...
- How much did you get in total?

1635
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:38,700
- gets 10 dollars.
- 10 dollars?

1636
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,810
- Then that's 30 dollars in total.
- Hold on.

1637
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,180
- And...
- Then how much is she giving me?

1638
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,510
- What? 5 dollars?
- 8 dollars?

1639
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,310
- I worked hard.
- Here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1640
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:46,510
5 dollars?

1641
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,870
(5 dollars?)

1642
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:48,910
(The youngest, Jong Kook,
gets 5 dollars.)

1643
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:50,580
- You're giving 5 dollars to him?
- Jong Kook...

1644
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,450
- gets 5 dollars.
- Dong Mi.

1645
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,490
- How much did you get?
- We can negotiate, you see.

1646
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,510
- How much did you get?
- I got...

1647
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,930
- 35 dollars.
- That's a little...

1648
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:00,530
- What? Come on.
- 35 dollars.

1649
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,990
(Dong Mi keeps 35 dollars
to herself.)

1650
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,790
- What a thief!
- Dong Mi!

1651
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,470
- I'm going to tell Mom!
- Listen.

1652
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,200
- Keep just 30 dollars for yourself.
- Listen to me.

1653
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,660
- Listen.
- She got 100 dollars?

1654
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,260
I understand you
taking more than us,

1655
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,510
- but you're being too greedy.
- That's why I'm taking 35 dollars.

1656
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,830
- You're being greedy.
- You're so greedy.

1657
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,200
This show already aired.
You're a very greedy one.

1658
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,470
Really? Then have a dollar.

1659
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:23,680
Wow, she's only giving you a dollar.

1660
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,410
- Wow.
- Dong Mi isn't so generous.

1661
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,450
- Take another dollar then.
- You could give more than that.

1662
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,790
- My gosh.
- That makes seven dollars.

1663
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,160
- 7 dollars. Lucky 7.
- Look at her.

1664
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,560
- Okay.
- Isn't it nice? It's seven dollars.

1665
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,620
I think she got five times
more than what I got.

1666
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,160
You took a lot, Dong Mi.

1667
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,990
(Giving another dollar)

1668
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,060
Why? Why are you giving me more?

1669
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,430
I think she'll keep giving you
if we ask her.

1670
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,160
- No, no.
- I think she can give more.

1671
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,560
- She'll give more if we ask.
- No, that's not true.

1672
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,010
Okay, then give me another dollar.

1673
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,100
- Fine. I can give you another one.
- Eight dollars would be fine.

1674
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,080
That's closer to 10 dollars,
you see.

1675
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,040
Now that we're done
distributing allowances,

1676
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,580
let us tell you
how much Dong Mi picked.

1677
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,910
You're going to tell us?

1678
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,180
No way.

1679
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:01,160
She picked 100 dollars.

1680
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,350
(Actually, she picked 100 dollars.)

1681
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,660
(Dong Mi took
62 dollars to herself.)

1682
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,260
This won't do. We have to...

1683
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,330
Look at her. She's happy.

1684
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:11,060
- Didn't I do well?
- We should've searched her.

1685
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,660
What do you mean?

1686
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,740
We're right here, and you're
asking them if you did well?

1687
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,290
- What do you mean?
- I know, I told you.

1688
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,470
We should've gone through her bag.

1689
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:20,680
This is a matter of trust.
How could you be so happy?

1690
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,180
You should be sorry instead.

1691
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,080
- You're the eldest, you see?
- You should be sorry.

1692
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,140
Ta-da.

1693
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,040
You can't be all bright about this!

1694
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,350
Ta-da.

1695
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,140
(She brags about how much she got
despite how angry the others are.)

1696
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,180
You can't tease us like that!

1697
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,180
- I got this much.
- We should've gone through her bag.

1698
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:39,560
Easily put, she took 30 dollars,

1699
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,290
- I know.
- and she gave me 5 dollars.

1700
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:42,290
(She gave me 5 dollars.)

1701
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,620
I'm just...

1702
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,390
She managed to take 35 dollars.

1703
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,490
Gosh, what a disgrace.

1704
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,560
Let me tell you the rules
of the final race.

1705
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,540
It's a game based on how older
siblings tell younger siblings...

1706
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,280
to run errands.
It's called Turn Off This Light.

1707
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,240
Soon, the lights
that are turned on...

1708
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,450
and stickers
with each family's name...

1709
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:07,560
will be hidden here and there.

1710
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,080
The eldest has to find the sticker
with their family name...

1711
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,220
and stick it on the light.

1712
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,790
They have to stick the sticker
on the light.

1713
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,100
Then I have to do a good job
of finding the stickers.

1714
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,830
Right, when the eldest
finds a sticker...

1715
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,160
This is what the younger ones
have to do.

1716
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,660
You have to turn off the lights
that have the stickers...

1717
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,200
with your family name.

1718
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,510
It's not a good thing
to have the lights on.

1719
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:28,640
You should turn off your family's.

1720
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,740
Turn on the lights
of other families.

1721
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:31,950
So we should turn on the lights
with our family name.

1722
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:35,970
Right. The eldest can stick
their family sticker...

1723
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,910
on the light that already has
another family's sticker.

1724
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:42,680
The younger siblings can turn on
the lights of the other family...

1725
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,260
and get in the way.

1726
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,580
Oh, they can turn on the lights
with the other family's name? Okay.

1727
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:49,450
When the time is up,
you'll earn 10 dollars...

1728
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:53,220
for each light that's turned off
with your family's name.

1729
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,660
So basically, the lights
with our family's name...

1730
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,540
need to be turned off...

1731
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,640
- in order for us to win.
- Yes, that's correct.

1732
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,330
You can also rip off the name tag,
regardless of the lights.

1733
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,580
If you rip off a name tag,
you earn 2 dollars.

1734
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,120
Those who got their name tags
ripped off...

1735
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,790
will have to freeze for 30 seconds
before they can join the game again.

1736
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,160
When the race is over, we will
combine the amounts of money...

1737
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,560
you earned by turning off the lights
and ripping off the name tags.

1738
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,180
We'll decide the ranking
by the amount.

1739
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,790
(The final ranking will be decided
by the total amount.)

1740
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,100
- 5, 4...
- It takes me a while...

1741
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,370
to put my shoes on.

1742
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,470
- Right.
- Fine!

1743
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,430
One. Race, start.

1744
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:29,990
(Race, start.)

1745
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,660
- We'll put this on first.
- Okay.

1746
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,740
Can I check what's up there?

1747
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,700
(The eldest has to find
the family sticker first.)

1748
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:41,220
(While they're searching...)

1749
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,970
(He found something?)

1750
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,220
You found something?

1751
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,140
- This is...
- What is it?

1752
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,180
(Kwang Soo of the Kim Family
found the sticker first.)

1753
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,290
There it is!

1754
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,790
But this belongs to the Shin Family.

1755
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:52,760
- It's not ours. It's the Shins'.
- There it is!

1756
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:55,890
(They start finding
the family stickers.)

1757
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:56,890
There it is.

1758
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:58,890
(Which sticker did Se Chan find?)

1759
00:56:58,890 --> 00:56:59,970
Did you find one, Se Chan?

1760
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,160
- Did you find one?
- It's for the Shin Family!

1761
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,260
- Really?
- Dong Mi!

1762
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,490
- I'll put it over there.
- Over there...

1763
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,810
Stick it on the light
that can't be seen.

1764
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,060
(Stick it on the light
that can't be seen.)

1765
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,140
The light that can't be seen?

1766
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,310
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk...)

1767
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:11,010
This must be the light.

1768
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,910
(found the light that was hidden.)

1769
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:14,720
So we have to stick
the sticker on here.

1770
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,740
- You get what I mean, right?
- Where?

1771
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:17,910
What is that?

1772
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,120
That's the light.

1773
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,350
Oh, really?

1774
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,910
We can turn it on or off.

1775
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,390
- Whose light is that?
- I can find these well.

1776
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,620
If we stick our family sticker,
it becomes ours.

1777
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,160
(In the meantime,
So Min is making a snowball.)

1778
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,660
Where could it be?

1779
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,660
(Where could it be?)

1780
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,810
(Looking around)

1781
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,660
(Throwing)

1782
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,810
(While she was busy playing...)

1783
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:44,680
Jong Kook, don't do that.
Seriously, don't do it.

1784
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,470
This isn't how it works.
Come on, you know it!

1785
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:50,350
(Jong Kook appears while screaming.)

1786
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:54,910
You can't take out the weakest!

1787
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:57,660
(The weakest So Min's name tag was
ripped off as soon as they started.)

1788
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,080
(So Min is frozen for 30 seconds.
Jong Kook earned 2 dollars.)

1789
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,260
Gosh, I bet a lot of them
will rip off my name tag today.

1790
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,220
This isn't fair!

1791
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,240
Come on. This isn't how it's played.

1792
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,160
This isn't how it's supposed
to be played. Stop it.

1793
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,830
This isn't how it's played.
I just got my name tag ripped!

1794
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,910
- You'll have to roll about here.
- Will you please let me go?

1795
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,510
Let me go about, will you?

1796
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,310
- Seriously.
- All right.

1797
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:24,790
I'm going to call you "Two Dollars"
from now, okay?

1798
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,620
Ms. Two Dollars.
There's Ms. Two Dollars!

1799
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:28,810
(Jeon So Min,
also known as Two Dollars)

1800
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,660
I guarantee you, I'll be
stuck here for at least 30 minutes.

1801
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,790
(She fell into the swamp
of being stuck.)

1802
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:35,790
Where can I find it?

1803
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,790
Playing a game in the snowy field
makes me feel...

1804
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,200
- like I'm back in my childhood.
- Ms. Cha!

1805
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,890
- Ms. Cha.
- Oh, hey, Ms. Kim.

1806
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:42,890
Do you want this?

1807
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,010
(Shouting loudly)

1808
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,430
(Do you want this?)

1809
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:47,970
Do you have our sticker?

1810
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,740
- Of course we want it.
- Do you have our sticker or not?

1811
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,080
- Of course I do.
- Let me see.

1812
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,310
- You think I don't?
- Show me.

1813
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:53,700
These are all yours.

1814
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,680
- I should... Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1815
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,720
Let's rip off Jae Hwa's name tag.

1816
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,910
- Are you sure it's our sticker?
- Yes, I'm telling you.

1817
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,660
Look at you guys closing in on me.

1818
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,260
I'm all alone here.

1819
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,260
(She retreats for now.)

1820
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,160
- Did you find our stickers?
- No.

1821
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,290
(Haha joins to help Jae Hwa.
It's 2 on 2 now.)

1822
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:10,700
Don't touch us.

1823
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,930
(The Cha brothers
are after Jae Hwa's name tag.)

1824
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:12,930
Jae Hwa.

1825
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,100
(Haha is trying to protect
his sister.)

1826
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,600
Come on.

1827
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,910
(I could lose their stickers
if I get my name tag ripped.)

1828
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,060
Oh, gosh.

1829
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,010
(Suk Jin is taking on Jae Hwa?)

1830
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:28,220
(It's a 1-on-1 match.)

1831
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:33,350
(Who will be the winner
in this match to win the stickers?)

1832
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,080
(Jae Hwa won.)

1833
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,430
Okay!

1834
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:40,720
Gosh, Suk Jin lost to her.

1835
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,490
(Laughing awkwardly)

1836
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,060
Suk Jin lost to her.

1837
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,370
(Suk Jin lost to her.)

1838
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,540
He must've been embarrassed.
He just clapped.

1839
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,010
That was amazing.
She's quite nimble.

1840
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,410
(She's quite nimble.)

1841
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,810
(Meanwhile, Dong Mi is busy
checking what's going on.)

1842
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:57,870
Jong Kook.

1843
00:59:58,410 --> 00:59:59,510
Come here.

1844
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:01,510
(Jong Kook goes to Dong Mi
as she called him.)

1845
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,990
- Turn this off! Turn it off.
- All right.

1846
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,910
Okay, okay. All right.

1847
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,080
(They're after the lights
instead of the name tags.)

1848
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,790
I need to find our stickers.

1849
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,030
(He saw the target.)

1850
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,990
(Kwang Soo goes after Dong Mi.)

1851
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,890
(Lying down)

1852
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,100
(She grits her teeth
and defends herself.)

1853
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,200
You little...

1854
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,470
(Kwang Soo can't do anything
because she struggles violently.)

1855
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,200
(At that moment,
Se Chan turns back and attacks him!)

1856
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,200
You!

1857
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,580
(Ripping)

1858
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:31,950
You!

1859
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,010
Out.

1860
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:34,080
Okay.

1861
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,180
(The weakest member
succeeded to land her first attack.)

1862
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,910
What? Wasn't my name tag ripped off?

1863
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,040
It wasn't ripped off.

1864
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,580
- I had no idea.
- I got Kwang Soo's name tag.

1865
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:42,680
Your name tag wasn't ripped off.

1866
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,680
- Kwang Soo.
- You need to pause.

1867
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,350
We need to find the stickers.

1868
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:47,600
(Jae Suk earns 2 dollars
and sets off to find the stickers.)

1869
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,790
Do you want to buy this
for two dollars?

1870
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,830
The Cha Family? That isn't ours.

1871
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,640
You could sell it to the Cha Family
for three dollars.

1872
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,890
Give me our sticker.

1873
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,560
You are in the Kim Family.

1874
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,410
(It's a Shin Family sticker!)

1875
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,910
Hand it over.

1876
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,200
- What?
- I mean...

1877
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,740
- "Hand it over"?
- Let's exchange the stickers.

1878
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,370
I don't need a Cha Family sticker.

1879
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:09,540
Then I will buy it. How much is it?

1880
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,990
It's originally five dollars.

1881
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,240
- It's too expensive.
- There is a celebrity discount.

1882
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,410
There is a celebrity discount.
Three dollars.

1883
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:15,490
Two dollars.

1884
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,350
The starting price is two dollars
these days.

1885
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,160
I am serious. Don't play around.

1886
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,700
- I will give it to you.
- If you don't give it to me,

1887
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:23,450
- I will kick you.
- Put it down.

1888
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:24,870
- I will put down the sticker here.
- Okay.

1889
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,700
(They show their cards
for a safe transaction.)

1890
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,760
Take one step forward.

1891
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,430
- Take one step forward.
- Okay.

1892
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,160
Take the second step.

1893
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:35,100
Take the second step.

1894
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,700
(The distance between them
doesn't close easily.)

1895
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,140
Take the third step.
No sudden movements.

1896
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,310
Hold on.

1897
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,280
All done. Dong Mi, run!

1898
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,850
- Hurry up and run!
- What?

1899
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,240
(Having adjusted to Running Man,
she steals the sticker.)

1900
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,620
- Hurry up and run!
- What?

1901
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,410
Dong Mi, run!

1902
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,530
(The brother distracts
while the sister steals.)

1903
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,530
Hurry up and run!

1904
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,390
Hurry up and run!

1905
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,760
- I will catch you no matter what.
- What?

1906
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,930
I will catch you no matter what.

1907
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,470
No, no.

1908
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:03,930
- Give me two dollars.
- No. Listen, Kwang Soo.

1909
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,510
- Give me a dollar then.
- Listen, Kwang Soo.

1910
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,540
- Give me a dollar then.
- It was on the ground, wasn't it?

1911
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,580
Give me a dollar!

1912
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,470
I worked so hard to find it.
Give me a dollar.

1913
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,740
I can't do that.
You lost the sticker already.

1914
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:14,910
Do you have the sticker for me?

1915
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:16,450
You lost it.

1916
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,890
I will get you. Okay.

1917
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,350
Okay. It's not my goal
to have the team win.

1918
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,760
- You...
- Good job, Dong Mi!

1919
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,680
Ji Hyo, if you go...

1920
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,720
into the second alley,
you will find our light.

1921
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,890
You need to turn it off.

1922
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:34,330
I need to turn it off.

1923
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,490
(She listens to Dong Mi
and goes to the light.)

1924
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,310
I need to turn it off. Okay.

1925
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,930
(Jae Hwa diligently puts
the stickers on the lights.)

1926
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,410
(Kim Family)

1927
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,350
- All right.
- Hey.

1928
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,620
I can't remove the sticker.

1929
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,850
(She looks around.)

1930
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:57,560
(She puts the Cha Family sticker
on top of the Kim Family sticker.)

1931
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:01,290
Hey! Chung Hwa!

1932
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,990
(Jae Hwa attacks.)

1933
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,490
(Jae Hwa attacks
after watching what she did.)

1934
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,060
(But she is outnumbered
since it's 2 on 1.)

1935
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,560
(She makes a narrow escape.)

1936
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,370
How is she so good
at ripping off the name tags?

1937
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:14,580
She is so strong.

1938
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,370
I got this.

1939
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,080
(Suk Jin joins the fight.)

1940
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,240
(It's 3 members of the Kim Family
versus Jae Hwa.)

1941
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,580
- She is so strong.
- Hold on.

1942
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,620
She is scary.

1943
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,040
(Moving her arms like a windmill)

1944
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:25,450
(They become helpless
in front of her shower of punches.)

1945
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:26,510
Hey.

1946
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:28,260
Was she a fighter?

1947
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:30,660
She is so strong.

1948
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:31,990
(The streetfighter doesn't back down
even if there are 3 opponents.)

1949
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:33,680
- Seriously. Jae Hwa.
- We did it.

1950
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,260
(3 people gang up on her
to remove the name tag.)

1951
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,760
Jae Hwa is like a bull.

1952
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,760
Jae Hwa.

1953
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:41,390
I can't believe her.

1954
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:42,700
Jae Hwa,

1955
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,160
where did you hang out
back in the day?

1956
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:45,910
- She is scary.
- Seriously.

1957
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:47,410
People should be careful.

1958
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:49,140
She nearly pounded on us.

1959
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:51,080
She is so scary.

1960
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,350
- She nearly ended us.
- It could have ended badly.

1961
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:55,180
- I work out.
- She is so scary.

1962
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,040
I have a lot of stickers
for the Shin Family.

1963
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,220
Really? Show me.

1964
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,540
- These are for the Shin Family.
- I can give you your stickers.

1965
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,810
- Okay.
- The Cha Family's stickers.

1966
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:02,890
I have three.

1967
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,450
- Let's see them.
- In that case,

1968
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,330
- let's trade them.
- Let's trade them.

1969
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:08,220
(At that moment)

1970
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,560
(She removes 2 name tags at once!)

1971
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,760
(She takes out two brothers
of the Cha Family.)

1972
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,370
- Is she...
- My sister is the best!

1973
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:16,760
Is she an assassin?

1974
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:17,970
What was that?

1975
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,370
Is she...

1976
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,830
She is much better than us.

1977
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,240
Is she an assassin?

1978
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,830
She is like
the female Kim Jong Kook.

1979
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,370
She ripped off two name tags
at once.

1980
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:26,470
Did you hear the sound?

1981
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:27,780
I knew I was out
because I heard the sound.

1982
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,910
(He didn't even see her.)

1983
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:30,950
Do you have
the Shin Family's stickers?

1984
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:32,450
I have the Cha Family's stickers.

1985
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,220
Do you want to exchange them?

1986
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:35,310
- Already?
- Yes.

1987
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,560
- How many do you have?
- One.

1988
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,030
- 3?
- I have 2.

1989
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:40,060
- Two Cha Family's stickers?
- Yes.

1990
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,760
- Find two of ours first.
- Okay. I will do that.

1991
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,260
- Make sure you do that. Deal.
- Deal.

1992
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,560
- Let's make an exchange then.
- Okay.

1993
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,890
Let's end the Kim Family.

1994
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,260
- Deal.
- Okay.

1995
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,240
- This is how it works.
- That's right.

1996
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,040
Jae Hwa is annoyingly strong.

1997
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,410
So...

1998
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,740
- we will join forces.
- Yes.

1999
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:00,100
(The annoyingly strong assassin
is destroying the Cha Family again.)

2000
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,740
Let's join forces!

2001
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:03,450
Chicken.

2002
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,740
(Cock-a-doodle-doo!)

2003
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,680
(The two cowards are scared
of Jae Hwa.)

2004
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,990
(While Jae Hwa takes on everyone...)

2005
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,560
I should receive more from Ji Hyo.

2006
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,950
(Dong Mi quietly puts on a sticker.)

2007
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,390
(She puts it
on top of the Cha Family's.)

2008
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:20,200
The Shin Family
keeps covering ours with theirs.

2009
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:24,660
(What is Chung Hwa doing
after forming an alliance?)

2010
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,280
(She also puts a sticker
on top of the Shin Family's.)

2011
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,580
(They learned that betrayal is
the only way to survive.)

2012
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:31,700
Ms. Cha.

2013
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:32,850
- Ms. Cha.
- Yes?

2014
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,740
- Do you have our stickers?
- Yes, I do.

2015
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:35,810
- You do?
- Yes.

2016
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:38,240
- Shall we make an exchange?
- That's a good idea.

2017
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,640
I also bought the compact foundation
you model for.

2018
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:43,180
It's so nice.

2019
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:44,680
I wanted my skin to look
as nice as yours.

2020
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,080
I even sent one to my mom.

2021
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,950
- Didn't I do a good job? It's okay.
- I will send it to you.

2022
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:49,100
I bought it with my money,
so give me the sticker.

2023
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,700
(It's like a conversation between
a used-goods seller and buyer.)

2024
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,290
Give me the sticker.
I have the Shin Family's sticker.

2025
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:54,970
- Cha Family's sticker.
- That's good. Let's exchange them.

2026
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,890
Really? Don't lie.

2027
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:59,040
Don't make me leave a bad review
for the compact foundation.

2028
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,970
(She makes a cute threat
for the safe exchange.)

2029
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:03,180
- Are you serious?
- I am serious. I like you a lot.

2030
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:04,850
- Let's hold them together.
- 1, 2, 3.

2031
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:06,040
I like you.

2032
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,580
- I will use it well.
- Thank you.

2033
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:10,040
- Please write a good review.
- Of course.

2034
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,680
(The exchange shows
that both of them have manners.)

2035
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,910
So Min, she is a nice girl.

2036
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:15,450
- Se Chan!
- Se Chan!

2037
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:16,680
Jae Suk.

2038
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,620
Jae Suk, I found so many stickers.

2039
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:20,430
- Let's see them.
- Shin Family's stickers.

2040
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:21,760
- Really?
- Look, Dong Mi.

2041
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,700
- Is there one for the Cha Family?
- I have many.

2042
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,830
- How many do you have?
- Four.

2043
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:26,030
- Check them later.
- He needs the Cha Family's.

2044
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:27,200
- Who?
- Here.

2045
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,240
- Suk Jin.
- Let's make an exchange.

2046
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:30,100
- Let's make an exchange.
- Let's make an exchange.

2047
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,260
- Let's make an exchange.
- How many?

2048
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,600
- How many do you have?
- Three?

2049
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,640
- I have a lot. I have 20.
- 3.

2050
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:36,040
We can give them to you.

2051
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,600
- 2.
- 3.

2052
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,680
- Here.
- Here you go.

2053
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,370
The atmosphere is nice.

2054
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:42,620
Why don't you give us
your name tag as well?

2055
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,120
It only costs two dollars.

2056
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,990
It only costs two dollars.

2057
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,220
Seriously.

2058
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,310
Give it to us.

2059
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:49,350
- It's that kind of atmosphere.
- Come on.

2060
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:50,410
It's that kind of atmosphere.

2061
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,530
- Give it to us.
- It's that kind of atmosphere.

2062
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:52,930
- Suk Jin.
- Give it to us.

2063
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:53,950
Thank you.

2064
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:54,950
You are the best.

2065
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:56,120
- I will have my revenge.
- Okay.

2066
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,330
Okay.

2067
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:58,470
He keeps saying
he will have his revenge.

2068
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:00,220
He keeps saying that,
but he can't do it.

2069
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,740
Dong Mi, I will have my revenge.

2070
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,140
- Okay.
- Please put this back.

2071
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,560
- Okay.
- I need to wait for 30 seconds.

2072
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,870
Okay.

2073
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:08,640
Jae Hwa.

2074
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,600
(The Kim Family is headed
somewhere.)

2075
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,350
(They spot a light!)

2076
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:15,510
- That's good.
- Let's hide it.

2077
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,870
We need to move it.

2078
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,140
Hold on. We should turn it off.

2079
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,910
- Turn it off.
- Hold on.

2080
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:21,450
Hold on.

2081
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:22,790
I don't think it will work.

2082
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,950
(What should we do?)

2083
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,060
Like this.

2084
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,430
(He hides the light with something.)

2085
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:28,450
It's so obvious.

2086
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,200
Don't use that. Use this instead.

2087
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:31,490
Use this instead.

2088
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:33,600
(The second brother
gets to work instead.)

2089
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:35,660
Is it even more obvious?

2090
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:36,930
It's so obvious.

2091
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:38,470
It's so obvious.

2092
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:40,660
It seems to be saying,
"Please come this way."

2093
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,410
Five minutes until the race ends.

2094
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,700
Jong Kook!

2095
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,850
(The physical fights become worse
as the end draws near.)

2096
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:46,950
(Ripping)

2097
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:48,640
Where does he keep coming from?

2098
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:50,280
Where did he come from?

2099
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,040
(The Kim Family's assassin
awakens in full force!)

2100
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,350
For goodness' sake.

2101
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,410
You know, Jae Hwa...

2102
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,850
pounds on people.

2103
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,930
She is a warrior.

2104
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:01,700
I can barely see her feet.

2105
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,430
Boom! She goes...

2106
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:04,430
Gosh, you startled me!

2107
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:05,970
That little...

2108
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:06,990
(The protein brother
chases after Haha!)

2109
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,140
He looks like a bear.

2110
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:10,100
We need to find the name tags.

2111
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,200
(The Cha Family can't do anything
because of the two bulls.)

2112
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,310
There are so many.

2113
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:16,470
(Getting more lights is
the only way they can win.)

2114
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,450
(The big sister of the Shin Family
sneaks up on him.)

2115
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:21,100
- What is it?
- Nothing.

2116
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,040
I was just looking.

2117
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,410
If you have a Cha Family's sticker,
we can make an exchange.

2118
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,080
- Do you have our sticker?
- Yes.

2119
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,080
Show me.

2120
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,390
Show me first.
A Cha Family's sticker.

2121
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:30,990
My siblings will come
if I call for them.

2122
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:32,160
I mean...

2123
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:33,420
You shouldn't do that.

2124
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:35,220
Your siblings will come
if you call for them?

2125
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:36,660
I am serious.

2126
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,300
- Come on.
- I have so many siblings.

2127
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,560
Don't be like that.
Dong Mi, show me the sticker.

2128
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,390
- I will call for them.
- Hold on.

2129
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,300
The deal is off.

2130
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,800
Se Chan!

2131
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,470
- Don't do that.
- Ji Hyo!

2132
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,130
Who are you looking for?

2133
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:52,600
Shin Ji Hyo!

2134
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,750
Shin Ji Hyo.

2135
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:54,880
(Jae Suk leaves for now.)

2136
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,250
You said you have our sticker.
Give it to me.

2137
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:57,670
I have it. Wait right there.

2138
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:03,420
Another one? Shin Family's stickers
are everywhere.

2139
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:05,250
Give it to me!

2140
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,460
Give it to me!

2141
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,660
How is her hearing so good?

2142
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,800
Give it to me!
I will give you yours.

2143
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,630
Give me the Cha Family's sticker.

2144
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:13,460
Come on.

2145
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,930
There you go.

2146
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,670
Okay. That's good.

2147
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:18,600
- So, this is... Jong Kook.
- We have a lot left.

2148
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,560
We shouldn't put a lot of stickers
on the lights.

2149
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,100
Other families keep covering them
with theirs,

2150
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,630
so we should hold on to ours.

2151
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:26,210
We shouldn't have put them early on.

2152
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,250
I didn't think it through.

2153
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,920
What should we do?

2154
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,080
You never think things through.

2155
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:33,640
Hey.

2156
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,290
Oh, you are my older brother.

2157
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,660
Hold on.

2158
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,050
- Kim Nipple.
- Se Chan.

2159
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,350
How could you say that...

2160
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,850
to your older brother?

2161
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,330
You should praise
your older brother.

2162
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:43,850
You never think things through.

2163
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:46,090
- It's true.
- I couldn't hold myself back.

2164
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:49,040
So Min, look for the envelopes.

2165
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,040
(Jae Suk turns on
the Shin Family's light.)

2166
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:52,760
- Did you turn it on?
- Yes.

2167
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,280
(He looks around...)

2168
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,970
(and turns off
the Shin Family's light.)

2169
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:00,280
(Chung Hwa runs over.)

2170
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:02,420
(Chung Hwa, put the sticker here!)

2171
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,450
(After putting the sticker,
they turn off the light.)

2172
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:07,050
What? Hold on.

2173
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,120
(She smacks him on the head.)

2174
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,920
It's a rule, Chung Hwa!

2175
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,290
Don't you think you are too violent?

2176
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,420
Are you calling my sister violent?

2177
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,060
Your sister is the one
who brandishes her fists.

2178
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,670
Do you know how many beatings
I took from her?

2179
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,390
- Hey.
- The sisters are strong.

2180
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,670
We took so many beatings
from Jae Hwa.

2181
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:25,960
- Go on your way.
- I can't believe him.

2182
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:27,970
This isn't the time
to put on the stickers.

2183
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:29,630
(The Kim Family is in a hurry
as well.)

2184
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,640
Are you out?

2185
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:34,550
I am out. Se Chan!

2186
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,210
- You aren't out, are you?
- Se Chan!

2187
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:37,310
Are you out? You aren't!

2188
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:40,380
(Haha heads somewhere
in the confusion of the moment.)

2189
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,310
(Shin Family)

2190
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,990
(He turns on
the Shin Family's light.)

2191
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:47,030
(Kwang Soo tries to turn it off
and Ji Hyo tries to stop him.)

2192
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:49,390
(He attacks with his teeth.)

2193
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:50,830
What are you doing? Hey!

2194
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,220
(The Kim Family's second brother
came to help!)

2195
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:54,840
(Turning the light on and off)

2196
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,170
(They touch the light repeatedly
as if they are playing a game.)

2197
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:01,430
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo grabs Kwang Soo
by his hair.)

2198
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:02,600
Hey!

2199
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:05,950
(Ji Hyo turns the light on and off
by herself.)

2200
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,580
(It's a hectic dogfight
on the snowy field.)

2201
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:09,640
Ji Hyo!

2202
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,010
Will you give me
a Cha Family's sticker if I help?

2203
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,490
Yes, I will!

2204
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,420
(Ripping off)

2205
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,490
(He is proud of himself
after landing a sneaky attack.)

2206
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,160
- He... Gosh!
- Okay!

2207
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:24,050
(The assassin approaches silently
and rips off the name tag!)

2208
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,030
(30 seconds
before the end of the race)

2209
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:28,560
- All right.
- We need to protect this one.

2210
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,000
Protect that one.

2211
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:31,540
Here you go.

2212
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,870
- Thank you.
- Jae Suk, you can move now.

2213
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:35,080
15 seconds remain.

2214
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,080
(They need to turn off
as many lights as possible!)

2215
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,170
- 15 seconds.
- Did you protect it?

2216
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,780
(Jae Suk heads
to the Cha Family's light!)

2217
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,310
(But Se Chan is protecting it!)

2218
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:49,380
(The fierce on and off war)

2219
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:52,960
(Wars break out
at other spots as well.)

2220
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,390
Stop it already.

2221
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:58,920
- 5, 4,
- Yes!

2222
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:02,370
- 3, 2, 1.
- 3, 2, 1.

2223
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,870
It's over. It's over.

2224
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:06,600
- I turned it on.
- The countdown ended first.

2225
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,930
(Cha Family's light is on.)

2226
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:09,970
I turned it on first.
Kwang Soo. Nice.

2227
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:12,280
- They will lose 10 dollars.
- They are too much.

2228
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,300
Nice.

2229
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,470
(Which team will have
the most amount of money?)

2230
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,450
(The final count)

2231
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:17,710
- Everyone.
- Yes?

2232
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,750
I will announce how much you made
by ripping off the name tags.

2233
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:24,510
Jong Kook, 22 dollars.

2234
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,220
(Jong Kook, 22 dollars)

2235
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,420
- That's incredible.
- Did he rip off 11 name tags?

2236
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,750
Just from the name tags?

2237
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,700
- Half of the money is from me.
- I ripped off her name tag a lot.

2238
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,870
Half of the money is from me.

2239
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:34,530
Jae Hwa, 16 dollars.

2240
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:35,960
(Jae Hwa, 16 dollars)

2241
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,200
Did you rip off eight name tags?

2242
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,870
(8 kills)

2243
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:41,800
- Did you rip off eight name tags?
- She showed us the best scene...

2244
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,970
in the 10-year history
of Name Tag Eliminations.

2245
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,210
She ripped off two name tags
at the same time.

2246
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,580
Jae Suk and Suk Jin.

2247
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:50,120
Staff members call her Two Swords.

2248
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,490
- Two Nunchuks.
- The female Park Jun Gyu.

2249
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:53,750
She stood...

2250
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,180
as if she was
on the top of a mountain.

2251
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:58,180
(The charisma of a Siberian tiger)

2252
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,220
Her gaze... Seriously.

2253
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,000
When she smiles,

2254
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,590
she looks a bit like Ryu Hyun Jin.

2255
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,300
- That's right.
- She looks a bit like Ryu Hyun Jin.

2256
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,390
- She does.
- She does, right?

2257
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,200
When she smiles,
she looks a bit like Ryu Hyun Jin.

2258
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,560
- She does.
- She does.

2259
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,740
- She really does.
- They resemble each other.

2260
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,410
People will believe her
if she says that she is his sister.

2261
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:15,410
(She even has
Hyun Jin's endless strength.)

2262
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:16,910
- There is a resemblance.
- Next.

2263
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:19,250
Kwang Soo and Haha,
14 dollars each.

2264
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,100
- I ripped off many name tags.
- Not bad.

2265
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,140
I will give you the results
regarding the lights.

2266
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:27,420
The Shin Family
put their stickers on nine lights.

2267
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,090
- Really?
- The lights that are off?

2268
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:31,350
- That's incredible.
- Nine lights in total.

2269
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,330
Eight lights were turned off.

2270
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:34,800
(They acquired 80 dollars.)

2271
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,550
- Did we get 80 dollars?
- Really?

2272
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,960
(The Shin Family turned off
all the lights except for one.)

2273
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,260
- Only one light was turned on.
- We did well.

2274
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,960
- The Kim Family...
- We are incredible.

2275
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:43,890
- put their stickers on four lights.
- Us?

2276
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:44,930
- Yes.
- Us?

2277
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,130
Only four lights?

2278
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,600
- All of them changed.
- Four lights were turned off.

2279
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,800
- What? 4 lights?
- We acquired 40 dollars.

2280
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,880
40 dollars.

2281
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:52,970
Next is the Cha Family.

2282
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,210
They put their stickers
on nine lights.

2283
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:57,970
Nine lights.

2284
01:13:57,970 --> 01:13:59,490
Two lights were turned off.

2285
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:00,880
(They acquired 20 dollars.)

2286
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,120
(2 out of 9 lights?)

2287
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,380
Chung Hwa is absorbed.

2288
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,220
I feel like I am watching
a morning drama.

2289
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,550
They turned on our lights.

2290
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:13,420
- I worked so hard.
- We had many lights. It's a shame.

2291
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,700
Thus,

2292
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,700
the 1st place is the Shin Family
with 122 dollars.

2293
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,300
The 2nd place is the Kim Family
with 84 dollars.

2294
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,840
The 3rd place is the Cha Family
with 40 dollars.

2295
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:25,050
Now comes the last step.

2296
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:26,950
- The sisters will move first.
- Okay.

2297
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:27,970
(The last time to distribute
the allowances)

2298
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,280
I need to get a lot of money.

2299
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,490
I got 100 dollars earlier.

2300
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:35,180
(100, 90, and 80 dollars)

2301
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,180
This one.

2302
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:37,750
(Earlier, Dong Mi picked
the most amount of money.)

2303
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,790
I think I picked a small amount.

2304
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,200
We need to avoid the penalty.

2305
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,220
(The Shin Family's
younger siblings enter.)

2306
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,870
Okay.

2307
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:47,330
It has begun.

2308
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:49,390
- Did you get 80 dollars?
- 80 dollars.

2309
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:51,600
- It will be funny to use a chance.
- Hold on.

2310
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,840
Did you get 80 dollars?

2311
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,930
- Is it a coincidence?
- Dong Mi, sit down.

2312
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,080
- Dong Mi.
- Is it a coincidence?

2313
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,550
80 dollars.

2314
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:00,600
It's always one extreme
after another for me.

2315
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,970
Earlier, I picked 100 dollars.
This time, I picked 80 dollars.

2316
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:05,380
I can't lie about it.

2317
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:06,680
Why not?

2318
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,550
- It's 80 dollars.
- But...

2319
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,880
- Jong Kook.
- It makes no sense...

2320
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,550
that you picked 80 dollars.

2321
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,720
- Seriously.
- I have more money.

2322
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,720
Let me explain.

2323
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:19,220
We placed 1st and won 122 dollars.

2324
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:21,220
What?
Then distribute that money first.

2325
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,740
- Listen.
- Distribute that money first.

2326
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,540
No. I will do this first...

2327
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,600
before I distribute the prize money.

2328
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:27,430
She is acting strange, right?

2329
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:30,340
- She is acting strange.
- You are too much.

2330
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,840
Give us 10 or 20 dollars more.
You are in 1st place.

2331
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,840
No. Let's say...

2332
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,450
the other teams
picked 60 dollars twice.

2333
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,510
If they keep the money
to themselves, it's 120 dollars.

2334
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,160
Then I won't come in first.

2335
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,790
Her ambition is on another level.

2336
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,220
Her eyes are on the prize.

2337
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,890
- She is unbelievable.
- Her ambition is on another level.

2338
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:50,390
She is thinking about
the maximum amount.

2339
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:51,460
I can't believe she is thinking
about that.

2340
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:54,170
You want to place first
and trample on everyone, right?

2341
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:57,000
You even thought about
the 60 dollars.

2342
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:59,670
There is the Dad Chance.

2343
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:02,430
Give us 30 dollars each...

2344
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,710
before anything.

2345
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,710
You can give us that much.

2346
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:07,140
(She distributes 30 dollars each.)

2347
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:08,380
For goodness' sake.

2348
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:11,210
What will happen to the two dollars?

2349
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:12,550
I will keep it.

2350
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:13,590
(I will keep it.)

2351
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:18,680
Jong Kook, we should kick her out
of the family.

2352
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:19,960
- Listen.
- Seriously.

2353
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,550
I gave you 50 dollars each.

2354
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,300
- We should kick her out.
- From whom...

2355
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,720
did she get that greedy side?

2356
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:27,890
- She needs a scolding.
- We should tell Mom.

2357
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:28,960
Don't do that.

2358
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,240
I will give you two dollars.

2359
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,630
She is too much.

2360
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,300
- Keep it for now.
- Really?

2361
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,540
Mom will come later...

2362
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:35,910
with a stick.

2363
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,140
She will break your legs. Get ready.

2364
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,750
- We need to call Mom.
- Jong Kook.

2365
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:43,210
I also think Dong Mi needs
to be punished...

2366
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,750
for her greedy side.

2367
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,710
That's good. We will call Mom.

2368
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:50,180
We will call Mom.

2369
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:52,990
- You decided to use the Mom Chance.
- Yes.

2370
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:54,530
I couldn't be fairer.

2371
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:56,030
It's impossible to do this
more fairly.

2372
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:57,250
Okay, Dong Mi.

2373
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:59,630
The Mom Chance revealed
that Dong Mi's words were...

2374
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:03,200
(Did Dong Mi speak truthfully
about the 80 dollars?)

2375
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:04,760
true.

2376
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,300
You ingrates!

2377
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,040
(The Mom Chance was a failure.)

2378
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,780
You ingrates!

2379
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:13,100
I told you that
I will divide the money equally.

2380
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,140
- We couldn't believe her.
- I told you that...

2381
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:18,210
- I will give you nine dollars.
- She is like...

2382
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:19,290
an experienced gambler.

2383
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:21,250
(Her mind games make them wonder
about her past.)

2384
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,210
- Double or nothing.
- An experienced gambler.

2385
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,710
She is good at playing cards.

2386
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:26,550
She is good at playing cards.

2387
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,330
- She shook us up.
- Seriously.

2388
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,590
Why did you do that?

2389
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:33,220
- Dong Mi.
- Couldn't you trust your sister?

2390
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,130
How much do you have now?
You have over 200 dollars, right?

2391
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,870
You should say,
"I won with 200 dollars!"

2392
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:42,130
Do that and see
how satisfying it is. Go ahead.

2393
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,100
(The Kim Family
and Cha Family are done as well.)

2394
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,140
(What will be the result?)

2395
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,880
We were going to have one person
receive the penalty.

2396
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,950
They must have used the Dad Chance.

2397
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:53,620
Two rooms used the Dad Chance,

2398
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:55,250
so three people in total
will receive the penalty.

2399
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:57,160
Did one room go without using it?

2400
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:00,030
(The Cha Family used
the Dad Chance.)

2401
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,050
(1 more person will receive
the penalty.)

2402
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:04,500
(2 more people will receive
the penalty.)

2403
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:06,000
They used chances.

2404
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,370
You didn't use it. Thank goodness.

2405
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:09,060
- We just need to avoid the penalty.
- Thank goodness.

2406
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,700
I will show you the prize first.

2407
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:13,210
- I am jealous.
- The prize is...

2408
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:15,170
- the high-end strawberry set.
- Strawberries.

2409
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,580
- Strawberries.
- Strawberries.

2410
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,170
- I will announce three winners.
- Okay.

2411
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:24,510
The 1st-place winner has
183 dollars.

2412
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,050
- Shin Dong Mi.
- Shin Dong Mi.

2413
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:27,920
The first-place winner!

2414
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,920
She took all our money.

2415
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,720
- The luxurious Dong Mi.
- It was no joke.

2416
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,160
I will pick the red ribbon.
Thank you.

2417
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,030
Dong Mi is incredible.

2418
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:39,370
The second-place winner...

2419
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,840
has 176 dollars. It's Kwang Soo.

2420
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,700
(Is Kwang Soo the 2nd-place winner?)

2421
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:46,600
(He succeeded to take all the money
with the Dad Chance.)

2422
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,670
176 dollars.

2423
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:51,130
(Unlike Dong Mi,
Jae Hwa failed with the mind games.)

2424
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:52,300
He is the worst.

2425
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,710
176 dollars.

2426
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:55,750
The third-place winner...

2427
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,780
has 65 dollars.

2428
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,310
It's Jae Suk.

2429
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:02,160
(He also took all the money
with the Dad Chance.)

2430
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,590
- Chung Hwa, take it home.
- You don't have to do that.

2431
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,880
You don't have to do that.
You are the best.

2432
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,300
Thank you.

2433
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:14,720
(Look at Kwang Soo's face.)

2434
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,460
Look at Kwang Soo's face.

2435
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,060
Two strawberry sets went
to the guests,

2436
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,600
- but he is holding onto his.
- Who came in last?

2437
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,100
(He holds onto the basket.)

2438
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:24,630
(Two Swords unfortunately has
a greedy brother.)

2439
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:25,750
He is unbelievable.

2440
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:27,100
Actually...

2441
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:28,750
Your dad will scold you.

2442
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:31,140
(Winning the prize is
Kwang Soo's small happiness.)

2443
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,450
The last place has 16 dollars.
It's Haha.

2444
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:35,510
(Haha is in the last place
since Kwang Soo took his money.)

2445
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:38,960
The 10th place has 33 dollars.
It's Jae Hwa.

2446
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,030
(Is Jae Hwa 2nd to last?)

2447
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:41,660
- I didn't place last, right?
- You get the penalty.

2448
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:43,850
(Haha and Jae Hwa will get
the penalty.)

2449
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:45,300
What is this family going to do?

2450
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,130
(The youngest one received
the strawberries,)

2451
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,220
(but the other siblings received
the penalty.)

2452
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:49,460
You got the penalty.

2453
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,800
The last person to receive
the penalty has 35 dollars.

2454
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,840
(Who is the last person to receive
the penalty?)

2455
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,970
Suk Jin.

2456
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,800
- Really?
- Yes.

2457
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,170
- I survived.
- So Min placed 8th with 43 dollars.

2458
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,920
That team lost all the money.

2459
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,380
I will tell you what the penalty is.

2460
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:08,380
Today's penalty
will let you share stories...

2461
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,120
and deepen the love
between the siblings.

2462
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,380
- It's time for a home-cooked meal.
- What is that?

2463
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,990
With the basic tools and ingredients
we prepared for you,

2464
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:17,830
you can prepare a home-cooked meal
and eat it.

2465
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:19,090
- What?
- Really?

2466
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,590
We're supposed to have a meal?

2467
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,200
It hasn't been long since we ate.

2468
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:26,370
It's so annoying.

2469
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:27,500
I hate it so much.

2470
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,800
- But the penalties try to make...
- My wife said she cooked for me.

2471
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,710
- us as annoyed as possible.
- But...

2472
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:35,840
We can't even say
it's a painful penalty.

2473
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,640
It's a good thing, but...

2474
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,840
- These strawberries are a gift.
- No, it's okay.

2475
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,210
- No, it's my treat.
- Oh, my.

2476
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:42,380
- These strawberries are a gift.
- Thank you.

2477
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,490
I hope you enjoy them.

2478
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:46,130
They're really good at coming up
with penalties. How could they...

2479
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:47,750
- Gosh, this is really...
- That's right.

2480
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:50,200
Doing this really makes
us feel like a family.

2481
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,170
- Yes.
- We're working as a family.

2482
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:56,240
- Watching you cook in a mountain,
- Yes?

2483
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,740
it feels like you're shooting
"Flaming Youth".

2484
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,600
("Flaming Youth")

2485
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:01,930
Your wish came true.

2486
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:04,970
No, it's not my wish.
I just said it for no reason.

2487
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,470
I said it to be funny.

2488
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:09,510
Okay. After I do this,

2489
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:11,340
I'm going to add a fried egg on top.

2490
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,640
- That's too big.
- I'm also going to add this.

2491
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,250
He still eats jelly as a snack.

2492
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:17,120
- There isn't any jelly.
- I'm annoyed there's no ketchup.

2493
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,120
(I'm annoyed there's no ketchup.)

2494
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:20,490
(He's suddenly embarrassed.)

2495
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:22,960
- Gosh.
- Gosh, this is so annoying.

2496
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,260
But it's quite heartwarming
for a penalty.

2497
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:27,760
It's heartwarming, but it's
quite nice to actually do it.

2498
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,260
(We'd like to thank Shin Dong Mi,
Kim Jae Hwa, and Cha Chung Hwa...)

2499
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,000
(for making Running Man's winter
warm like cozy snowflakes.)

"A movie-like incident where
prisoners escaped from prison..."

2501
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,910
(These people shouldn't be
let out into the world.)

2502
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:38,300
(We call them the "Penalty Men".)

2503
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,500
Wait a minute!

2504
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,500

(Ahn Eun Jin)

2508
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:51,350
(They discover the identities
of the Penalty Men.)

2509
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:52,660
Are you taking us hostage?

2510
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:53,660
(We're all wearing red.)

2511
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:55,960
(The Penalty Men are trying to
go out into the world.)

2512
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,700
(The humans must stop them.)

2513
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,030
(What will become of their fate?)
