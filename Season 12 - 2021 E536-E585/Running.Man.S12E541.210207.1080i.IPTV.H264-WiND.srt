1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,930
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,900
- Hello.
- What is this?

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,570
- Is it our breakfast?
- Hello.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,610
- Hello.
- I guess we get to pick something.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,400
I pick number three.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,540
- I'll go with number 8.
- I want number 3.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,350
- All right.
- I'll pick number three.

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,350
I want number four.

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,010
Why do you like
number eight so much?

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,170
Eight is my favorite number.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,780
I think Haha is doing
some mission alone.

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,010
He's wearing modernized hanbok.

13
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,650
Do you want to introduce
Korean culture to the world?

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,990
Haha. Your fashion is...

15
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,920
quite rambling these days.

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,530
When you wear hanbok like that,
you should change your hairstyle...

17
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,200
like an aristocrat.

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,300
It looks better now.

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,460
- Lord Haha.
- His hat...

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,770
- Hey.
- All right.

21
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,100
"Is anyone there?"

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,780
- Good.
- Like an aristocrat.

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,630
He's a dad and 42 years old now.

24
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,380
And this is what he's doing.

25
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,880
I'm 43.

26
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,020
- Are you 43?
- That's better.

27
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,710
Jae Suk, we have to
talk about this. Look.

28
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,050
He dyed his mullet.

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,520
- Will you let it slide?
- What?

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,990
- He dyed his hair here.
- No.

31
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,060
Will you let it slide or what?

32
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,780
- I did it just a little.
- Will you let it go?

33
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,160
It turns out his new movie
was just an excuse.

34
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,460
He actually thinks this looks cool.

35
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,970
I just became
attached to it over time.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,830
- I just tried it before I cut it.
- This isn't right.

37
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,940
He dyed his hair for real.

38
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,000
It's so annoying.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,560
You should wear it in a pigtail.

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,830
- What?
- Wear it in a pigtail.

41
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,880
I'm so disappointed
that you said that.

42
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,030
I'm really happy.

43
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,800
You just said
you liked my hair in the car.

44
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,970
You should wear my pants
and a pigtail together.

45
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,610
Gosh, I hate it.

46
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,750
- We're done.
- We're done.

47
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,940
Today,

48
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,990
to celebrate midwinter,

49
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,660
we got you a little something.

50
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,750
- I'm nervous though.
- I hope it's a good thing.

51
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,300
- It won't be fun if you all get it.
- Only two?

52
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,050
Six of them have
different gifts in them.

53
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,660
But two of them are duds.

54
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,660
Really?

55
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,000
I want you to stand
behind the table.

56
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,530
And you all will open
your gifts together.

57
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,740
- Okay.
- I will...

58
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,060
- I'll pick what's left.
- I pick number three.

59
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,860
- I want number eight.
- I'll have what's left.

60
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,300
- I'll just get what's left.
- I want number four.

61
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,640
- Number two.
- I'll get what's left.

62
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,750
- No.
- Then I'll go with number one.

63
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,270
- What do you want?
- I'll pick number two.

64
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,880
- I want number 4.
- I pick number 7.

65
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,250
Se Chan likes number eight.

66
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,250
Please open your gifts
on the count of three.

67
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,990
- All right.
- One.

68
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,990
(They can predict their luck
for today with the gifts.)

69
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,990
Two.

70
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,990
Three.

71
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,260
(Who will get the two duds?)

72
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,330
Three.

73
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,990
(Kwang Soo and So Min
lost the draw.)

74
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,670
(It's a 100 manual squirt gun.)

75
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,990
This is my favorite, hotteok.

76
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,300
I'm so lucky.

77
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,670
All right.

78
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,110
- This is amazing.
- All right.

79
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,110
(She got into trouble after
stealing Se Chan's choice.)

80
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,010
- Look at you.
- This is amazing.

81
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,010
I knew you would pick number eight.

82
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,920
I didn't know they would
squirt water guns from in there.

83
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,710
- Hyeong Gu.
- Hey.

84
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,180
Don't pull his hair.

85
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
(He tries to punish him
for squirting a water gun.)

86
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,890
(He pulls out his head...)

87
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,150
(and slaps him in the face.)

88
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,420
(Hyeong Gu, playing multiple roles,
he's in charge of water guns today.)

89
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,960
(He's getting slapped
after squirting a water gun.)

90
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,330
Hyeong Gu.

91
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,860
That's enough.

92
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,570
You're doing all sorts of things.

93
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,460
I didn't know number eight
would be a dud.

94
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,670
The gift we prepared for you is
six kinds of snacks for winter.

95
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,360
Yes! It's hotteok.

96
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,610
- It's still steaming.
- Right.

97
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,240
It's still warm.

98
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,300
- Look at this.
- This is warm too.

99
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,740
Please listen to the rules
while enjoying the snacks.

100
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,550
Today, we will have a New Year
Driving Out Bad Luck Race...

101
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,240
with a horrible penalty.

102
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,050
- What is the penalty now?
- I'm curious what it is.

103
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,120
Those who just picked duds
have been...

104
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,920
- selected as Penalty Men.
- Okay.

105
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,270
And there will be more
Penalty Men after the missions.

106
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,960
Is it settled already?
From the beginning?

107
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,740
It's not decided yet, but you are
highly likely to get a penalty.

108
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,210
Can I just get the penalty
and go home?

109
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,800
I woke up two hours early
to go to a hair salon this morning.

110
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,900
(Pleased)

111
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,170
We will have three guests soon.

112
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,640
- Do we have guests today?
- They don't know...

113
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,950
we picked the first Penalty Men
during the opening.

114
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,740
They just think they'll be picking
team members as a team leader.

115
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,550
Do you see the chairs
for the king over there?

116
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,080
We will have these chairs for them.

117
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,460
And the one on the right
will fall apart.

118
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,260
The guest who picks this chair
will start as a Penalty Man.

119
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,070
This is fun.

120
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,620
Can't you tell it's a dud?

121
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,430
You can't tell. It must be fun.

122
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,460
Then we will bring in the guests.

123
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,040
Yes!

124
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,870
Hello.

125
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,010
Hello.

126
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,820
- He's Lee Sang Yi.
- Sang Yi.

127
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,180
(He was the baseball coach
in "When the Camellia Blooms".)

128
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,280
(He caught people's eye
playing a comedic role.)

129
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,520
(And he became the nation's beloved
brother-in-law in "Once Again".)

130
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,160
(Lee Sang Yi even won
the Best Male Rookie Award.)

131
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,160
- Hello, Eun Jin.
- Hello.

132
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,230
(She was a 2nd-year resident
in "Hospital Playlist".)

133
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,530
(With her great acting skills
from plays and musicals,)

134
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,250
(Ahn Eun Jin shows
her strong presence.)

135
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,620
And we have Yoon Kyung here.

136
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,620
(Bae Yoon Kyung)

137
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,210
(She was the most talked-about
cast member...)

138
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,460
(in "Heart Signal Season 1".)

139
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,150
(And now she's establishing
her presence as an actress.)

140
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,850
(She did many dramas like
"Record of Youth"...)

141
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,260
(and "Hi Bye, Mama!".)

142
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,070
They are Bae Yoon Kyung,
Ahn Eun Jin, and Lee Sang Yi.

143
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,000
- Great.
- Hello.

144
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,660
(The 3 rising stars have come to
visit a variety show.)

145
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,810
So, Sang Yi.

146
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,270
Jong Kook would be
excited to hear this.

147
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,600
- Why?
- He's from Anyang.

148
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,970
(Thrilled)

149
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,180
- He's from Anyang.
- Anyang?

150
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,340
(Befuddled)

151
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,180
- Come here.
- Is that true? Welcome.

152
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,190
(He greets a friend from Anyang
with a big hug.)

153
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,340
Is he from Anyang?

154
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,820
Congratulations.

155
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,910
- This is great.
- Congratulations.

156
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,980
(Guests from Anyang get
the highest power in Running Man.)

157
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,020
Things will be easy for him today.

158
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,430
- My gosh.
- Regionalism and school relations.

159
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,520
This darn world runs on
school relations and regionalism.

160
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,660
We have to get rid
of the bad custom.

161
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,020
He's really happy to hear that.

162
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,200
He always cares about
regionalism and school relations.

163
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,570
And he's not ashamed of it at all.

164
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,530
And he cares about
regionalism the most.

165
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,140
I thought he seemed
somewhat familiar.

166
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,710
I kept saying that, right?
"He seems familiar."

167
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,820
Actually, Jong Kook was
eating sweet potatoes.

168
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,620
(Before he found out
that Sang Yi is from Anyang,)

169
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,150
(he only cared
about his sweet potatoes.)

170
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,410
(As soon as he says
he's from Anyang,)

171
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,560
(he became Jong Kook's favorite.)

172
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,150
(Anyang cartel)

173
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,930
- He's even blushing.
- Anyang is the best.

174
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,870
Like I said before,
Jong Kook cares...

175
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,370
- a lot about regionalism.
- Exactly.

176
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,460
He really does.

177
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,160
Although this is his first time
on Running Man,

178
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,580
Sang Yi is fitting in well already.

179
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,640
Congratulations.

180
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,180
- You're in Jong Kook's arms.
- Congratulations.

181
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,310
Seriously.

182
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,640
Things will be easy for you.

183
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,080
- Anyang.
- He's got the face of Anyang.

184
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,180
Anyang.

185
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,190
Sang Yi is also a musical actor.

186
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,260
He must have a lot of talents.

187
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,710
We have to hear him sing.

188
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,350
- I watched his performance.
- What?

189
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,560
- I watched his performance.
- Really?

190
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,830
Sang Yi performed
at MONNI's concert.

191
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,350
- I watched it.
- Really?

192
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,870
- In Samseong-dong?
- Yes.

193
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,430
Do you know the members of MONNI?

194
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,460
Yes. I know the drummer.

195
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,000
(I know the drummer.)

196
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,570
(Laughing)

197
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,770
She knows a lot of musicians.

198
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,810
I see.

199
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,100
She knows a lot of band members.

200
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,140
(She's got the sensitivity
of a band member.)

201
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,970
She knows a lot of musicians.

202
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,470
She's intimate with many musicians.

203
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,450
So Min is acquainted with
a lot of musicians.

204
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,650
I did a musical with Ahn Eun Jin.

205
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,060
Eun Jin? What was the musical?

206
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,520
- They are acquainted.
- We did a musical together.

207
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,930
- He's a friend from college.
- We went to the same college.

208
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,850
I see.

209
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,290
(As she saw Sang Yi get cheers
just because he's from Anyang...)

210
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,660
Isn't he amazing?
He's my friend from college.

211
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,940
Are you two close?

212
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,160
We went to college together.

213
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,830
He really is amazing.

214
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,250
Sang Yi prepared a song
and will play the acoustic guitar.

215
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,750
- I want to watch it.
- That's what So Min likes.

216
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,270
I want to hear him sing.

217
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,540
He sings really well.

218
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,540
- He plays the guitar?
- Sang Yi was...

219
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,280
the winner of a YouTube Star
UCC contest.

220
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,710
- What?
- UCC?

221
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,760
It's "Rainism"
of Anyang Arts High School.

222
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,260
- He was the winner.
- "Rainism"?

223
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,720
Sang Yi was quite popular.

224
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,770
He's amazing. And he was
the student representative.

225
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,570
The student representative?

226
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,960
- The student representative?
- He was a UCC star.

227
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,460
So Min is taking
a few steps forward.

228
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,160
- All of a sudden.
- She's revving up.

229
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,470
- She keeps coming closer.
- Because...

230
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,510
- This is what So Min likes.
- So Min likes stuff like this.

231
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,770
This is her favorite.

232
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,680
I love it.

233
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,140
I'll sing a little.

234
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,250
Okay.

235
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,820
(How are Sang Yi's
singing and guitar skills?)

236
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,950
1, 2, 3, and go.

237
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,280
(Excited)

238
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,560
- He's got great skills.
- This is nice.

239
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,890
He's got a sweet voice.

240
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,660
(Skillful guitar-playing
with a baritone voice)

241
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,630
<i>This is my gift for you</i>

242
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,090
This is like "K-Pop Star".

243
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,570
<i>Please accept it</i>

244
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,460
(He's a student representative
playing the guitar.)

245
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,210
(They feel like
they are on a school trip.)

246
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,600
<i>2 times 1 is 2, 2 times 2 is 4,
2 times 4 is 8</i>

247
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,050
<i>- 2 times 2 is 4, 2 times 4 is 8
</i>- He's singing "Iguana".

248
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,550
This is "Iguana".

249
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,150
You should go close to him.

250
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,560
(She loves the song,
so she approaches him slowly.)

251
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
<i>- 2 times 1 is 2, 2 times 2 is 4</i>
- This is fun.

252
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,930
<i>- 2 times 4 is 8
</i>- She likes it.

253
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,430
- This is her favorite.
<i>- 2 times 5 is 10</i>

254
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,160
(She moves her limbs to the rhythm
of the acoustic guitar.)

255
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,990
<i>Iguana</i>

256
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,260
(Despite her dance,
he shows off his singing skills.)

257
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,670
Yes!

258
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,990
(Despite her dance,
he shows off his singing skills.)

259
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,410
I've never heard this song before.

260
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,000
It's "Iguana". He sang "Iguana"!

261
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,230
- I can't believe it.
- How do you know this song?

262
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,470
I listened to "Iguana"
on my way here today.

263
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,550
- Today?
- Yes.

264
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,910
You think you two
are meant for each other, right?

265
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,550
- It's just a coincidence.
- Right.

266
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,710
- Yes, it's a coincidence.
- So just calm down.

267
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,610
He sounded great...

268
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,290
- but her weird dance ruined it.
- Yes, she danced like this.

269
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,530
- What's wrong with your dance?
- What?

270
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,560
I just think the lyrics are cute.

271
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,530
It was just like Eun Jin said.

272
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,750
- Yes.
- He was popular back then, right?

273
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,170
Yes, he was very popular.

274
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,330
He really is talented.

275
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,900
- I saw him play for about 10 years.
- Is that so?

276
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,170
- You mean this pattern?
- Yes.

277
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,000
- I see.
- So I'm familiar with his pattern.

278
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,680
It's good to see various
performances for the opening...

279
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,910
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

280
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,040
Well, excuse me.

281
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
Are you his ex-girlfriend?

282
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,050
(Suddenly curious because
she knows many details about him)

283
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,210
I think it's possible.

284
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,790
- You know too much about him.
- Things are cool between them.

285
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,880
- Did you date each other?
- No.

286
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,420
It's just because
we went to the same school.

287
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,120
- We practically grew up together.
- We were close.

288
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,030
We know everything about each other.

289
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,560
- Sadly, yes.
- Seriously.

290
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,800
We were in the same class
and we even performed together.

291
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,400
- We're kind of tired of each other.
- I see.

292
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,860
So we've learned...

293
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,440
a lot about Lee Sang Yi.

294
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,570
No guest ever played the guitar
and sang for the opening before.

295
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,540
I'm sure he would've felt sad
if you hadn't asked him to do it.

296
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,410
See? She knows too much.

297
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,830
- You're right.
- Close enough to be his ex.

298
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,370
- You two went out, didn't you?
- I'm sure of it.

299
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,500
I'm sure they dated.

300
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,740
You two went out, right?

301
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,280
Yes, they're close.

302
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,880
- What did I tell you?
- She knows too much.

303
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,380
It's so obvious, right?

304
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,980
- I'll ask you this.
- Okay.

305
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,820
- I didn't think you did.
- Okay.

306
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,110
- But...
- I'm sorry.

307
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,160
Are you trying to support him
as his ex-girlfriend?

308
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,220
- That's right.
- I knew it.

309
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,800
- She said yes.
- So she wants to support him.

310
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,930
- She said yes.
- She's a supporter.

311
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,700
She's supporting him
as his ex-girlfriend.

312
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
I didn't plan to, but it happened.

313
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,800
- Please give him a big hand.
- Yes.

314
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,570
(Sang Yi's introduction based on
regionalism and school relations)

315
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,670
He's very charming.

316
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,810
Next is Bae Yoon Kyung.

317
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,040
(Introducing Yoon Kyung after
Sang Yi's remarkable introduction)

318
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,680
(She saw how glad they were
because Sang Yi is from Anyang.)

319
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,710
(She's just confused
with all the complicated thoughts.)

320
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,580
(She even saw their strange
school connection.)

321
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,580
(So she thought carefully if she
has any connection with anyone.)

322
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,160
So Yoon Kyung.

323
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
Do you personally know anyone here?

324
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,620
Have you ever bumped
into anyone before?

325
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,090
(Who will have
a special connection with her?)

326
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,760
I've been to
Kwang Soo's movie preview.

327
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,230
- You have?
- Which movie?

328
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,440
"Inseparable Bros".

329
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,540
- Really?
- Right.

330
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,210
- We've been to that one.
- Yes, we have.

331
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,230
We've been there too.

332
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,040
Right, "Inseparable Bros".

333
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,910
I left in the middle
because of a soccer game.

334
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,870
- Right, you did.
- So I don't know how it ends.

335
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,240
- That's why I don't know the end.
- Right.

336
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,280
(Kwang Soo feels bad.)

337
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,950
He really left in the middle.
Did you watch it later?

338
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,290
No, I didn't.

339
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,980
I tried to send him a thank you
message after the premiere.

340
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
But then I saw a picture of him
playing soccer on his Instagram.

341
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,350
So I knew he went to play soccer.

342
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,750
I saw him at the premiere
but he went to play soccer.

343
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,900
So schedule the premiere
earlier next time.

344
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,760
Because I have soccer games
at that time.

345
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,200
I actually saw Ji Hyo too.

346
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,860
- Where did you see Ji Hyo?
- Me?

347
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,210
At Ms. Hong Da's wedding.

348
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,670
- Who?
- In Jeonju?

349
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,330
- Yes, in Jeonju.
- In Jeonju?

350
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,180
- In Jeonju?
- You saw her in Jeonju?

351
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,450
- Is that so?
- Who is she?

352
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,340
She's my hairdresser.

353
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,210
Ji Hyo hosted the wedding
for her hairdresser.

354
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,110
- Yes, I hosted the wedding.
- Ji Hyo hosted the wedding?

355
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,190
Oh, really?

356
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,880
- Yes, I hosted the wedding.
- Ji Hyo hosted the wedding?

357
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,960
Seriously?

358
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Gosh.

359
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,960
Ji Hyo, you hosted the wedding?

360
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,250
- You did?
- Seriously?

361
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,350
- My goodness.
- You?

362
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,590
- I can't believe it.
- Why?

363
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,300
- She hosted the wedding?
- You did?

364
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,490
How did that happen?

365
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,200
Why didn't you tell us about it?

366
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,540
So how did it go?

367
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,960
It went well.

368
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,260
I've never heard that
Ji Hyo hosted someone's wedding.

369
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,500
- I can't believe it.
- Amazing.

370
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,710
You host weddings too?

371
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,970
Gosh, you're so cool.

372
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,370
Okay, it was Yoon Kyung.

373
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,680
Next is Ahn Eun Jin.

374
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,000
(Everyone calms down
to introduce Eun Jin!)

375
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,110
Hello, everyone.

376
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,320
So you went to the same college
as Sang Yi, right?

377
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,150
Did she have a nickname in college?

378
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,660
It was "Angel Eun Duin".

379
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,480
She wanted everyone
to call her "Angel".

380
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,620
- No.
- She called herself "Angel"?

381
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,060
- That's not true.
- You called yourself "Angel"?

382
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,400
- No, no.
- You called yourself that?

383
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,350
It was my Buddy Buddy ID.

384
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,860
That's why they called me that.

385
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,960
Gosh, Buddy Buddy.

386
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,700
- I haven't heard it in a long time.
- We're from the same generation.

387
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,760
- Gosh, Buddy Buddy.
- That's why...

388
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,940
they called me "Angel Eun Duin".

389
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,070
- So it was your ID.
- Yes.

390
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,570
Come on. It wasn't like that.

391
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,830
- How was it like then?
- You were like this.

392
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,940
You said, "I'm an angel.
So call me Angel Eun Duin."

393
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,410
I was that cute in college?

394
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,210
- Yes.
- So I was cute.

395
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,710
What is this?

396
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,150
- My goodness.
- I think...

397
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,580
- these two were...
- Yes.

398
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,420
not really that close.

399
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,820
Maybe something
went on between them.

400
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,350
- Maybe a little.
- Actually, I wasn't...

401
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,030
a very good student in college.

402
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,830
But he was the class rep so
he always told me to join things.

403
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,660
He was
our first class representative.

404
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,670
He wanted us to be
in all the meetings.

405
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,530
- He always called.
- He was passionate.

406
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,940
So he sent you messages
to attend the meetings?

407
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,760
I'm sure you're the only one
who got those messages.

408
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,960
My goodness.

409
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,330
- I told you they didn't date.
- Are you sure about that?

410
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,710
She said no.

411
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,810
Come on.

412
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,080
I love what you're insinuating.

413
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,680
It's like a teen drama.

414
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,550
So he sent her a message
pretending everyone else got it.

415
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,290
- Right.
- And he waited with flowers.

416
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,840
Yes, with the guitar.

417
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,080
I love the story.

418
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,060
- Yes, ready to sing "Iguana".
- I love the story.

419
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,350
Don't you think you're too excited?

420
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,930
- I love this story.
- You do, don't you?

421
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,850
Then he says, "You're the only one
I asked to come."

422
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,330
So that's what happened.

423
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,620
- He waited alone.
- Right.

424
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,700
Do you know what Eun Jin said?

425
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,400
"So that's what happened."

426
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,830
Give them a big hand, everyone.

427
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,360
(Their introductions are over
with many special connections!)

428
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,330
Before we start the race,

429
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,730
we'll divide you into teams.

430
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,650
Three guests will be the leaders
in the first round.

431
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,610
(The special rule
the guests don't know)

432
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,450
(Among the three chairs,)

433
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,580
(the one on the very right
will fall apart.)

434
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,480
(The guest who chooses the chair
will be a Penalty Man...)

435
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,350
(with Kwang Soo and So Min.)

436
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,830
(They don't know
about the special rule.)

437
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,200
So all three of you should
sit in these chairs for the leaders.

438
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,260
Please.

439
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,490
(After the introduction,
they're being guided to the game)

440
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,860
You can choose the one you want.

441
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,070
Should we sit down?

442
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,470
Yes, Yoon Kyung, Sang Yi,
and Eun Jin. Have a seat.

443
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,470
(Who will have the honor
of becoming a Penalty Man?)

444
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,740
(It's Sang Yi.)

445
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,050
(He confidently took a seat
as the team leader.)

446
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,320
My goodness.

447
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,610
(Everything he built on connections
and singing has been ruined.)

448
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,290
So we're starting the game now?

449
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,080
It's already started?

450
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,480
(The class representative's
friendly slapstick comedy)

451
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,530
All right.

452
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,960
(The class representative's
friendly slapstick comedy)

453
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,960
So the game has already started?

454
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,400
The game has already started?

455
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,300
How could you
fall on your back like that?

456
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,800
So is this what this place is like?

457
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,360
- This wasn't that bad.
- Okay.

458
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,500
I guess Sang Yi was quite surprised.

459
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,280
It's 2021 New Year
Driving Out Bad Luck Race,

460
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,970
Take My Bad Luck Away.

461
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,370
Today, we'll let you know
what the penalty is in advance.

462
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,410
Okay, what is it?

463
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,680
Like in the old days,

464
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,710
you'll go through a race
under a large scale water bomb.

465
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,560
(They had the large scale
water bomb specially made.)

466
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,220
- My goodness.
- I really hate this.

467
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,580
Why is it always cold
when we do something like this?

468
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,030
- Yes, it's cold.
- It's so cold today.

469
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,170
The three chosen Penalty Men
are on one team.

470
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,930
And the rest of you
will be divided into two teams.

471
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,460
So a total of three teams
will compete in the race.

472
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,730
After each mission,

473
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,710
one member of the losing team
will be chosen...

474
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,830
to be sent to Team Penalty.

475
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,870
(Team Penalty can bring one from
the losing team after each mission.)

476
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,970
And at the final race,
Team Penalty will compete...

477
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,710
against the rest of the members.

478
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,780
So they'll get more members.

479
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,210
Through the races, Penalty Men will
be able to switch teams.

480
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,980
Penalty Men will move around
but at the last round,

481
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,960
the team with more Penalty Men
will lose the race.

482
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,250
And Penalty Men in the losing team
will get the penalty.

483
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,900
(Penalty Men in the losing team
will get the penalty as well.)

484
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,430
And there's a separate rule...

485
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,030
of penalty tickets.

486
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,830
Every member will get
12 penalty tickets.

487
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,590
You've just received the tickets.

488
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,460
So you have 4 numbers
from 1 to 4 in the first digit...

489
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,810
and 4 numbers
from 1 to 4 in the second digit.

490
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,810
Which means you have
16 tickets in total.

491
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,910
And through the missions,

492
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,000
we will give you mission funds
according to the ranking.

493
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,710
You may use the funds
to get rid of your penalty tickets.

494
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,450
(Everyone starts with 16 tickets but
they can remove them with the fund.)

495
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,290
Also, we will draw lots.

496
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,950
If you have the number
we pick, you'll get the penalty.

497
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,980
All right.

498
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,880
(Every member who has the chosen
number will get the penalty.)

499
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,720
(Penalty Men in the losing team
and the members...)

500
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,560
(who have the number that has been
drawn will get the penalty.)

501
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,930
I should get rid of
all the tickets then.

502
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,030
You're right.

503
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,200
Getting rid of the tickets is good?

504
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,930
Three Penalty Men...

505
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,300
will divide the rest into two teams.

506
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,670
(Team Penalty Men, Team Eun Jin,
and Team Yoon Kyung)

507
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,410
Each team will take a picture
with their members.

508
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,780
A group picture?

509
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,340
Gosh, I wanted to use this.

510
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,410
Does each team get one?

511
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,740
2, 3.

512
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,420
(They'll do anything
for the production cost.)

513
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,510
Here we go. 1, 2.

514
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,710
Let's see. See more.

515
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,010
(Aiming for her one shot)

516
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,090
Portrait mode.

517
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,020
(Testing the functions for selfies)

518
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,860
There are so many functions.
I'll lower it.

519
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,900
Here it is. Gosh.

520
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,060
- You lowered it?
- Check this out.

521
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,170
The background gets darker
if I do this.

522
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,600
- It's amazing.
- It looks edited.

523
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,000
If you're done,
you may change your clothes.

524
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,070
- Haha, I'll take your picture.
- Okay.

525
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,640
- Why don't you sit over there?
- All right.

526
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,350
That's it.

527
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,910
Wait.

528
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,920
Ready?

529
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,620
Yellow.

530
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,120
- That's it.
- How is it?

531
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,280
Check this out.
I zoomed in 30 times.

532
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,360
Hey.

533
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,190
- What's this?
- Just look.

534
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,430
My mustache really looks dirty.

535
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,790
This one is really nice.

536
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,990
(Now let's go get
some mission funds!)

537
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,760
Why isn't Suk Jin coming?

538
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,200
He's busy doing product placement.

539
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,100
But it won't help
to promote the product at all.

540
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,290
I guess they're taking a risk.

541
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,300
Actually...

542
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,670
Suk Jin is using the product.

543
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,110
But he's not using the camera.

544
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,380
Why are you taking it from far away?

545
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,540
(He is in the group picture.)

546
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,270
- Suk Jin.
- Hey!

547
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,970
- Jong Kook.
- 1, 2, 3.

548
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,970
(Taking a picture from far away)

549
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,210
Even if it's far,

550
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,540
pretty people will look pretty
in the picture.

551
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,210
(Editing Suk Jin out)

552
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,810
- Did you only get them in the shot?
- No.

553
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,860
But the camera is facing that way.

554
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,480
How can I only get them in the shot
when I'm so far away?

555
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,100
Okay. Does it look good?

556
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,170
- Hey, you only got...
- It was very far.

557
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,940
But look how clear it is.

558
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,490
You only took a photo of them.

559
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,800
- 10 times?
- Yes, I zoomed in 10 times.

560
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,000
(While they work hard
doing product placement...)

561
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,270
Do you have rubber bands?

562
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,610
Thanks, Yoo Ri.

563
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,910
- It'll look okay with a trim.
- Pull it. It's fake.

564
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,950
I think it's a hairpiece.

565
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,770
- Wait, Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

566
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,920
(Playful Jae Suk is
tying Kwang Soo's hair back.)

567
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,950
- Wait.
- Can't believe it.

568
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,710
- Doesn't he look like...
- Don't make him look handsome.

569
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,860
I have to.

570
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,250
- Do I really look okay?
- Jae Suk cares for you.

571
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,960
He really looks nice.

572
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,290
He does, right?

573
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,290
- Seriously.
- But the side view doesn't.

574
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,100
- You look great.
- It's amazing.

575
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,760
- Really?
- Yes, you look great.

576
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,340
You look much better.

577
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,800
- Well, it feels cool.
- You look gross.

578
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,870
I look gross?

579
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,210
- Hey.
- Kwang Soo.

580
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,500
Isn't this nice?

581
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,740
- It's gross.
- You look great.

582
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,240
- Kwang Soo.
- Isn't this nice?

583
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,810
There's an emoticon like this.

584
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,150
- Right.
- What emoticon?

585
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,350
- You look really good.
- There's an emoticon like that.

586
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,390
Isn't that a wig he's wearing?

587
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,160
- He grew his hair.
- Really?

588
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,860
This is much better.

589
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,090
- They say you look cool.
- Look at them.

590
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,050
They are talking about you
in whispers. You're so popular.

591
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,790
Do you like my hair?

592
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,220
Yes. You look pretty.

593
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,720
He's popular again.

594
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,230
- My gosh.
- This is what happens all the time.

595
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,400
You're a star.

596
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,500
You should buy me a drink.

597
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,260
- It's always your best days.
- Last week,

598
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,030
- when Suk Jin...
- He's popular again.

599
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,070
He likes it.

600
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,570
That doesn't feel so bad.

601
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,620
- He should've done it sooner.
- It feels great.

602
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,090
Here's your first mission.

603
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,350
It's Need Communication...

604
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,310
where you need to communicate
with your team members.

605
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,020
Each team will
do the mission in turn.

606
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,720
All the team members will wear
headphones that play loud music.

607
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,630
One will give questions,
one will answer,

608
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,990
and the rest will sit under the
balloon that grows bigger over time.

609
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,700
Oh no.

610
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,760
So it's like Shout in Silence.

611
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,800
If you listen to the question
and answer it, you get one point.

612
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,570
If your team member gives
the correct answer or passes,

613
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,210
the players should switch seats.

614
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,070
(The players who give questions
should switch seats.)

615
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,280
We give questions in turn.

616
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,920
I shouldn't be sitting
under the balloon...

617
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,550
- at the last moment.
- And you'll be covered...

618
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,090
with flour once the balloon bursts.

619
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,320
Okay.

620
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,280
- The Penalty Men should go first.
- Do it with confidence.

621
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,320
Good.

622
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,100
- All right.
- Let's go.

623
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,560
Okay.

624
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,720
Make sure to explain it well.

625
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,700
- Ready.
- Let's do this.

626
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,110
We can do this.

627
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,370
Start.

628
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,380
(The balloon starts to be inflated.)

629
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,650
What?

630
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,000
(Confession)

631
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,380
(The first word is confession.)

632
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,920
I like you.

633
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,190
- You like me?
- Yes.

634
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,280
(I like you.)

635
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,050
(A word caught Love Frog's ear.)

636
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,930
- What is it called?
- She got it right away.

637
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,590
How could she hear that right away?

638
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,130
(She's good at listening tests
when it comes to love.)

639
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,260
It's a noun.

640
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,560
What? Do you like me?

641
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,060
- It's a noun.
- That's not it.

642
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,840
- It's a noun.
- You should answer it.

643
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,060
"I like you."

644
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,610
It's a noun.

645
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,680
- Proposal.
- It's something like that.

646
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,340
- Before a proposal...
- Propose.

647
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,610
Proposal?

648
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,680
- Proposal? Propose.
- Something before a proposal.

649
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,680
- Confession.
- Two syllables.

650
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,390
(She got the first word
right quite quickly.)

651
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,850
It was hard,
but she got it right anyway.

652
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,710
This is hard.

653
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,890
It's hard to explain.

654
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,660
(The second word is phone number.)

655
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,320
- Phone.
- Phone.

656
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,200
- Num.
- Num.

657
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,220
- Ber.
- Ber.

658
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,520
- Num.
- Num.

659
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,990
(Is he just reading the word?)

660
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,170
You can't do that.

661
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,140
You should explain the word.

662
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,840
- You can't do that.
- Telephone.

663
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,170
- Correct.
- You can't do that.

664
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,710
The balloon is about to burst.

665
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,530
(Pad Thai)

666
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,740
Good.

667
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,070
- Vietnamese food.
- No.

668
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,010
(Vietnam?)

669
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,510
- No.
- Vietnam.

670
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,850
- It's Thai food.
- It's Thailand.

671
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,090
Whale?

672
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,620
(They got off on the wrong foot,
so they are just wasting time.)

673
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,890
Bow tie. Tie. Bow tie.

674
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,050
- Pass it!
- Tie.

675
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,220
Oh no.

676
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,700
(The balloon is
getting a lot bigger.)

677
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,200
Pass it!

678
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,820
- Tie.
- Pass it!

679
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,760
- It's a Vietnamese noodle dish.
- What?

680
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,760
A Vietnamese noodle dish.

681
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,410
- Pass it.
- A Vietnamese noodle dish.

682
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,640
- What?
- Pass it!

683
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,340
Pass the question!

684
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,970
Pass!

685
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,880
Pass!

686
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,650
Pass it!

687
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,710
Pass!

688
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,240
- What is it?
- Pass.

689
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,120
- Pass.
- No, I want to answer it.

690
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,540
You can't get it right.

691
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,710
No, I want to answer it.

692
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,050
You can't get it right.

693
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,890
- Pass it!
- He's such a fool.

694
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,160
- What a fool.
- Pass the question!

695
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,630
You don't know it. Pass it.

696
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,290
Do you not know
a Vietnamese noodle dish?

697
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,460
I don't know anything.

698
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,760
- I don't know. Let's just pass.
- I don't know?

699
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,600
(At the moment...)

700
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,910
- Pass it!
- Look at him.

701
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,370
Pass!

702
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,030
My goodness.

703
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,610
Pass.

704
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,450
This is too big.

705
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,880
(It finally bursts.)

706
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,010
(No one listened
to Kwang Soo's shout.)

707
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,120
It's too big.

708
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,770
(No one listened
to Kwang Soo's shout.)

709
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,120
(The boy with twin tails
has become a wreck.)

710
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,190
It looks like he got hit.

711
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,660
It was loud.

712
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,460
I mean, he didn't explain it well.

713
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,790
You should explain it in words.

714
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,990
You shouldn't make gestures.

715
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,460
You should only say words.

716
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,110
Guys, you should explain it
with your hands behind your back.

717
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,910
- Okay.
- Put your hands behind your back.

718
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,270
Ready. Start.
You can't make any gestures.

719
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,650
(Mouthwash)

720
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,740
(The first word is mouthwash.)

721
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,420
You gargle with this.

722
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,590
- Gargle?
- You eat something...

723
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,890
when your breath stinks.

724
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,660
- Eat it?
- You gargle and spit.

725
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,250
- Gargle?
- Your mouth...

726
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,220
Gargle.

727
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,020
- You gargle with this.
- Garglin.

728
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,660
- Garglin?
- You gargle with this.

729
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,290
It's a brand name.

730
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,220
What is it called?

731
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,290
- Gargle liquid?
- No.

732
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,400
- He doesn't know the word.
- He doesn't know.

733
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,210
He doesn't know the word.

734
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,070
No. What is it called
in a fancy word?

735
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,350
In a fancy word?

736
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,570
You gargle with this.
What is it called?

737
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,120
It's not fancy at all.

738
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,150
(Mouthwash is a fancy word
to Empty Head of Running Man.)

739
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,850
You gargle with this.
What is it called?

740
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,660
He's so ugly.

741
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,520
- What is he saying?
- You stupid punk.

742
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,820
(Extremely frustrated)

743
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,860
You gargle with it.

744
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,520
(He opens his heart taking advantage
of the silence from the headphone.)

745
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,290
You gargle with it.

746
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,400
No. You gargle like this.
What is it called?

747
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,060
- Hey, just pass it.
- What is this called?

748
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,410
It's a gargle.

749
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,340
Tell me how many syllables it has.

750
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,770
Sam.

751
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,850
Gam?

752
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,310
- Sam.
- Sam.

753
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,240
- Hap.
- Samhap?

754
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,740
- Samhap?
- What's in samhap?

755
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,920
Skate.

756
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,460
- Right.
- Okay.

757
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,930
She's good.

758
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,090
She's good.

759
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,290
(Scandal)

760
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,630
She's doing a good job.

761
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,560
(Jae Suk should explain
the word, "scandal".)

762
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,790
- Hey.
- What?

763
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,370
This is... Well...

764
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,460
(Clapping)

765
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,710
He can't explain the word.

766
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,910
He's stuck.

767
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,910
It's something between
a man and a woman.

768
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,070
What did you say?

769
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,650
- Well, the thing is...
- What?

770
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,210
That's what stars have.

771
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,210
What is he talking about?

772
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,190
- Stars have...
- What?

773
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,920
- When stars meet...
- He's really bad at this.

774
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
- They take pictures and...
- Gestures.

775
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,390
- No gestures.
- They do this thing.

776
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,790
- Don't make gestures.
- What are you talking about?

777
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,520
Suk Jin shouldn't see anyone now.

778
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,520
But he sees someone.

779
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,900
It's something like that.

780
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,940
Blind date.

781
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,960
Three syllables.

782
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,530
- He met someone?
- I mean, Jong Kook...

783
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,060
- Jong Kook?
- Jong Kook...

784
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,140
- Yoon Eun Hye.
- He has a girlfriend.

785
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,970
(He just says
the name automatically.)

786
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,880
- Pass. What are you talking about?
- This is frustrating.

787
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,920
- He can't explain the word.
- That's cheating.

788
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,850
Why can't you get it right?

789
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,360
What is this?

790
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,690
- He doesn't know what it means.
- It's a bad guy.

791
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,550
He's really...

792
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,520
(Ingratitude means bad.)

793
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,660
He's really mean.

794
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,200
I mean...

795
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,400
(He barely explains
the feeling of the word.)

796
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,290
- He doesn't know this word.
- I'm younger than you.

797
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,960
- You're younger.
- I'm younger than you.

798
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm younger, but I call you stupid.

799
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,640
- Mutiny.
- I call you a fool.

800
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,500
I'm bad. I'm a jerk.

801
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,740
What is it called?

802
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,740
- Is that what it means?
- It's a Chinese idiom.

803
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,510
The younger one is mean
to the older one.

804
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,510
Oh, right. That's what you like.

805
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,810
What?

806
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,660
What's the word?
It's "Fruits of diligent study".

807
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,720
No.

808
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,320
"Fruits of diligent study"?

809
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,520
What does it have to do
with "Fruits of diligent study"?

810
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,720
What was that?
Is it nangjungjichu or something?

811
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,260
- This is crazy.
- You're so...

812
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,900
(Popping)

813
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,710
(Team Yoon Kyung gets 1 point.)

814
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,710
I'm startled.

815
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,730
I'll surprise you.

816
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,840
I'm going to surprise you.

817
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,180
Ready.

818
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,240
(Team Eun Jin took risks
and let Suk Jin answer questions.)

819
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,740
Start.

820
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,010
Suk Jin is answering.

821
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,540
(In-laws)

822
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,620
This is easy.

823
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,210
- I have a stomachache.
- When do we start?

824
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,780
If he buys land...

825
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,050
- Grab medicine?
- Buy land.

826
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,720
- Catch chicken?
- I get a stomachache.

827
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,250
- Stomach.
- It's done.

828
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,860
- Isn't it a cousin?
- Stomach.

829
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,550
I get a stomachache.

830
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,290
The saying says a cousin.

831
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,870
- If he buys land, I get jealous.
- Stomachache.

832
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,100
Jealous?

833
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,440
- In-laws.
- Right.

834
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,000
I get jealous
when my in-law buys land.

835
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,210
(And he got it right?)

836
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,640
He got it right.

837
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,500
He's supposed to say a cousin.

838
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,800
It's about a cousin.

839
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,010
The saying goes, "You get jealous
when your cousin buys land."

840
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,310
(Joe Biden)

841
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,120
- The US president.
- Soap.

842
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,190
- Jeoktoma.
- Jeoktoma.

843
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,930
- The US president.
- Soap.

844
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,520
- President?
- Yes.

845
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,050
- Soap president?
- The new president.

846
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,990
- Soap?
- US.

847
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,960
- Soap president?
- The US president, you fool.

848
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,320
Soap president?

849
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,230
- Soap?
- Start over.

850
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,000
Soap president?

851
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,260
Aekyung?

852
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,970
(Is the soap president Aekyung?)

853
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,140
What?

854
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,850
- Aekyung?
- Did he say Aekyung?

855
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,240
Because it's soap.

856
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,680
(He says all the companies he knows
to find the soap president.)

857
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,010
Aekyung?

858
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,540
Pass.

859
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,010
- What's the soap president?
- Why is it so hard?

860
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,280
Jong Kook is upset. He's mad.

861
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,550
I mean...

862
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,700
What on earth is the soap president?

863
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,290
(They've done only one word,
but they are getting really upset.)

864
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,900
(Pancake)

865
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
(Wiggling)

866
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
- Okay?
- Eun Jin tries to look nice.

867
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,460
What are you doing?
You should hurry.

868
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,910
Just hurry.

869
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,110
On a birthday.

870
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,970
- Birthday.
- Birthday.

871
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,530
You eat this.

872
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,910
I eat this on my birthday?

873
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,570
Cake.

874
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,740
- And...
- Cake.

875
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,710
- Cake.
- There's one more syllable.

876
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,810
(Eun Jin keeps
wiggling her fingers.)

877
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,210
- Don't move your hands.
- Birthday.

878
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,920
- Birthday?
- You eat it on your birthday.

879
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,020
Cake.

880
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,520
- Eun Jin's face is really funny.
- In front of the word.

881
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,860
Something cake.

882
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,720
Suk Jin can't
get it right this way.

883
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,790
Happy birthday.

884
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,060
See? He doesn't know.

885
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,440
But it's something cake.

886
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,870
Eun Jin's face is really funny.

887
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,910
Cheesecake?

888
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,910
(Oh, cheesecake?)

889
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,270
I don't know how else to explain.

890
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,110
- Cheesecake?
- A plate to put it on.

891
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,040
- He thinks it's a type of cake.
- Pass.

892
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,810
- Oh, gosh. What do we do?
- Eun Jin is so funny.

893
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,180
That was hilarious.

894
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,540
- It's going to pop shortly.
- "Soap".

895
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,280
(Prima donna)

896
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,250
(A prima donna is the lead female
soprano singer of an opera.)

897
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,360
That's difficult.

898
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,190
That's difficult.
How should he explain it?

899
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,720
Oh, boy. How will he explain it?

900
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,890
The US!

901
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,960
(The US!)

902
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,660
- Soap?
- No, no.

903
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,900
- Gosh, I'm so frustrated.
- "Soap" again?

904
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,790
- The US...
- He's already tired.

905
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,640
She sang "Like a Virgin"!

906
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,140
"It's raining"?

907
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,460
The female singer!

908
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,710
- "Fur leather"?
- From the US!

909
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,030
- "Tiger Mask"?
- "Like a Virgin"...

910
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,470
- Time's over.
- My, it's so loud.

911
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,450
How should I explain it?
I should've passed it.

912
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,450
- "Madonna".
- Gosh, Suk Jin.

913
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,180
Why couldn't you guess Joe Biden?

914
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,540
- Why? When did you...
- She said the US president.

915
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,920
The US president.

916
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,190
Why would you say
a soap brand name instead?

917
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,890
Why did you mishear "the US"
as "soap"?

918
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,360
Your lips and hers look different.

919
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,930
- Ji Hyo, how did say it? Show me.
- You kept saying...

920
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,630
"The US Ma..."
Darn it. I said "Madonna".

921
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,720
Just say "the US".

922
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,160
"The US president".

923
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,400
- Just say "the US".
- "The US".

924
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,170
(They suddenly started
reenacting the moment.)

925
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,170
(Just say "the US".)

926
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,500
- "The US".
- I said it more than 100 times.

927
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,640
- Did you pronounce it properly?
- He doesn't know anyway.

928
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,770
- I mean...
- Why are you getting upset at her?

929
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,880
- Stop fighting.
- Listen to me.

930
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,570
- There's no way of doing it well.
- You're being too sensitive.

931
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,970
- Why are you being so sensitive?
- Why couldn't you get it?

932
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,540
- Just say "the US".
- It wasn't like that.

933
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,210
I thought there's someone
called the soap president.

934
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,550
I'm not sure if I can explain well.
Hold on a second.

935
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,430
- It was difficult to explain.
- There you go.

936
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,130
- You can do it!
- Wait.

937
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,860
Must I let him do things like this
to me when he's younger than me?

938
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,020
"Ingratitude"!

939
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,790
You can do this, right?

940
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,990
You can do it!

941
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,260
(Everyone in here is so playful.)

942
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,530
Let's do this!

943
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,140
(Yoo Jae Suk)

944
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,030
This is hard to guess.

945
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:58,450
(The 1st word is Yoo Jae Suk.)

946
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,620
He's ugly!

947
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,390
(She shouted out loud
to let everyone know he's ugly.)

948
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,090
He's ugly!

949
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,160
Yoo Jae Suk!

950
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,750
(But Kwang Soo got it right!)

951
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,060
(He got the correct answer magically
from a single hint "ugly".)

952
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,760
(I'm ugly?)

953
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,260
(He got the answer right so fast
that her jaw dropped.)

954
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,670
- That was incredible.
- My goodness.

955
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,760
(That gave everyone goosebumps.)

956
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,530
- What just happened?
- How did he know?

957
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,500
- Gosh.
- That was so funny.

958
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,800
How did he know?

959
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,450
(The next question is
"unconcealable talent".)

960
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,350
- Fruits of diligent study!
- "Fruits of diligent study"?

961
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,770
Another expression other than that.

962
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,780
There are too many.

963
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,890
Fruits of late-night study?

964
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,550
(Team Penalty Men gained 1 point
in Round 2.)

965
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,720
To pee...

966
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,320
- "To pee"?
- Yes!

967
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,600
- Anywhere!
- Urinating in public!

968
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,790
Urinating in public.
Switch your seats quickly.

969
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,560
(Team Yoon Kyung also
gained 1 point in Round 2.)

970
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,260
- Let's do this.
- Here I go.

971
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,460
Let's do this properly.

972
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,870
- Jong Kook, look at us too.
- Turn it around.

973
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,170
- Let's go!
- Being in second place is good too.

974
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,530
- Ready. Go.
- Hasn't it begun yet?

975
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,840
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

976
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,240
- Go.
- Oh, no. It's difficult.

977
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,650
(The answer is
"The Way This Guy Lives".)

978
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,450
- It's a fast-tempo song.
- It's difficult.

979
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,890
What? Speak slowly.

980
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,890
(Singing)

981
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,160
(He suddenly started singing.)

982
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,720
- What is he doing?
- What is that?

983
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,090
- What's that? Are you singing?
- He could just...

984
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,160
That's not how the song goes.

985
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,520
- Is it a song?
- It's a song!

986
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,900
- He's singing "Barefooted Youth".
- That's ridiculous.

987
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,670
- That's "Barefooted Youth".
- He's singing the wrong song?

988
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,670
(He keeps singing the song
that's not related to the answer.)

989
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,700
(This won't work.)

990
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,910
That's not the song
he should sing.

991
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,880
- Is it a song?
- It's a song. It has five words.

992
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,570
- What song is it?
- What is he doing?

993
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,410
- I don't even know.
- That's not the song.

994
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,570
- I don't know! Pass it!
- Tell me if you don't know.

995
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,270
- You don't know? Okay.
- I don't know.

996
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,270
(They passed it in the end.)

997
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,280
- Isn't it SECHSKIES' song?
- Pass.

998
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,280
- I live and die by style
- What was that?

999
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,690
- Wasn't that "Barefooted Youth"?
- Yes.

1000
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,280
- That's Buck's song.
- Gosh.

1001
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,280
(Stock)

1002
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,200
- Let's go. Let's go.
- What a shame.

1003
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,170
- Samsung Elec...
- I should be guessing the answer.

1004
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,220
El?

1005
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,220
(Samsung Elec...)

1006
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,790
(Sam!)

1007
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,790
(Sung!)

1008
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,260
(Samsung Elec...)

1009
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,670
- What is she doing?
- Kakao.

1010
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,970
- My gosh.
- What?

1011
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,530
("Kakao")

1012
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,470
Gosh. This is no joke.

1013
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,180
You shouldn't explain it like that.

1014
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,680
She's amazing.

1015
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,270
- Te!
- "Te"?

1016
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,780
(Te...)

1017
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,590
Tesla.

1018
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,160
- "Tae Jin Ah"?
- Te...

1019
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,750
(She urgently said
the hottest blue-chip stock.)

1020
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,050
"Tae Jin Ah"?

1021
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,250
(He misheard it as "Tae Jin Ah".)

1022
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,870
(She's trying to express
stock price increase.)

1023
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,640
"Tae Jin Ah"?
Did you say "Tae Jin Ah"?

1024
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,030
(It's going up.)

1025
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,870
(The price of the stock I have
is staying the same.)

1026
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,960
(The price of the stock
she's holding hasn't changed.)

1027
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,770
My goodness. Eun Jin is so funny.

1028
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,070
- Te...
- "Tae".

1029
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,070
- S...
- "Jin".

1030
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,110
- La.
- "Ah".

1031
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,650
I bet Jong Kook can't even imagine
the correct answer.

1032
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,680
- "Tae Jin Ah"!
- It's going up.

1033
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,090
(Going up)

1034
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,810
- "Tae Jin Ah"!
- It's going up.

1035
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,090
Yes, Tesla.

1036
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,710
- "Tae Jin Ah"!
- "Going up!"

1037
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,480
(She uses her hands more and more.)

1038
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,090
- Eun Jin is hilarious.
- I'm sure she invested in stocks.

1039
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,660
- She's so funny.
- Definitely.

1040
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,490
Tae Jin Ah is going up?

1041
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,490
Oh, wait. Is it stock?

1042
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,640
- Yes!
- That's amazing. He got it right.

1043
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,140
What does Tae Jin Ah have to do
with stocks?

1044
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,340
That's amazing.

1045
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,170
(They barely got the correct answer
with company names and gestures.)

1046
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,800
(If they get another one right,
they'll tie with Team Penalty Men.)

1047
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,030
How many points did they score?

1048
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,150
- That's difficult.
- We're doing well!

1049
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,340
- Of course.
- It'd be even harder.

1050
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,380
(Sweet potato)

1051
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,510
(They must get the correct answer
before the balloon pops.)

1052
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,720
- You...
- I...

1053
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,280
- ate this...
- Haha?

1054
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,780
- earlier in the morning.
- My business partner? At his house?

1055
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
What?

1056
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,590
You ate this. You ate it.

1057
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,860
(The balloon is about to pop.)

1058
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,030
What? At Haha's house?

1059
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,070
(Pop)

1060
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,800
- They got many answers right.
- I did what at Haha's house?

1061
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
You ate it in the morning.

1062
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,070
- Oh, sweet potato?
- Eun Jin did a great job.

1063
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,510
(Team Penalty Men is
still in 1st place.)

1064
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,030
Saying company names
was a good strategy.

1065
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,380
- Why did you say "Tae Jin Ah"?
- It's been going up.

1066
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,970
Suk Jin, can you sing
"The Way This Guy Lives" again?

1067
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:51,970
No, that's...

1068
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,070
(He's still singing the same song.)

1069
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,820
("Barefooted Youth")

1070
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,650
(Woo-ah! Woo-ah!)

1071
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,820
- Oh, right.
- Why did you even sing?

1072
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,530
Did you think he could
hear you sing?

1073
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,530
I don't know many songs either.

1074
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,960
He tried to make it easier
for him to guess.

1075
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,960
He sang "Barefooted Youth".

1076
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,260
(This is how
"The Way This Guy Lives" goes.)

1077
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,240
- Oh, that's right.
- SECHSKIES.

1078
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,170
- Darn it.
- As a result,

1079
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,970
- Team Penalty Men came in first.
- Okay!

1080
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,970
(Team Penalty Men came in 1st
with 3 points.)

1081
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,340
Team Eun Jin is in 2nd place,
and Team Yoon Kyung is in 3rd place.

1082
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,650
What a shame.

1083
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,240
- I'm relieved.
- We did quite well.

1084
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,340
I'm so relieved.

1085
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,150
As I told you earlier,

1086
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,090
the more mission fund you get,

1087
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,550
the more penalty tickets...

1088
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,380
- you can get rid of.
- Yes.

1089
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,920
We'll give you the drawing board
for R money.

1090
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,900
Each member of the teams
can pick...

1091
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,860
1 out of 5 in the section
of your team ranking.

1092
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,130
I haven't done this in a long time.
When I was a little boy,

1093
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,420
- in front of schools,
- Team Penalty Men.

1094
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,760
- kids would do this after school.
- Pick one.

1095
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,440
- Each of us gets 1?
- Pick just 1.

1096
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,070
- 2 of them will be left.
- Everyone gets 1?

1097
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,070
Just pick one.

1098
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,780
Okay. Pick one.

1099
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,670
- You want this one?
- No.

1100
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,780
Among those pieces of paper,

1101
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,920
2 of them are 100 dollars,
the rest are 80, 60, and 0 dollars.

1102
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,880
(How much did each of the team
members gain?)

1103
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,090
- Zero.
- I think Kwang Soo picked zero.

1104
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,650
Show us what you chose
starting with Kwang Soo.

1105
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,990
- I think he chose zero.
- Zero?

1106
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,010
I picked zero.

1107
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,460
(Kwang Soo gained zero.)

1108
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,260
(His team came in 1st,
but he gained no money.)

1109
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,260
It's so hard to believe.

1110
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,670
80 dollars.

1111
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,030
(Sang Yi got 80 dollars.)

1112
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,130
(So Min got 100 dollars.)

1113
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,170
100 dollars?

1114
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,630
- 80 dollars.
- What happens now?

1115
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,130
That's the amount you have
individually.

1116
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,340
This is an individual fund.

1117
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,380
Eun Jin, what about you?

1118
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,670
I got 60 dollars.

1119
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,670
- How much?
- 60 dollars.

1120
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,780
- 60 dollars? I got...
- Suk Jin.

1121
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,940
50 dollars.

1122
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,780
- 40 dollars.
- I see.

1123
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,610
- Ji Hyo got 80 dollars.
- I must've picked zero.

1124
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,690
I got 80 dollars.

1125
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,780
I thought I got no money.

1126
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,190
Both of you got 80 dollars.

1127
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,990
- None of us picked zero.
- Exactly.

1128
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,360
All right. Here we go!

1129
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,690
Do not hesitate!

1130
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,420
Your team can get 60, 60, 40, 20,
and 0 dollars.

1131
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,800
- 90? Oh, 60 dollars.
- That's 60 dollars.

1132
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,670
- You got lucky.
- I got 40 dollars.

1133
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,630
- Did I get the most among us?
- Yes. I got 20 dollars.

1134
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,070
What about you, Yoon Kyung?

1135
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,170
- Zero.
- She got no money.

1136
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,170
- I picked the highest amount.
- She's in trouble.

1137
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,570
- Right.
- Yoon Kyung is in trouble.

1138
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,840
60 dollars!

1139
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,130
Is this an individual game?

1140
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,470
- No, but you need...
- Next,

1141
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,210
it's time for Team Penalty Men...

1142
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,380
to recruit one person
from the bottom place team.

1143
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,150
- They're in the last place, right?
- Yes.

1144
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,690
Yoon Kyung is on our team too.
What do you mean, "I see"?

1145
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,090
Yoon Kyung, you should stand
here with us.

1146
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,280
- Who should we choose?
- They can choose anyone?

1147
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Just one person?

1148
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,490
- Who?
- Yes.

1149
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,630
We don't know what will happen
when we move to that team.

1150
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,050
What will happen to
the chosen person?

1151
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,130
If you join Team Penalty Men,

1152
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,970
you'll have more chances
of getting a penalty at the end.

1153
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,690
- Oh, I get it.
- We should avoid joining that team.

1154
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,190
- It'll be someone on that team.
- Exactly.

1155
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,440
- Have you guys made up your mind?
- Yes, we've made our decision.

1156
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,760
Please announce it.

1157
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,630
(Who could be the unlucky person
to join Team Penalty Men?)

1158
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,900
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Okay.

1159
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,280
(They chose Jae Suk.)

1160
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
(Jae Suk has been chosen
by his senior Penalty Men.)

1161
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,420
Nice.

1162
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,970
- Of course.
- Why me?

1163
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,610
- Hey.
- You belong to that team.

1164
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,190
- It feels right.
- You suit the team.

1165
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,360
You're perfect for the team.

1166
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,780
Gosh, seriously.

1167
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,590
Now, we'll move
to the next location.

1168
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,400
If we bring Jong Kook to our team,
it'll be game over.

1169
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,170
(Everyone is getting on the bus
to move to the next location.)

1170
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,990
Kwang Soo, I have something
to ask you about.

1171
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,970
- When you look in the mirror...
- Do you think you look pretty?

1172
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,360
- and check your hair...
- Do you feel pretty?

1173
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,300
When you see your hair at the back,
does it make you want to go out?

1174
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,510
- You... Hang on.
- Why?

1175
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,880
- I don't mind if Jong Kook says it.
- But...

1176
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,970
- Checking your hair in the mirror,
- I told you not to act up.

1177
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,050
he'd say, "Good. Okay."

1178
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,780
Is that how you react?

1179
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,190
- That's...
- I'm just curious.

1180
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,550
- We're just curious.
- He didn't have any intention,

1181
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,990
- but you provoked him.
- That's not true.

1182
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,990
How do you feel?

1183
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,550
Who inspired you?

1184
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,280
There must be the key point
of your style.

1185
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,260
Kim Da Mi from "Itaewon Class".

1186
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,030
(The crazy Da Mi)

1187
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,760
(The story behind his hairstyle
has finally been revealed.)

1188
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,340
Oh, okay. That makes sense now.

1189
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,760
- It feels great to finally hear it.
- Indeed.

1190
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
- Have you been hiding it?
- All right.

1191
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,130
- Okay.
- You can tell us anything.

1192
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,130
(The talk has been heated up
through the story of his hairstyle.)

1193
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,670
Eun Jin did a great job
at explaining the word "stock".

1194
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,780
- I bet she's investing in stocks.
- Are you, Eun Jin?

1195
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,470
- I think so.
- It's not like that.

1196
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,820
- "It's not like that."
- "It's not like that."

1197
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,780
- I know nothing about it.
- It's not like that.

1198
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,780
I don't know stock trading any terms
like "Tae Jin Ah".

1199
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,280
- It was "Tesla", not "Tae Jin Ah".
- Oh, right.

1200
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,920
Sang Yi didn't seem to be so good
at playing games.

1201
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,280
He was lousy at explaining.

1202
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,530
It was unexpected.

1203
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,460
Sang Yi and Eun Jin,

1204
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,090
you two must've gone on
a group trip together.

1205
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,130
- Yes, we did. Sang Yi...
- He's trying to put them together.

1206
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,760
- Sang Yi arranged everything...
- He's trying to put them together.

1207
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,240
- as the student representative.
- Oh, I see.

1208
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,970
- He rented a bus and everything.
- Really?

1209
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,570
You normally play games
at these things.

1210
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,440
- Of course.
- And have the orientation.

1211
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,170
Then you split into groups...

1212
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,010
- And talk.
- Yes, that's right.

1213
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,380
You'll also have a few drinks and...

1214
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,990
That's enough!

1215
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,050
- Will you stop?
- Just stop.

1216
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,090
How is it that everything
is spun that way?

1217
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,960
- He's just lonely, that's all.
- Unbelievable.

1218
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,050
- He's had that expression all day.
- Once...

1219
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,490
you have a few drinks...

1220
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,990
People like you
ruin brewing romances.

1221
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,800
Right, you're only ruining it.

1222
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,690
Did you ask her out
for some fresh air?

1223
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,530
Yes or no? Answer me!

1224
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,590
I want to feel the romance.

1225
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,940
You want to what?

1226
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,860
- He's hilarious.
- He wants to feel the romance.

1227
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,030
It's only so that he can have fun.

1228
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,210
- No way.
- I'm sick and tired of this.

1229
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,340
What a pervert.

1230
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,920
You probably ruined...

1231
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,670
some relationships
of Jong Kook's too.

1232
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,940
Although, I'm only speculating.

1233
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,320
Jong Kook? Well, he's...

1234
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,690
His wall is put up too high.

1235
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,590
- There's no hope for him this year.
- He doesn't let anyone in.

1236
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,320
He'll just stay a bachelor forever.

1237
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
But...

1238
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,690
We recently went by
Jong Kook's place.

1239
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,800
- Yes.
- That's right.

1240
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,190
It's been a while...

1241
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,190
since I've been to a house that
felt more like a storage facility.

1242
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,570
- Seriously?
- I mean...

1243
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,210
This is what I said
after leaving his place.

1244
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,400
After leaving his place,

1245
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,530
I asked Jae Suk...

1246
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,280
if it was only my feet
that were cold.

1247
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,070
He was like, "No."

1248
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,780
I thought I was
under the weather or something.

1249
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,740
- My feet were freezing.
- How can...

1250
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,070
your feet be freezing
when in a house?

1251
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,490
He doesn't even turn on the lights.

1252
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,690
It reminds you of hyeongseoljigong.

1253
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,050
It's winter, so the sun sets
around 5 p.m., right?

1254
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,760
- Where's the need?
- Why do you need lights?

1255
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,880
You have to feel your way
to your own bathroom.

1256
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,150
It's not like I'm going to read.

1257
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,650
No way.

1258
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,300
Yoon Kyung, were you...

1259
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,900
not interested in joining
the entertainment industry?

1260
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,990
Me? No, not at first.

1261
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,070
- Not at all?
- No.

1262
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,940
I see hints of Kim Min Jung
in your face.

1263
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,840
- Thank you.
- You should know this in advance.

1264
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,240
If you get to meet Suk Jin
some other time...

1265
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,280
Let me say I'm sorry.

1266
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,380
- He might not recognize you.
- I'll apologize in advance.

1267
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,550
There's a high chance of that.

1268
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,380
I don't pay attention to faces...

1269
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,440
when I meet new people.

1270
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,010
No, that's a lie.

1271
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,110
He used to remember faces
like nobody's business.

1272
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,510
- Only rich people.
- Yes, exactly.

1273
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,380
He never forgets
the faces of rich people.

1274
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,490
- When they buy meals.
- So get wealthier.

1275
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,720
- What are you talking about?
- But it's true.

1276
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,490
I'm good at remembering my seniors,
that's all.

1277
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,170
You never forget
the 10-billion dollar guy.

1278
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,490
- What?
- 10 billion...

1279
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,170
- Oh, him.
- He's Chinese.

1280
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,590
- He's younger than me.
- Is he?

1281
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,090
But you addressed him
as someone older.

1282
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,340
(Because he has 10 billion dollars?)

1283
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,970
If they're rich,
he regards them as his elder.

1284
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,030
It's money over age.

1285
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,740
- I'm only joking.
- There's no need to say that.

1286
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,840
He regards them as older
if they're rich.

1287
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,970
It's only a joke.

1288
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:30,970
- Let's not mention that.
- I only address him that way...

1289
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:31,970
as a joke.

1290
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,340
How can you not get the joke?

1291
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,050
Don't humiliate Suk Jin like this.

1292
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,840
A few years ago,

1293
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,780
he called me for the first time...

1294
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,380
to treat me to a meal.

1295
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,590
- Really?
- I went out...

1296
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,960
and he was with a group
of wealthy Chinese men.

1297
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,150
- Really?
- And...

1298
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,690
he was serving them.

1299
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,490
(He was waiting on the rich men?)

1300
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,590
I'm not making this up.

1301
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,970
He didn't mention anything
but just offered to buy me dinner.

1302
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,240
Don't you lie!

1303
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Don't you remember it?

1304
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,940
- That's enough.
- Why would I have waited on them?

1305
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
- But it's true.
- That's enough.

1306
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,110
- Kwang Soo, that's enough.
- You were in a suit.

1307
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,570
- That's enough.
- Don't you remember that?

1308
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,380
Viewers, what he said is a lie.

1309
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,670
I didn't wait on them.

1310
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,010
- That's enough.
- I kept my pride, you know.

1311
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,320
Anyway, we're going...

1312
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,610
to play a mini-game
on our way there.

1313
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,610
- Nice.
- Sounds good.

1314
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,960
- Will we get to add another member?
- Yes.

1315
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,860
- Oh, dear.
- Again?

1316
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,550
- Yes, you can.
- After this game?

1317
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,920
Jong Kook's not good
at games on buses.

1318
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,590
We can add a member
to Team Penalty.

1319
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,030
This game...

1320
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:25,240
was created based on how Jae Suk
kept saying "What about apples?"...

1321
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,740
during a game in a recent episode.

1322
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,110
This is What About Apples.

1323
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,130
What About Apples?

1324
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,210
(Episode 539)

1325
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,610
(Suk Jin started off
the strawberry game.)

1326
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,030
(Why do you like them?)

1327
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,300
(Jae Suk suddenly asked
an unrelated question.)

1328
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,440
(He still answered.)

1329
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
(What about apples?)

1330
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,320
(The game was created
based on Jae Suk's ad-lib.)

1331
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,090
It goes like this.
<i>What about apples?</i>

1332
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:51,090
<i>- What about apples?
- What about apples?</i>

1333
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,920
- Go ahead.
- Suk Jin, four.

1334
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,970
The first and last word
should be "apple,"

1335
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,130
but the ones in between
should be "elppa."

1336
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,800
(The words in between
should be said backwards.)

1337
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,570
This is too tricky.

1338
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,570
The weakest link
is appalled by the rules.

1339
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,400
- What about when the number is 1?
- 1?

1340
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,780
<i>Apple</i>

1341
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,010
If it's two,
do you just say apple twice?

1342
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,710
<i>- Apple-apple
- Apple-apple</i>

1343
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,710
That's two.

1344
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,970
- And if it's three.
<i>- Elppa-elppa</i>

1345
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,340
<i>- Apple-elppa-apple
- Apple-elppa-apple</i>

1346
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,720
If it's four...

1347
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,590
<i>- Apple-elppa-elppa-apple
- Apple-elppa-elppa-apple</i>

1348
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,720
Apple.

1349
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,760
- Okay.
<i>- Apple-elppa-apple</i>

1350
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,550
- Let's do this.
<i>- What about apples?</i>

1351
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,630
<i>- What about apples?
- What about apples?</i>

1352
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,820
- It's too fast.
- Kwang Soo, three.

1353
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,220
<i>Apple-elppa-apple</i>

1354
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,590
Jong Kook, four.

1355
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,070
<i>Apple-elppa-elppa-elppa</i>

1356
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,720
- Okay.
- Nice!

1357
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,630
(The last word
should've been apple.)

1358
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:33,800
Nicely done!

1359
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,530
I knew you'd attack me first.

1360
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,840
- Okay, let's go.
- Don't attack teammates.

1361
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,880
- Let's go.
- Don't attack teammates.

1362
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,070
- Jong Kook's up first.
- Go ahead.

1363
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,170
- Okay.
- And go.

1364
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,420
<i>- What about apples?
- What about apples?</i>

1365
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,970
- Kwang Soo, three.
<i>- Apple-elppa-apple</i>

1366
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,510
Jong Kook, one.

1367
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,010
<i>Apple</i>

1368
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,220

Hold on a second.

1373

(The timing was off,
but not too much.)

1374
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,030
- Wait.
- I did it correctly.

1375
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,320
Are you sure?

1376
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,860

1377
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,130
I was on beat.

he chokes while playing the game.)

- Absolutely.

00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,260

- No.

1392

will guarantee a win.)

1401

What's the matter with you?

1402
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,440
- Wait.
- "Apple, apple."

1403
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,220
Are we allowed to kick someone
off our team?

1404
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,150
This game doesn't fit me well.

1405
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,440
Jae Suk, just get off, will you?

1406
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,960

- He keeps getting it wrong.

1407

Just get off the bus.

- We chose the wrong teammate.

- Unbelievable.
- Jae Suk...

1410
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,990
- Can't we switch fruits?
- You can.

1411
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,050
How about grapefruit?

1412
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,220
- Plum.

when he's flustered.)

1419
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,940
Hold on a second.
Let's play without him.

I'd rather take a break.

- This game doesn't suit me.

Got it?

1426
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,010
The round always ends with him.

00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,530
- This is what she read.
- Ji Hyo, what was that?

1448
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,150
(What she read
dominated her subconscious.)

1449
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,690

- Ji Hyo.

1450
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,150
Is it Kim Safety or Choi Safety?
Who is it?

You know that word means
nipple in Korean, right?

1468
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,190
Why do you have three nipples?

1469
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,800
Well, I...

1470
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,420
Must you repeat that word
so many times?

1471
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,260

- We only have two nipples.

1472

I can't believe you did this.

1476
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,740

1484
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,650

- Yes, us.

1486
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,590
- Not you, Suk Jin.
- Aren't you on our team?

1487
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,360
Can you please remember your team?

1488
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,650
You're not on this team.

1489
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:19,590
She's teamed up with Se Chan and...

1490
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,990
Yoon Kyung, Haha, and Se Chan
are in first place.

1491
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,190
We won the game.

1492
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:23,760
- And in second place...
- It's us.

1493

Eun Jin, Suk Jin, and Ji Hyo.

1494
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:28,110
- I'm glad.
- At least we came in second.

1495
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,510
You had 4, 5, 6 points respectively.

1496
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,070
Is Team Penalty
in last place again?

1497
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:33,070
- That was close.
- We didn't lose as a team.

1498
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,400
Jae Suk lost it for us.

1499
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,380
You keep making me play games
that I'm bad at.

1500
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,510
It was wrong of you
to add Jae Suk to your team.

1501
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,440
This game just isn't the one for me.

1502

(They arrive where
the last mission will take place.)

1503
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,380
Right.

1504
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,510
I mean it today.

1505
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,130
I mean it.

1506
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,260
(He announces that
he'll be playing dirty.)

1507
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,880
Kwang Soo's terrifying me today.

1508
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,460
He'll be like a mad man
in this round.

1509
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,190
His eyes seem determined.

1510
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,260
We're in trouble today.

1511
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,240
Our fates were sealed...

1512
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,240
the moment he joined...

1513
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,510
- Team Penalty.
- I'll be shooting.

1514
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,840
- I'll shoot.
- He's only joking.

1515
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,840
(He threatens others
with a bullet that has expired.)

1516
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,440
- Guys.
- Yes?

1517
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,320
Starting with the winning team,
you'll choose the money you earned.

1518
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,940
All right, let's do this.

1519
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,110
- It's us three, right?
- Right.

1520
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:16,740
- Go ahead.
- Back in the day,

1521
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,380
I used to play games
like this a lot.

1522
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,190
Kwang Soo earned no money last time.

1523
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,920
- 100 dollars!
- No way, I got 80 dollars.

1524
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,490
- Nice.
- Unbelievable.

1525
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:25,650
I have 60 dollars!

1526
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:27,920
The money...

1527
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,300
that you blindly selected
in both rounds...

1528
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,030
- is your total amount.
- Got it.

1529
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,630
Team Penalty
will choose another teammate.

1530
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,070
We thought about this...

1531
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,800
- and the team...
- That's right.

1532
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,470
We can't have anyone
strong on this team.

1533
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,670
- We'll be at a disadvantage.
- It won't be ideal for us.

1534
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,470
So we should choose
from the weaker links.

1535
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:49,380
(They need to choose
from the weaker links.)

1536
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,510
How about Suk Jin?

1537
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,090
- Suk Jin...
- Yes, Suk Jin.

1538
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:55,360
(He's the number 1 choice
out of all the members?)

1539
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:56,690
Wait a second.

1540
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,920
You'll choose Suk Jin
over Ji Hyo and Eun Jin?

1541
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,490
- He's the weakest link.
- That must be our choice.

1542
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,320
- The weakest link.
- You see...

1543
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,800
We must choose the weakest link.

1544
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:06,360
The issue with Suk Jin is this.

1545
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,760
He tries to trick
his own team members.

1546
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,970
- So Eun Jin might be better.
- Right. Eun Jin would be better.

1547
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:14,030
I think she would cause us
less trouble, don't you think?

1548
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,240
- Absolutely.
- She must be honest and upright.

1549
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,380
- We'd be at a disadvantage.
- Of course.

1550
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,070
- I really hope they won't pick me.
- We should choose one of them.

1551
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,740
Okay. 1, 2, 3.

1552
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,590
(Out of Eun Jin and Suk Jin,
which one did Team Penalty choose?)

1553
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,090
- Ahn Eun Jin.
- Eun Jin.

1554
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:28,720
(Ahn Eun Jin has been chosen
as a new member!)

1555
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,780
Go.

1556
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,190
- Just like this?
- Eun Jin will be...

1557
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,090
- a Penalty Man in this round.
- Okay.

1558
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,190
- Okay.
- Eun Jin.

1559
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,900
(Welcome to Penalty Men world.)

1560
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,190
We can talk about the stock market
with her during the race.

1561
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,110
(They picked Eun Jin thinking
she was an easy target.)

1562
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,900
(But later on, in the race...)

1563
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,670
(She'll tear off the most name tags
with her tenacity and strategies.)

1564
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:52,940
(What change will Eun Jin make
as the blue-chip name tag taker?)

1565
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,190
Through the final race, you can
change the team to get a penalty,

1566
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:00,280
and gained extra mission funds.
It's Switch Penalty Men.

1567
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,320
That's the worst.

1568
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,050
You'll be divided into
Team Penalty and Team Non-penalty.

1569
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,990
It'll be 5 members versus 6 members
at the beginning.

1570
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,760
Each team will wear either red caps
or blue caps.

1571
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,190
You can switch caps
and join the other team...

1572
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,760
by taking off the name tag
of a member of that team.

1573
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,470
You're allowed to take off
anyone's name tag.

1574
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,610
(Team Penalty wears red caps,
and the other wears blue caps.)

1575
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:19,030
(They can switch teams
by taking off a name tag.)

1576
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,800
30 minutes after you begin the race,

1577
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,670
the team with more Penalty Men
will lose.

1578
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,550
The Penalty Men on the losing team
will get a penalty.

1579
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,820
And the winning team will receive
extra mission funds.

1580
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,990
The Penalty Men on the losing team
will get a penalty.

1581
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,780
And the winning team will receive
extra mission funds.

1582
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,920
If they join our team,

1583
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,050
- we all have to move to that team.
- Exactly.

1584
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,400
That's how you can calculate.

1585
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,130
So people wearing the same color
caps don't have to fight.

1586
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,900
Correct. Take off the name tags
of people in the other color.

1587
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,530
You have to join the team
with fewer Penalty Men.

1588
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:52,530
Also, we'll announce which team has
more Penalty Men...

1589
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,510
every five minutes.

1590
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,840
The result will be determined
in the last minute.

1591
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,070
In the last minute.

1592
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:03,010
Everyone, please leave me alone
just for today.

1593
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,340
- We have to move to that team.
- I'm begging you.

1594
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,920
Please leave me alone.

1595
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,960
I want her cap.
I call dibs on her cap.

1596
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,690
- Please leave me alone.
- She's the easiest target.

1597
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,820
I can't predict the result
because of So Min.

1598
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,490
Exactly. So Min will be
the largest variable.

1599
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:14,650
Prepare 20 caps for So Min.

1600
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,530
I don't know which team
So Min will end up on.

1601
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,030
I started off on the wrong foot.

1602
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,470
Also, we hid 10-dollar mission funds
in different places.

1603
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,300
(It's also important
to find the hidden mission funds.)

1604
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,340
- You can gain extra funds that way.
- Okay.

1605
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,470
- Everyone, you may leave now.
- Let's go.

1606
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,070
- This won't be easy.
- We must move to that team.

1607
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:34,320
We have to try at least.

1608
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,490
It will be an intense war of nerves.

1609
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,220
(All members of Team Penalty
put on red caps!)

1610
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,220
No one can predict...

1611
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:41,820
what could turn the game around
at the end.

1612
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,320
It's hard to predict.

1613
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:46,590
I'll be tough today.
I'll run really fast too.

1614
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:49,300
So please stay alert.

1615
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,130
(He seems determined to act up
like crazy today.)

1616
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,470
Kwang Soo said he'll be tough today.

1617
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:56,760
So I'm going to be tough as well.

1618
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:59,740
Let's save as much money
as possible for now.

1619
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,510
I need money...

1620
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,900
(Haha plans to save money
to get rid of penalty tickets.)

1621
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,740
in order to get rid of
as many penalty tickets as I can.

1622
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,320
I will never be hit by
water balloons in this cold weather.

1623
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,340
(She looks unnecessarily serious.)

1624
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,490
(She's full of enthusiasm.)

1625
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,990
The race will begin shortly.

1626
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,320
Five.

1627
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,550
Four.

1628
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,320
Three.

1629
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,970
Two.

1630
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,340
One.

1631
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,740
Race, start.

1632
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,360
(Currently, all Penalty Men are
on Team Red.)

1633
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,280
(They'd be at an advantage
if they move to Team Blue.)

1634
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,970
I have no time for this.
I should take off a name tag first.

1635
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,340
I should take off a name tag.

1636
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,880
(Kwang Soo is going to move to
Team Blue that has no Penalty Men.)

1637
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,320
(Jae Suk has the same plan.)

1638
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,630
- Oh, my. Jae Suk.
- Hey, Sebastien.

1639
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,530
Are you going to join Team Blue?

1640
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,690
Well... I think...

1641
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,970
I should move to your team
no matter what, right?

1642
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:58,840
Yes. You need a good strategy.

1643
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,860
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1644
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,300
Wait. Just like this?
You're attacking me right away?

1645
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,510
- You know I have no choice.
- Wait.

1646
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,110
(He's taking off Se Chan's name tag
just like this?)

1647
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:07,780
- I have no choice.
- Wait a second.

1648
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,380
- You know... I should...
- My gosh.

1649
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,570
- There must be some confrontation.
- That's unnecessary.

1650
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,050
There's no need.

1651
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:17,880
It hasn't even been 10 seconds
since the race began.

1652
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,990
- Hey.
- Jae Suk...

1653
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,630
- Already? We should run away.
- Let's hurry up.

1654
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:23,880
We should run away from them.

1655
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,960
- We should run away from them.
- They will probably...

1656
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,090
(They're running away
from the Team Red members.)

1657
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:31,840
Kwang Soo!
Kwang Soo, come over here.

1658
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,090
(Sang Yi found the weakest members
of Team Blue.)

1659
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,090
Let's go.

1660
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,400
- Why?
- Come over here.

1661
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,670
(And Kwang Soo joined Sang Yi.)

1662
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,570
(Penalty Men Kwang Soo and Sang Yi
want to move to Team Blue!)

1663
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,170
Hey, stop it. What are you doing?

1664
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,720
Take it off now. Hurry.

1665
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,050
- Hey!
- Hurry up.

1666
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,720
- Why are you wearing a blue cap?
- I took it off!

1667
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,420
(Team Red had 4 Penalty Men,
Team Blue had 1 Penalty Man.)

1668
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,690
All right.

1669
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:54,780
(Kwang Soo took Ji Hyo's name tag
off and joined Team Blue!)

1670
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,920
(Team Red has 3 Penalty Men,
and Team Blue has 2 now.)

1671
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,300
Take it off! Take it off, Sang Yi!

1672
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,260
Jae Suk, why are you wearing
a blue cap?

1673
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,720
Why... Why is it blue?

1674
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,070
- Listen.
- When did you join that team?

1675
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,360
Right now...

1676
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:05,990
You should take off the name tag
of anyone you see.

1677
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,940
There he is.

1678
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,260
(In front of Penalty Man Eun Jin,)

1679
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,070
(the weakest member
of Team Blue showed up.)

1680
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,470
- Oh, my. Hello.
- Hi.

1681
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,110
I'm just so glad to see you here.

1682
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:15,610
- Hi. Bye.
- Wait.

1683
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:16,940
- Wait.
- Bye!

1684
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,340
Stop!

1685
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,340
Get him.

1686
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,090
(Suk Jin has no choice but to run
to avoid joining Team Red.)

1687
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,690
(But he got caught quickly due to
his poor cardiovascular endurance.)

1688
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,820
Oh, my gosh.

1689
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,460
Wait.

1690
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,380
(Eun Jin got a chance
to join Team Blue.)

1691
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,860
- Just for a moment. I'm so tired.
- You caught me,

1692
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,190
so let's take a break.

1693
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:35,470
- I'm really sorry.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1694
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:36,530
No way.

1695
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,360
(After a quick apology,
she reached his name tag.)

1696
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,190
No need to apologize
because you can't take it off.

1697
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,260
You think?

1698
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,610
Really? Are you sure?

1699
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:44,630
(He's bluffing
when he can't do anything.)

1700
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,210
Outer reaping throw!

1701
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,300
Outer reaping throw!

1702
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,650
Gosh. I'm running out of energy.

1703
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:53,220
(After repeated attempts to perform
an outer reaping throw,)

1704
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,740
(Eun Jin succeeded in
her 1st name tag hunt.)

1705
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,050
(She successfully took off
the name tag of the easiest target.)

1706
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,780
Well... I saw it coming.

1707
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,530
(They're exchanging their caps
while catching their breath.)

1708
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:03,590
Here you go.

1709
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,490
(Team Red has 2 Penalty Men,
and Team Blue has 3.)

1710
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:08,130
(As Eun Jin joins Team Blue,
Team Blue is now losing!)

1711
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,320
I'm sorry, Suk Jin.

1712
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,900
- You have nothing to apologize for.
- I'm sorry.

1713
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:11,990
Don't be.

1714
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,260
(Team Red is winning
with 2 Penalty Men.)

1715
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,630
Jae Suk, we have to
keep our caps blue.

1716
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,610
- But...
- We don't know the exact numbers.

1717
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,010
- We don't know yet.
- Right.

1718
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,840
- It's pointless to take it off.
- It's pointless.

1719
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,110
It's pointless right now.

1720
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:23,780
Okay. Let's...

1721
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,610
- You see, right now...
- Jae Suk, why...

1722
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,220
Why are you wearing a blue cap?

1723
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,280
As soon as he saw me,
he ripped my name tag off.

1724
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,510
- He was so determined to do it.
- Hey.

1725
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:34,610
As soon as he saw my blue cap,
he attacked me.

1726
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:37,130
I'm relieved that you two are
on the same team. Let's go, Ji Hyo.

1727
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:38,490
- We're on the same team now.
- Se Chan.

1728
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:40,530
- Take Jae Suk's name tag off.
- Sorry?

1729
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:41,690
Then hold him down.

1730
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,070
Take it off! Take it off now!

1731
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,190
(Ripping off)

1732
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,740
- There's no point.
- I didn't know she'd take mine off.

1733
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,740
- Gosh, you.
- There's no point.

1734
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,610
You should've ripped off
only one of our name tags.

1735
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:54,570
- Gosh, seriously.
- You should have...

1736
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,380
Give it to me.

1737
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,150
- Don't put it on like that.
- Put their name tags back on them.

1738
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,220
(Penalty Men Kwang Soo and Jae Suk
are back on Team Red.)

1739
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,280
- Se Chan, let's hurry up and go.
- Okay.

1740
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,440
Why would you do that?

1741
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,720
Run!

1742
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,150
- Hey, we're back on Team Blue.
- Run!

1743
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,630
(After moving the Penalty Men to
Team Red, they're running away.)

1744
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,960
Let's go and find some money.

1745
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:17,860
Oh, those mean people.

1746
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:21,490
(Team Red has 4 Penalty Men,
and Team Blue has 1.)

1747
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,940
(While running around, she met...)

1748
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,360
I wish I could have a sip of water.

1749
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,940
(The red cap duo)

1750
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,110
(They need to move to Team Blue!)

1751
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,280
- Eun Jin.
- Oh, my gosh.

1752
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,720
- Wait.
- Eun Jin.

1753
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,010
(She lied down to protect
her name tag.)

1754
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,650
My gosh. This can't be happening.

1755
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,420
Hey, wait. All right.

1756
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,940
- Eun Jin.
- All right. Let me...

1757
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,960
- I'll do it by myself. I don't...
- Come on.

1758
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,190
Eun Jin, I'm sorry.

1759
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,780
(Ripping off)

1760
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:44,550
I'm sorry.

1761
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,030
(Jae Suk moved to Team Blue alone
in the end.)

1762
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,670
I can't stand this anymore.
This is ridiculous.

1763
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,570
He's so sly.

1764
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,360
- Eun Jin, here you go.
- Okay.

1765
00:56:56,010 --> 00:57:00,010
(Sang Yi was quietly watching them.)

1766
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,170
- Jae Suk is on Team Blue now.
- Eun Jin, here you go.

1767
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,610
(He's planning to move to Team Blue
by ripping Jae Suk's name tag off.)

1768
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:04,610
Kwang Soo.

1769
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:06,150
Which team has more Penalty Men?

1770
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:07,170
(Passing him by quietly)

1771
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,150
(I should run away now!)

1772
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:12,820
(Peek-a-boo)

1773
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,030
(Sang Yi succeeds in leaving
Team Red!)

1774
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:18,720
- Gosh, seriously.
- Let's stop this.

1775
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,130
- Gosh. I mean...
- That was so funny.

1776
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,340
(The merciless Eun Jin takes off
even a passer-by's name tag.)

1777
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,590
What was that?

1778
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,070
Let me pass by, will you?

1779
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,840
- Hey!
- Let me pass by, okay?

1780
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,300
- Don't stretch your cap.
- I'm sorry.

1781
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,670
I'm really sorry.

1782
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,110
- This is driving me nuts.
- Team Red has more Penalty Men?

1783
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:37,170
- I'm on your team.
- He's on Team Red too.

1784
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,740
- Oh, he's on Team Red too.
- Hey.

1785
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,150
It makes me upset for no reason.

1786
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,420
Check the color
before ripping the name tag off.

1787
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,990
- Check the color first.
- How many Penalty Men are here?

1788
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,220
I'll leave. Please give me a moment.

1789
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,550
- Check the color first.
- How many Penalty Men are here?

1790
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:48,630
Only two of you are Penalty Men.

1791
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:49,690
Really?

1792
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,220
- We might be at an advantage.
- That's possible.

1793
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,860
- Let's keep it this way.
- We might have fewer Penalty Men.

1794
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,190
- If we hide ourselves...
- So Min is the problem.

1795
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:55,360
so no one can find us...

1796
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,800
Let's hurry up and go.
All the four of us together.

1797
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,420
- We should stick together.
- Let's not split up.

1798
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,470
- We just have to keep this number.
- That's right.

1799
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,010
I can't believe I'm on the team
with you guys out of all people.

1800
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,570
- We're all so weak.
- What a band of misfits.

1801
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:06,010
- We're all so weak.
- Gosh.

1802
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:08,440
And 2 of us are the bottom 2
in terms of appearance.

1803
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,280
(The weakest and ugliest)

1804
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,380
True.

1805
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,650
I can't believe this.

1806
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,670
- We must keep our caps.
- Yes, we must.

1807
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,990
- Let the others fight in there.
- We have only 30 minutes.

1808
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,880
- Why don't we...
- Okay.

1809
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,050
- What is it?
- Hey, wait.

1810
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,490
(As soon as Se Chan found
the mission fund envelope...)

1811
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,360
- No. Wait, wait. No. Stop.
- You brat.

1812
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:28,050
- Stop it.
- Hey.

1813
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,570
Let's divide the money equally.

1814
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:32,690
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's do that.

1815
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:34,490
- Wait.
- Let's put it down for now.

1816
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,740
- I found this.
- How can we work together?

1817
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,970
- Let's put it down for now.
- Okay.

1818
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,710
- Let's put it down.
- All right.

1819
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,340
- But I'm the one who found it.
- Okay.

1820
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,340
- Put it down. Come on.
- Put it down.

1821
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,970
- Gosh. I can't believe you guys.
- Don't be like this.

1822
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:48,380
- Seriously, they're so mean.
- Put your hand down.

1823
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,090
- Put it down.
- Okay. Let's all put it down.

1824
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,860
- Put it down.
- Put it down.

1825
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,920
- Okay.
- Let it go on the count of three.

1826
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,530
- This is what we'll do.
- It's torn into pieces.

1827
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,360
- Let's put it down.
- Let's just divide it by four.

1828
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,990
We'll play rock-paper-scissors
and let the winner have it all.

1829
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,820
That'll sort this out.
Let's divide it by four.

1830
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,090
(Under Suk Jin's leadership,
they're dividing the R money.)

1831
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,400
- It's not valid without this piece.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1832
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,740
- This is the most important piece.
- True.

1833
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,940
Let's play rock-paper-scissors,
and let the winner take it all.

1834
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,240
- Do we have to go this far?
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1835
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,880
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1836
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,550
- I won.
- Hold on.

1837
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,150
- I won.
- Gosh.

1838
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,380
- Hold on.
- Darn it.

1839
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,920
(If I can't have it,
I'd rather swallow it.)

1840
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:23,440
Let's get rid of it.

1841
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,190
This never happened.

1842
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,820
- It says 10 dollars here.
- It's written on that piece?

1843
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:27,920
- It's written on mine too.
- Hang on.

1844
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,960
Can you see?

1845
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,550
Mine says 10 dollars.

1846
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:31,860
- But it's torn in half.
- He swallowed it.

1847
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,090
- And I even won.
- Make it a whole piece.

1848
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,090
- It says 10 dollars.
- You have to have our pieces too.

1849
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,400
That's impossible.

1850
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,820
Let me tell you the current status.

1851
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,360
There are more Penalty Men...

1852
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,340
(On Team Red...)

1853
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,610
on Team Red.

1854
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:44,130
- Darn it.
- We should rip off a name tag.

1855
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:45,880
(There are three Penalty Men
on Team Red.)

1856
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,380
(Team Red is losing.)

1857
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,940
(There are two Penalty Men
on Team Blue.)

1858
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,070
(They run as fast as they can
to find the members of Team Blue.)

1859
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,650
There are more Penalty Men
on Team Red.

1860
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,440
(The rest of the members
heard the current status as well.)

1861
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,860
You mean there are more Penalty Men
on Team Red?

1862
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,260
(Let's switch to Team Blue.)

1863
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,970
Who is that?

1864
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,630
(The Penalty Men on Team Blue
are being chased.)

1865
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,900
Rock-paper... Let's play it fair.

1866
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,030
This way.

1867
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,610
- Hang on!
- Suk Jin.

1868
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:19,610
I'll lie on the floor.

1869
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,280
- Be careful!
- I'm being serious.

1870
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:23,110
Come on, Suk Jin!

1871
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:24,150
(Big Nose mercilessly ripped off
Eun Jin's name tag.)

1872
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:27,280
- I'm sorry.
- Switch your caps.

1873
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,920
You have to keep moving.

1874
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,380
(Big Brother Big Nose leaves
as soon as getting the blue cap.)

1875
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,050
Hey, wait! You can't rip it off
right away!

1876
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,190
It wasn't mine that got ripped off.

1877
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,550
(Big Nose is back on Team Red
in less than 10 seconds.)

1878
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,920
There are more Penalty Men
on Team Red now?

1879
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,090
You have 10 seconds to run.

1880
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,820
How many Penalty Men
are on Team Red now?

1881
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,130
There are more Penalty Men
on Team Red.

1882
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:47,360
If we just wait, there will be
lesser Penalty Men on Team Red.

1883
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,360
(If we wait, there will be
lesser Penalty Men on Team Red.)

1884
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,360
(Cool down.)

1885
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,170
- Did you find any money?
- Is your heart okay?

1886
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:54,130
I'm okay. I ran too hard.

1887
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,280
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

1888
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,550
I think you should sit for a while.

1889
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:00,820
I think they'll come for me
if I just stay in one place.

1890
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,220
That's right. They'll just come.

1891
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,240
(A sudden dance time
when they're losing)

1892
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,280
I like this move.

1893
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,460
(The tour bus dance move
Jae Suk fell for)

1894
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,760
Your dance skills...
I like this move.

1895
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,860
Where did you learn that?

1896
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,260
I mean...

1897
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,690
Where did you learn this move?

1898
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,490
It's a move from
"Saturday Night Fever".

1899
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:16,590
Oh, really?

1900
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,090
(Being cute)

1901
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,260
I think So Min found
her signature move.

1902
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,630
This is not the time
to be playing around.

1903
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:25,710
- Hey.
- If we just stay in one spot,

1904
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:26,740
Over here!

1905
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,800
- they'll come to us.
- I got Team Blue here!

1906
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,280
(Eun Jin yields Haha
to So Min after catching him.)

1907
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,720
I'll send you away... No, you can't!

1908
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,970
I'm coming!

1909
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:36,050
- The Penalty Man.
- Okay!

1910
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,760
You're ripping it off now?

1911
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,300
(Penalty Man So Min
is on Team Blue now.)

1912
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,700
- So Min is on the other team now.
- The Penalty Man is gone.

1913
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,870
- So Min is on the other team.
- All right.

1914
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,410
We're winning.

1915
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,300
Jae Suk, we're winning.

1916
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,320
Keep it down.

1917
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:05,320
- That fool.
- Keep it down.

1918
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,120
What should I do now?

1919
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,160
I should look for the money.

1920
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,180
(So Min got fooled by Eun Jin.)

1921
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,090
I have no idea what's going on.

1922
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:13,220
Which team has more Penalty Men?

1923
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,930
- All right. It's time.
- Eun Jin...

1924
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:17,030
- Okay, tell us the status.
- Currently,

1925
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,430
- Team Blue is losing.
- We got this.

1926
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:21,430
(Currently, Team Blue is losing.)

1927
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:23,530
- Then...
- We're all set, Jae Suk.

1928
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:25,300
We're all set. They're losing.

1929
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,910
You mean Team Blue
has more Penalty Men?

1930
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,110
- Yes, they do.
- We got this.

1931
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,340
We got this. Let's pause then.

1932
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:31,910
Team Blue is losing.

1933
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:33,510
Jae Suk, what's important is...

1934
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,820
- The three of us...
- Sang Yi!

1935
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,140
can follow So Min around.

1936
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,820
- What?
- Just follow...

1937
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,740
If we just follow So Min around,
we'll never lose.

1938
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:42,450
- Sang Yi, come here.
- He's right.

1939
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:44,280
We can be So Min's shadow.

1940
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,410
- We should guard So Min.
- Then we'll never lose.

1941
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:46,620
We should guard So Min.

1942
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,200
(Right then, Sang Yi joined Team Red
after ripping Eun Jin's name tag.)

1943
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,430
We should guard So Min.

1944
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,930
- Kwang Soo is on Team Blue.
- Look at her.

1945
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,300
She'll end up getting
the penalty, but she likes it.

1946
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,300
Because she's getting
all the attention.

1947
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,370
- Since we're guarding her.
- We're like your fan club.

1948
01:02:57,370 --> 01:03:00,300
- Jeon So Min!
- Jeon So Min!

1949
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,430
- Jeon...
- Listen.

1950
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,010
I won't get my name tag ripped,

1951
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:04,300
so give me 10 dollars each.

1952
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,510
- 10 dollars each?
- I won't get it ripped.

1953
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:06,800
I'll make sure to guard it
and stick with you.

1954
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,280
So Min, you don't have a choice.

1955
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,780
In other words, you're our hostage.

1956
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:11,780
(In other words,
you're our hostage.)

1957
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,720
- So Min.
- What is she talking about?

1958
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,180
- Someone is coming.
- But you can't...

1959
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,550
Team Blue is losing.

1960
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,280
(So Min is seeking a chance
to leave Team Blue.)

1961
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,120
- How did you...
- If we stick to these members...

1962
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,700
- Hey.
- Is she serious?

1963
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,990
(Se Chan is giving So Min
a sideways glance.)

1964
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:30,390
(There are two Penalty Men
on Team Red now.)

1965
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,300
(If one more goes to Team Red...)

1966
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,780
Help me. Help me now!

1967
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,180
- Help me!
- He ripped off So Min's name tag.

1968
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:40,110
But I almost got it!
I almost got it.

1969
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:41,450
I grabbed the tip of his name tag.

1970
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,550
Get ready to run, Kwang Soo.

1971
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:44,780
Switch your cap with Sang Yi's.

1972
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,510
- What's the status now?
- We're back to square one.

1973
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:47,550
Back to square one.

1974
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,320
Come on!

1975
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,450
Wait a minute. I'm on the same team
as them again?

1976
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:52,620
What color is my cap? Is it red?

1977
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,180
There are three Penalty Men
on Team Red already.

1978
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,120
- We have to run.
- They have more Penalty Men!

1979
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,200
(Sang Yi and Se Chan
ditch the fan club and run.)

1980
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,320
They have more Penalty Men now!

1981
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,260
It hasn't been 10 seconds yet!

1982
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,660
- It hasn't been 10 seconds yet!
- Yours wasn't ripped!

1983
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:07,300
Hey, this is so tiring.

1984
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,070
Who came up with this race?

1985
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:10,430
- This is driving me crazy.
- Who did?

1986
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,700
Hey! What happened?

1987
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:15,450
- This is so exhausting!
- It's the three of us again?

1988
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:16,510
(It's the three of us again?)

1989
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,070
This is the worst race.

1990
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,720
- This is the worst.
- You know,

1991
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,050
I'll never be able to win
no matter what I do.

1992
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,680
- We can just...
- But we can't be doing nothing.

1993
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,550
make our moves a few minutes
before the race is over.

1994
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:28,550
(They decide to use their energy
3 minutes before the race is over.)

1995
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:31,220
(Right then, Eun Jin
from Team Blue appears.)

1996
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,430
How do we find them?

1997
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:34,530
(As soon as they heard
Eun Jin's voice...)

1998
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:37,140
- I know.
- We can't find them anywhere.

1999
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:38,590
(He goes at her right away.)

2000
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:40,300
- He's not even human.
- What's...

2001
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,410
(He goes at her
without even hesitating.)

2002
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:43,510
- What's the current status?
- You're not even human.

2003
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:44,910
What's the status?
Which team is losing?

2004
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,370
- Why would you go after her?
- How can I...

2005
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:47,780
- Where is the money?
- Which team has more Penalty Men?

2006
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,110
- I have no idea.
- Did you find any, Eun Jin?

2007
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,870
I found really little.

2008
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:54,280
(Suk Jin loses his patience
and attacks Eun Jin.)

2009
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:00,030
You can't rip off mine!
I'm on your team.

2010
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,280
So now...

2011
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,320
- What just happened?
- Let's recall what happened.

2012
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,820
- The blue cap goes to him.
- Yes, it should.

2013
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:05,990
Eun Jin's cap goes to Suk Jin.

2014
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:07,030
- It's mine.
- And then...

2015
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:08,620
- Watch.
- Then it goes to Kwang Soo.

2016
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,340
- Why?
- Because he ripped off your name.

2017
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:11,870
And then it comes to me.

2018
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,340
(The blue cap goes to Jae Suk?)

2019
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:14,410
You got it, right?

2020
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,410
Then...

2021
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:18,610
Then I'm going to run,
but you're a fool.

2022
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,610
Why?

2023
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:21,510
- Why?
- Why?

2024
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:23,180
(But Team Blue is winning.)

2025
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,840
- You sent him away.
- That's right.

2026
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:27,510
- That's right. Come here.
- We should go.

2027
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:29,120
- What's happening?
- What's happening?

2028
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,280
- Which team is winning?
- We should go.

2029
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,050
(Even Yoon Kyung and Jong Kook
who were passing by got confused.)

2030
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,160
What's going on?

2031
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,800
(Ripping)

2032
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,550
- You ripped off his name tag?
- What was that?

2033
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,220
(Yoon Kyung ripped off
Kwang Soo's name tag.)

2034
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,220
Wait.

2035
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,840
That's a good thing.
Team Red was winning.

2036
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,340
Why? They said Team Blue
has more Penalty Men.

2037
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,760
- No, that's not true.
- I know!

2038
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,800
But you're not Penalty Man.

2039
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,200
Can you put this back on?

2040
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,800
We're totally safe. Follow me.

2041
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,870
- Follow me. Hurry.
- We...

2042
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:52,870
We're safe. We sent the Penalty Man
to Team Blue again.

2043
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:53,910
- We are...
- What a relief.

2044
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,180
Why did Yoon Kyung rip off
Kwang Soo's name tag?

2045
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,950
Yoon Kyung ripped off my name tag.

2046
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,320
Then we'll have more Penalty Men.

2047
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:00,510
I know. If you just stay still...

2048
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:01,890
Where did you find the money?

2049
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:03,410
- Where was it?
- Jae Suk.

2050
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:05,410
- Hey, give me 10 dollars.
- What? Don't be ridiculous.

2051
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:08,030
- Hey, give me 10 dollars.
- I gave out a lot.

2052
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,720
You should look for the money.

2053
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,590
There are more Penalty Men
on our team now.

2054
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,930
Why did you have to go after her?

2055
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,070
No, I got mine ripped off.

2056
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,430
(I got mine ripped off.)

2057
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,970
Will you please use your brain?

2058
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,300
(Will you please use your brain?)

2059
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,970
Think before you rip off
someone's name tag.

2060
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:24,240
Running around like a headless
chicken won't get you a win.

2061
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,800
- Jae Suk, you're...
- That's not how...

2062
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,110
- the variety shows these days work.
- Jae Suk.

2063
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,780
Think before you move.
Think about it.

2064
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,910
- Okay? If you play like that,
- Jae Suk.

2065
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:33,910
you'll always get the penalty.

2066
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:34,990
I think...

2067
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,160
you and I will be going home
completely wet.

2068
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,780
- We're totally safe.
- We totally are.

2069
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,180
They'll come rip our name tags off,

2070
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,200
- so we should run away.
- Can't we rip off theirs?

2071
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,430
But this is a dead-end.

2072
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:46,620
Let's go back to the hallway.

2073
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:49,340
- Assume that they're not there.
- But we are... We need...

2074
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,530
two Penalty Men anyway.

2075
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,490
- We'll be in trouble if we have...
- He's coming!

2076
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:53,510
(He's coming!)

2077
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:56,140
We should run to the other side!

2078
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,640
(Kwang Soo is chasing them.)

2079
01:06:58,110 --> 01:06:59,610
Run away!

2080
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,070
(When Kwang Soo chases after them,)

2081
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:03,370
Hurry! Go!

2082
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:06,050
(Suk Jin goes into the room
and Yoon Kyung stays in the hall.)

2083
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,390
- Welcome.
- What?

2084
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:09,990
(Welcome.)

2085
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:12,390
Welcome.

2086
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:13,490
What?

2087
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,780
- Welcome.
- What... What is going on?

2088
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,820
Come here.

2089
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:18,800
Yoon Kyung.

2090
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,970
(She tries to fight Jae Suk off.)

2091
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:21,090
I need to rip off the name tag.

2092
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,760
- Why?
- Come on.

2093
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,160
- I will reach behind your neck.
- Walk away.

2094
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,840
Over there,

2095
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:28,910
- Suk Jin is in the room.
- Where?

2096
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:29,930
(She gives him
her team member's location.)

2097
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:31,280
- That room.
- You need to take me there.

2098
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,610
- Over there.
- You need to take me there.

2099
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,950
- Where?
- Over there.

2100
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:35,970
That room.

2101
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:37,450
Once I see him,

2102
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:38,910
- I will rip off his name tag.
- Really?

2103
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:40,740
- Let's go.
- Then...

2104
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,990
- I will take you to the room.
- Okay. Then I will let you go.

2105
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:44,780
- Open the door, okay?
- Okay.

2106
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:46,360
- Where is he?
- In there.

2107
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:48,220
- Is he in "The Penthouse" room?
- Yes.

2108
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:51,090
I am serious. He is hiding in there.

2109
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:52,530
- I don't see him.
- He is hiding in there.

2110
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:54,030
Open the door.

2111
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:55,200
Bring Suk Jin out.

2112
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,340
- Really?
- Yes.

2113
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,870
(She enters the room
as if nothing has happened.)

2114
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:01,240
(Suk Jin is here.)

2115
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:02,800
What? Did you sell me out?

2116
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,610
Did you sell me out?

2117
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,740
- No.
- You were talking to someone.

2118
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,800
- No, I wasn't.
- No?

2119
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,840
- I...
- Jae Suk.

2120
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,550
I was going to hide with you,

2121
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:13,340
but I couldn't find you.

2122
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:15,090
Where did Jae Suk go?
He was chasing after us.

2123
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,410
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

2124
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,510
- He almost ripped off my name tag.
- Stay in here.

2125
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,450
(Peek-a-boo)

2126
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:23,890
Where are you going?

2127
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:25,160
Hey.

2128
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,930
Hey!

2129
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,200
Yoon Kyung, please hold him.

2130
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:29,640
What is going on?

2131
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,930
Did you sell me out?

2132
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:32,930
Come on.

2133
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,240
I mean...

2134
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,740
Yoon Kyung, just you wait.

2135
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,380
(She runs away at full speed
while Suk Jin threatens her.)

2136
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,320
This is nerve-wracking.

2137
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,540
- Team Red.
- I need to go over there.

2138
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,010
Yoon Kyung.

2139
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,420
(He finds his target.)

2140
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:52,080
- There are more on Team Blue.
- Jae Suk was...

2141
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,080
on Team Red.

2142
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,290
- He is a Penalty Man.
- Yes.

2143
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,880
- Is he on Team Red?
- Yes.

2144
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,590
There are members of Team Red.
I am Team Red, right?

2145
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,590
Am I Team Blue?

2146
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:02,070
(Am I Team Blue?)

2147
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:05,260
(He attacks Yoon Kyung for revenge!)

2148
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,500
What?

2149
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,300
(He successfully takes his revenge.)

2150
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,630
- How could you betray me?
- It's better to be...

2151
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:12,210
on Team Red.

2152
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:13,910
- It's better to be on Team Red.
- Yes.

2153
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:17,040
(Ji Hyo spots So Min,
Team Red's Penalty Man.)

2154
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:19,840
Team Blue has fewer Penalty Men.

2155
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,620
- Really?
- Yes. We have fewer Penalty Men.

2156
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,510
- We have fewer Penalty Men.
- Hold on.

2157
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,180
Penalty Men!

2158
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:28,880
(They spot Team Red's Penalty Men,
Jae Suk and Eun Jin!)

2159
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,220
(So Min is on Team Red too.)

2160
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,460
- Look at that.
- Team Red.

2161
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:33,590
What?

2162
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,590
Hey!

2163
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:36,960
- We are Team Red. What is it?
- What is it?

2164
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,070
Hurry up.

2165
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:40,170
(Team Blue is winning.)

2166
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:41,800
- Why are they running away?
- Kwang Soo. Hold on.

2167
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:44,040
So Min is on Team Red.
That team has three Penalty Men.

2168
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:46,500
We just need to protect ourselves.

2169
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,610
Watch out for Jae Suk.

2170
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,670
The Penalty Men must be
at each other's throats.

2171
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,510
Gosh, how do you know
which side to join?

2172
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:53,640
Haha!

2173
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,880
(Haha!)

2174
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,290
Haha, we are the only Penalty Men
on the team.

2175
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:57,820
(Haha, we are the only Penalty Men
on the team.)

2176
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:58,960
We just need to keep it this way.

2177
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,530
- Our team has only two Penalty Men.
- Really? Are you sure?

2178
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,530
The Penalty Men of that team have
no reason to rip off...

2179
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,550
Team Blue's name tags.

2180
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:07,790
Then Team Blue would have
more Penalty Men.

2181
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:09,740
I need to rip off
Team Blue's name tag.

2182
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:11,890
I think I should do that.

2183
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:13,240
There they are.

2184
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,960
Team Blue members
are gathered outside.

2185
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,540
Then...

2186
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,470
- I don't have anything.
- Hey, hold on.

2187
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,140
I can't beat you guys...

2188
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:24,250
in terms of speed or strength.

2189
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,490
Both of you are Penalty Men, right?

2190
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,950
(Sang Yi and Kwang Soo want
to keep the blue cap.)

2191
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,180
(Hold on.)

2192
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:35,830
(It's better to have
fewer Penalty Men on Team Blue.)

2193
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:38,750
(In that case...)

2194
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,870
(Suk Jin,
rip off Sang Yi's name tag.)

2195
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:45,070
- You understood the rules, right?
- I...

2196
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:46,630
You understood the rules, right?

2197
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,330
I understood them perfectly.

2198
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,130
Are you going to be this way?

2199
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:51,670
Hold on.

2200
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:53,080
(Ripping)

2201
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,210
Okay. I did it.

2202
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,170
- Let's go.
- We need to run away.

2203
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,950
- Suk Jin, So Min is coming.
- 1, 2, 3,

2204
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:01,580
4, 5...

2205
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,010
We are safe. We are totally safe.

2206
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,920
(Team Blue loses Sang Yi,
a Penalty Man.)

2207
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:06,990
I am the only Penalty Man...

2208
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,420
on Team Blue.

2209
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,130
(Kwang Soo is the only Penalty Man
on Team Blue!)

2210
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,250
- 7, 8,
- What's the current situation...

2211
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,570
- nine,
- for Team Red?

2212
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,790
- 10. Okay.
- What's the current situation?

2213
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:16,870
How many Penalty Men are
on Team Red?

2214
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:18,790
- Let's...
- Let's think.

2215
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,110
- You and me.
- Let's think.

2216
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,500
- Kwang Soo is on Team Blue.
- Kwang Soo is the only one...

2217
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,080
- There are five Penalty Men, right?
- Yes.

2218
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:24,540
Kwang Soo is the only Penalty Man
on Team Blue.

2219
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:26,300
- Jae Suk is on Team Red.
- The other four are on Team Red.

2220
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:27,780
Then...

2221
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:28,950
This is...

2222
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,450
I figured this out
after running around for 10 minutes.

2223
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,250
I trusted Kwang Soo.

2224
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,180
Why did you trust Kwang Soo?

2225
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,880
(My goodness.)

2226
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:43,090
(Yoon Kyung, a Blue Team member,
is walking around by herself.)

2227
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,030
(Hiding)

2228
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,590
(She spots Jae Suk.)

2229
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:52,670
Yoon Kyung.

2230
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,040
What is going on?

2231
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,300
(Yoon Kyung doesn't know
that Team Blue is winning.)

2232
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:57,780
It's more advantageous for you
to join Team Red.

2233
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,800
Why?

2234
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,640
Team Blue currently has
more Penalty Men.

2235
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,140
- So I will switch teams with you.
- Why would you do that?

2236
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,450
- It's 3 versus 2,
- Okay.

2237
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,040
so it doesn't affect me that much
to switch teams with you.

2238
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,180
I will do it for you.

2239
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,080
But we don't know...

2240
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,320
the current situation.

2241
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,460
That's why
I want to try switching teams.

2242
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,160
It's a good idea.

2243
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,720
Right? Let me rip off your name tag.

2244
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,830
Or you can rip mine off.

2245
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:18,590
You can rip off mine.

2246
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:19,700
- I will rip off yours.
- Okay.

2247
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:24,370
(Fooled by Jae Suk,
she reaches for his name tag.)

2248
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,330
(Running away)

2249
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:30,380
I have had it with you.

2250
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:32,410
I have had it with you.

2251
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,950
(Yoon Kyung suspects Jae Suk
and runs away.)

2252
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,040
Listen.

2253
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:39,040
Listen.

2254
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:40,620
What is your problem?

2255
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:42,880
(Yoon Kyung tends to be suspicious.)

2256
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,920
Why...

2257
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:46,360
It's either you rip off my name tag
or I rip off yours. I have no time.

2258
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,490
(But Jae Suk's lie continues.)

2259
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,250
All right. Gosh, it's stiff.

2260
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,700
- No one ripped it off before.
- Yes.

2261
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,920
- The race ends in five minutes.
- Really?

2262
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,260
Will you give us
the current situation now?

2263
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,390
- Yes.
- Okay.

2264
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:59,200
All right. Team Blue...

2265
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,760
All right. Team Blue...

2266
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:06,080
Team Blue is winning.

2267
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,910
(Excuse me?)

2268
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,970
(Laughing)

2269
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:13,140
(You can sense her rage
from the back.)

2270
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,210
Oh, that hurts!

2271
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,820
He is too fast!

2272
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:16,990
(The cheater runs away.)

2273
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:18,920
(Crying)

2274
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,180
He is too fast.

2275
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,490
(Jae Suk manages to lose her.)

2276
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,390
He fooled me.

2277
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:24,460
(He fooled me.)

2278
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,870
Team Red is losing.

2279
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:28,200
This is driving me crazy.

2280
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,290
What should I do?

2281
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:30,330
Is there no way to win?

2282
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:32,070
(Less than 5 minutes remain.)

2283
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:33,960
I see Team Blue.

2284
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,370
Someone is over there, right?

2285
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:38,930
(Hitting)

2286
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:40,110
Hey!

2287
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,470
Team Blue... I am Team Blue, right?

2288
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,280
Where is everyone hiding?

2289
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,710
Everyone must be hiding.

2290
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,510
If Team Blue members scatter,
we will win for sure.

2291
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,750
30 seconds remain.

2292
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,630
Run away, Team Blue!

2293
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:55,160
(The last 30 seconds
to determine the result)

2294
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,220
She is coming after us!

2295
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:59,290
I need to keep this cap.

2296
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,870
I need to keep this cap
no matter what.

2297
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,500
15 seconds remain. 15 seconds.

2298
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:06,500
(Kwang Soo in a blue cap
is looking for a place to hide.)

2299
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,410
Jae Suk!

2300
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:10,800
What? Why are you on Team Blue?

2301
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,500
Why are you... Hold on!

2302
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,080
(There are two blue caps.)

2303
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,620
(Why is Sang Yi
in a blue cap as well?)

2304
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,880
- Hold on! What?
- Hey!

2305
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,380
- Hey!
- What is...

2306
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,540
(At that moment,)

2307
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,320
(Suk Jin appears in a red cap.)

2308
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,550
- There are so many of them.
- What?

2309
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:26,080
- Hey!
- What is going on?

2310
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,160
(At this rate, Team Blue will lose.)

2311
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:29,960
So Min!

2312
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:32,920
Team Red has fewer Penalty Men.

2313
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,200
Team Blue has more, right?

2314
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,500
What is going on?

2315
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,540
(Then their target is Suk Jin.)

2316
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,670
(The last 5 seconds will determine
the result.)

2317
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,500
- Three...
- Get him!

2318
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,740
(If the race ends this way,)

2319
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:44,800
(the Penalty Men
of Team Blue will lose.)

2320
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:46,540
Get him!

2321
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:51,920
(Ripping)

2322
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:55,990
(Kwang Soo ripped off
Suk Jin's name tag!)

2323
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:58,790
(The race ends.)

2324
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:00,960
(Each team currently has
2 Penalty Men.)

2325
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,380
Please gather around.

2326
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,700
Hey, Sang Yi is a Penalty Man!

2327
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:06,760
What happened?

2328
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,890
(The non-Penalty Men's cap colors
get revealed.)

2329
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:10,960
What?

2330
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:13,000
It's blue.

2331
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:14,910
Did Team Blue win?

2332
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,610
We don't know yet.

2333
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:18,910
(Jong Kook and Eun Jin
will determine the result.)

2334
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:20,080
Which color is Eun Jin's cap?

2335
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,910
(Since Eun Jin is a Penalty Man,
her team will lose.)

2336
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:25,210
(What are their cap colors?)

2337
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:28,640
Hey.

2338
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,080
Eun Jin is on Team Blue.

2339
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,460
(Eun Jin is on Team Blue.)

2340
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,330
Eun Jin is on Team Blue.

2341
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,890
(Eun Jin, a Penalty Man,
is wearing a blue cap.)

2342
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:38,390
- We lost.
- Team Red won!

2343
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:39,750
Team Red won.

2344
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,720
Okay!

2345
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,760
(Team Red won.)

2346
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:44,240
At the last moment...

2347
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,670
(We were winning.)

2348
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:47,570
Kwang Soo came out of nowhere.

2349
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:50,130
(Kwang Soo made the right choice
by ripping off Suk Jin's name tag!)

2350
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,170
Team Red won!

2351
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:53,300
What?

2352
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,280
When did this happen?

2353
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,380
Jong Kook is on Team Red.

2354
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,170
Jong Kook is on Team Red.

2355
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,640
(Jong Kook is wearing a red cap.)

2356
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:01,080
What happened?

2357
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:02,750
She is coming after us!

2358
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,550
(Right before the race ended)

2359
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,680
I got you, Muscle Monster!

2360
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:09,920
It's better for me to rip off
the name tag.

2361
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,420
It's better for me to switch teams.

2362
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,700
(But both Ji Hyo and Yoon Kyung had
red caps.)

2363
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,370
I should switch over to Team Red.

2364
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,420
Okay.

2365
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,570
(If 3 out of 5 members
are non-Penalty Men on Team Red...)

2366
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:21,710
I should switch over to Team Red.

2367
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:22,930
Rip it off.

2368
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:26,080
(Thus, he gave up his blue cap!)

2369
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,410
(He sent Eun Jin to Team Blue
and solidified his victory.)

2370
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:29,500
Jong Kook, did you switch teams
at the last moment?

2371
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,670
Jong Kook.

2372
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:32,450
(Protein Monster
can strategize now.)

2373
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:33,750
We lost because of Jong Kook.

2374
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,340
- I did it.
- Jong Kook.

2375
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:36,920
Let's move to the ending location.

2376
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:37,990
Shall we go?

2377
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,990
(They move to the ending location
for the final penalty!)

2378
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,420
All right, everyone.

2379
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:44,550
Thanks to Kwang Soo's buzzer-beater,

2380
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:45,830
Team Blue lost.

2381
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:46,870
(Team Red won!)

2382
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,200
Thus, Team Blue's...

2383
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,130
Eun Jin, Sang Yi, and Jae Suk...

2384
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,390
will get the penalty.

2385
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:52,830
- The decision is final.
- Yes.

2386
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:54,300
Here is
what the rest of you will do.

2387
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,070
the winning team...

2388
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:58,130
will select the R money
one last time.

2389
01:16:58,170 --> 01:16:59,210
Really?

2390
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,000
Pick one each.

2391
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,450
Gosh, I picked 10 dollars.

2392
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,450
Look at Ji Hyo.

2393
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:07,540
Four dollars.

2394
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:09,490
How about you, Yoon Kyung?

2395
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,250
What's the number?

2396
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,580
Is it zero?

2397
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,720
(She got zero again.)

2398
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,550
You got zero all day long.

2399
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,890
- What is up with her today?
- We will get the penalty together.

2400
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:22,790
She is really bad at games.

2401
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,090
Before the penalty ticket lottery,

2402
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,210
you can use the mission fund...

2403
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:29,610
- to discard your penalty tickets.
- Okay.

2404
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:32,630
You remember
the 16 penalty tickets, right?

2405
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:33,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

2406
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:35,580
You can discard 1 penalty ticket
for 20 dollars.

2407
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,950
- 20 dollars?
- We can't discard that many.

2408
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:41,880
Pay up and pick the numbers
you want to discard.

2409
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:45,010
(Afterward, two numbers
will be chosen by lottery.)

2410
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:47,080
Discard the number
you think will get chosen.

2411
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,080
(The one who has the chosen number
will receive the penalty.)

2412
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:53,370
(The final Penalty Men will be hit
with a strong water bomb!)

2413
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,170
I don't know
which number will get chosen.

2414
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:58,390
It's impossible to know.

2415
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:01,070
There are so many.

2416
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,300
It wasn't my goal
to rip off the name tags.

2417
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:04,910
I will discard these tickets.

2418
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:06,780
Okay. If you leave them there,
we will take them.

2419
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,280
I have two tickets left.
I won't get chosen, right?

2420
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,320
I bet you do.

2421
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,420
I will pay up 320 dollars.

2422
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:13,080
- 320 dollars.
- 320 dollars?

2423
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,250
Yes. Count them.

2424
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,320
Did he discard all the tickets?

2425
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,320
- Did you discard all the tickets?
- Do you still have money left?

2426
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,380
Yes, I do.

2427
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,160
Jong Kook discarded all the tickets.

2428
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,220
- I have 40 dollars left.
- What?

2429
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,630
- You have to turn it in.
- Really?

2430
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:24,700
(He turns in 40 dollars.)

2431
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,530
- How did he do that?
- What?

2432
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:27,790
He is so frugal.

2433
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:29,460
Is he the production crew or what?

2434
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:32,790
While you guys focused on the cap,
I searched for the R money.

2435
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:35,740
People pretended not to see him
when they ran into him.

2436
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,430
(Protein Monster,
we didn't see anything.)

2437
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:38,930
- Seriously.
- He is too scary.

2438
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:40,500
Did you acknowledge him?

2439
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,580
I pretended not to see him.

2440
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:44,120
Show us your tickets.

2441
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,250
Please let the number be three.

2442
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,580
- Please.
- Please let the number be three.

2443
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:49,340
Kwang Soo has a high chance
of getting the penalty.

2444
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,750
Why do I have
so many penalty tickets?

2445
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,710
Hey, I have more.

2446
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:53,880
I have the most number
of penalty tickets.

2447
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,880
(Out of the 7 of them,
who will receive the penalty?)

2448
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,700
I will pick the first digit.

2449
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,000
- Please. The 1st digit.
- 3.

2450
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,130
2 or 3.

2451
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,130
(The first digit...)

2452
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,000
(can increase or decrease
the chances of the penalty!)

2453
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
All right. The first digit.

2454
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,110
Please don't let it be one.

2455
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:08,210
(What's the first digit?)

2456
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,800
- Two.
- Okay!

2457
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:12,610
(Okay!)

2458
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:13,640
He is set.

2459
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,950
I am set. I am safe.

2460
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,500
- I have 2 numbers left.
- The 1st digit.

2461
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,340
23 and 22.

2462
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:20,320
Haha, you and I have
the same numbers.

2463
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,380
- You and I have the same numbers.
- 21 and 22?

2464
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,460
Please let it be 3 or 4.

2465
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,660
- 3 or 4.
- 3 or 4.

2466
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,290
- My numbers are 21 and 22 too.
- Really?

2467
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:29,660
- 3 or 4.
- My numbers are 21 and 22 too.

2468
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:30,750
(Yoon Kyung's numbers are included.)

2469
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,200
- 3 or 4.
- Kwang Soo.

2470
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,500
Hey.

2471
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:35,200
- No, no.
- You shouldn't celebrate yet.

2472
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,200
I thought you were set.

2473
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:38,540
- Okay, okay.
- 3 or 4.

2474
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,870
- 3 or 4.
- 3 or 4.

2475
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:42,540
- I picked it.
- Two.

2476
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:43,800
3 or 4.

2477
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,540
Please let it be four.
Then no one will be picked.

2478
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:46,780
- 3 or 4.
- 3 or 4.

2479
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,250
- Two.
- Bo Pil!

2480
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:49,800
All right.

2481
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,320
22.

2482
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,510
Kwang Soo is ruined!

2483
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,880
(Congratulations on getting chosen.)

2484
01:19:57,990 --> 01:19:59,460
- That was quick.
- All right.

2485
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,720
Okay, okay.

2486
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,750
22.

2487
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:04,160
(Yoon Kyung avoided getting picked
for the penalty!)

2488
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,290
- That was quick.
- All right.

2489
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:08,030
(Let's get the penalty together.)

2490
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:09,290
Okay, okay.

2491
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,870
- Did you pick it on purpose?
- No, I didn't.

2492
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,200
Pick again.

2493
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:14,630
This makes no sense.

2494
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:16,370
- Yoon Kyung, how about you?
- I didn't get picked.

2495
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:18,380
- She has so many tickets.
- Excuse me?

2496
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,630
How did that happen?

2497
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:21,110
How did she avoid getting picked?

2498
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:23,140
She is good at games.

2499
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:25,170
- She is the master.
- Yoon Kyung is good at games.

2500
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:26,880
- She is the master.
- Okay.

2501
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:28,340
(This is fun.)

2502
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:31,680
Everyone I had hoped for
will receive the penalty.

2503
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,120
This makes no sense.

2504
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,680
(Kwang Soo's prediction came true.)

2505
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:37,590
2021 New Year
Driving Out Bad Luck Race.

2506
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:38,700
Driving out bad luck.

2507
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,670
(Se Chan got exempted
thanks to the Relief Chance.)

2508
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,830
1, 2, 3.

2509
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:49,610
(Staggering)

2510
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:50,710
That was incredible.

2511
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,970
(The water bomb hit them hard!)

2512
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,280
(He looks ugly.)

2513
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,250
That was incredible.

2514
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,820
That's it!

2515
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,080
(Highly satisfied)

2516
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,340
(Dry heaving)

2517
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,320
(They can't help
but feel overwhelmed.)

2518
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,380
That's it.

2519
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:06,830
- That's it.
- I just gargled.

2520
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:09,050
- It was like a disaster movie.
- That's it.

2521
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,550
- That's it.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2522
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,700
(They drove out their bad luck
for 2021.)

2523
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,330
(We thank Eun Jin, Sang Yi,
and Yoon Kyung...)

2524
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:16,030
(for joining the 2021 New Year
Driving Out Bad Luck Race.)

2525
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,390
(Running Gym)

2526
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,130
(This is the home ground
of the most mischievous members.)

2527
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:22,370
(Will the gym get new visitors?)

2528
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:23,580
(3 guests from "The Penthouse")

2529
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:24,970
(Yoon Jong Hun)

2530
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:26,210
(Park Eun Seok)

2531
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:27,470
(Ha Do Kwon)

2532
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,750
(Do Kwon, are you here
to get Jong Kook?)

2533
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,010
(I have no greed today.)

2534
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:33,510
(Dual)

2535
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:35,210
(He returns to being
the game-changer right away.)

2536
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:37,290
I just heard
his switch getting flipped on.

2537
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:39,960
(Running Man's
athletic meet starts!)

2538
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,180
(Shouts...)

2539
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:44,960
(and theft bombard them
as they get used to the show.)

2540
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:49,530
(Running Man shows them
the harsh variety show environment.)

2541
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:52,370
(The 3 guests go to the dark side.)

2542
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:57,110
(They use upgraded fouls
and adjust to the show!)

2543
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,300
(The determined trio...)

2544
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,970
(and the mischievous members
of Running Man have a match!)

2545
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,000
(Which team will win
the athletic meet?)
