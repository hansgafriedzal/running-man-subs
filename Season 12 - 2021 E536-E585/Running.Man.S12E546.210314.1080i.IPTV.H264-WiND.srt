(A strange energy covers
the peaceful Running Village.)

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,160
(And there's a mysterious pot.)

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,440
Hello!

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,010
Hello.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,470
Stay quiet.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,110
The camera isn't even on yet.

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,870
- Hello.
- This feels strange.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,920
Hello.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,310
(What's happening in this place?)

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,490
Today,

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,580
- you will travel back in time.
- Is that so?

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,630
- That's what we're doing.
- We're going back to the past.

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,030
We have four guests who are
perfect for the Joseon Dynasty.

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,720
- Joseon Dynasty?
- How dare you!

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,730
There they are.

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,130
Sung Hoon.

17
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,340
- There's Dong Jun.
- Dong Yoon!

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,740
Dong Jun is back after a long time.

19
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,030
- Hello.
- And there's Sae Rok.

20
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,340
(A fierce battle against evil
spirits trying to destroy Joseon.)

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,070
(Korean exorcism fantasy drama,
"Joseon Exorcist")

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,310
I'll stop it before
it becomes the living dead.

23
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,310
(Jang Dong Yoon
playing Prince Chungnyeong)

24
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,210
Why do they not die?

25
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,620
You have to save his life
before they do.

26
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,620
(Park Sung Hoon
playing Prince Yangnyeong)

27
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,780
Is there any way to get rid of them?

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,530
(Kim Dong Jun playing
an acrobatic actor, Byuri)

29
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,320

actress with secrets, Hye Yum)

30
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,160
(Jang Dong Yoon, Park Sung Hoon,
Kim Dong Jun, Keum Sae Rok)

31
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,590
It's "Joseon Exorcist".

32
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,620
We have four actors from the drama.

33
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,460
- "Joseon Exorcist".
- Please give them a big hand.

34
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,900
"Joseon Exorcist".

35
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,230
It's set in Joseon Dynasty.

36
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,230
I heard Sung Hoon...

37
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,010
is So Min's close friend.

38
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,010
- Really?
- Is that true?

39
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,540
- We did a drama together.
- Which one?

40
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,150
- What was the drama?
- A one-act drama.

41
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,620
What is Sung Hoon like?

42
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,710
Sung Hoon looks cool,

43
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,120
but he's very weak.

44
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,420
- He's clumsy.
- Right.

45
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,150
If he fights against Suk Jin,
Suk Jin might beat him.

46
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,030
Seriously? He must be feeble.

47
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,620
Sung Hoon, do you not work out?

48
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,960
Never.

49
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,200
That's good.

50
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,700
He's...

51
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,120
- perfect for our show.
- I know.

52
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,930
He would be like
the second Kim Hee Won.

53
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,490
What's your hobby, Sung Hoon?

54
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,730
- I like to lie in bed.
- Good.

55
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,130
- He's just like Suk Jin.
- You're like me.

56
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,870
He likes to lie still.

57
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,010
My gosh.

58
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,870
- It's not that everyone...
- You're right.

59
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,310
- has to work out hard.
- I agree.

60
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,870
- His arm is so soft.
- I like that.

61
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,650
- He's so skinny.
- It's like a sticky rice cake.

62
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,120
And we have Jang Dong Yoon here.

63
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,260
(Next to the weakling is the pure
and elegant guy, Jang Dong Yoon.)

64
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,210
Dong Yoon is really handsome.

65
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,380
Hello. I'm Jang Dong Yoon,

66
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,430
and I'm playing Prince Chungnyeong
in "Joseon Exorcist".

67
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,590
- He has a great voice.
- Wish me good luck.

68
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,960
- I like his voice.
- I'll try my best.

69
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,160
- It sounds so good.
- You know what?

70
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,490
- Dong Yoon is...
- What about him?

71
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,740
He got a full mark in math
on the college entrance exam.

72
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,000
- My gosh.
- He's smart.

73
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,140
This isn't a quiz show though.

74
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,140
(The young men who stopped
robbers with their wits)

75
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,240
(He became the talk of the town
after catching a robber.)

76
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,050
(Handsome)

77
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,780
(He was on the news
and made his debut later on.)

78
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,210
I feel so small.

79
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,840
I got four points in math.

80
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,020
(I got four points in math.)

81
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,020
Then you should just
focus on your studies.

82
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,680
- Hang on.
- Why did you...

83
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,430
Then you should just
focus on working out.

84
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,900
I do work out.

85
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
I spend half of my time working out.

86
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,900
He got into the harsh world
of show business instead.

87
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,160
Dong Yoon is...

88
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,330
(He's handsome.)

89
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,490
Hello.

90
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,870
(Hello.)

91
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,960
What makes you so happy?

92
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,560
I just met eyes with Dong Jun,

93
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,840
so I said hello to him.

94
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,240
- Why did you say hello like that?
- This is crazy.

95
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,640
It's just...

96
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,180
I couldn't wave at him.

97
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,500
You're wearing...

98
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,650
- an old lady's jacket today.
- Gosh, no.

99
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,620
She's even wearing a pearl necklace.

100
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,940
It's like you're attending
your kid's school play.

101
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,960
- Hey, stop that.
- I'm all dressed up today.

102
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,180
Next to Dong Yoon,

103
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,280
- we have Keum Sae Rok here.
- Welcome.

104
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
I'm acquainted with Sae Rok.

105
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,300
I said I'd make you become a star.

106
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,360
And you became
the most searched word that day.

107
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,300
- I did.
- Right.

108
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,460
And I even did a TV commercial.

109
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,340
I made Sae Rok a star.

110
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,640
(Sae Rok met
the star-maker, Big Nose.)

111
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,970
(Without Suk Jin's help,)

112
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,240
(she became the most searched word
with her powerful shoulder dance.)

113
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,740
(She made herself a star
with her abdominal shout.)

114
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,020
(Suk Jin didn't do anything.)

115
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,520
He's a star-maker.

116
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,910
I was surprised too.

117
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,960
I made a joke about
the search word rankings.

118
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
I said she was number four,

119
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,060
- and she really was ranked 4th.
- I was ranked 4th.

120
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,780
That's how it started.

121
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,650
You should do the same thing
for your stock investments.

122
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,830
Mr. Shipbuilding.

123
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,930
"I'm Suk Jin who invested
in J Shipbuilding."

124
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,330
"I'm Suk Jin who invested
in J Shipbuilding."

125
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,770
Today, with the actors
from "Joseon Exorcist",

126
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,810
you will have the Running Dynasty
Records Race.

127
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,680
And you will be
in a hierarchical society...

128
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,030
where the king's words are the law.

129
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,280
- What does that mean?
- Oh, really?

130
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,740
So what matters is
who will become the king.

131
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,310
You will decide the king right away.

132
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,680
- What?
- Is it a random game?

133
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,710
- A random game?
- I want you to pick one scroll.

134
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,210
If Kwang Soo becomes the king,
things will get bloody today.

135
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,410
- I know.
- No, I'm...

136
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,720
- You know what I mean.
- I want to be the king.

137
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,260
- Should we just pick one now?
- Yes.

138
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,830
- Just pick one.
- We don't know who'll be the king.

139
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,790
I really want to be the king.

140
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,920
- I'll put you guys in prison.
- You don't want me to be the king.

141
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,700
I'll just pick what's left.

142
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,570
(I picked it first.)

143
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,590
And?

144
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,710
- Okay.
- All right.

145
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,140
- One.
- Hang on. Let me open it.

146
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,400
- Two.
- The last one...

147
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,470
Three.

148
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,540
- Darn it.
- What's this?

149
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,650
It's empty.

150
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,580
- Is it Dong Jun?
- I didn't see it yet.

151
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,520
What is this?

152
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,910
- I think it's you.
- It's him.

153
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,590
- You're the king.
- Oh, no.

154
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,760
I'm the king!

155
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,260
We have a horrible king.

156
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,460
- He can't be the king.
- This isn't right.

157
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,260
Take off Ji Suk Jin's pants.

158
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,630
- Take off his pants right away.
- Hey.

159
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,570
- And send him...
- Okay.

160
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,270
- to the mountain.
- The mountain?

161
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,400
Am I the king?

162
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,770
- I can't believe he's the king.
- He's our king.

163
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,030
It's a hierarchical society.

164
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,670
So today's king is Yang Se Chan.

165
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,840
- All day?
- Yes.

166
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,280
- What?
- All day?

167
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,750
It won't change at all?

168
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,110
In today's race, there will be
three different classes.

169
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,210
The first is the nobles.

170
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,050
They are King, Queen,
Premier, and Vice-premier.

171
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,760
These four people are nobles.

172
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,530
- And there are four eunuchs.
- What?

173
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,460
And there are four slaves.

174
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,850
- There are slaves too.
- I'd rather be a slave.

175
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,900
- I'd rather be a slave.
- A slave is better than a eunuch.

176
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,660
Don't you think so?

177
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,140
Those who are in the same class
are in one team.

178
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,900
Each team will earn rice...

179
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,070
through each mission.

180
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,840
You will get rice according
to the results of each mission.

181
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,380
The king gets to decide
the classes of all members.

182
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,340
And he can switch the classes of
two members before each mission.

183
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,450
Can I do that?

184
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,190
- And he can do that all day?
- I'm the real king.

185
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,980
That is, those who want
a better social status should...

186
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,630
get on the king's good side.

187
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,830
We should be nice to Se Chan.

188
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,000
We will be discriminated against
for sure.

189
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,860
I'm so glad that
I've always been nice to Se Chan.

190
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,030
It's started already.

191
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,570
Okay. I'm going to win today.

192
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,000
- I have to flatter Se Chan.
- He's my favorite.

193
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,510
I don't like to flatter others.

194
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,840
You're dressed like a slave.

195
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,940
Look at his pants.

196
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,800
During the race,

197
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,150
the king can talk down to everyone.

198
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,580
And the rest should use
honorifics to the king.

199
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,820
- That's so nice.
- This is crazy.

200
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,690
I love that. It's great.

201
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,320
Now, Se Chan, you should
decide the classes...

202
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,460
of the 11 members as the king.

203
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,920
- My gosh.
- I'm nervous.

204
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,050
My goodness.

205
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,150
Hang on. So I'm the king.

206
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,090
- Pick the queen first.
- I see.

207
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,160
(He should select the queen first.)

208
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,860
(She takes
one step forward quietly.)

209
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,940
Hang on. Why are you
acting like that already?

210
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,600
Could you dance for me?

211
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,280
(She shows off her dance moves
for the king.)

212
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,800
That's the filial dance.

213
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,580
That makes me feel uncomfortable.

214
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,750
Oh, dear.

215
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,590
- Oh, what is going on?
- Sae Rok is a good dancer.

216
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,340
- My gosh.
- Please, Your Majesty.

217
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,710
She looks beautiful.

218
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,890
She dances well.

219
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,650
Her dance...

220
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,650
- Her dance was beautiful.
- She dances well.

221
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,960
Can a man...

222
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,590
- become the queen?
- It's possible.

223
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,700
It can be a man.

224
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,360
(All right then.)

225
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,770
(They all dance together
in the unbiased Running Man.)

226
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,360
- Good.
- Hey.

227
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,080
Gosh, look at them.

228
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,210
You guys are unbelievable.

229
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,950
Stop that. Enough.

230
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,080
- Come here.
- That's dirty.

231
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,710
- It's not dirty.
- My gosh.

232
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,540
Hey, look at him.

233
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,150
He has long hair.

234
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,320
(He shows off his feeble charm.)

235
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,150
I'll select the queen.

236
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,480
- What?
- The king is...

237
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,350
That's because
he's never been a king before.

238
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,220
I've never done this before.

239
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,420
- Just let it go.
- Hey.

240
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,700
- Kings can make mistakes.
- There are...

241
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,200
kings who aren't so smart.

242
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,000
- He's right.
- It can happen.

243
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,160
"I'll select the queen."

244
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,770
- I'll...
- It's hard...

245
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,280
- select the queen.
- to be the king all of a sudden.

246
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,470
My gosh.

247
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,640
The queen is...

248
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,150
(The queen is...)

249
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,280
We don't know it yet.
It might be you, So Min.

250
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,540
(Is it So Min
whom he sees every day?)

251
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,910
(Is it Sae Rok whom he met again
after a long time?)

252
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,520
I think the queen
has been decided already.

253
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,980
The queen is...

254
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,690
Keum Sae Rok.

255
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,330
She's the queen.

256
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,200
- Yes!
- All right.

257
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,920
This is what the queen should do.

258
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,460
- He has an ulterior motive.
- There are two people left.

259
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,140
- Premier and Vice-premier.
- I think it's hard...

260
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,030
to be the Premier
and the Vice-premier.

261
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,070
I think they will be
Jong Kook and Haha.

262
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,880
For Premier and Vice-premier,

263
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,280
you should choose the people
whom you're comfortable with.

264
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,150
- Okay. Good.
- Yes.

265
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,200
What about me?

266
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,410
Shut it!

267
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,940
How dare a slave talk to the king?

268
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,220
- He's a slave.
- A slave?

269
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,850
- Are you a slave?
- A slave?

270
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,120
Otherwise, you should be a eunuch.

271
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,360
I don't want you to be my eunuch.

272
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,260
You should pick someone educated...

273
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,890
for the Premier.

274
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,600
He got the perfect score in math.

275
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,900
Hang on. That sounds
like a good idea.

276
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,370
But I don't want him
because he will stand out.

277
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,640
(He's out because of
his outstanding looks.)

278
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,530
Then why don't you pick this guy...

279
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,930
who's smart but ugly?

280
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,240
Right. He's uglier than me,

281
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,700
- but he's smart.
- He is smart.

282
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,010
I want Jae Suk to be the Premier.

283
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,910
- Really?
- You're successful.

284
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,580
- He's not good-looking.
- He's not good-looking.

285
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,750
- But he's smart enough.
- That's right.

286
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,860
Your Majesty.
If you want someone ugly,

287
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,280
I can be a perfect fit.

288
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,180
He looks horrible.

289
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,530
- What's wrong with your face?
- Your Majesty.

290
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,370
He looks like a middle-aged man.

291
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,920
What happened to your face?

292
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,560
What's wrong with your face?

293
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,640
What's wrong with him?

294
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,740
The medicine is too strong.

295
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,400
What happened to your face?

296
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,430
All right then.

297
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,640
I want someone quiet...

298
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,900
and obedient for the Vice-premier.

299
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,670
He's obviously a eunuch.

300
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,850
Long hair.

301
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,940
Those who hold high office
should take good care of me.

302
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,850
Considering regionalism and kinship.

303
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,520
I like the members of Team Slave
except for Suk Jin.

304
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,520
- I like my team.
- You do?

305
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,180
This is nice.

306
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,420
Why did you push me?

307
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,550
- Your Majesty.
- Team Slave has good members.

308
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,860
- Your Majesty.
- What?

309
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,000
- What's that, Hyeong Gu?
- Hey, Hyeong Gu.

310
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,030
He's a eunuch.

311
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,430
It's an urgent
public appeal from the capital.

312
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,740
Hyeong Gu.

313
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,330
He joined SBS
through open recruitment.

314
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,800
Really?

315
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,930
You went to a good college.
Life must be so hard.

316
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,610
Is this what you want
to do with your career?

317
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,880
- Yes, it is.
- Thank you.

318
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,120
You may leave now.

319
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,880
Your Majesty.

320
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,540
- He must've studied hard.
- Please take a look at this.

321
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,780
(What does the appeal that Eunuch
Hyeong Gu brought say?)

322
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,450
Read it for me, Premier.

323
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,390
Okay. I'll read this for you.

324
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,920
"Your Majesty, there are..."

325
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,530
"evil spirits that possess
people's bodies..."

326
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,230
"and disturb the public order
outside the castle."

327
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,320
How terrible!

328
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,130
"And two of them made
their way into the castle..."

329
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,500
"and are hiding among people."

330
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,930
"Please hold a trial..."

331
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,330
"and make sure
to arrest the evil spirits."

332
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,370
I got you!

333
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,110
- You're busted!
- I'm not an evil spirit.

334
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,800
- Are there evil spirits here?
- I got one already.

335
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,040
- Okay.
- It's not me.

336
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,400
- I'm not an evil spirit.
- I smell something fishy.

337
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,350
I think this guy...

338
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,220
- And that...
- and the guy in strange pants...

339
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,080
That slave. It's him.

340
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,150
I think the slave is an evil spirit.

341
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,550
There are...

342
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,860
two evil spirits here
hiding among people.

343
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,790
- This is hard.
- There are two.

344
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,060
I think I know who they are.

345
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,690
You can eliminate
the evil spirits through a trial.

346
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,160
If you eliminate
all the evil spirits...

347
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,300
through three trials today,
humans will win.

348
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,870
And the two humans...

349
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,880
with the most rice
will get the prize.

350
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,540
And the evil spirits
will get the penalty.

351
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,070
Do the evil spirits know
about their identity?

352
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,570
They know
that they are evil spirits.

353
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,850
But if at least one evil spirit
survives, the evil spirits win.

354
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,490
They will win the prize,

355
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,620
and two humans with the least rice
will get the penalty.

356
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,780
Now I'd like you to change
into your costumes...

357
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,730
and move to the first court.

358
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,190
Okay.

359
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,690
(They will change their outfits
and move to the first court.)

360
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,240
Hurry up.

361
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,500
(The Running Dynasty of King Se Chan
begins with hidden evil spirits.)

362
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,770
You don't look good
with a real mustache,

363
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,140
but the mustache drawing
looks great on you.

364
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,330
"You don't look good
with a real mustache?"

365
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,300
- Is there a camera?
- How could you...

366
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,110
- say such a thing to the king?
- I'm sorry.

367
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,200
(Eunuch Kwang Soo
forgot about his identity.)

368
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,070
If you're a eunuch, act like one.

369
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,810
Come here.

370
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,540
Do you want to draw a mustache?

371
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,810
A eunuch can have a mustache.

372
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,260
- Can a eunuch grow a mustache?
- Sure.

373
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,280
(It's possible
only in Running Dynasty.)

374
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,450
A eunuch can't grow a mustache.

375
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,690
What's that mole for?

376
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,150
All right. It means you're mine.

377
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,600
I picked you. You're dismissed.

378
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,190
- Next.
- Hello.

379
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,560
Come here. I'll fix
your dirty mustache.

380
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,510
Don't make it look really dirty.

381
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,930
It's really is dirty.

382
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,140
(He makes it look even uglier.)

383
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,540
(He draws a mole again.)

384
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,570
You're dismissed.

385
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,040
I'm upset with you these days.

386
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,250
What are you upset about?

387
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,440
We should play the King Game
together later on.

388
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,480
Let's do that.

389
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,490
Number 1 and 4 should kiss. Okay?

390
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,810
Darn it. I'm number four.

391
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,990
- What's your number?
- I'm number one.

392
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,990
Good.

393
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,020
(They have fun
playing the King Game.)

394
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,360
Go on in.

395
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,680
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

396
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,190
The ignorant king is in power.
We're in trouble.

397
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,790
Did you come early to sit here?

398
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,230
No, it's not like that.

399
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,240
I just got changed and came here.

400
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,060
(He glanced at him
and burst out laughing.)

401
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,160
My gosh.

402
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,800
You look like a real eunuch
in that costume.

403
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,140
Hey...

404
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,440
Do not speak to us casually
like that.

405
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,280
Right. We're in different classes.

406
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,410
(Their social classes are effective
even on the bus.)

407
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,440
But...

408
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,120
- Don't act like you don't know.
- Are you serious?

409
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,540
You should apologize to him.

410
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,080
Has it begun already?

411
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,680
Hey, but you...

412
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,390
"Hey"? Hey, Ji Suk Jin.

413
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,190
Gosh, seriously.

414
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,530
- Keep it together.
- You don't even have it.

415
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,900
What did you just say?

416
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,560
- But that's true.
- How dare you?

417
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,690
Not now. I'll let you do it later.

418
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,640
I'll let you do it if you promote me
to a eunuch.

419
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,560
I have the authority to do
what I want as your king.

420
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,030
How dare that punk have pictures
taken in a cool pose like that?

421
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,780
He's posing for pictures
when he's a mere servant.

422
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,040
He even has female fans too.

423
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,410
No one follows the King.

424
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,040
You two will have a unibrow.

425
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,580
- No.
- Come here.

426
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,260
(After drawing unibrows
on the servants...)

427
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,890
You're a eunuch.

428
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

429
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
- Wait.
- I want to watch.

430
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,860
But I thought eunuchs
have no body hair.

431
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,790
It is I, your king, that decides.
Do not say anything.

432
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,240
- My apologies.
- I hate your mullet.

433
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,270
I used to hate another punk
with a mullet.

434
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,010
I'm glad you're here.

435
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,700
Just stay still.

436
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,570
(His sin is having a mullet.)

437
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,900
- Wait.
- Stay still.

438
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,280
I think I know what you're drawing.

439
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,910
Don't move. This will look great.

440
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,440
- Queen, you may get on the bus.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

441
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,780
You look so pretty.

442
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,150
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Go on in.

443
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,280
Won't she get a mustache?

444
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,280
(Relieved)

445
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,920
(Eunuch Kook, understands the power
structure, surrenders to the power)

446
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,860
Jong Kook is waiting quietly.

447
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,400
(He's done drawing a circle.)

448
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,420
I shall think of you
as my little brother.

449
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,600
Go on in.

450
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,330
Thank you
for your boundless generosity.

451
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,900
Next.

452
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,160
(Eunuch Kook is the last to go.)

453
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,480
- Aren't you Kim Jong Kook?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

454
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,150
You are quite muscular for a eunuch.

455
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,850
I do not know where the testosterone
comes from.

456
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,480
I shall help you produce
even more testosterone.

457
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,150
- Come closer.
- I don't think that's possible.

458
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,180
Don't you all think
that our king is too ignorant?

459
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,260
"Ignorant"?

460
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,890
- I'm sorry.
- That's treason.

461
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,780
- But the King is too ignorant.
- As a matter of fact,

462
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,690
the Premier deserves the throne.

463
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,870
- I agree.
- Of course.

464
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,030
I also think that's right.

465
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,790
He's practically ruling the country
on the King's behalf.

466
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,970
(They're starting to plot a revolt
against the tyrant.)

467
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,830
- Stop it.
- You have control over him.

468
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,200
You are the King to us, my lord.

469
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,670
Do I have the face to become a king?

470
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,380
Yes, my lord.

471
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,480
I'm pretty sure that Jae Suk will
have to change into...

472
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,750
a slave's costume later.

473
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,020
He'll go down step by step
and end up being a slave.

474
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,520
That's possible.

475
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,120
(Airhead King is getting on the bus
after drawing on the others' faces.)

476
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,580
Why are the slaves sitting there?
Come forward.

477
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,860
- Pardon?
- Come forward.

478
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,260
- But...
- Hurry up and come.

479
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,920
- This has been my seat for so long.
- How dare you?

480
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,230
- That's funny.
- How dare you talk back to me?

481
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,660
- Sit in the front seat.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

482
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,100
Go to the front seat.

483
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,160
Where should I sit?

484
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,800
Do not think it's a joke
and do as you're told.

485
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,110
- Exactly. How dare he?
- Where should I sit?

486
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,170
- A mere slave...
- Oh, I can sit here.

487
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,640
How dare you sit with a backrest?

488
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,170
Can't I even sit with a backrest?

489
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,850
Sit on the floor, not a seat!

490
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,280
- I shall allow it just this once.
- Run now!

491
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,310
(Everyone else is
as mean as the King.)

492
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,350
All of you must impress me today.

493
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,810
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

494
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,810
The King speaks like a thug.

495
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,420
"A thug"?

496
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,630
- I didn't mean it like that.
- How dare you?

497
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,100
How impudent! That little punk.

498
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,150
"Punk"?

499
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,870
You shouldn't say such a vulgar
expression as the Premier.

500
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,690
- Those impudent punks.
- How dare you?

501
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,190
Slave Ji, how dare you
raise your voice?

502
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,370
I shall not let this slide.
Slave Ji.

503
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,470
Sell all the stocks you own
this instant.

504
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,240
Sell all of them!

505
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
- How can I sell them?
- That is impossible, Your Majesty.

506
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,700
- The stocks he owns...
- No one will buy them.

507
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,650
His stocks are not worth much
even after selling them.

508
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,720
Then forget what I said.

509
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,850
(Slave Ji's stocks are worth
chump change.)

510
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,720
His stocks are about to be delisted.

511
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,520
Is that so? Then you may
hold on to them.

512
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,950
We can change our social classes
except for the King, right?

513
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,230
That's correct. Except for the King.

514
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,650
(It's possible to change
their social classes, but...)

515
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,150
By the way... I'm asking this...

516
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,370
- out of curiosity.
- Yes?

517
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,270
Are you the manager of these two?

518
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,010
That's irrelevant to the context.

519
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,270
- This is set in the old days.
- I mean...

520
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,570
Why are you shooting
another show here?

521
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,800
Are you shooting "The Manager"?

522
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,070
- No.
- "The Manager"?

523
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,250
Don't be ridiculous.

524
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,170
Are you here as Dong Jun's manager?

525
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,410
- Or as Dong Yoon's manager?
- No.

526
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,410
That suits him well.

527
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,410
Why aren't you two saying anything?
Why would you pat me?

528
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
All right.

529
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,490
I shall tighten the discipline,
Your Majesty.

530
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,550
Correct.

531
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,190
- "Correct"?
- "Correct"?

532
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,530
- You can just say, "Go ahead."
- What was that?

533
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,730
- What was that?
- You see...

534
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,890
- Are you intimidated?
- You can just say, "Go ahead."

535
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,890
You see,

536
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,590
- I've never...
- You are so ignorant.

537
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,170
- played a role as a king before.
- Are you intimidated?

538
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,270
- He's never played...
- "I have no experience, my lord."

539
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,360
I have no experience, my lord.

540
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,770
- "My lord"?
- Wait.

541
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,780
He looks like a pushover.

542
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,710
- Who are you to control me?
- That is not true, Your Majesty.

543
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,780
- My apologies.
- He keeps trying to control me.

544
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,840
- This is what's called "regency".
- Exactly.

545
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,220
You must take him down.

546
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,190
- Do you know what "regency" means?
- Do you know what it is?

547
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,780
I believe that it means
"refreshed areas".

548
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,110
- Airhead!
- I know what it means.

549
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,780
Please lift the restrictions
on the greenbelt.

550
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,380
What is he talking about?

551
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,700
Eunuch Ha, how come you have
three children as a eunuch?

552
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,700
Before I lost it...

553
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,890
He was a step ahead.

554
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,770
My, I didn't know he was so virile.

555
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,330
- Sae Rok, why are you so quiet?
- Yes?

556
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,360
Why?

557
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,630
- She's so playful on set.
- Really?

558
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,130
Sae Rok, what do you do on set?

559
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,300
I'm not playful.

560
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,300
You're the most playful one there.

561
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,340
- Please show us.
- No, I'm not.

562
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,140
Actually, Ji Hyo is also
quite playful off camera.

563
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,310
- When can we see that?
- Ji Hyo...

564
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,380
- Ji Hyo is...
- When can we see that?

565
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,960
the type that acts playful
when the camera goes off.

566
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
She's playful in real life.

567
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,660
- That's true.
- But when the camera is rolling,

568
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,760
she becomes shy, and it's been
that way for the past 10 years.

569
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,230
Meanwhile, Suk Jin acts playful
on TV shows,

570
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,530
but he's actually very quiet
in real life.

571
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,200
He doesn't even greet me back
when I say hi to him.

572
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,940
That's true.

573
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,510
- Right.
- He doesn't speak until he's paid.

574
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,670
I guess it's true.

575
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,980
Suk Jin, why is your hand
so sweaty?

576
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,410
What? It's because I'm hot.

577
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,840
- What?
- Aren't your hands sweaty?

578
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,520
- No, see it yourself.
- Something must be going on.

579
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,780
Are you one of the evil spirits?

580
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,990
- No, I'm not.
- You must be.

581
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,310
- I'm just feeling hot. That's all.
- He's suspicious.

582
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,310
I'm really feeling hot.

583
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,550
I'm sure he was given the role.

584
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,960
No. That's not true.

585
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,350
You're blushing too.

586
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,160
- No. It's not the case.
- It wasn't because of his pants.

587
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,890
Jong Kook, touch his hand just once.

588
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,460
- This is...
- If you're not...

589
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,670
an evil spirit, you must be
going through male menopause.

590
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,670
- It's because...
- That was...

591
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,390
an awesome punch line.

592
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,670
I hope he's an evil spirit.

593
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,630
I can finally smile
as I'm relieved now.

594
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,060
You became so talkative suddenly.

595
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,870
Queen, which of us are
the evil spirits?

596
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,750
Before I answer that,
I have a question.

597
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Go ahead.

598
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,180
Is it possible that you are
one of the evil spirits?

599
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,380
- Of course.
- Yes.

600
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,580
Can the King be an evil spirit?

601
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,310
(The King may be
an evil spirit too!)

602
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,380
Of course.

603
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,720
- The King may be one of them too.
- Right.

604
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,280
I have a good feeling about this.

605
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
I may be one of them.

606
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,260
How about we choose one
before we arrive?

607
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,590
(Who are the 2 evil spirits
acting as humans among them?)

608
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,320
(Running Palace where the King
and the ministers discuss affairs.)

609
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,940
This place is decorated
like a period movie filming set.

610
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,470
It looks amazing.

611
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,510
(There are
solemn-looking thrones too.)

612
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,240
- It looks nice.
- Look how the chairs are placed.

613
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,530
- How nice. I'm so upset.
- Let's sit down.

614
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,180
Did you really have to place them
like this?

615
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,370
- Of course, I know.
- Sit down quietly.

616
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,840
- Give us some cushions at least.
- Just sit down.

617
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,370
What about the slaves?

618
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,610
Oh, yes. I can sit on the throne.

619
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,850
(Airhead King and Queen Keum are
sitting on the thrones.)

620
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,920
Queen, please sit.

621
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,820
- Did you really have to do this?
- Do you want to sit here?

622
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,930
No, that's okay.

623
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,260
(Everyone found their seats
according to their classes.)

624
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,620
Starting with the slaves...

625
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,060
Why hasn't the Vice-premier
come yet?

626
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,620
- She went to the restroom.
- She went to poop.

627
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,700
Oh, she went to poop?

628
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,770
How dare you describe
the act of the Vice-premier...

629
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,440
as "pooping"?

630
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,710
- You punk.
- Then...

631
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,630
Not every eunuch is the same.

632
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,800
Refrain yourself
from saying anything disrespectful.

633
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,800
That ignorant punk.

634
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,140
- He sounds like a eunuch.
- Oops.

635
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,520
- What was that?
- It's just...

636
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,380
- He sounds like a eunuch.
- It's not like that.

637
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,960
- He sounds like a lowlife.
- It's my old habit.

638
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,960
- "That ignorant punk."
- What kind of king...

639
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,390
Actually, His Majesty used to be
the lowliest...

640
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,500
You brat!

641
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,700
How dare you say that
as a mere premier?

642
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,000
You might become a slave if you
keep acting like this, you brat.

643
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,770
- Please forgive me.
- "You brat."

644
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,440
- No king would put on such a face.
- Please forgive me.

645
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,940
You all will be killed when I speak
the way I used to speak again.

646
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,240
(It's almost a threat.)

647
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,010
I'm trying to act solemn,

648
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,800
but if you keep acting up like this,

649
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,210
- I might go back to the way I was.
- Your Majesty,

650
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,220
please forgive me.

651
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,310
- Do not provoke His Majesty.
- I'll go back to my old self.

652
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,450
- Your Majesty.
- Do not provoke him again.

653
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,520
While I am acting
with grace and dignity...

654
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,050
I beg your forgiveness,
Your Majesty.

655
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,190
- So Min, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

656
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,230
What are you doing?

657
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,190
This is my baby, Your Majesty.

658
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,890
- Who is the father?
- Is he in here?

659
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,200
(Her baby looks like someone.)

660
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,560
Is the father of the baby
in this room?

661
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,230
- He's right here.
- Here.

662
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,290
- He's here.
- Take...

663
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,740
Take...

664
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,010
Take that crazy woman out of here
immediately!

665
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,860
- What do you think you are doing?
- She's crazy about role-playing.

666
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,300
- Isn't this...
- No. Please.

667
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,530
- Did you draw the King's face?
- Please don't do that.

668
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,010
- How dare you...
- He's my baby.

669
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,280
(Genes are powerful.)

670
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,020
- How dare you...
- He's my baby.

671
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,750
Send her to prison!

672
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,020
- Send this crazy woman...
- How dare you...

673
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,050
- Please. I beg you.
- She gave birth to the King's baby.

674
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,310
He's my child.

675
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,460
- You wench!
- "You wench."

676
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,660
You wench!

677
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,760
(Queen Keum got furious as she saw
the baby that looks like the King.)

678
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,090
The baby looks just like the King.

679
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,090
- What kind of role play is this?
- She drew the King's face...

680
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,500
Doesn't he look just like the King?

681
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,700
- Send her to prison.
- How dare you draw his face?

682
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,440
- He's my baby.
- He looks just like the King.

683
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,940
- Then Sung Hoon starts crying.
- Look at him.

684
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,280
- He turns out to be Sung Hoon's.
- He looks...

685
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,840
He has a similar mustache
to Sung Hoon's.

686
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,980
But he looks just like the King.

687
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,040
This is hilarious.

688
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,780
(Crying her heart out)

689
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,780
Director, let's begin.

690
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,020
This is the first trial where you
can eliminate an evil spirit...

691
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,780
before you carry out the mission.

692
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,990
We must eliminate the evil spirit.

693
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,620
Every one of you is free to talk
about the person...

694
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,890
that you think is the evil spirit.

695
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,320
But the King will
select the person...

696
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,500
to be tried.

697
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,830
After the discussion?

698
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,170
- The King has all powers.
- It'd be the best if he's one.

699
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,210
Exactly.

700
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,830
However, the King may also be
one of the evil spirits,

701
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,910
and you may oppose
the King's opinions.

702
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,570
Those who are against his opinions
can revolt against him.

703
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,220
- That's great.
- Revolt?

704
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,810
The revolt succeeds...

705
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,920
if more than half of you
break the dried gourd with the head.

706
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,580
In that case, you'll select the one
to be tried through a vote.

707
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,490
Let's eliminate him before we begin.

708
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,230
If the evil spirit is caught,

709
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,790
the evil spirit will stay as a slave
to the end of the show.

710
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,860
Really?

711
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,500
If the evil spirits lose the race,
the one with less rice...

712
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,710
will receive a penalty twice.

713
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,710
(The evil spirit with less rice will
receive a penalty twice.)

714
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,980
If you put an innocent person
on trial,

715
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,780
the evil spirits will choose
one person...

716
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,610
to take all the rice that person has
behind your backs.

717
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,810
And they will share the rice.

718
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,580
The evil spirits must complete
a hidden mission...

719
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,550
before each of the three trials.

720
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,550
(The evil spirits must complete
a mission before the trials!)

721
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,690
The evil spirits had a mission
to complete on your way here.

722
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,700
- Did they complete it?
- Oh, gosh.

723
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
(The evil spirits already completed
their 1st hidden mission.)

724
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,700
- They drew a mole on the face.
- Did they complete the mission?

725
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,860
(They drew a mole on the face!)

726
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,700
He has a mole under his eye.

727
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,240
(Is the mole under the eye
the mark of the evil spirits?)

728
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,210
He drew a mole under the eye.

729
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,840
Why?

730
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,870
He drew that mole.

731
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,480
(Slapping)

732
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,680
Was it the hidden mission?

733
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,380
What? I didn't draw it.
I didn't draw this mole.

734
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,280
I bet it was the hidden mission.
The King drew it.

735
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,920
(The person who drew the mole is...)

736
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
(the King.)

737
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,960
I am not an evil spirit.

738
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,760
Why would I have a mole
under my eye?

739
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,350
- See?
- That makes sense.

740
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,050
That's not true. I drew moles
on randomly chosen members.

741
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,430
(Taken aback)

742
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,200
- Your face is so red!
- Look at his face.

743
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,330
No. That's not true.

744
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,700
- He got caught.
- Trust me.

745
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,600
Hey, change your clothes.
Take that off now!

746
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,060
Listen. I'm telling you the truth.

747
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,180
- Why is your face so red?
- No. I was just taken aback.

748
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,330
I'm really not an evil spirit.

749
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,040
(He really is suspicious.)

750
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,950
- I know who the evil spirits are.
- By the way,

751
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,340
the King also has a mole
under his eye.

752
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,080
Do you think I would
make it that obvious?

753
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,780
- What was the hidden mission?
- Listen to me.

754
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,420
I would never do that.
I just stopped drawing moles.

755
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,580
What? Se Chan is crying.

756
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,660
- Hold on. I have...
- Trust me.

757
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,690
- Why would I do that?
- Se Chan, don't cry.

758
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,760
I think...

759
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,260
- I'm really not an evil spirit.
- Investigator Kim.

760
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,930
- I'm not. Trust me.
- Investigator Kim.

761
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,500
- I swear.
- Jong Kook, hold back for a while.

762
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,290
- Here he goes again.
- It's not the right time.

763
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,560
- I have things I want to say.
- Wait a little longer.

764
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,800
- But I can't.
- I'm sure he's an evil spirit.

765
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,530
He became the King
when he's an evil spirit.

766
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,450
- That's right.
- This is the true regency.

767
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,140
We had a similar mission before.

768
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,340
- Wait. Hey...
- They lured us into choosing...

769
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,870
- Eunuch Ha.
- Yes?

770
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,720
He became the King...

771
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,340
when he's also an evil spirit.

772
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,810
And you call this the true regency?
I don't think that's what it means.

773
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,120
That darn stupid regency.

774
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,320
Do you even know
what "regency" means?

775
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,050
(Chuckling)

776
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,590
That doesn't make sense.

777
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,770
(Laughing)

778
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,770
(Haha's mistake made
everyone laugh.)

779
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,940
- Let's drop it. It's a happy day.
- How many of us would know?

780
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
(Stroking)

781
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,070
(It's such a great day.)

782
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,410
Oh, boy.

783
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,180
- The Queen... The Queen...
- How many of us...

784
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,140
- The Queen is laughing hard too.
- Please...

785
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,720
- Leave her alone.
- I think she's fake laughing.

786
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,780
Isn't this funny, Your Highness?

787
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,850
What is your opinion, Your Highness?

788
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,810
I think... Since my...

789
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,780
My husband...

790
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,260
The King's face turned red.

791
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,550
- So I'm suspicious of him.
- His face did turn red.

792
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,270
- His face is still red.
- You're right.

793
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,560
I also suspect the King.

794
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,700
- What?
- He drew moles on two people.

795
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,970
- And his face turned red.
- You're corning me like this?

796
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,060
- "Corning"?
- "Corning"?

797
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,070
"Corning"?

798
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,510
You mean "cornering".

799
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,250
- It's not "corning".
- Just tell me one thing.

800
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,450
Why did you draw moles on our faces?

801
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,480
So Min drew a mole on my face.

802
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,280
So I thought it'd be funny
to draw a mole on everyone...

803
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,420
thinking of you all as my children.
While doing it...

804
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
I'm sorry.

805
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,350
- He stopped drawing it.
- Actually...

806
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,880
It's all because of Eunuch Kim.

807
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,030
I shall clear my name.

808
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,120
- I shall...
- Please don't.

809
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,760
prove that I'm not an evil spirit...

810
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,460
- Please calm down.
- I shall take my clothes off...

811
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,230
- Please calm down.
- to prove...

812
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,320
Please calm down.

813
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,770
Do not stop me!

814
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,330
- Please don't.
- Because of Eunuch Kim...

815
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,830
- Your Majesty, please calm down.
- I don't want to play this role.

816
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,940
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

817
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,330
Please explain so we can understand.

818
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,180
- For that petty thing...
- Unfortunately, there's no one...

819
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,950
who can torture that eunuch
in this country.

820
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,280
(No one in this country can
torture that eunuch.)

821
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,280
- This is unfair.
- No one can punish him.

822
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,350
My wish is to get a chance
to slap him in his butt.

823
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,350
I'm so upset.

824
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,160
Let's move on for now.

825
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,850
Since we're all confused,
how about we choose the opposite?

826
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,000
- What do you mean?
- I think it can be a solution.

827
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,970
How about we put Eunuch Lee
on trial?

828
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,970
(Let's put Eunuch Lee on trial!)

829
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,970
My gosh. This isn't right.

830
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,130
- I know you picked him...
- This isn't right.

831
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,210
- just for fun.
- When it's hard to decide...

832
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,980
I can't put him on trial
just because you think...

833
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,570
- it'll be funny.
- When it's hard to decide...

834
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,250
It's best to put him on trial,
Your Majesty.

835
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,340
Please do not play along with him.
He's just being playful now.

836
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,680
- Stop it.
- Then how about Eunuch Park?

837
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,040
He won't stop shivering.

838
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,310
- He's been shivering all day long.
- He's not an evil spirit.

839
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,780
- Right, Sung Hoon...
- We should wait for now.

840
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,720
By the way,
Sung Hoon really looks...

841
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,490
He does look so weak.

842
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,430
- Indeed.
- He looks so weak and fragile.

843
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,590
He was the first person
who lost it.

844
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,560
Did both evil spirits complete
their missions?

845
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,270
Both of them have a mission,

846
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,970
and both completed it successfully.

847
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,130
- Really?
- I see.

848
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,860
(Both of the evil spirits
completed their missions!)

849
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,440
- Let's talk!
- Here they are.

850
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,300
(From the opening
when everyone was watching...)

851
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,870
- This is ridiculous!
- What about me?

852
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,870
(And even in the bus where
they were all sitting together)

853
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,450
(They completed their missions
without letting the humans know.)

854
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,780
I'm sure they did something
on the bus.

855
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,580
- While we were talking on the bus?
- Think carefully.

856
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,230
(Who could be the evil spirits?)

857
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,760
I was sitting at the back, you know.

858
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,430
And I think Dong Yoon is
an evil spirit.

859
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,700
- What did he do?
- Dong Yoon...

860
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,440
- What did I do?
- hit Sae Rok in the head...

861
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,100
and joked around with her.

862
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,780
(Dong Yoon must've joked around
with her to complete the mission.)

863
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,040
- Dong Yoon...
- He must be an evil spirit.

864
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,570
kept joking around with her
like hitting her head.

865
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,220
- But...
- Hitting her head...

866
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,020
- we all do that on set.
- sounds too simple for a mission.

867
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,520
Dong Yoon?

868
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,490
Dong Yoon, you were given a role,
weren't you?

869
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,050
- No.
- That's funny.

870
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
No. I'm telling you the truth.

871
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,430
But he always does that to me.

872
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,160
- He always plays jokes...
- That means...

873
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,430
he has a crush on her.

874
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,120
(That means he has a crush on her!)

875
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,270
(What?)

876
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,030
- How dare you lay sight...
- Is that so?

877
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,330
on the Queen as a slave?

878
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,770
That means he has a crush on her.

879
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,860
- Is anyone out there?
- This is like a soap opera.

880
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,480
- Set in the Joseon Era.
- How dare he?

881
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
(The handsome slave who falls
in love with Airhead King's woman)

882
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,780
(The Joseon Dynasty Drama,
"The Queen and the Slave")

883
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,840
Are you in love with the Queen?

884
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,250
I heard that social status doesn't
matter in love.

885
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,720
(I heard that social status doesn't
matter in love.)

886
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,140
That little...

887
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,350
- You little...
- I think...

888
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,120
- I think I'll lose her to him.
- To be honest...

889
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,690
- I think I'll lose her to him.
- Your Majesty.

890
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,380
- I think I'll lose her to him.
- To be honest,

891
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,760
I think that Dong Yoon is
a better match for her.

892
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,360
How dare you?
I think I'll lose her to him.

893
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,440
Hold on. Then... Hey, Eunuch Lee.

894
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,830
(He suddenly spoke casually to him.)

895
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,860
"Hey, Eunuch Lee"?

896
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,240
- "Hey, Eunuch Lee"?
- That was funny.

897
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,410
Hey, Eunuch Ha. Why?

898
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,870
How are the eunuchs ranked?

899
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,480
- In the order of employment.
- Eunuch Kim is first in rank.

900
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,680
Eunuch Kim is first in rank.

901
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,450
- I'm the head eunuch.
- I see.

902
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,310
Did you see Dong Yoon do it?

903
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,720
- Do what?
- What do you mean?

904
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,310
Why would you speak casually to me?

905
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,190
- Aren't we in the same rank?
- He has seniority over you.

906
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,160
- We're not in the same rank.
- You rude punk!

907
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,960
- Hey, he's your senior.
- They were hired at the same time.

908
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,580
- How dare you?
- Even though we're eunuchs...

909
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,460
- I didn't realize it.
- who don't have it...

910
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,460
I thought we were in the same rank.

911
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,270
Let's have Sung Hoon
slap him in the butt.

912
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,320
- I didn't know.
- Lie down.

913
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,590
It wasn't like that.

914
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,970
- I have seniority over Sung Hoon.
- I won't let this slide.

915
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,970
But...

916
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,130
- The youngest always does this.
- Prove you're not weak.

917
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,510
- Show us.
- But I didn't...

918
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,140
- That was so weak.
- But I didn't...

919
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,780
(Did he really hit me?)

920
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,610
That was so weak.

921
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,450
- Sung Hoon, your hand must hurt.
- It doesn't hurt at all.

922
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,690
That was so weak.

923
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,280
- I hit him as hard as I could.
- Come back to your seat.

924
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,550
- He's so weak.
- What was that?

925
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,120
He's so peculiar.

926
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,850
- It didn't hurt at all.
- Even though we're eunuchs...

927
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,430
Didn't Dong Jun do
anything suspicious?

928
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,460
- Dong Jun?
- I'm not an evil spirit.

929
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,700
Dong Jun came on Running Man
many times before.

930
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,130
He seems quieter than the last time
he came on the show.

931
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,440
- You see...
- He's been too quiet.

932
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,770
It'd be easier for him to play
an evil spirit.

933
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,130
When we were on the bus,
Dong Jun...

934
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,600
- held my hand like this.
- No way.

935
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,710
- Really?
- Did he really do that?

936
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,680
- So...
- That's because he pitied you.

937
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,950
- I did it out of pity.
- He just felt sorry for you.

938
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,040
- Out of pity?
- Yes.

939
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,380
But men rarely hold...

940
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,220
- another man's hand.
- True.

941
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,110
- I like Kwang Soo.
- Isn't it odd?

942
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,050
(It's hard to read Dong Jun's face.)

943
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,960
(While they were on the bus,)

944
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,060
(Dong Jun suddenly held
Kwang Soo's hand.)

945
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,590
(Could that be the hidden mission?)

946
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,740
No, that's not why did it.

947
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,330
It's hard to tell if Dong Jun
and Dong Yoon are evil spirits.

948
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,470
I'm suspicious of Dong Yoon
and Sung Hoon.

949
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,570
- Dong Jun is suspicious too.
- I think...

950
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,780
You see, the Queen
may also be one of the evil spirits.

951
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,140
- Don't you think?
- Right. She may be one of them.

952
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,040
- That's possible.
- If you think about it...

953
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Could it be Sae Rok?

954
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
That's so random.

955
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,580
Now that we know about the hidden
missions, it'll get harder for them.

956
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,050
Anyway, we'll put the person...

957
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,420
- that Mr. Yang chooses on trial.
- Correct.

958
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,160
- Your Majesty, tell us...
- I will...

959
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,580
- who you think it is.
- I'm sorry,

960
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,890
- but did you call him "Mr. Yang"?
- The most suspicious person.

961
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,270
Was that a hidden mission?

962
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,360
(Why did he suddenly call Se Chan
"Mr. Yang"?)

963
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,770
- "Mr. Yang"?
- You called him "Mr. Yang".

964
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,090
I was just being polite.

965
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,130
Do you want me to speak in a girl's
voice because I'm a eunuch?

966
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,360
(Do you want me to speak in a girl's
voice because I'm a eunuch?)

967
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,440
(The sorrow of a eunuch's life
without such ordinary freedom)

968
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,070
- That's not how you address a king.
- I was just being polite.

969
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,340
- That's not appropriate.
- I just addressed him respectfully.

970
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,380
- It's time to make a decision.
- Okay.

971
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,450
Your Majesty.

972
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,190
Gosh. This is so complicated.

973
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,080
I think that one of the evil spirits
is among our members,

974
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,760
and the other is among the guests.

975
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,160
You have to choose just one.

976
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,430
Will you choose
one of the members?

977
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,460
By the way,
why is So Min so quiet today?

978
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,820
Exactly. She's been too quiet too.

979
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,030
- So Min?
- She's holding the dried gourd...

980
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,060
I find it suspicious
that she drew a mole on my face.

981
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,330
- Gosh, I'm not an evil spirit.
- Could drawing on it...

982
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,670
- Hold on a second!
- Gosh, I'm not an evil spirit.

983
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,510
(Could that be her mission?)

984
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,780
Could drawing on it...

985
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,480
- be her...
- Is that her mission?

986
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,680
- Is that her mission?
- No. I drew it for no reason.

987
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,800
Hold on a second!

988
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,580
So Min drew a mole
on the King's face.

989
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,280
- Gosh.
- On the King's face.

990
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,380
(So Min drew a mole
on the King's face.)

991
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,380
- This is driving me nuts.
- Vice-premier Song...

992
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,660
She drew a mole on the King's face.

993
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,280
I'm really not an evil spirit.

994
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,120
- What?
- Was that your mission?

995
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,360
You drew a mole on my face
and drew my face on the dried gourd?

996
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,930
- That's suspicious.
- Try to remember.

997
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,590
Try to remember when I drew a mole
on your face, Your Majesty.

998
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,470
Jae Suk and Jong Kook were...

999
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,560
See? She keeps making excuses
without denying it.

1000
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,440
- You can put me on trial, but...
- Exactly. If she's not,

1001
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,600
she wouldn't mind going on trial.

1002
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,870
- That's right.
- I mean, why do I always...

1003
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,480
She became so talkative suddenly.

1004
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,220
Jong Kook always
eliminates me first.

1005
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,880
Premier Yu, I've made my decision.

1006
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,920
- Please tell us your decision.
- I'm not one of the evil spirits.

1007
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,260
You know that I don't talk much
when we have male guests, right?

1008
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,260
I shall...

1009
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,930
put Jeon So Min on trial.

1010
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,460
- Gosh.
- I don't think so.

1011
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,470
(I shall put Jeon So Min on trial.)

1012
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
- I'm not an evil spirit.
- We can break our dried gourd.

1013
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,790
I said I'm not!

1014
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,860
It hurts.

1015
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,360
She even smashed the face
of the child she cares about.

1016
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,480
- It isn't me.
- I don't think it's her either.

1017
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,100
- Then...
- I don't think so.

1018
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,640
The King made his decision.

1019
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,980
It really isn't me.

1020
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,110
I'm sorry but...

1021
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,070
- You know me, right?
- It can't be.

1022
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,580
Guys, please.
The mission was completed...

1023
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,380
on the bus
where I hardly did anything.

1024
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,920
Have a seat for now.

1025
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,930
If he's right though,
that means he's an evil spirit too.

1026
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,850
If he's right,
he'll be taken off the hook.

1027
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,620
- It's not me.
- It's not her.

1028
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,120
- I doubt it's her.
- Then...

1029
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,590
I'll reveal the result
of the first trial.

1030
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,440
If So Min is an evil spirit,

1031
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,670
she'll drink all of
the sophora root tea...

1032
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,770
and stay as a slave forever.

1033
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,510
That's bitter, you know.
The bitter flavor will linger.

1034
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,780
Then...

1035
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,710
- I don't think it's her.
- So Min...

1036
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,450
- Is she an evil spirit?
- She isn't.

1037
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,140
(Is So Min an evil spirit?)

1038
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,310
Is she an evil spirit?

1039
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,280
- She isn't.
- See? What did I tell you?

1040
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:54,000
(They failed to find the evil spirit
in the first trial.)

1041
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,760
- What?
- See?

1042
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,890
It isn't me.

1043
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,290
Since you accused
an innocent person,

1044
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,770
the evil spirits
will steal the rice...

1045
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,630
from the person they choose.

1046
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,440
Please put on the blindfolds
in front of you.

1047
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,130
After taking their blindfolds off,

1048
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,600
the evil spirits will choose
the person they will steal from.

1049
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,010
I said it wasn't me.

1050
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,580
- Why did you end up choosing me?
- The majority ruled.

1051
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,490
The King made up his mind
quite fast if you ask me.

1052
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,080
- I'm suspicious of him.
- It's not me.

1053
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,490
His actions were questionable.

1054
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,010
All right.

1055
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,760
The evil spirits will
take off the blindfolds...

1056
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,220
and choose a person.

1057
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,350
(The evil spirits will now
steal from one of the people.)

1058
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,370
(That's when...)

1059
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,240
(Dong Yoon takes off his blindfold.)

1060
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,910
(That means...)

1061
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,600
(Earlier, Dong Yoon entered
an empty room alone.)

1062
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,350
What's this?

1063
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,870
Did someone leave this behind?

1064
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,010
(His curiosity gets the best of him,
so he opens the pot.)

1065
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,740
(At the very moment...)

1066
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,990
(The energy of the evil spirit
gets sucked into Dong Yoon.)

1067
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,200
(That's how Dong Yoon
became an evil spirit.)

1068
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,330
Am I at Joseon's palace?

1069
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,160
Let's have some fun then.

1070
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,640
(Let's have some fun then.)

1071
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,540
(Glancing)

1072
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,280
What else am I supposed to say?

1073
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,740
Are you serious?

1074
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,950
Do you do things like this
on Running Man?

1075
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,470
(He overcomes the silly lines and
enters the Running Man Universe.)

1076
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,310
You're joining us today on
the Records of the Running Dynasty.

1077
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,040
You two are the evil spirits
living among humans.

1078
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,220
Evil spirits?

1079
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:30,720
While keeping
your identities a secret,

1080
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,060
you must complete hidden missions.

1081
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,620
Every time you fail your missions,

1082
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,760
a letter from your name
will be revealed.

1083
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,030
For your first mission,

1084
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,640
you'll be making three hearts...

1085
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,390
- at the camera.
- Hearts?

1086
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,930
One must do so
during the opening scene...

1087
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,310
while the other does so on the bus.

1088
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,140
Must the both of us succeed?

1089
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,010
(The humans open the show
unaware of the situation.)

1090
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,620
(While everyone is focused
on the King's power...)

1091
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,240
(He succeeds in making
his first heart.)

1092
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,890
(While the others were busy
with their statuses...)

1093
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,990
(He easily makes his second heart.)

1094
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,450
(While the others were focused
on Se Chan being the King)

1095
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,620
(He was bold enough
to make two hearts in the end.)

1096
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,490
(Dong Yoon was able
to carry out his mission.)

1097
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,430
Choose a person.

1098
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,060
(The two evil spirits
even survived the trial.)

1099
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,780
(The evil spirits chose the person
they will steal the rice from.)

1100
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,310
Please put your blindfolds back on.

1101
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,240
(Whose rice was stolen
by the evil spirits?)

1102
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,350
- You can take them off.
- Can we?

1103
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,640
Wait, it's already done?

1104
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,010
All right.

1105
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,620
- Who are they?
- The evil spirits...

1106
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,160
The human
chosen by the evil spirits...

1107
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,950
was Jae Suk.

1108
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,620
All your rice...

1109
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,060
now has been split
between the evil spirits.

1110
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,260
- Then he's not an evil spirit.
- No, not Jae Suk.

1111
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,100
Wait. You never know.

1112
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,510
Yes, it could be a trick.

1113
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,970
- To not be suspected.
- Exactly.

1114
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,910
It could've been done on purpose.

1115
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,010
- He could've chosen himself.
- Of course.

1116
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,240
That's possible.

1117
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,010
Before we begin the first game,

1118
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,540
the King...

1119
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,310
can swap the status of two people.

1120
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,580
Your Majesty!

1121
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,180
Your Majesty!

1122
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,290
I will be by your side
with a gyeonmajiro attitude.

1123
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,530
Gyeonmajiro?

1124
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,890
That's a nice attitude to have.

1125
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,560
(Laughing)

1126
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,620
Gyeonmajiro?

1127
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,830
Gyeonmajiro...

1128
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,060
I too will have
a gyeonmajiro attitude.

1129
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,490
To make it fun for me...

1130
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,160
(Glancing)

1131
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,640
It'll be fun...

1132
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,040
to see the Premier swap places
with Eunuch Lee.

1133
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,180
Okay!

1134
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,080
(A change in rank)

1135
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,950
Swap places.

1136
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,350
(Airhead King appoints people
just for his own amusement.)

1137
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,410
Swap places.

1138
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,810
Get going.

1139
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,810
(Jae Suk goes from Premier
to a eunuch.)

1140
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,450
- I need a mustache.
- A mustache?

1141
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,760
Let me give him a beating first.

1142
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,830
Sure thing.

1143
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,120
The Premier can do what he wants.

1144
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,120
Get down on the ground.

1145
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,600
Do as you please.

1146
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,990
This is for being cheeky earlier!

1147
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,490
Take that.

1148
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,790
It serves you right.

1149
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,330
Do as you wish Premier Lee.

1150
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,430
- Darn it! This is so humiliating.
- Hey.

1151
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,740
You're the lowest in rank among us.

1152
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,780
(You're the lowest in rank
among us.)

1153
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:07,410
(Their ranks are decided based
on who first became a eunuch.)

1154
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,370
Kiddo, can you clean this up?

1155
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,810
Kiddo, clean this up.

1156
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,160
- Unbelievable.
- Clean this up.

1157
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,760
You can let one more person
trade ranks.

1158
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,890
Unbelievable.

1159
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,680
- I want to be Vice-premier.
- I wish to be Vice-premier.

1160
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,030
Your Majesty, I wish to be a queen.

1161
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,330
- The Vice-premier...
- How dare you!

1162
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,700
Your Majesty.

1163
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,490
(Who will be blessed the King?)

1164
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,240
You sure are pretty.

1165
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,140
You sure are pretty.

1166
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,470
(You sure are pretty.)

1167
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,140
That's out of the blue.

1168
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,640
- This is utter nonsense.
- Who do you think is pretty?

1169
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,470
This just doesn't make any sense!

1170
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,240
Are you kidding me?

1171
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,910
Seriously?

1172
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,760
No one has ever said
that to me before.

1173
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,580
There wasn't even any build-up.

1174
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,120
- What...
- I mean...

1175
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,720
Unbelievable.

1176
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,330
Gosh.

1177
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,930
- You must've flirted with him.
- How pretty.

1178
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,660
You can be my queen.

1179
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,040
(Me?)

1180
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,560
You will now be a slave.

1181
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,200
(Slave Ji turns his life around
by becoming Queen.)

1182
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,370
- Slave Ji.
- This isn't bad.

1183
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,810
- It's not bad.
- A rise in status.

1184
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,540
- He's been blessed by the King.
- Sae Rok's a slave now.

1185
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,510
- Sae Rok...
- Goodness.

1186
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,780
This is upsetting.

1187
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,410
"You sure are pretty" was hilarious.

1188
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,680
- Goodness.
- Suddenly?

1189
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,790
He needed a reason,

1190
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,120
so he went and said
"You sure are pretty."

1191
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,950
Suk Jin seemed
embarrassed by that statement.

1192
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,160
Higher.

1193
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,350
(Slap!)

1194
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,060
Right? The Queen
is of a higher status.

1195
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,100
(Queen Ji shows his true colors.)

1196
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,470
How dare you lay your hands
on the Queen?

1197
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,660
You shouldn't.

1198
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,290
Can a queen have such a husky voice?

1199
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,240
You. You're awfully quiet.

1200
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,700
Weren't you up here
just a moment ago?

1201
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,780
Close your mouth.

1202
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,470
Close your mouth!

1203
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,600
I told you to close your mouth.

1204
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,720
Yes, Your Highness.

1205
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,410
Close your mouth!

1206
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,540
(What an insult.)

1207
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,580
- Gosh.
- you.

1208
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,950
- You know I like you, right?
- Thank you.

1209
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,660
He suddenly got to be a queen.

1210
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,720
(The 1st trial ends with
the Airhead King's appointments.)

1211
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,850
I sure am pretty.

1212
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,430
So pretty.

1213
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,350
(Se Chan's people change locations.)

1214
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,220
No, don't do this.

1215
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,890
You're giving me the creeps.

1216
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,830
- Don't do this.
- Honey!

1217
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,100
In the first game,

1218
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,700
you'll be explaining words
in the format of old poems.

1219
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,640
This is Syllable Count Poem.

1220
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,970
- That sounds difficult.
- Just the sound of it...

1221
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,780
Each team will take turns.

1222
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,580
The three explaining the word...

1223
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,140
will do so
by keeping the syllable count...

1224
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,010
- of 4, 3, and 4.
- No way.

1225
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,760
- 4, 3, and 4 syllables.
- Like a poem.

1226
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,220
Sounds like fun.

1227
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,700
- 4, 3, and 4 syllables.
- 4, 3, and 4.

1228
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,290
Each team will get three words
to explain.

1229
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,720
Once the game is over,
you'll be able to scoop up rice...

1230
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,140
and the amount will depend
on how well you do in the game.

1231
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,510
- Let's do this.
- You're all good with words.

1232
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,780
- Team Eunuch.
- Let's go!

1233
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,740
Let's have some fun.

1234
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,810
1, 2, 3.

1235
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,640
(Let's party!)

1236
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,310
Let's have some fun.

1237
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,370
Go, go!

1238
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,720
Let's do this.

1239
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Here we go.

1240
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,950
Give them the word.

1241
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,890
(Starting with Eunuch Yu, which
word must they explain first?)

1242
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,950
(Playing the field)

1243
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,120
(He must start off
with 4 syllables.)

1244
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,850
You can do this. I believe in you.

1245
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:12,330
- Of course.
- I believe in you.

1246
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,540
- "Of course." Are you done?
- "Of course."

1247
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,790
- He said his.
- No way.

1248
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,200
- "Of course."
- Just let him have that.

1249
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,410
- But he said it.
- "Of course."

1250
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,200
- "Of course."
- Seriously?

1251
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,640
(Sung Hoon must explain
in just three syllables.)

1252
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,780
(Groaning)

1253
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,450
(He suddenly lets out
an elegant grunt.)

1254
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,640
(The modern-day concept
is hard to explain.)

1255
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,810
What's with his pose?

1256
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,160
- Go ahead.
- What's wrong?

1257
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,890
We got off to a bad start.

1258
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,950
Prior.

1259
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,990
(Playing the field:
Of course, Prior)

1260
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,290
- Will they, won't they?
- Playing the field!

1261
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,060
- Nice!
- Are you kidding me?

1262
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,540
(Thanks to Jong Kook's wit,
they get the first one right.)

1263
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,830
I already knew
when Sung Hoon said his word.

1264
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,240
- I can't believe it.
- What a relief.

1265
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,680
Okay, nice one.

1266
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,930
This...

1267
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,510
(The next word
is trickier to explain.)

1268
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,780
(A sitz bath)

1269
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,220
While seated.

1270
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,290
(A sitz bath: While seated)

1271
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,810
(Sighing)

1272
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,560
- He needs to say a good one.
- While seated.

1273
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,290
It's not an easy one.

1274
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,220
Warm.

1275
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,530
(A sitz bath: While seated, Warm)

1276
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,120
While seated and warm.

1277
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,850
(A sitz bath: While seated, Warm)

1278
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:17,990
Anus bath.

1279
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,140
(A sitz bath is a bath
for the anus.)

1280
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,100
- Nice one.
- Nice.

1281
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,410
(The immature wording
gets Jong Kook the answer.)

1282
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,410
- A sitz bath.
- Nice!

1283
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,310
- I already knew what it was.
- Nicely done!

1284
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,970
I told you to just
make sense, right?

1285
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,040
Haha was right to say it.

1286
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,640
- Can one say that?
- If not,

1287
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,010
it could've been lower-body bathing.

1288
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,080
I have to give them credit for that.

1289
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,180
I knew it was a sitz bath though.

1290
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,680
Nicely done.

1291
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,850
You're getting the hang of it.

1292
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,120
- Nice!
- It's perfect.

1293
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,720
Nice!

1294
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,310
(Nolboo)

1295
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,830
With Heungboo.

1296
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,660
(Nolboo: With Heungboo)

1297
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,990
With Heungboo.

1298
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,220
They're brothers.

1299
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,060
They're brothers.

1300
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,970
Budaejjigae.

1301
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,260
Budaejjigae.

1302
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,010
Nice one!

1303
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,010
Nice one!

1304
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,010
Nice.

1305
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,010
Nolboo.

1306
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,970
(Team Eunuch got
all three questions correct.)

1307
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,740
- Nice.
- Team Eunuch got all three right.

1308
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,140
That was funny.

1309
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,580
- All right! Let's go.
- Let's do it well.

1310
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,580
So Min is the oldest on her team.

1311
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,560
I'm the leader.
I'm the leader, you guys.

1312
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,410
- Get ready.
- This is great.

1313
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,180
- Here we go.
- I'll do my best.

1314
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,930
You guys look fresh!

1315
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,350
Get ready, set, go!

1316
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,470
(The first word is "eunuch".)

1317
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,040
Those guys...

1318
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,390
(Eunuch)

1319
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,470
"Those guys"?

1320
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,370
Refers to. It refers to those guys.

1321
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,470
- Why would you say "refers to"?
- I know you can...

1322
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:38,970
(The last player makes a complaint.)

1323
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,700
- I know you can wrap it up!
- Why would you be so serious?

1324
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,640
Why would you be so serious?

1325
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,120
- She put on a straight face.
- Don't be so serious.

1326
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,950
- You blew your chance.
- "Refers to".

1327
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,620
Come on!

1328
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,990
You should've said
a four-letter word instead!

1329
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,950
Maybe she's an evil spirit.
Maybe this is her mission.

1330
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:53,990
It is eunuch.

1331
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,660
Sae Rok is doing a good job!

1332
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,990
(Pork cutlet)

1333
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,260
Swings.

1334
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,260
- That's a good approach.
- That's a good one.

1335
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,060
Lined up.

1336
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,470
To sell this food.

1337
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,010
I don't know what that is.

1338
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,410
- You know the food he likes!
- She doesn't know this?

1339
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,600
She's behind in trend.

1340
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,970
- It's...
- So Min is old-fashioned!

1341
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,970
Maybe she got it wrong on purpose.
Oh, she's not an evil spirit.

1342
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:13,970
Seriously, this guy...

1343
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,010
- I can't do this.
- I know you're not it.

1344
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,120
- I know you're not it. Sit down.
- Come on.

1345
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,910
So Min is not an evil spirit.

1346
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,790
- You got it wrong on purpose, no?
- They said she's not it.

1347
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,910
- You're an evil spirit, aren't you?
- I'm not!

1348
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,290
- Aren't you an evil spirit?
- Hey.

1349
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,430
- Why are you so bad at this?
- So Min.

1350
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,450
Can the evil spirit
leave her body for a second?

1351
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,700
Can it leave and go back in?

1352
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,790
It's pork cutlet.

1353
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,260
- I didn't know that.
- Hey.

1354
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,200
- Hey.
- She's only interested in love.

1355
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,430
Kim Jong Kook and Haha's...

1356
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:40,370
- Right! You should've said that.
- Then she'd have gotten it right.

1357
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,640
(He apologizes right away
for his poor writing skill.)

1358
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,910
I'd have gotten it right.

1359
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,180
She'd have said the answer
right away.

1360
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,540
- Of course.
- She'd have figured it out fast.

1361
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,540
Their pork cutlet is the best.

1362
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:48,950
I'll send you some.

1363
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,510
So Team Slave
got all three questions wrong.

1364
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,310
They did well,
but I couldn't get it right.

1365
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,910
(Disappointed,
but they accept the result.)

1366
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:55,910
Well done.

1367
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,450
What's our score?

1368
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,950
(Right then)

1369
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,990
(Evil Spirit Dong Yoon
cuts across the set...)

1370
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,060
(and heads to the back.)

1371
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,200
Well done.

1372
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Good job.

1373
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,290
Well done.

1374
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,870
- That was close.
- Only if they got one right.

1375
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,490
- Well done.
- Okay.

1376
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,810
- Well done.
- You did well too.

1377
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,870
As a result,
Team Eunuch is in first place.

1378
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,140
(Why did Dong Yoon go around
and tell them they did well?)

1379
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,200
(Before the shoot)

1380
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,680
Here's the hidden mission
the evil spirits need to accomplish.

1381
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:25,740
The second mission is to touch
the name tags of everyone.

1382
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,910
Touching their name tags?

1383
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:30,120
- You can divide the mission.
- We can do it together?

1384
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,450
Got it.

1385
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,850
(They received the hidden mission
to touch everyone's name tags.)

1386
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,100
(From then, they looked for
every chance they could get...)

1387
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,970
(to touch everyone's name tag.)

1388
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,260
Well done.

1389
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,970
(He managed to touch most of their
name tags before the mission ended.)

1390
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,970
(Who is the other spirit
that touched the name tags?)

1391
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,140
We did it.

1392
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,370
Now it's time to take the rice
according to the ranking.

1393
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,120
The 1st place team
can scoop 3 times.

1394
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,010
The 2nd place team
can scoop 2 times.

1395
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,160
And the 3rd place team
can scoop 1 time.

1396
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,790
Move the rice to your pot.

1397
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:03,790
We never know.

1398
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,560
All right.

1399
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,430
- It goes deep.
- He can scoop out a lot.

1400
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,990
Wow, Kwang Soo is taking
a lot at once.

1401
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,160
You scooped out a lot.

1402
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,160
(Taking a full bowl of rice)

1403
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,760
He filled the entire bowl.

1404
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,160
- That's amazing.
- You're amazing.

1405
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,660
That's as much as
a bowl and a half.

1406
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:20,060
(Pouring the whole bowl
into his pot securely)

1407
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,330
- He got the most rice.
- Let's give it up for him.

1408
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:22,330
There's a lot!

1409
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,810
(His great performance
calls for a round of applause.)

1410
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,350
Wait a minute.
What's this, Kwang Soo?

1411
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,680
No one interrupted him too.

1412
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,970
There's another name tag
on top of his.

1413
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,310
He poured the rice
into Jae Suk's pot.

1414
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,180
(Changing the pot)

1415
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,010
(He donated the rice
to someone else's pot.)

1416
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,060
Is this for real?

1417
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,060
(The owner of the pot magically
changes in an instant.)

1418
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,220
(While Kwang Soo is scooping out
the rice,)

1419
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,430
(Jae Suk put his name tag
on Kwang Soo's.)

1420
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,660
It's like "The Usual Suspects".

1421
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,220
He peeled off Kwang Soo's tag
and his name was there.

1422
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,760
Kwang Soo must really like Jae Suk.

1423
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,330
And the 3rd place team can scoop
1 time. Move the rice to your pot.

1424
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,240
The 1st place team
can scoop 3 times.

1425
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,010
There's a limit to how much
I can scoop.

1426
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,870
Let's move on to the second trial.

1427
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:59,240
Let's go!

1428
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,870
Let's go.

1429
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,370
(Will they be able to find
the evil spirits this time?)

1430
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,140
My seat is right next to the King's.

1431
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,010
(The people of Running Dynasty
gather in the court.)

1432
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,410
That means someone
pulled off the hidden mission.

1433
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:09,450
(Evil Spirit Dong Yoon seems excited
to have finished all the missions.)

1434
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,680
It was really hard to play the game
and look for the evil spirits.

1435
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,830
- But I've never looked for them.
- You looked for them?

1436
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,290
We can just depend on Jong Kook.

1437
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,100
- But when he does observe,
- I observed everyone.

1438
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,260
we tend not to.

1439
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,490
I'm sure I've found one this time.

1440
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:22,640
- You did?
- Hey.

1441
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,970
(He's sure that he's found
an evil spirit?)

1442
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,930
(Dong Yoon gets nervous as Jae Suk
is sure to have found one.)

1443
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,510
I have a few suspicions,

1444
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,850
but let's see
what they have in common.

1445
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,950
We're reassured
since we have a detective.

1446
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:38,220
We need to catch one this time.

1447
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,140
We must catch one.

1448
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,450
I'll switch your status.

1449
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,390
- During the mission...
- It's all up to him.

1450
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,330
- The eunuch here...
- I think he wants to say something.

1451
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:46,580
- Eunuch Kim seems to have...
- The youngest eunuch.

1452
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,660
observed everyone thoroughly.

1453
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,100
- Eunuch Yu, our youngest...
- Eunuch Yu,

1454
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,930
- go ahead and speak.
- He made a mistake this time.

1455
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,560
(An evil spirit made a mistake?)

1456
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,600
What kind of mistake?

1457
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,060
- Let's hear him out.
- Let's hear about it.

1458
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,040
(A mistake?)

1459
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:06,740
I think the hidden mission was to
touch our name tags.

1460
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,040
Name tags?

1461
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,410
(Jae Suk figured out the
hidden mission of the evil spirits?)

1462
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,640
Toward the end... Do you remember?

1463
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,350
After Team Slave was done
playing the game,

1464
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:18,390
Dong Yoon...

1465
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,280
Who sat next to me?

1466
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,640
- He touched my name tag too.
- He touched our name tags.

1467
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,240
(While Dong Yoon was doing
the hidden mission,)

1468
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,120
(they got suspicious
of his behavior.)

1469
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,660
"Well done."

1470
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,390
- That's right!
- That's right!

1471
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,390
(They agree with the claim
Jae Suk is asserting.)

1472
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,430
- Let me tell you the reason.
- Yes.

1473
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,120
I can explain.

1474
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,620
- Go ahead then.
- All right.

1475
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,290
Let me explain.
I only touched their shoulders.

1476
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,060
- You only touched their shoulders?
- Yes.

1477
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,200
If you can't explain yourself well,

1478
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,910
- you'll have to be tried.
- That's right.

1479
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,370
We must have him tried.

1480
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:09,640
Yes, we must. I'm sure it's him.

1481
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,100
- I'm telling you, it's not me.
- Then this must be what happened.

1482
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,810
Then why didn't you touch
my name tag?

1483
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,180
- I know.
- Don't be too disappointed.

1484
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,580
But he didn't touch my name tag.

1485
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,350
You could've not felt it.

1486
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,350
(That's what happened.)

1487
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,350
(Is that so?)

1488
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,620
Let me explain.

1489
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,850
It must be hard
to touch everyone's name tag though.

1490
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,200
- Go ahead then.
- It must be hard.

1491
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,120
First of all, I did not
touch everyone's name tag.

1492
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,390
Then the mission must be
to touch only a few.

1493
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,390
- No, that's not true.
- Maybe you had to touch three.

1494
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,470
It's my habit to encourage people
while grabbing their shoulders.

1495
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,410
- But he's never done that before.
- He's never done it?

1496
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,970
- No, it's just that...
- He's never done it before.

1497
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,950
- You only skipped out on me?
- It's not that.

1498
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,640
Why would everyone get so sullen?

1499
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,140
- We're here to investigate.
- Their friendship is damaged.

1500
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,970
Maybe he was told to touch
only the male members.

1501
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,080
But you need to remember this.

1502
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,080
If Dong Yoon isn't the evil spirit,

1503
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,850
we need to catch two at once
in the next trial.

1504
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,390
We need to catch one now.

1505
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,490
I told you, I'm sure about this.

1506
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,350
But what if Dong Yoon
is not an evil spirit?

1507
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:02,290
- We need to catch one now.
- Let me tell you one more thing.

1508
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,370
- Here's one more.
- We'll hear you out.

1509
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,390
But...

1510
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,140
Dong Yoon was playing the game
on this side, right?

1511
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,370
Yes, he was on that side.

1512
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,040
He went around the room...

1513
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,970
and came behind us
to tell us we did well.

1514
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,510
He didn't have to
go around the room.

1515
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,780
- He didn't have to.
- That's right.

1516
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,700
- He could've just said it there.
- No, that's not true.

1517
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,870
So that's what happened.

1518
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,010
I told you it's him.

1519
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,010
(It must be him.)

1520
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,350
You must've been in a hurry.

1521
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,740
Why did he go around the room?

1522
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,740
(Now everyone is sure
that Dong Yoon is the evil spirit.)

1523
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,720
- We're now sure that it's him.
- You got the wrong guy.

1524
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,720
Why did he go around the room?

1525
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,450
Why did you do that?
Tell us your reason.

1526
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,220
- Well, that's...
- You didn't touch So Min's.

1527
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,720
- Why did you touch everyone else's?
- Are you usually that affectionate?

1528
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,930
He didn't touch mine.

1529
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,700
I'm usually affectionate toward...

1530
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,240
- If you can't explain yourself...
- Okay, you can put me on trial.

1531
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,200
(You can put me on trial.)

1532
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,870
You can, but I'm telling you,
it's not me.

1533
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:44,970
Toward the end...

1534
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,370
Seeing how confident he is,
it feels like we got the wrong guy.

1535
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,010
Isn't it much easier to catch
an evil spirit...

1536
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,540
once they get someone wrong?

1537
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,450
Did you hear what he just said?

1538
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,390
Then you can... Even if I'm tried,

1539
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,640
- it's my loss.
- Since we're confused,

1540
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,790
let's just put Kwang Soo on trial.

1541
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,620
(When you're confused,
just pick Kwang Soo.)

1542
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,220
(He's always suspected
when they're not sure.)

1543
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,350
Do you want to get a beating?

1544
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,350
(Do you want to get a beating?)

1545
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,530
Do you want to get a beating again?

1546
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,330
(His threat is not scary at all.)

1547
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,220
When we're confused,
just pick Kwang Soo.

1548
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,490
(They will save that option
for now.)

1549
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:13,700
Please make your decision.

1550
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,330
- All right, then.
- Let's just stick to Dong Yoon.

1551
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,370
- Your Majesty.
- If everyone agrees,

1552
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,640
- Let's just pick him.
- I'll pick him then.

1553
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,010
- Your Majesty.
- Let's go with him.

1554
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,180
- We should try him.
- All right.

1555
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,870
- Even in the first game...
- I'll put Dong Yoon on trial.

1556
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,350
- But he seems so confident though.
- I know.

1557
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,810
- I don't think it's him.
- Your Majesty, it is him.

1558
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,470
- We could be wrong.
- How dare you?

1559
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:33,410
Then who's the other person
that touched the name tags?

1560
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,760
- There must be another one.
- This is crazy.

1561
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,080
I didn't touch everyone's name tag.

1562
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,720
Let's just see if he's the one.

1563
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,790
- Okay.
- All right.

1564
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,060
All right. Dong Yoon is...

1565
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,490
(Dong Yoon is...)

1566
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:45,490
the evil spirit.

1567
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,290
He is the evil spirit!

1568
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:51,240
(They managed to catch Dong Yoon
only after two trials.)

1569
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,870
- I will... I will...
- Your Majesty.

1570
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,700
- think...
- We managed to catch him.

1571
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,740
very highly of you.

1572
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,010
We managed to catch him!

1573
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,410
You evil spirit!

1574
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,080
- I am going to...
- You wicked evil spirit!

1575
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,350
How dare you touch our name tags?

1576
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,990
(Evil Spirit Dong Yoon drinks up
the sophora root tea.)

1577
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,160
- Gosh, this is really bitter.
- That's enough.

1578
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,260
Is it good for my health?

1579
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,330
- Okay.
- Of course.

1580
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,850
- Then...
- We caught him.

1581
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,200
Don't finish it. It's really bitter.

1582
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:20,290
He acted so well until the end.

1583
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,430
(She quietly runs away.)

1584
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,510
- Why did you leave quietly?
- What?

1585
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,410
What do you think you're doing?

1586
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,410
- Nothing.
- What was that all about?

1587
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,410
What?

1588
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,310
- She gave...
- So Min.

1589
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,970
Have you ever brought us candy...

1590
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,350
- when we drank something bitter?
- I know!

1591
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,410
- Is today Valentine's Day?
- What was that all about?

1592
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,010
- You just gave him candy?
- Valentine's Day?

1593
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,620
Why did you do that
when we caught an evil spirit?

1594
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,720
Because it's bitter.

1595
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,260
What was that?
You're an evil spirit, aren't you?

1596
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,290
(What was that?
You're an evil spirit, aren't you?)

1597
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,430
No! They said I'm not!

1598
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,930
- You see?
- Okay.

1599
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,790
If we didn't try her earlier,
we'd have kept suspecting her.

1600
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,390
- Of course.
- I know.

1601
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:53,870
Look what she just did.

1602
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,970
- We did a good job.
- We really did.

1603
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,240
That was a great choice.

1604
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,140
Now it's time to change your status.

1605
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,410
(Time for King Se Chan's
personnel reshuffle)

1606
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:03,640
Obviously,

1607
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,140
Eunuch Kim and Eunuch Yu
did a wonderful job.

1608
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,410
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1609
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,080
But I was offended...

1610
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,640
by Premier Lee.

1611
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,180
Me? Why?

1612
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,080
- What did I do?
- If I do not know the answer,

1613
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,890
you are supposed to butter me up
and tell me the answer.

1614
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,790
How dare you keep your mouth shut?

1615
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,390
But I...

1616
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:22,430
Your Majesty, I am all ready.

1617
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,490
- Your Majesty.
- I'll switch Premier Lee...

1618
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,490
I'll give you my rice.

1619
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,060
- You're speaking informally to him?
- I'll give you my rice.

1620
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,510
And before the next mission starts,

1621
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,700
I'll wire you some cash.

1622
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,870
Cash?

1623
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,180
Your eyes tell me
that you are going to betray me.

1624
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,180
(His offer to bribe
doesn't work on the King.)

1625
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,280
I will switch Premier Lee...

1626
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,870
(Your Majesty!)

1627
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,040
with...

1628
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:44,720
- Eunuch Yoo over there.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1629
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,390
I will switch him back
to being a premier.

1630
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:47,810
- He's back to his position.
- But...

1631
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,290
(A glorious return of Premier Yu)

1632
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,430
Move!

1633
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,790
It's better to stay as Queen.
I'm so lazy to change the costume.

1634
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,260
You're lazy to change the costume?

1635
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,220
What's wrong, honey?

1636
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,240
I just realized...

1637
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,870
how ugly you are.

1638
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,540
(The Queen needs to be
switched fast.)

1639
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,240
I need to switch you
with someone else.

1640
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,640
Your voice is beautiful.

1641
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,200
(Your voice is beautiful.)

1642
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,810
Will you be my queen?

1643
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,010
- My goodness.
- Come on up!

1644
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:14,720
That seat is really uncomfortable.

1645
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,620
- Get out of here.
- Okay.

1646
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,220
- Get out of here!
- Move!

1647
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,350
Hey, you're the youngest now.

1648
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:21,790
My goodness.

1649
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,720
I am? Gosh.

1650
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,990
- All right!
- All right!

1651
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,620
- How gross.
- He's so cute though.

1652
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,120
Queen Jong Kook is so cute!

1653
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,030
- I need to erase my mustache.
- You should.

1654
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,390
Now I'll tell you the rules
of the final mission.

1655
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,990
In the final mission,

1656
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:39,060
you could be a prey
or you could be a hunter.

1657
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,430
It's called
the Ironic Survival Game.

1658
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,810
It's a survival game
where you'll use a toy gun.

1659
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,280
- It sounds fun.
- Sounds like fun.

1660
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,240
You'll each attach five balloons
to your body.

1661
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,910
We'll give you 30 bullets.

1662
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,720
- It's that game.
- We're using balloons again.

1663
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,810
You can't shoot at just anyone
on the opposite team.

1664
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,830
At two different spots
in this building,

1665
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,790
there are two roulettes
with your names on them.

1666
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,030
You should spin the roulettes,

1667
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,600
and the name you get
will be your target.

1668
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,990
- I see.
- We have different targets.

1669
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:07,490
So we don't know
who will be our targets.

1670
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:09,830
Your target will be changed
every two minutes.

1671
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:11,140
The person you get after spinning
the roulettes...

1672
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,830
will be your target for two minutes.

1673
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:14,600
When all of your balloons pop,
you'll be out.

1674
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,470
The ranking of the teams will be
determined by who remains last.

1675
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,510
The final winner
can scoop out the rice.

1676
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:20,910
All right. I got good team members.

1677
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:23,040
- Of course.
- You picked the good ones.

1678
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,510
Let's move to the starting point
of the last mission.

1679
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:27,560
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

1680
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,850
Since I got busted already,

1681
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,950
I think I can do a good job
in helping the other evil spirit.

1682
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,560
Wish me luck!

1683
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,490
(He has to pull off the hidden
mission with the other evil spirit.)

1684
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,370
Hold on.

1685
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:41,970
- Haha.
- Yes?

1686
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,010
- Are you busy?
- Why? What's up?

1687
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,540
Can I put my forehead against yours?

1688
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,510
- What?
- Can we put our foreheads together?

1689
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,540
Oh, you're just
doing the mission plainly?

1690
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,240
What's this?
Am I becoming an evil spirit?

1691
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:54,720
Will this make me an evil spirit?

1692
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,220
- What was that?
- I'm off now!

1693
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,080
I'm off! Was that okay?

1694
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,080
Okay.

1695
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,720
- Hey...
- Since we're on the same team,

1696
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,430
- I know that.
- if I'm cornered,

1697
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,350
you need to come and help.
You know that, right, King?

1698
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,160
- Do not worry, Queen Jong Kook.
- Honey.

1699
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:09,700
I will protect my queen.

1700
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,990
- Honey.
- I'm here, and you're there.

1701
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,260
(I'm here, and you're there.)

1702
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,430
(He's the King's man.)

1703
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:18,370
- Honey!
- Gosh. What is it?

1704
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,640
It's so gross. It feels like...

1705
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,510
- You need to protect me.
- Don't worry.

1706
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,100
- How adorable.
- Honey.

1707
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,470
You're so cute!

1708
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,140
(Stamping his feet
with his big build)

1709
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,510
I'll be waiting.
You need to come to me.

1710
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,350
- Don't worry!
- Okay? To over here.

1711
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,350
(Queen Mustache has too much
testosterone and is too cute.)

1712
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,180
The race will start now.

1713
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,660
Okay.

1714
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,890
The targets are...

1715
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:43,060
(Announcing the first targets)

1716
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:48,100
(Who will be the first targets
that will be attacked by everyone?)

1717
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,140
(The first targets are...)

1718
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,640
Kim Dong Jun and Song Ji Hyo.

1719
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,240
The first targets are
Kim Dong Jun and Song Ji Hyo.

1720
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,350
(They're the targets!)

1721
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:02,450
(They run away first.)

1722
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:03,640
This is driving me crazy.

1723
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,720
Kim Dong Jun and Song Ji Hyo?
I'm coming! Bang, bang!

1724
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,790
- Song Ji Hyo and Kim Dong Jun.
- Dong Jun?

1725
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,330
We need to protect Dong Jun.

1726
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,220
Wait a minute.
Where could Dong Jun be?

1727
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,350
Song Ji Hyo and Kim Dong Jun?

1728
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:17,200
Okay, no one on our team
is a target.

1729
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,060
(They need to protect
their team members to win.)

1730
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,600
I should hide in here.

1731
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,700
(Ji Hyo plans to hide
inside a lecture room.)

1732
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,200
Come in quickly.

1733
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,240
(Dong Jun is
at the end of the corridor.)

1734
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,540
Look for Dong Jun now!

1735
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,700
(Jae Suk appears right then.)

1736
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,810
Dong Jun is on Team Slave.

1737
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,370
(He spots Jae Suk in red
from afar.)

1738
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:34,470
Darn it.

1739
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:39,620
(He quickly flees downstairs.)

1740
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,430
(Eunuch Park Sung Hoon appears.)

1741
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:47,450
(There's my target!)

1742
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,530
(The first chase begins.)

1743
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,790
(Sung Hoon does his best
to chase Dong Jun,)

1744
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,310
(but Dong Jun
is getting farther away.)

1745
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,410
(Dong Jun runs away relaxedly.)

1746
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,200
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

1747
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,510
(Paper Doll Sung Hoon
appears way too late.)

1748
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,950
Why doesn't it work?
I can't shoot the bullet!

1749
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,010
(Blaming the bullets)

1750
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,390
(Relaxed Dong Jun...)

1751
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,410
I can't shoot it!

1752
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,910
(and the guy with a mullet
who runs as fast as he can)

1753
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:15,950
Darn it!

1754
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:17,030
Darn it.

1755
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,180
(We can only hear
his sound of breathing.)

1756
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,790
I could've shot him.

1757
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:22,430
(Showing off his poor stamina
as soon as the chase starts)

1758
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,100
Dong Jun?

1759
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,700
I got him!

1760
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,760
(Another guy
with a mullet appears.)

1761
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,260
Hey, Dong Jun.

1762
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,870
Haha! We need to finish him!

1763
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,010
(Dong Jun ran into Haha
while running from Kwang Soo.)

1764
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,410
(It popped!)

1765
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:40,010
(Another one popped.)

1766
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:41,010
Finish him!

1767
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,450
(2 of Dong Jun's balloons popped
in an instant.)

1768
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,080
No, no!

1769
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,760
This is exhausting.

1770
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:50,220
It will work. It's open!

1771
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,490
It's open!

1772
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:52,930
Here.

1773
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,530
(Kwang Soo squeezed himself
through the door.)

1774
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:55,850
(Dong Jun is in danger!)

1775
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,990
He's out!

1776
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,370
(Kwang Soo hit the balloon
when Dong Jun was about to flee.)

1777
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,160
- Kim Dong Jun is out.
- All right!

1778
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,640
- Kim Dong Jun is out.
- I did it!

1779
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,640
(Kim Dong Jun is out.)

1780
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,280
I couldn't do anything.

1781
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,280
I was about to...

1782
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,080
Kim Dong Jun is out.

1783
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,510
(Right then, Dong Yoon puts
his forehead against Dong Jun's.)

1784
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:18,310
The second targets are
Kim Jong Kook and Park Sung Hoon.

1785
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:21,350
(The second targets are
Kim Jong Kook and Park Sung Hoon.)

1786
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,720
- Hey, I'm on your team.
- Oh, right.

1787
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:27,830
(He automatically aims his gun.)

1788
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,100
My goodness. Hey!

1789
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:31,890
- I'm sorry.
- That's quite upsetting, you know.

1790
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:32,990
I'm so sorry.

1791
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,370
- Who's the other one?
- Who's the other target?

1792
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,370
Who's the other target?

1793
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:36,810
- Oh, Sung Hoon?
- It's Sung Hoon.

1794
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,810
(The tall guy with poor stamina
is the second target.)

1795
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,640
He's over here!

1796
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,200
- Come here, everyone!
- Run, Sung Hoon!

1797
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,600
(He runs away first.)

1798
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,200
- Run!
- Shoot him! What are you doing?

1799
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,450
Why would I? He's on my team.

1800
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,970
(Se Chan chases after Sung Hoon
right away.)

1801
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,720
Run!

1802
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,080
(Run!)

1803
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,290
Run, Sung Hoon!

1804
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:53,310
(Run, Sung Hoon!)

1805
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:57,430
(He runs at full speed
without even turning back.)

1806
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,530
- Who's the other target?
- Jong Kook.

1807
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:03,390
Gosh, this is really exhausting.

1808
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:06,990
(His breathing gets heavy
as though he's about to throw up.)

1809
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,310
(He's about to pass out.)

1810
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,330
They said you can't get out of bed
for two days...

1811
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,140
if you shoot Running Man.

1812
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,640
(They said you can't get out of bed
for 2 days after Running Man.)

1813
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,140
I should stay in bed for three days.

1814
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,310
(I should stay in bed
for 3 days.)

1815
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,620
(While Sung Hoon announced that
he'll stay in bed for 3 days,)

1816
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,620
(what has Dong Yoon been up to?)

1817
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:23,640
How come...

1818
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,390
(What has Dong Yoon been up to?)

1819
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,810
Excuse me.

1820
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,910
- What is it? What are you doing?
- Let me put my forehead...

1821
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,830
Wait. Hey!

1822
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:32,930
Hey!

1823
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,160
Why would you...

1824
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,930
I did it. I did it for him.

1825
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,870
- But...
- I did it for him.

1826
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,790
- Just do it for him.
- Yes?

1827
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,540
(Dong Yoon is
openly doing the mission here?)

1828
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,370
(Jae Suk puts his forehead
against Dong Yoon's for now.)

1829
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,370
The current targets are...

1830
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,510
Jae Suk and Suk Jin.

1831
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,580
(Jae Suk?)

1832
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,410
(Dong Yoon was right next to him.)

1833
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,510
(He succeeds to pop
1 of Jae Suk's balloons.)

1834
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,180
Hey! Hey!

1835
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,290
(1 more balloon pops.)

1836
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,890
Ji Hyo! Hey!

1837
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,350
- Ji Hyo, I am on your team.
- Oh, you are right.

1838
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,430
- Oh, you are right.
- I popped two balloons.

1839
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,990
(Dong Yoon chases after Jae Suk.)

1840
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:10,990
- I used up my bullets.
- You are out of bullets.

1841
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,970
(Jae Suk succeeds to get away.)

1842
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,560
(This is such an important moment.)

1843
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,660
You are out of bullets.

1844
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,260
Where is Suk Jin?

1845
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,600
(Suk Jin is the other target.)

1846
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,410
(The targets were announced
when Suk Jin was with Se Chan.)

1847
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,580
(He shows his pitiful back
as always.)

1848
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,720
(He runs to a dead end.)

1849
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,410
You are out of bullets.

1850
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:30,640
(He manages to prolong his life
because Se Chan is out of bullets.)

1851
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,790
No way!

1852
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,510
- Suk Jin, run!
- Help me!

1853
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:34,790
- Help me!
- Suk Jin!

1854
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:35,850
- Help me!
- Don't go that way!

1855
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,330
(He runs into the muscular queen.)

1856
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,660
(Screaming)

1857
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:41,990
- Help me!
- Don't go that way!

1858
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:43,990
(His scream fills the studio.)

1859
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,370
- Suk Jin!
- No!

1860
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,140
- Run!
- No!

1861
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:50,540
Run!

1862
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,370
- Why won't the balloons pop?
- Run!

1863
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:53,930
- Help me!
- Run!

1864
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:55,100
(Everyone is obsessed
with the shooting game.)

1865
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:56,510
(Even Dong Yoon joins the hunt
for Eunuch Ji.)

1866
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,600
No!

1867
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,010
- Help me!
- Run!

1868
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,780
Run!

1869
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,180
Run! Run!

1870
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,580
(Kwang Soo the eunuch
blocks the door with his body.)

1871
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:06,680
Run!

1872
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,060
Run!

1873
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,450
(He runs away with 2 balloons
thanks to Kwang Soo.)

1874
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,680
No.

1875
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,600
(Ji Hyo chases after him!)

1876
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,790
- Suk Jin.
- All right.

1877
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,200
- I am sorry.
- It's okay.

1878
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,890
Isn't it time to spin the wheel?

1879
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,560
(Bang! Bang!)

1880
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,010
(Two balloons pop at once!)

1881
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,540
(Ji Hyo popped 2 balloons
with 1 bullet.)

1882
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,540
Did both balloons get popped?

1883
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,100
Why did both balloons get popped?

1884
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,180
Did she pop two balloons at once?

1885
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,140
- Really?
- Did I do that with one bullet?

1886
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,740
Suk Jin is out.

1887
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,970
- Gosh.
- Suk Jin is out.

1888
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,040
Did anyone else get eliminated?

1889
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,290
I am the first one, right?

1890
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,140
The race...

1891
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,260
starts.

1892
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,120
(After Dong Jun,
Suk Jin gets eliminated.)

1893
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,180
Did you see Jae Suk?

1894
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:45,790
- I popped two balloons.
- Where is he?

1895
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:46,890
What?

1896
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:48,930
Let me put my forehead
against yours.

1897
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,660
- Why?
- Let me do that.

1898
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,700
Why do you need to do that?

1899
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:54,060
- What?
- What is up with him?

1900
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:55,740
- Hey.
- What?

1901
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:57,970
What are you doing? Stop it!

1902
01:02:57,970 --> 01:02:59,330
Stop it!

1903
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,700
Stop it!

1904
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,010
(Is Dong Yoon carrying out
a hidden mission?)

1905
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:04,180
Let go of me!

1906
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,040
I... I...

1907
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:07,640
He is so suspicious.

1908
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,620
Is there a way to make
more evil spirits...

1909
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,410
- or turn someone into one?
- The current targets are...

1910
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,660
Sae Rok and Se Chan.

1911
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,950
(The current targets are
Sae Rok and Se Chan.)

1912
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:19,060
(Sae Rok loses 3 balloons
because of Jong Kook right away.)

1913
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,060
No!

1914
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:22,760
(With no place to go,)

1915
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,720
(the former queen gets taken out
by royalty.)

1916
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:29,640
(Se Chan gets chases for a while.)

1917
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:31,970
(He gets eliminated
when the last balloon pops.)

1918
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:34,140
Se Chan and Sae Rok are out.

1919
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,180
- No!
- The current targets are...

1920
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,310
Jae Suk and Sung Hoon.

1921
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:40,870
(The current targets are
Jae Suk and Sung Hoon.)

1922
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:45,810
(Jae Suk tries to go
to a secluded place.)

1923
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:49,220
(Panting)

1924
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:52,430
(So Min sees him.)

1925
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:54,620
(Jae Suk's location)

1926
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:55,930
(While she prepares to attack,
Dong Yoon appears.)

1927
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:57,700
Dong Yoon, come here.

1928
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,260
Jae Suk is in here.

1929
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:00,470
(Whispering)

1930
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:03,240
(Jae Suk doesn't have
many bullets.)

1931
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,560
Is that door open?

1932
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,660
Do you want me to go in?

1933
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,010
- Aren't you going to shoot him?
- I guess I should.

1934
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,580
You are acting strange.

1935
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:10,910
You are acting strange.

1936
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,370
You are acting strange.

1937
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,810
What is up with you?

1938
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,350
You are acting strange.

1939
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,510
(He turns around.)

1940
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,790
You are acting strange.

1941
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,810
(Why isn't Dong Yoon attacking
Jae Suk?)

1942
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,680
You are acting strange. What?

1943
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,290
- No, no.
- Hold on.

1944
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:26,660
Okay.

1945
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:27,890
So Min.

1946
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:29,350
It's not like that.

1947
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:30,490
You are acting strange.

1948
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:32,260
(Is he trying to protect
a fellow evil spirit?)

1949
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,260
That's so suspicious.

1950
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,540
Why doesn't Dong Yoon want to shoot
Jae Suk?

1951
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,010
The current targets are...

1952
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,810
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.

1953
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,240
Gosh, the targets changed.

1954
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:44,180
(An evil spirit candidate,
Jae Suk comes outside.)

1955
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,140
That's so suspicious.

1956
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,970
Why didn't Dong Yoon want to shoot
Jae Suk?

1957
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:50,540
Why did he hesitate?

1958
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,740
Who? Dong Yoon?

1959
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,060
(Dong Yoon seemed to hesitate
when he could take out Jae Suk.)

1960
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,290
Okay.

1961
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:58,160
(So Min finds it strange.)

1962
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,760
(The current targets,
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo)

1963
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,390
(Kwang Soo the eunuch
was picking up bullets.)

1964
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,830
What? That startled me.

1965
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,540
What are those neon shoes?

1966
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,240
What are those neon shoes?

1967
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,310
Jong Kook is a target, right?

1968
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,930
- Yes.
- Gosh, that startled me.

1969
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:15,600
How do I open this?

1970
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,740
I was going to go out
when Kwang Soo left.

1971
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:19,910
Jong Kook is here.

1972
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,080
Jong Kook is here.

1973
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,180
What should we do?

1974
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,350
(But they don't know what to do.)

1975
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,580
What should we do?

1976
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,790
(They spray water.)

1977
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:34,330
(For goodness' sake.)

1978
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:38,120
(He even spits out water.)

1979
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:41,790
The current targets are
Haha and Ji Hyo.

1980
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,260
Jong Kook.

1981
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,640
(He gets caught
when the targets change.)

1982
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,510
(It lands on his face.)

1983
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,430
Haha, run!

1984
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:51,040
Haha!

1985
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,600
- You are here.
- Jong Kook.

1986
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,510
Jong Kook, I have a bad back.

1987
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,510
- He is here, Jae Suk!
- I have a bad back.

1988
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:57,810
- Haha.
- We need to finish him off.

1989
01:05:57,810 --> 01:05:58,950
Come on.

1990
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,450
- Haha!
- That stings!

1991
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:01,510
- Ouch.
- Haha.

1992
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:02,680
Turn around.

1993
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,830
(Haha has 1 balloon left.)

1994
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:04,830
Turn around.

1995
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,580
Come on out.

1996
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:08,390
My goodness.

1997
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,660
I couldn't run away.

1998
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,430
Haha is out.

1999
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,040
- Haha is out.
- Sung Hoon.

2000
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,700
The current targets are
Kwang Soo and Jae Suk.

2001
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,970
(Kwang Soo and Jae Suk,
the new targets get announced.)

2002
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,970
(Team Eunuch: 3, Team Slave: 2,
Team Noble: 2)

2003
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,100
I have three bullets left.

2004
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,870
With these three bullets,
I will make a difference.

2005
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:27,240
(He is overly absorbed in the game.)

2006
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,040
What are you doing?

2007
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:33,310
Dong Yoon, hold on! Listen to me!

2008
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,290
(Dong Yoon attacks Kwang Soo
when his guard is down.)

2009
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,120
Dong Yoon, stop! Dong Yoon!

2010
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,490
(If Kwang Soo gets eliminated,
Team Eunuch will place last.)

2011
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:41,950
Kwang Soo and Jae Suk?

2012
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:44,200
(While the two of them fight,
these people go after Jae Suk.)

2013
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,660
(They spot Jae Suk.)

2014
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,240
(The weak duo
goes after Jae Suk as well.)

2015
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,660
By the way, Jae Suk is really fast.

2016
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,060
I am exhausted.

2017
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:55,430
(Kwang Soo's last balloon
is before his eyes,)

2018
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:58,240
(but Dong Yoon keeps missing it.)

2019
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,450
(Jae Suk is being chased.)

2020
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:01,350
- The other way.
- The other way?

2021
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,510
It's too late for that.

2022
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:03,990
Please.

2023
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:05,140
(The last targets will determine
the result.)

2024
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,350
Come on!

2025
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:09,290
(Kwang Soo is using strength
and Jae Suk is using speed.)

2026
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:10,290
I refuse to go out.

2027
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:11,930
(The two targets must survive
to keep the teams' ranks.)

2028
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:14,220
(What will be the result
of the final race?)

2029
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,620
Welcome back.

2030
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,620
(The race ends.)

2031
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:18,620
- Kwang Soo, did you survive?
- I survived.

2032
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,100
Good work.

2033
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,470
(The final survivors enter
the courtroom.)

2034
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:23,970
I can't guess the result.

2035
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,370
Firstly,

2036
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,810
the evil spirits succeeded to do
the hidden mission.

2037
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,410
- Was there another one?
- What could it be?

2038
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:32,810
I guess there was something
other than the forehead touch.

2039
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:35,310
I will announce the result.
The first place is...

2040
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,870
(The 1st place)

2041
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:37,950
Team Noble.

2042
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,990
Then the other 2 teams placed 2nd.

2043
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,810
They will scoop out rice two times.

2044
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:44,390
Now,

2045
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:45,890
shall we begin with the slaves?

2046
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,490
(They get to scoop out rice
according to the result.)

2047
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:48,990
It's game over.

2048
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:50,830
The tables have been turned.

2049
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:52,100
We don't have much.

2050
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,330
After a general meeting,

2051
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:57,260
the king will decide
who will be put on a stand.

2052
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,760
This is driving me crazy.

2053
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,930
- Jae Suk, I keep hearing tip-offs.
- What?

2054
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,370
Some people saw...

2055
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,370
how Dong Yoon avoided popping
your balloons.

2056
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,180
This is bad.

2057
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:09,870
Jae Suk is suspicious.

2058
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,450
- Jae Suk is suspicious.
- That's right.

2059
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,450
It must be true.

2060
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:17,290
When you said
that Jae Suk is suspicious,

2061
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,180
Dong Yoon said no.

2062
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,200
- Is there a reason to say no?
- Seriously.

2063
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,430
- Seriously.
- I know.

2064
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,970
He had no reason to say no.

2065
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,200
- To be honest...
- I mean...

2066
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:28,700
He got caught.

2067
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,100
He is too pure.

2068
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,370
Let me tell you this.

2069
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,200
- I am not an evil spirit.
- He is changing the subject.

2070
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,240
Think about the seating arrangement
we had on the bus.

2071
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,550
If you think about it,

2072
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:40,580
Jae Suk and Dong Yoon sat together.

2073
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,620
They sat by the window.

2074
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,080
- Jae Suk sat by the window.
- That's right.

2075
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,120
- They were behind me.
- Yes.

2076
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,050
- Dong Yoon tried to depend on him.
- Did they sit together?

2077
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:48,590
They sat together.

2078
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:51,330
Dong Yoon tried to depend on him.
That's why he sat next to Jae Suk.

2079
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,530
If I am not an evil spirit,

2080
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:54,830
you will be in big trouble.

2081
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,630
- You have one chance.
- We are simply throwing out...

2082
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,460
- ideas.
- Okay, okay.

2083
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,330
Can I give you an alibi?

2084
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,540
Go ahead.

2085
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,670
Are you trying...

2086
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,430
- to protect Jae Suk?
- An alibi?

2087
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:07,100
Why are you protecting him?

2088
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,580
- I mean...
- It's so confusing.

2089
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:09,780
Why are you protecting him?

2090
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:11,750
Are you trying to protect me?

2091
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,970
You are making it look weird.

2092
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,250
Everything he does seems suspicious.

2093
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,010
- Dong Yoon...
- Look at that.

2094
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:17,310
He lost control.

2095
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:19,550
- He lost control.
- He lost control of the situation.

2096
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:21,310
Are you trying...

2097
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:23,090
- Dong Yoon.
- Give us the alibi.

2098
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,920
- His ears turned red.
- He dug himself into a hole.

2099
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,180
His ears turned red.

2100
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:28,750
- I will talk.
- Okay.

2101
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,830
Why did you take Jae Suk's rice?

2102
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,460
- Why did you take it?
- I thought...

2103
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,740
he would acquire a lot of rice.

2104
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:35,800
(Simple)

2105
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,000
Was that the reason?

2106
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,130
Most people would have chosen
Jong Kook.

2107
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:39,300
(Dong Yoon's words are unclear.)

2108
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,340
- I can't believe him!
- Let's send Jae Suk to the stand.

2109
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:44,280
- We have the answer.
- It's pretty clear.

2110
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,750
Jae Suk is suspicious.

2111
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,340
Dong Yoon and Jae Suk are
suspicious.

2112
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:50,840
The other evil spirit must be
a veteran.

2113
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,380
The Running Man members
are better at carrying out...

2114
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:56,590
a mission such as touching
the name tags...

2115
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:57,630
- in secret.
- That's right.

2116
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:00,160
We should be suspicious
of Jong Kook too.

2117
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,420
That goes without saying.

2118
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,890
The other evil spirit must be
a Running Man member.

2119
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:05,390
- That must be the case.
- But...

2120
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,830
Kwang Soo...

2121
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:07,890
Oh, he isn't Kwang Soo.

2122
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,670
He resembles Kwang Soo.

2123
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,130
- Seriously.
- He resembles Kwang Soo.

2124
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:15,000
- I am here.
- He has long hair too.

2125
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,670
- He resembles Kwang Soo.
- He looks the same.

2126
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,080
- He resembles Kwang Soo.
- I see the resemblance.

2127
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,880
I would believe it if someone said
that they are brothers.

2128
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,640
Sae Rok, who do you think
is the other evil spirit?

2129
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,710
- I think it's Jae Suk.
- Why?

2130
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:27,710
- This is driving me crazy.
- Earlier,

2131
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,710
So Min said repeatedly...

2132
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:33,090
that Dong Yoon didn't shoot
at Jae Suk.

2133
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:36,250
I suggested that we go and attack
Jae Suk together.

2134
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,590
When I gave you his location,

2135
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,890
you were like, "Why?"
He was hesitant.

2136
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,890
- He wanted to go someplace else.
- So Min spread this story.

2137
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,300
But So Min isn't an evil spirit.

2138
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,540
- She isn't an evil spirit.
- Be honest.

2139
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,170
- You aren't an evil spirit, right?
- Are you?

2140
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,470
- She is too suspicious.
- I am not an evil spirit.

2141
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,280
Let's send So Min to the stand...

2142
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,710
one more time to be certain.

2143
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:55,970
I am not an evil spirit.

2144
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:57,310
Why are people so suspicious of me?

2145
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:00,090
Dong Yoon was with me for a while.

2146
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,490
- That's right. They were together.
- And...

2147
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:05,130
Dong Yoon held people's hands
and put his forehead against theirs.

2148
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:06,460
- That's right.
- When he did that,

2149
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:10,130
Sae Rok ran away
and Dong Jun refused to do it.

2150
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:11,330
Everyone ran away.

2151
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:12,590
But Jae Suk went,

2152
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,800
"Really?" Then he put his forehead
against Dong Yoon's.

2153
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,960
All right, Dong Yoon.

2154
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,540
(He let Dong Yoon hold his hand
and put his forehead against his.)

2155
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:21,600
It's strange.

2156
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,040
He is either an angel...

2157
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,950
- or someone with a mission.
- No.

2158
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:29,210
I let him do it
because I thought he was faking.

2159
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,590
- I can explain clearly.
- Hold on.

2160
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:34,310
You haven't explained
anything clearly!

2161
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,750
- Hey!
- Wasn't it locked?

2162
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,920
You haven't explained
anything clearly!

2163
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,030
Jae Suk.

2164
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:44,760
Why do you think
Dong Yoon keeps protecting you?

2165
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,560
He is trying to hide his partner.

2166
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:49,800
Everyone thinks
I am the other evil spirit,

2167
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,870
so Dong Yoon is driving a nail
into the coffin.

2168
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:54,470
He is doing this to
help the team win.

2169
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,910
Are you saying he twisted it twice
to frame you...

2170
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
when someone else is
the other evil spirit?

2171
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:01,050
That would make him a genius.

2172
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,620
So this might be a feint?

2173
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,670
There is the fanny pack.

2174
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:05,620
- You know,
- But an evil spirit...

2175
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:07,310
your Highness.

2176
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:08,680
If you are unsure,

2177
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,030
choose Eunuch Lee.

2178
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:13,030
Why do you keep framing me?

2179
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,960
Why would he choose me?
I didn't do anything today.

2180
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,200
Hold on. It's true.

2181
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,170
Hold on. It's true.

2182
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,800
(What?)

2183
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,060
- It's over.
- It's over.

2184
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,540
It's over. His rice is gone.

2185
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,910
- It's over.
- It's over.

2186
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,240
- It's over.
- His rice is gone.

2187
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,740
- Let go.
- It's over.

2188
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:30,780
(Eunuch Lee lost
all the rice he gathered.)

2189
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,210
- Leave it.
- Don't touch the rice.

2190
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:33,450
- Leave it.
- Don't touch it.

2191
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,470
It isn't allowed.

2192
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:35,880
- It was a mistake.
- It doesn't matter.

2193
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,340
- Leave it.
- Leave it.

2194
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:38,950
You spilled it.

2195
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:40,510
- You spilled it.
- Leave it.

2196
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:41,960
It's not like
someone else spilled it.

2197
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:45,220
There are
about 12 grains of rice inside.

2198
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:48,420
Who is the other evil spirit?
Who is the other evil spirit?

2199
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,630
Who is it?

2200
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,800
- You need to catch the evil spirit.
- Who is it?

2201
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,670
Will Kwang Soo get the penalty
if we don't catch the evil spirit?

2202
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:54,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

2203
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,260
Then we won't need to do it.

2204
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,390
Hold on.

2205
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:58,870
Please make a decision.

2206
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:01,000
Let me be honest.

2207
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:02,500
Isn't it a bit late?

2208
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,380
When the evil spirits removed
the blindfolds,

2209
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,640
we heard music.

2210
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:12,340
- But I heard a sound from my right.
- That's right! Who made it?

2211
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,920
Who was to your right?

2212
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,050
- I didn't hear anything.
- Didn't you sit over there?

2213
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:16,310
- Did you sit here?
- No, no.

2214
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:18,330
Sae Rok, Ji Hyo...

2215
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:20,720
- Me.
- Jong Kook, Ji Hyo...

2216
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:22,050
I don't think it's Sae Rok.

2217
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:23,550
- I heard a sound.
- What sound?

2218
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:24,560
- Okay.
- Jong Kook sat there.

2219
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,130
I heard the ping of a rubber band.

2220
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:28,430
That was me.

2221
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,760
I kept doing this
since the blindfold wasn't in place.

2222
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,000
I kept doing this.

2223
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,540
The rubber band could be a big hint.

2224
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,040
- I heard a sound.
- Seriously.

2225
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,140
(Jae Suk becomes lively again.)

2226
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,750
- Look at Jae Suk.
- I am serious.

2227
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:42,750
- Jae Suk suddenly became lively.
- Look at Jae Suk.

2228
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,920
He wants to hold on
to the smallest suspicion.

2229
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,920
"That's right. That's it."

2230
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,120
(He deduces without any reasons.)

2231
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,620
He is in a hurry.

2232
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,330
Seriously. Jae Suk is so funny.

2233
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,630
- Jae Suk.
- Everyone.

2234
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,390
What Kwang Soo said is a big hint.

2235
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:55,700
- I heard a sound.
- The rubber band.

2236
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,300
Earlier,

2237
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,200
- I continued...
- He is coming up with excuses.

2238
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,530
For goodness' sake.

2239
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:02,540
The more you talk,
the more pitiful you seem.

2240
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:05,210
Jae Suk,
this is what everyone wants.

2241
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:06,260
That's right.

2242
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:07,710
- This is what everyone wants.
- That's right.

2243
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:09,630
- Kwang Soo is our plan B.
- Premier Yu.

2244
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:10,880
I am not an evil spirit.

2245
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:13,670
- Maybe he isn't one.
- I am really not an evil spirit.

2246
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,420
Maybe he isn't one.

2247
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:17,950
- At this point...
- Maybe he isn't one.

2248
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,090
I think it's Jong Kook.
But I can't be sure.

2249
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:21,750
- Then I will go up the stand.
- We can't be sure.

2250
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:22,920
Do you want me to go up?

2251
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:25,750
If you want me to go up,
I will do it.

2252
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:28,220
If Jae Suk is an evil spirit,
he will get the penalty, right?

2253
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,250
He is scary.

2254
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,960
If I am not an evil spirit,
you will get the penalty, right?

2255
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,090
I will go up.

2256
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:33,530
(I will go up.)

2257
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:35,370
- It's up to the king.
- I will go up.

2258
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,460
- I will go up.
- Come on.

2259
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,500
I am serious.

2260
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,130
- I will go up.
- No, no.

2261
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:41,800
- Jae Suk is happy.
- I am serious.

2262
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:43,740
No, no. Jong Kook.

2263
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:45,170
Jae Suk is happy.

2264
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:47,050
- Why are you smiling?
- It's Jae Suk!

2265
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,640
Why is Jae Suk happy?

2266
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,780
He is happy.

2267
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,010
- Why are you smiling?
- It's Jae Suk!

2268
01:14:52,010 --> 01:14:53,290
- Jong Kook, I am sorry.
- I want him to get the penalty.

2269
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,660
I am sorry.

2270
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:57,120
- You were suspicious of me.
- I am sorry.

2271
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,420
You aren't an evil spirit.

2272
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,850
- You aren't an evil spirit.
- I will go up.

2273
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,200
Sit down, evil spirit!

2274
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,130
He couldn't hide his smile.

2275
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:05,370
As soon as he turned around,
he showed a smile.

2276
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:07,200
He smiled as he walked away.

2277
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:08,630
He smiled.

2278
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:09,760
My goodness.

2279
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,210
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2280
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,960
- Let's go.
- Let's put Jae Suk on trial.

2281
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,060
Okay. I agree.

2282
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:15,340
- No.
- I put Premier Yoo on trial.

2283
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,880
I can't believe Dong Yoon.

2284
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,280
(Did he get caught up
in Dong Yoon's scheme?)

2285
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,550
Jae Suk is so funny.

2286
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:20,840
I will tell you after this.

2287
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,340
Dong Yoon saw someone.

2288
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:24,840
If Jae Suk is an evil spirit,

2289
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:27,050
Team Evil Spirits will lose.

2290
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,460
If he isn't an evil spirit,

2291
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:31,630
someone else would be one.

2292
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:33,330
You are frustrated
because of Dong Yoon, right?

2293
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:36,030
- All right.
- It has to be Jae Suk.

2294
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,500
It would be strange if he isn't.

2295
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,670
Jae Suk...

2296
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,700
- is...
- No way.

2297
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:41,700
Jae Suk...

2298
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:42,840
Let's see.

2299
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,840
No way.

2300
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,130
- Is...
- An evil spirit.

2301
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:47,060
- An evil spirit.
- An evil spirit.

2302
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,780
(Everyone is curious about
his identity.)

2303
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Not an evil spirit.

2304
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,080
(He is not an evil spirit.)

2305
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:00,590
(Jae Suk is a human,
not an evil spirit.)

2306
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,420
You should have objected more.

2307
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,030
(Dong Yoon won.)

2308
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,700
- Why did you smile?
- Yes!

2309
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,830
You should have objected more.

2310
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:12,590
I objected as much as I could.

2311
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,960
(Everyone is shocked.)

2312
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,630
- Why did you smile?
- I...

2313
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:18,760
Oh, no.

2314
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:19,930
He really wasn't one.

2315
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:22,100
Does that mean
Dong Yoon twisted it twice?

2316
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,410
The evil spirits won.

2317
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:25,410
(The evil spirits won.)

2318
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:27,550
The one who succeeded in doing...

2319
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,170
as many missions as Dong Yoon...

2320
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,290
I am so curious.

2321
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:34,340
- The second evil spirit is...
- Who is it?

2322
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,290
(The second evil spirit's identity)

2323
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,090
(The perfect execution
of the hidden missions...)

2324
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:42,550
(and even more perfect acting)

2325
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,560
Congratulations,

2326
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:46,130
Sae Rok.

2327
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,340
Sae Rok.

2328
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:53,300
(Sae Rok was an evil spirit.)

2329
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:55,910
What?

2330
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:59,550
I said that two guests could be
the evil spirits.

2331
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,580
Two guests.

2332
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,710
(Two guests were the evil spirits.)

2333
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:06,250
Two guests.

2334
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:10,250
(Sae Rok, the second evil spirit
was daring and secretive.)

2335
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:12,850
(A few days ago,)

2336
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:14,590
(Sae Rok found a suspicious pot.)

2337
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:16,630
What is this? A pot?

2338
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:19,920
(She opens it naturally
as if she was told to do it.)

2339
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,780
I finally got a body.

2340
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,170
Shall I party now?

2341
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,510
(Thus, Sae Rok was reborn
as an evil spirit.)

2342
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:39,550
Today, we will have the Records
of the Running Dynasty Race.

2343
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:42,490
You are the evil spirits
that are hiding among people.

2344
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:43,880
Okay.

2345
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:45,420
Evil spirits.

2346
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:51,920
(Hidden mission 1,
Make 3 hearts in the car)

2347
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:57,260
(She made hearts
even during a conversation.)

2348
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,380
(Then the 1st trial took place.)

2349
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:09,840
(Kwang Soo was suspicious
of Sae Rok and Dong Yoon.)

2350
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,380
(Is it Sae Rok?)

2351
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:16,290
(They kept a distance
and shook off people's suspicions.)

2352
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:18,990
(Exchanging a signal)

2353
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,180
Dong Yoon.

2354
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:21,330
(They met up throughout
the missions.)

2355
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:22,920
I will touch the red
and you will touch the green.

2356
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,760
Come in a bit later.
Go to the restroom.

2357
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,390
(Touching together)

2358
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,740
(Touching)

2359
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:37,210
(She remained confident
and avoided suspicion.)

2360
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:41,140
The last mission is
holding hands for a minute...

2361
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:44,750
while you are on the same floor
as another member.

2362
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:47,420
(The last mission was hard.)

2363
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,490
Hold other people's hands.

2364
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:51,250
Link arms with them.

2365
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:53,330
Do something, okay?

2366
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:54,700
Okay. I will do it.

2367
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,830
Do it right.

2368
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:57,590
(As Sae Rok instructed,
Dong Yoon held people's hands.)

2369
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:59,130
Oh, you're just
doing the mission plainly?

2370
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:02,130
(He carried out a hidden mission
with Sae Rok in plain sight.)

2371
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,740
(Holding hands)

2372
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,740
(Although Sae Rok shouted,
she held his hand tighter.)

2373
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:13,210
(We did it.)

2374
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:14,250
Come here.

2375
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:18,920
(They held hands
for over 3 minutes.)

2376
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:21,050
Let's go, Dong Yoon!

2377
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:22,380
(Sae Rok and Dong Yoon had
a perfect victory.)

2378
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,460
Yes!

2379
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:26,880
(The two guest evil spirits had
a perfect victory.)

2380
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,590
(Their teammates are shocked.)

2381
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,090
I was totally fooled.

2382
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,530
The guests.

2383
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,870
Since you always expected to see
1 member and 1 guest,

2384
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:37,540
we gave the roles
to two guests this time.

2385
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:40,260
They made us suspect each other.

2386
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:41,740
I suspected Ji Hyo
until the very end.

2387
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,500
I thought there would be
a Running Man member.

2388
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,670
- Seriously.
- I was suspicious.

2389
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:46,340
- Dong Yoon.
- Yes?

2390
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,210
Why did you protect Jae Suk?
Was it a strategy?

2391
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,470
- It was a strategy.
- Of course it was.

2392
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,840
I can't believe him.

2393
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:53,120
- It was a strategy?
- He did well.

2394
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,460
I kept laughing and exchanging looks
with Dong Yoon.

2395
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,180
- Really?
- Did you exchange looks?

2396
01:19:58,420 --> 01:19:59,460
I had no idea.

2397
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,890
I got goosebumps at the end.

2398
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:03,030
It was a strategy.

2399
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:05,560
Dong Yoon didn't look
in this direction.

2400
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,800
- He kept looking this way.
- Jae Suk.

2401
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,090
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

2402
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:11,040
Stop pretending to be sharp
and sit down.

2403
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,240
You should have said that earlier.

2404
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,740
You didn't trust my words!

2405
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,600
You didn't trust my words!

2406
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,540
- I am sorry.
- It was so hard today.

2407
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:20,100
Every time I said something,
he went...

2408
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:21,510
(Sung Hoon's scorn
was more hurtful than suspicions.)

2409
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:23,970
It was the most annoying.

2410
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,640
Every time I said something,

2411
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:27,960
he went...

2412
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:29,510
(The look in Sung Hoon's eyes
hurt Premier Yu's pride.)

2413
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,010
I couldn't believe it.

2414
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:32,250
I thought it was obvious.

2415
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,300
The prize of the day
comes from the West.

2416
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,000
Western fruits
and a Western snack, macarons.

2417
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,170
A Western snack.

2418
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,540
The prize will go
to the two of them.

2419
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,800
(They will have a taste
of the West.)

2420
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,760
And the penalty for today
is flogging.

2421
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,130
It's not like you're dying.

2422
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:49,600
Se Chan, hit him hard.

2423
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:51,550
- It won't kill you anyway.
- Make it hard.

2424
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:52,950
It's just loud. That doesn't hurt.

2425
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:54,000
It won't kill you.

2426
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,510
- I'll begin.
- Oh, no.

2427
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:56,780
This is for fun.

2428
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:58,990
- It doesn't hurt, does it?
- It doesn't.

2429
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:01,090
- There you go.
- It won't hurt.

2430
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,660
(Thudding)

2431
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:06,130
(The king's power)

2432
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:09,030
That was amazing.

2433
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,560
It sounded great.

2434
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:13,530
Say, "I'm the king."

2435
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,630
Well done. That was good.

2436
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:16,840
- It felt great.
- That was great.

2437
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,840
Good. Okay.

2438
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,210
Good work today.

2439
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:20,410
- Good work.
- Good work.

2440
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:21,500
(We hope "Joseon Exorcist"
will be successful.)

2441
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
This is the only variety show
that has...

2442
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,140
two Grand Award winners.

2443
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:26,500
I'm so proud.

2444
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:27,910
(Yoo Jae Suk or Kim Jong Kook)

2445
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:29,210
(Pick a captain you want.)

2446
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,780
(They feel uncomfortable already.)

2447
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:35,050
(They sign the oath that says
they will never get upset.)

2448
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:38,380
(Will they be able to spend
the day without getting upset?)

2449
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:42,390
(They show the Pumbaa dance
to liven up the mood.)

2450
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:44,830
(That's when...)

2451
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:47,200
(the Grand Award winner
starts acting high-handedly.)

2452
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:50,540
(The members can't take it anymore
and run away from the captains.)

2453
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:53,670
(They even ran away to a mud flat.)

2454
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,740
(The Grand Award winners are
coming to find them.)

2455
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,250
(It will snap, you fool.)

2456
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,950
(Why are they all in that place?)

2457
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,550
(Who will keep their promise and
upgrade the dignity of the award?)

2458
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,120
(Yoo Jae Suk versus Kim Jong Kook,
Dignity of the Grand Award)
