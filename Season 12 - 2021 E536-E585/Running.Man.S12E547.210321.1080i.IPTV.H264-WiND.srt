(On a beach in Ganghwa Island
where the breeze is still cold)

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,310
- This way?
- Are we going this way?

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,610
- Is there something in there?
- Why are we going in there?

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,960
Hello.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,790
- What?
- Come on in.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,150
- I'm nervous.
- What's all this?

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,290
(What is this?)

8
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,560
"In Suyu-dong..."

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,920
"With his whimsical charm..."

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,750
- "The grand award..."
- It's Jae Suk.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,930
(He has won the grand award
15 times.)

12
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,340
(His whimsical charm
and positive attitude)

13
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,660
(He claims that's
when he had his first kiss.)

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,410
(He was the youngest comedian
who debuted through open recruit.)

15
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,610
(He started to become popular with
his character as a grasshopper.)

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,500

KBS Entertainment Awards.)

(Yoo Jae Suk is an award collector
who won the grand award 15 times.)

26
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,700
There's Jong Kook.

27
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,850
Why are we doing this?

28
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,130
- That's Jong Kook.
- When did they...

29
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,590
Hey, what's all this?

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,560
(2020 SBS Entertainment Awards)

31
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,870

as soon as he debuted.)

33
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,630

in three different Music Awards.)

(This is a memorial hall for
the two grand award winners.)

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,510
- Hey, what's all this?
- Hello.

39
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,260
- Hello.
- What's this?

40
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,230
- Hey, I was born...
- What is this?

41
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,320
- I was born in Yongsan.
- What's going on?

42
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,230
- What is this?
- Is it a biography?

43
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,320
- A biography?
- Where should I look at?

44
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,660
It says "He was born
in Suyu-dong, Gangbuk-gu."

45
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,840
This is a museum.

46
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,070
- What is this?
- What's going on?

47
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,630
This is... My gosh.

48
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,400
- And what is this?
- He's not Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

49
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,130
- What's all this?
- What are we doing?

50
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,430
This should be in front
of a statue like that.

51
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,950
Gosh, the people who didn't win
the grand award are getting upset.

52
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,240
- This is...
- What are you doing?

53
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,680
It's not like I was born here.

54
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,850
Is it about his biography?

55
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,760
"He claims that's when
he had his first kiss."

56
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,510
- He claims?
- What are you doing?

57
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,650
- Did he claim that?
- Why did you add that?

58
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,820
My gosh.

59
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,020
I was born in Yongsan.

60
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,490
I'm from Seoul.

61
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,020
Just let it slide.

62
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,700
- It's a good day.
- What's all this?

63
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
- What is this?
- Why?

64
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,070
- I'm wearing it because I'm cold.
- What's with this?

65
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,240
What's that jacket?

66
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,510
- What about it?
- It's like a flower garden.

67
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,610
- It's...
- What's that?

68
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,940
(Is this too much?)

69
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,500
Still, it's cool.

70
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,770
I think I should take this off.

71
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,150
By the way, Suk Jin...

72
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,440
- Why?
- Why are you taking it off?

73
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,340
- Suk Jin.
- I was just about to start.

74
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,650
I didn't get to say anything.

75
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,960
- Because...
- I was about to start.

76
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,780
This is what I'm supposed to wear.

77
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,020
This cardigan belongs to my aunt.

78
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,330
Se Chan, weren't you wearing
this shirt earlier today?

79
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,220
I knew it. Someone stole my shirt.
Suk Jin!

80
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,060
I couldn't wear it.

81
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,590
Suk Jin, this is Se Chan's.

82
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,870
- You can't wear that.
- Hey.

83
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,870
- That's not true.
- It's mine.

84
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,770
After his stylist, Ha Na
who got paid per case quit,

85
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,870
- he got a new stylist.
- I know.

86
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,940
Stop talking about
the "per case" thing.

87
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,440
- Why?
- I'm not the one who paid her.

88
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,650
- Still...
- Oh, it was your agency?

89
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,560
We have a member
who gets paid that way.

90
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,960
He gets paid by the hour.

91
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,150
- By the hour?
- Hey.

92
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,090
- Is that you?
- He gets paid by case?

93
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,590
- This is crazy.
- By case.

94
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,330
Right. Suk Jin gets paid
by the hour.

95
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,560
- By the hour.
- That's right.

96
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,870
Anyway, I believe
Ha Na will be doing well...

97
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,800
- because she's talented.
- Sure.

98
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,560
She's not the type to boast.

99
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,960
He forgot about her already.

100
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,340
- Who?
- He forgot about Ha Na.

101
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,740
How would I forget Ha Na?

102
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,810
- You had Min Hee before.
- Do you remember Min Hee?

103
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,550
- Min Hee.
- Sure.

104
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,080
- Suk Jin is...
- When you met her before,

105
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,440
she said hello to you,
and you made a bow to her.

106
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,340
(He treated her like a stranger
after working with her for 5 years.)

107
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,210
- She worked for him for five years.
- That's impossible.

108
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,430
- After five years...
- That can't be right.

109
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,620
He's lying.

110
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,750
- That's ridiculous.
- That's absurd.

111
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,120
That sounds just like Suk Jin.

112
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,520
Yesterday, Suk Jin was...

113
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,220
I guess he's made up his mind.

114
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,960
He wants to remember the names
of our crew members.

115
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,640
- Seriously?
- Right. He kept asking me.

116
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,340
"Hey, what's his name?"

117
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,970
So I was like...
His name was Sun Myung,

118
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,030
but I said Sin Myung.

119
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,940
- And he tried to remember the name.
- That sounds exciting.

120
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,150
And I told him
his family name is Namkoong.

121
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,310
- I was...
- Is he Namkoong Sun Myung?

122
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,940
I asked Se Chan about
a crew member's name.

123
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,990
She was a woman, but he said
her name is Ko Chul Bong.

124
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,460
Her name is Bong Pal.

125
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,250
He asked what her job was.

126
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,020
- So...
- No one tells him the real names.

127
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,220
He asked me about her job,
so I said she made window frames.

128
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,220
- "She makes window frames?"
- All of a sudden, Suk Jin...

129
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,430
Window frames?

130
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,430
So you guys, don't be surprised...

131
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,410
if Suk Jin calls you by
a weird name.

132
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,740
- We will...
- Ko Chul Bong.

133
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,680
Hey, Bong Pal.

134
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,540
I asked, "Is she
a writer or a director?"

135
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,180
And he said "She's
in charge of the jimmy jib."

136
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,420
I said things like, "She makes
window frames. She drives a truck."

137
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,780
- A truck?
- He's so mean.

138
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,920
This is the only variety show
that has...

139
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,360
two Grand Award winners.

140
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,160
- Right.
- That's cool.

141
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,930
So we'll have a special episode for
Yoo Grand Award and Kim Grand Award.

142
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,600
It will start
in their memorial hall.

143
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,390
- Their memorial hall?
- This is a memorial hall.

144
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,030
It's not a memorial hall. My gosh.

145
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,560
These two are very shy
when we do stuff like this.

146
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,690
I hate stuff like this.

147
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,700
- Gosh, I really hate this.
- A memorial hall?

148
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,430
- What's all this?
- A memorial hall.

149
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,630
I'm no match for him though.

150
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,440
I just won the award once.

151
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,920
Jong Kook is another
grand award winner.

152
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,550
So today...

153
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,220
They are the pride, the core,
and the heart of Running Man.

154
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,320
With these two grand award winners,

155
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
we will have
the Dignity of the Grand Award Race.

156
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,230
- Finally.
- We have two hearts.

157
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,390
- This is...
- We're finally doing this.

158
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,760
First, Jong Kook and I feel
uncomfortable about stuff like this.

159
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,330
- He looks very shy.
- I'm feeling uncomfortable.

160
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,130
As you probably noticed,

161
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,200
Jae Suk is the captain
of Team Yoo Grand Award.

162
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,130
And Jong Kook is the captain
of Team Kim Grand Award.

163
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,500
So there will be teams.

164
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,240
The rest of the members will...

165
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,870
choose a captain they want
before each mission.

166
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,050
I feel uncomfortable already.

167
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,720
Do we get to pick the captains?

168
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,560
You should never sulk.

169
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,660
Then...

170
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,750
Gosh, Jong Kook.

171
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,250
There will be missions...

172
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,820
where the number of
team members won't matter.

173
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,800
So it's okay even if
one team has more members.

174
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,120
Oh, really?

175
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,560
You can just pick whichever team
you want.

176
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,190
Can we pick teams
after hearing about the game?

177
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,310
No, you can't.

178
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,430
Why not?

179
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,240
- It won't be easy.
- The members...

180
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,040
of the winning team...

181
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,640
will get double the number
of members in points.

182
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,620
But if you lose,

183
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,850
you will lose the exact
number of members in points.

184
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,140
So the member with the highest
score will be the winner.

185
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,990
And the two members
with the lowest scores...

186
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,360
and one member picked by them
will get a penalty.

187
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
- Really?
- Is it picked?

188
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,030
But the member with
the highest score is exempt.

189
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,870
Now I want the two captains
to sign a written oath...

190
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,430
that says they will never get mad...

191
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,890
- no matter what.
- That's good.

192
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,330
I'm telling you. I won't be mad.

193
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,740
You can't control my feelings.

194
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,810
So you can just pick
a team you want comfortably.

195
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,040
- Bring the written oath.
- Let them sign.

196
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,740
- All right.
- Even after the shoot.

197
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,500
I don't think
I need many team members.

198
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,420
Exactly. You don't need many.

199
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,240
I've never seen a contract like
this before. You shall never sulk.

200
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,740
I won't sulk.
We've been together for a long time.

201
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,060
You should never glower at me.

202
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,730
- I should read this carefully.
- What is the addition for?

203
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,800
The other members can add conditions
that they want.

204
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,760
You can't say, "Okay. I get it."
It's forbidden.

205
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,370
- "Okay. I get it."
- "Okay. I get it."

206
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,330
"Okay. I get it."

207
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,540
Don't stare at us
for over two seconds straight.

208
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,870
- You can't say our full names.
- Don't call our names.

209
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,430
You can't whisper to others
while looking at my face.

210
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,430
(You can't whisper to others
while looking at my face.)

211
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,200
You can't stare at us
for over three seconds.

212
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,940
- That's good.
- Don't glower at us.

213
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,310
Don't stare at me with snake eyes.

214
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,850
Okay. That's good.

215
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,440
Hang on. You can't do that.
Look at that.

216
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,740
- Snake eyes.
- You can't do that.

217
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,160
- Don't glower at us like that.
- I won't do that.

218
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,720
I can stare at you
because I like you.

219
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,860
- You stare at us like this.
- You can't do that today.

220
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,560
They are not exactly
"the apple of my eye".

221
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,060
To get a star...

222
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,490
- You don't have to read that.
- He's changing the conditions.

223
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,870
Jae Suk won't let
things like this slide.

224
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,560
- He's changing it.
- Isn't it that you should...

225
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,130
- talk to your attorney?
- I check contracts thoroughly.

226
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,330
You're amazing.

227
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,630
"I can't pick the stars
for our members..."

228
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,570
"who are like the apple of my eye."

229
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,410
"Even though I can't do that,
I do care about them."

230
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,480
"Whatever decision they make,
I won't be mad..."

231
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,940
"Or resent them."

232
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,640
It depends.

233
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,740
Hey.

234
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,810
He can't change
everything like that.

235
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,060
I didn't change a lot.

236
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,030
What's this? "As much as possible."

237
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,030
- Just sign it.
- "For the members..."

238
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,300
I can see their characters.
He checks everything thoroughly...

239
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,230
while Jong Kook just signed it.

240
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,670
"I respect their opinions."

241
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,670
- All right. It's done.
- Don't say my full name.

242
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,390
- Not the full name.
- Read it for us.

243
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,760
I wrote it down. "I won't stare at
the members for over three seconds."

244
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,630
"I won't say, 'Okay, I get it.'"

245
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,780
(Don't stare at them for over 3
seconds and say "Okay, I get it.")

246
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,850
- I got goosebumps.
- You startled me.

247
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,870
That sounds so natural.

248
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,440
That's the tone of your voice.

249
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,070
- Se Chan, give this to them.
- Okay.

250
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,140
All right.

251
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,080
Like I said before,

252
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,790
you can pick the captain
of your team today.

253
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,030
The two captains will wait
in their own rooms.

254
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,300
The rest of the members will
go to their rooms in turn...

255
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,030
- Okay. Let's do that.
- This is Jae Suk's room.

256
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,630
- And this is Jong Kook's room.
- All right.

257
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,860
- "Okay, I get it."
- "Okay, I get it."

258
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,730
- "Oh, Yang Se Chan."
- "Oh, Haha."

259
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,410
- "Oh, Lee Kwang Soo."
- "Suk Jin, I get it."

260
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,510
It's not like today is our last day.

261
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,250
- Hey, we have to add this.
- Write this down.

262
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,550
"It's not like
today is our last day."

263
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,180
- Write it down.
- We have to write it down.

264
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,840
Gosh, it's suffocating already.

265
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,980
Honestly, I'm not acting cool.

266
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,450
(The grand award winners are
waiting for the members to come.)

267
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,080
I think two will be
more than enough.

268
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,030
If no one comes, can I play alone?

269
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,500
My gosh.

270
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,530
(Someone has to come, right?)

271
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,140
Gosh. It's possible
that no one shows up.

272
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,770
I should brace myself for that.

273
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,810
(Whom will the members pick?)

274
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,960
Gosh, this is...

275
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,930
(Kim Grand Award's Room)

276
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,340
It's cold today. Where should I go?
Should I go into the room?

277
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,340
There's something I heard.

278
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,250
Today, the penalty will
be very harsh.

279
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,440
And the two losers get to pick
a person for the penalty.

280
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,550
Unless you win the game,

281
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,710
you might get the penalty.

282
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,210
- If you don't win...
- We should do this right.

283
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,920
We have to win no matter what.

284
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,820
- We have to win.
- I should be on the winning team.

285
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,820
We don't even know what it is.
Can you tell us what we're doing?

286
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,060
It's like a choice
between brain and brawn.

287
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,770
Jong Kook is smart too.

288
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,500
What? Are you saying
Jong Kook is dumb?

289
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
- Okay.
- You can't say that.

290
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,830
- Are you saying Jong Kook is dumb?
- Haha!

291
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,830
We can't do this to each other.

292
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,700
I'll go. I've made up my mind.

293
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,230
- Okay. You go on ahead.
- Hang on.

294
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,970
(So Min picks her team
while everyone's hesitating.)

295
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,050
I think...

296
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,910
one of them will get more members.

297
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,650
This is hard to choose.

298
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,650
(Will So Min pick the snake,
Kim Grand Award who holds grudges?)

299
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,020
(What's So Min's choice?)

300
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,390
You should appreciate this. Look.

301
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,420
- Are you choosing me?
- As soon as I got in here...

302
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,160
- You're still out of breath, right?
- My gosh.

303
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,180
You picked me right away.

304
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,260
- I know. I came right away.
- Okay. Good.

305
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,170
Jong Kook, I got in here
even before the cameras were ready.

306
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,270
- That's great.
- It was quick.

307
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,430
You should remember that.

308
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,670
Today, I'll be nice.

309
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,600
I thought you were
dressed too lightly.

310
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,910
I'll keep you warm.
You know what I mean.

311
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,010
- I was worried about you.
- Jong Kook.

312
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,810
I got here even before you sat down.

313
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,750
- How did you come in so quickly?
- I didn't even hesitate.

314
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,810
That's amazing.
What's with you, So Min?

315
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,310
They were still talking.

316
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,950
- Suk Jin even said this.
- What did he say?

317
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,220
<i>Look at the sky
The white snow is falling</i>

318
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,130
(Se Chan picked Jong Kook too.)

319
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,350
Se Chan.

320
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,460
Good. Okay.

321
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,590
Okay. This is nice.

322
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,860
I came here without hesitation.

323
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,270
You were later than So Min, but...

324
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,510
- I came right after her.
- Okay.

325
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,730
This is enough for me.

326
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,780
I don't need more.

327
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,810
Hang on.

328
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,440
I see a silhouette.

329
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,440
- Hey.
- My gosh.

330
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,110
Hang on.

331
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,440
This isn't bad. It's 4 to 4.

332
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,550
Hang on.

333
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,760
- Song Jeoktoma.
- Ji Hyo, this is...

334
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,180
This is enough. We're ready.

335
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,290
We don't need useless members.

336
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,290
I don't need the tall one.

337
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,170
(Unlike Kim Grand Award's room...)

338
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,540
Two would be more than enough.

339
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,860
I don't know
what games we're playing though.

340
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,310
Ji Hyo and Se Chan.

341
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,810
That would be perfect.

342
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,570
I just need Ji Hyo and Se Chan.

343
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,180
They are very smart.

344
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,050
- And I...
- We all are wearing white socks.

345
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,340
- We're a team.
- Next is...

346
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,480
- What's happening there?
- It's all white.

347
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,750
This is crazy.

348
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,560
Gosh, it's hard to choose.

349
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,430
It won't be physical
from the beginning.

350
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,220
(It won't be physical
from the beginning, right?)

351
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,060
- Are you alone in here?
- Gosh.

352
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,860
(Haha is here.)

353
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,040
You must've been so lonely.

354
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,100
You...

355
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,670
What's that?

356
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,180
Why don't you look grateful?

357
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,470
- Gosh, I should go.
- Haha, come back here. Haha.

358
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,750
They're having a party over there.

359
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,050
Come here, Haha.

360
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,290
I don't need many members.
I want only two.

361
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,420
It will be hard
to have a lot of members.

362
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
(He's just saying that
knowing he won't get many members.)

363
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,520
It's hard to have many members.

364
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,480
- Jae Suk.
- Hey.

365
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,800
- Jae Suk.
- Hey.

366
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,000
You picked a captain
whom you can be comfortable with.

367
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,670
He's here.

368
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,670
- I'm here.
- You want to be at ease.

369
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,460
- My gosh.
- Hey, Jae Suk.

370
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,690
This isn't so bad.

371
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,230
Sure. This is good enough.

372
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,960
- I really like my team.
- This is really good.

373
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,040
I can control these guys.

374
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,310
I guess Haha went to the other team.

375
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,020
- Haha is...
- He didn't come.

376
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,180
He's...

377
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,150
Is he using me? Is it just business?

378
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,650
- I think so.
- Exactly.

379
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,560
So this is what Haha did.

380
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,680
I'm realizing it today.

381
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,720
I think he's using your
generous and cool personality.

382
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,690
Exactly. He uses me.

383
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,720
(He's turning into a poisonous snake
from Haha's betrayal.)

384
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,060
He uses me to attract investors.

385
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,860
I get it. Okay.

386
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,170
(Suk Jin also picks Jong Kook.)

387
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,270
All right.

388
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
(He greets Suk Jin with a bright
smile as if he wasn't mad at all.)

389
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,830
Did they go to the other room?

390
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,380
Gosh. What are you doing here?

391
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,010
I want to win the race.

392
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,780
- Right. He is...
- He's realistic.

393
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,050
I heard there will be
a harsh penalty today.

394
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,980
Suk Jin doesn't want
Jae Suk to be his captain.

395
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,980
That's not true. It's not like that.

396
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,080
That's not why.

397
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,890
- I had to come here.
- Sure. That's a good choice.

398
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,220
I never imagined...

399
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,400
But if we lose the first game,
I'll move to the other team.

400
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,960
We can't lose with so many members.

401
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,170
- Were you the last one to go?
- I was the last one.

402
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,590
I was talking about Haha.

403
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,360
- Haha picked the other team.
- Haha is...

404
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,730
Suk Jin, don't you agree?

405
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,230
- Jong Kook.
- I think...

406
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,680
- he's been using me.
- He's using you.

407
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,280
- He's using me for business.
- Right.

408
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,910
I can't deny it.

409
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,880
- Right.
- I just realized it today.

410
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,150
- Jong Kook is...
- This isn't what you shouldn't do.

411
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,070
- That's why you signed the oath.
- I know, but...

412
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,210
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

413
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,480
But I just can't help it.

414
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,180
Suk Jin is done making his choice.

415
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,350
- Really? He went there?
- Seriously?

416
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,350
Good.

417
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,590
- We are the elite members.
- I see.

418
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,690
We are the elite members.

419
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,000
- You could've been really lonely.
- We are the best ones.

420
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,670
Gosh, Jong Kook will be...

421
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,730
We're the best members.

422
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,270
I have to do a TV show
with him this week.

423
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,560
Why?

424
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,970
Things are becoming clear now.

425
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,180
This is just perfect.

426
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,600
- This is the first mission.
- What is it?

427
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,650
I just hope
it's not something physical.

428
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,250
- Nothing physical.
- The first mission is...

429
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,180
one of the things that shows
the dignity of grand award winners.

430
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,440
It requires power, agility,

431
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,350
- Power?
- and craftiness.

432
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,890
It's called Two-body Hide-and-seek.

433
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,030
- What?
- Hide-and-seek?

434
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,680
- What?
- Hide-and-seek?

435
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,820
Two-body?

436
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,130
The team members
except the captains...

437
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,770
can hide in any place you want
within this pension complex.

438
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,270
And the two captains will be...

439
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,930
connected to each other with a rope.

440
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,010
And they will look for the members
of their opposing teams.

441
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,570
As soon as you find a member,

442
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,680
the member is out right away.

443
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,420
(The two taggers should find
the members hiding in the pension.)

444
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,680
There will be only one round.

445
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,710
The tagger who finds out
all the members first will win.

446
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,020
They will be connected with a rope?

447
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,820
- So it's about strength.
- This is...

448
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,590
- He will be dragged along.
- This isn't right.

449
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,220
It's about strength
from the beginning.

450
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,670
We can't do this from the beginning.

451
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,170
I chose Jae Suk because I thought
it wouldn't be about strength.

452
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,830
We will be connected with a rope?

453
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,540
That's good for us.

454
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,330
Sure. I can drag Jae Suk around.

455
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,010
Jong Kook can drag him around.

456
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,310
We're going to win.

457
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,810
- We will definitely win.
- We will.

458
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,250
- It's between me and Jae Suk.
- Right.

459
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,380
- I can drag him around.
- You should drag him around.

460
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,380
Hey, we have an advantage though.

461
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,110
Even if we lose,

462
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,810
we don't lose
as many points as they do.

463
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,180
If we lose, will we lose six points?

464
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,710
No, only three points.

465
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,930
- Three points?
- See?

466
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,320
- That's what I mean.
- You like mud.

467
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,590
- Can you stay under the mud?
- Hey.

468
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,670
- I don't like mud.
- You do.

469
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,170
- Who would want to be in the mud?
- He's crazy about mud.

470
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,000
Stay under the mud.
You'll never get caught.

471
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,010
Hey, if you go into the mud today,

472
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,170
your feet will freeze.

473
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,830
- Hey.
- I shouldn't have heard that.

474
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,830
- That makes me want to do it.
- Hang on.

475
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,310
We will lose only three points.

476
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,050
So let's just think
we will lose the first game.

477
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,420
We should be strategic.

478
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,980
I don't want to lose the first game.

479
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,750
- I'll win no matter what.
- I'm just saying...

480
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,110
it's okay to lose.
It's only three points.

481
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,850
Don't try too hard.
You know what I mean.

482
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,560
- I want to try hard.
- Just enjoy.

483
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,760
I just realized...

484
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,950
that you're not popular.

485
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,060
I know.

486
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,720
He would've been in trouble
if I didn't come.

487
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,320
He was sitting all alone here.

488
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,300
If you and I didn't choose Jae Suk,

489
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,640
he would've been dragged
around the whole time.

490
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,310
- No need to play the game.
- Guys.

491
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,550
Like I said, you guys
should hide well.

492
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,340
- Okay?
- Yes.

493
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,680
So we should hide.

494
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,810
- We can win.
- We should hide well.

495
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,790
We can disguise and everything.

496
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,580
Just stay in a place
where we can't see you.

497
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,810
Please change into team uniforms.

498
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,480
- Okay.
- All right.

499
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,060
I'm sure we will win.

500
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,760
Our chances of winning
are like 80 percent.

501
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,170
(Kim Grand Award, Yoo Grand Award)

502
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,670
- What's this?
- It's pink.

503
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,040
This is...

504
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,270
Jong Kook's face looks big
on Jong Kook.

505
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,600
- But this looks small.
- It looks small.

506
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,510
There aren't many places
where we can hide.

507
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,100
It will be annoying
to have to search each car.

508
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,570
I think Jong Kook will stop me
from checking the cars.

509
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,950
Exactly.

510
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,990
I'm sure he will do that.

511
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,690
If they all hide in the cars,

512
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,220
and you can't go to the parking lot,
we will lose.

513
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,260
That's right.

514
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,560
- They're doing it already.
- Why did you choose me?

515
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,590
What are you talking about?

516
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,350
Why would you say that?

517
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,500
I mean, you guys
should do a good job. Okay?

518
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,390
(What's he saying?)

519
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,160
You're the one
who will look for them.

520
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,500
I know. I'll find them.

521
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,830
Why would you say that
folding your arms like that?

522
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,540
- You already gave up.
- I didn't give up.

523
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,810
I'm telling you, let's just relax.

524
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,070
I really want to win
in a situation like this.

525
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,070
(Unlike the captain, the team
members are very passionate.)

526
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,810
You should take off the flippers.

527
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,190
What? What flippers?

528
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,310
- What flippers?
- Hey.

529
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,520
- What flippers?
- Your feet are huge.

530
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,690
No.

531
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,820
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

532
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,880
- Let's go.
- Do we not have any plans?

533
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,320
- Try your best.
- You...

534
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,030
I'll try my best. And you know,

535
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,060
I have no strategy.

536
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,540
I'll just go see what happens.

537
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,300
I'll fight against the world.

538
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,360
Hey.

539
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,440
Things always don't go as planned.

540
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,370
I just fight against them.

541
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,540
You should at least fight.

542
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,570
So...

543
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,370
- You are on your own.
- Don't get beat up.

544
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,410
You know what I mean.

545
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,980
- It's an old saying.
- We should take care...

546
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,380
Exactly. Okay?

547
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,950
- Okay.
- Make sure to survive.

548
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,220
Jae Suk, regency
by the queen mother.

549
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,380
Okay.

550
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,650
A fresh breeze and a bright moon.

551
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,560
It's a fresh wind and a bright moon.

552
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,150
- A fresh wind and a bright moon.
- Okay.

553
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,350
(Jae Suk leaves
after correcting his team members.)

554
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,160
Gosh, I picked the wrong team.

555
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,060
Darn it. I'm doomed.

556
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,970
- You won't be here next time.
- Of course not.

557
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,810
Anyway, you will...

558
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,040
- Don't let him open it.
- Okay.

559
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,900
Jong Kook, so...

560
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,280
- It's not like...
- You're right.

561
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,110
- I will...
- I'll stop him from coming here.

562
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,720
We will hide in the closet
or something.

563
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,380
That's right. You should.

564
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,410
That's what you should do.

565
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,580
Okay.

566
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
(Kim Grand Award will drag
Jae Suk somewhere else.)

567
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,060
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

568
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Let me tell you something.

569
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,060
- You can't do things by force.
- Jae Suk,

570
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,350
I don't do that.

571
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,820
But if that's...

572
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,500
what the directors want,

573
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,330
I have to try my best.

574
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,940
I'm not telling you
not to try your best.

575
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,310
- I have to work hard anyway.
- Just don't be...

576
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,600
- so rough.
- So what do you think?

577
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,640
- If that's what the directors...
- It's not like that.

578
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,050
- We should follow them.
- That's not true.

579
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,640
You're wearing a black outfit today.

580
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,170
You look like a wild animal.

581
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,580
A wild animal?

582
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,760
I'm just trying to make things go...

583
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,080
as the directors planned.
It's not like...

584
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,230
You may start hiding.

585
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,460
- Got it. Okay.
- You may hide now.

586
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,000
We have only three minutes.

587
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,060
- Is that enough for us to hide?
- Three minutes.

588
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,040
(While the 2 leaders are covering
their eyes and ears,)

589
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,330
(Se Chan is looking
for a place to hide.)

590
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,270
The beacon does not shine
on its own base.

591
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,640
(Ji Hyo is looking around nervously
for a while.)

592
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,910
The beacon does not shine
on its own base.

593
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,450
What? Se Chan is there.

594
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,490
There's no way they come in here.

595
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,150
(All 5 of them except for Kwang Soo
have hidden themselves.)

596
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,460
I'm running out of time.

597
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,350
(Meanwhile, the bare-footed
Kwang Soo hasn't hidden yet.)

598
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,760
(Running at full speed)

599
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,350
(Kwang Soo is running somewhere
hastily.)

600
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,500
10, 9, 8...

601
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,390
(I have only 10 seconds left?)

602
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,070
(The man who goes crazy
whenever he sees a mudflat)

603
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,780
(He's running
straight to the mudflat.)

604
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,840
I really want to win.

605
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,170
(The mudflat lover is running
on the mudflat barefoot to win.)

606
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,720
I'll risk my life to win this.

607
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,910
(Flapping)

608
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,650
(After scaring the seagulls away,
he's hiding behind rocks.)

609
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,000
(Lee Kwang Soo, can't help
going into a mudflat)

610
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,770
He'll never be able to find me.

611
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,470
Go.

612
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,860
(Talking to the drone)

613
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,970
Go away!

614
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,670
Get lost!

615
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,510
2, 1. Go!

616
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,520
(Will he not get caught?)

617
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,640
Let's go.

618
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,950
- Can I take this off?
- Yes.

619
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,490
- Let's go and find them.
- Let's go.

620
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,080
Wait. Your side...
Oh, is that your team's house?

621
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,150
This one is mine, right?

622
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,730
- This is your team's house.
- Correct.

623
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,420
Then I can just stop him
from coming into our house.

624
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,970
(Jong Kook's plan is to keep
Jae Suk away from his house.)

625
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
(Grabbing)

626
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,860
- Gosh. We won't go in there.
- All right.

627
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,770
- We'll go to mine too.
- Let's go to yours first.

628
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,660
- Let's check yours first.
- Let's do it the other way around.

629
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,710
- Yours is closer. Let's go.
- Let's go to your house first.

630
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,740
Let's go in.

631
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,840
- Come back here. It might snap.
- Come here.

632
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,900
- Come here now!
- Hey.

633
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,370
I said, come back here.

634
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,750
- This rope might snap, you punk!
- Come here.

635
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,790
It won't snap. Just come in.

636
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,310
Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

637
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,720
- Come here already.
- You can't do this. It's not fair.

638
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,420
- Gosh. Hey, Bo Pil!
- Stop it. Come over here.

639
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,290
- Gosh, seriously.
- Come on in. Take off your shoes.

640
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,960
- This is driving me nuts.
- Let's compromise with each other.

641
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,620
- Why are you doing this?
- Like I said,

642
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,390
we should create a situation
that our staff wants.

643
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,500
Gosh, seriously.

644
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,830
- That's how things work. What?
- Hey, they both left.

645
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,160
What do you mean?
Did they go out of here?

646
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,040
We don't have time for this.
We have to go around outside.

647
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,330
(At that moment!)

648
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,670
(Someone is lying in the bed!)

649
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,980
(The bulging shape on the bed...)

650
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,080
(made Jong Kook smile happily.)

651
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,520
(Flapping)

652
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,020
(I found someone.)

653
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,260
- What?
- Who is that?

654
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,650
Hold on.

655
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,080
(He just has to call the person's
name to eliminate him or her.)

656
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,200
(Unexpectedly, it turns out
to be Suk Jin.)

657
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,500
- Why...
- Why are you here?

658
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,470
(Why is he here when he promised
to hide in Kim Grand Award's room?)

659
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,770
- Hey. Hey!
- Suk Jin? What's going on?

660
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,710
You should've stopped him
from removing the blanket!

661
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,900
(Suk Jin? What's going on?)

662
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,280
(Suk Jin's strategy was
unbelievably clumsy.)

663
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,480
- What is he doing here?
- I mean...

664
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,710
- What's wrong with you?
- What is this?

665
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,070
- You're supposed to be in my room.
- Listen, Jong Kook.

666
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,670
That's not the point here.
Why are you here?

667
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,750
Why is he here?

668
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,080
- You're supposed to be in my room.
- It's a trick, you know.

669
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,690
Why would you keep it to yourself?

670
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,880
- You should've told me.
- I'm speechless.

671
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,530
- I can't believe him.
- Hey, remember what you said?

672
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,760
Obviously, I thought there would be
only the other team members here.

673
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,970
You should've stopped him
from lifting the blanket.

674
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,160
I was lying on the bed confidently.

675
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,560
- What's wrong with him?
- Exactly.

676
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,090
You should've stayed
at my house. Why did you come here?

677
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,630
This is driving me crazy.

678
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,560
- Why were you hiding here?
- You're driving me crazy.

679
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,060
- I'm speechless.
- Go away! Go!

680
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,670
I can't believe this. Hey!

681
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,370
- Be honest with me. Why here?
- Am I out?

682
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,550
Of course, you're out.

683
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,900
Did he do it on purpose?

684
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,480
- Is he a spy or something?
- Why would he do that?

685
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,670
Did he try to help me?

686
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,450
Is he a spy or what?

687
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,550
I'm not a spy. I wasn't trying to
help the other team.

688
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,580
But why...

689
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,060
Why did you try to help me?

690
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,060
(Someone started laughing
under the blankets.)

691
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,320
- But can you really hide here?
- Hey, go out and hide.

692
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,090
I'll lie down here.

693
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,300
Where?

694
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,270
(Haha hid himself
between the blankets.)

695
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,060
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

696
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,130
- Haha, it's not noticeable.
- Right?

697
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,780
(So Haha hid perfectly
between the blankets.)

698
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,510
- I didn't know you'd help me out.
- Don't come between us.

699
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,110
- Why would you come between us?
- My gosh.

700
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,050
I'm pretty sure that someone is
hiding in this room.

701
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,310
I told you both of my team members
went out of the house.

702
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,350
(Jong Kook started searching
following his hunch.)

703
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,720
Wait.

704
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,490
(He's looking at the blankets.)

705
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,060
(Will Haha be eliminated?)

706
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,300
Of course, you can do that.

707
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,230
Anyway, thank you, Suk Jin.

708
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,360
- Why was he hiding in that room?
- Exactly.

709
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,830
Thank goodness.

710
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,470
He didn't find me.

711
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,100
(Haha didn't get caught
thanks to Suk Jin.)

712
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,810
(Jae Suk found a pile of clothes
that looks suspicious.)

713
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,780
Someone is hiding here.

714
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,980
There must be someone here.

715
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,070
(I'm 100 percent sure!)

716
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,190
I'm sure there is.

717
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,350
(The hibernating frog
of Team Kim Grand Award)

718
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,520
(Why did you come out of there?)

719
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,880
- I found So Min.
- Hey!

720
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,150
Why are you all...

721
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,500
- Why are you all here?
- Hey.

722
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,360
- Is this a prank?
- It's odd. Hey.

723
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,230
- This is driving me nuts.
- Why would they help me?

724
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,470
Hey, So Min!

725
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,300
- That's not the case.
- I mean...

726
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,940
Why did you come to this house,
Jong Kook?

727
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,540
- Hey.
- Why were you hiding in this house?

728
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,630
- I didn't...
- Why did you want to come here?

729
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,340
- It's because this is your house.
- But why...

730
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,100
(It's because this is your house!)

731
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,750
- But why...
- I came to find your team members.

732
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,250
- But we found your team members.
- This can't be happening.

733
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,880
Jong Kook, hurry up
and find his team members.

734
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,110
- This is ridiculous.
- We must win the first game.

735
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,410
- How did this happen?
- Hang on. Then...

736
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,020
This doesn't make any sense.
What's going on?

737
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,190
What's going on?

738
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,190
It's a bit strange.
I think it's a conspiracy.

739
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,620
- Right?
- It's a conspiracy.

740
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,420
- I mean, why would they do that?
- Your team members...

741
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,060
I'm pretty sure that the tall one...

742
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,700
Wait, Jae Suk. I'm sure
the tall one is around here.

743
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,540
Seagulls are flying in the sky.

744
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,540
(Hiding between rocks)

745
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,040
Seeing that those migratory birds
are flying away,

746
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,900
I think that winter is finally over.

747
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

748
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,710
you all did a great job this winter.
I mean, the entire year.

749
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,370
(Wink)

750
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,610
Somewhere on the mudflat
between rocks,

751
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,450
Kwang Soo is hiding.

752
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,150
Kwang Soo, don't cross the river.

753
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,150
(Kwang Soo, don't cross
the mudflat.)

754
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,620
That is your house.

755
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,120
That's right. This one isn't mine.

756
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,200
(Striding)

757
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,850
- Gosh.
- Come over here.

758
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,200
- What are you doing?
- Let's take a look around here.

759
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,390
We should search outside.

760
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,210
It must be hard for the tall one
to hide.

761
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,210
Wait. I think...

762
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,630
- I think someone's here.
- They're the sound team.

763
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,570
Nam Joong is here too.

764
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,140
- Why is Nam Joong here?
- Why is he here?

765
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,170
(The assistant director is putting
his hands together awkwardly.)

766
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,050
(Someone's here!)

767
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,990
I'm not feeling well.

768
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,460
- No. He's on my team.
- It's Se Chan.

769
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,060
(He's been arrested for showing
his gums too often.)

770
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,960
(Another member of my team?)

771
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,260
(It's Se Chan.)

772
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,770
Hey, you punk!

773
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,120
Why didn't you stay inside?

774
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,940
(All of his team members are
outside his house.)

775
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,970
Hey, why are you helping me?

776
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,040
Why did you come here?

777
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,830
- Why are you helping me?
- I don't understand.

778
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,540
Why did you come here? Why?

779
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,710
Have you noticed
that they were acting so awkwardly?

780
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,780
I told you guys to act naturally!

781
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,070
- You were all looking so awkward.
- I noticed...

782
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,070
that something was weird about
the staff members sitting here.

783
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,990
I get that, but why were you
hiding out here?

784
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,250
What's wrong with you all?

785
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,260
You could have just stayed
inside the house!

786
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,410
Why did all of you come out?
What's wrong with you?

787
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,760
I was afraid you two might
come into the house.

788
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,490
All you guys had to do
was stay inside the house.

789
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,960
- Hey, by the way...
- I mean, why...

790
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,500
Why are you helping me?

791
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,530
This doesn't make any sense.

792
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,320
I was going to
go in a different direction.

793
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,000
This makes no sense.

794
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,440
(We're in trouble.)

795
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,130
Jong Kook is already upset.

796
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,740
The tone of his voice...

797
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,780
(He could tell how upset Jong Kook
was by his tone.)

798
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,830
He's definitely upset.

799
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,340
Why didn't they stay inside?
I didn't go there to protect them.

800
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,370
(His anger grows as time goes by.)

801
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,720
I just don't understand.

802
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,610
They could've stayed in the house.

803
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,690
(And his back muscles got pumped
because of his anger.)

804
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,910
My gosh. Those punks...

805
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,810
You know...

806
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,190
Why would they...

807
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,320
(Kicking)

808
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,490
- Hey, don't kick it.
- I don't understand.

809
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,700
- What if someone is under there?
- What? Hold on.

810
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,700
(What? Hold on.)

811
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,560
(After the furious kick,
he looked at the blankets again.)

812
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,060
(Will Haha avoid getting caught
this time as well?)

813
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,470
Wait.

814
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,470
(He got caught this time.)

815
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,870
(He couldn't avoid
getting caught twice.)

816
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,780
- Oh, my. Look at him.
- That was perfect.

817
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,900
It was perfect.

818
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,610
- How did you know I was here?
- Indeed.

819
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,020
I heard you guys leaving earlier.

820
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,250
Who covered you with the blankets?

821
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,050
There must've been someone
who covered him.

822
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,110
Gosh. Why was he hiding in there?

823
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,850
I just have to find Ji Hyo now.

824
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,260
That tall punk.

825
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,300
- Gosh, Ji Hyo.
- That tall punk...

826
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,350
Ji Hyo!

827
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
Wait.

828
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,500
I think it's likely
that the tall one...

829
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,160
is hiding on the mudflat.

830
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,470
- That tall punk.
- Ji Hyo.

831
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,100
(Kwang Soo has been weathered
and aged hiding between the rocks.)

832
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,070
(Kim Grand Award is heading toward
the mudflat to find Kwang Soo.)

833
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,240
I think he's over there.

834
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,250
(But right behind them,)

835
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,250
(Ji Hyo is hiding!)

836
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,110
(Please don't look back.)

837
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,410
Where is he?

838
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,050
(Ji Hyo is in the visible range.)

839
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,140
- He must be somewhere around here.
- What?

840
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,290
(At that moment,
Jae Suk looked back.)

841
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,580
(If Ji Hyo gets caught,
Team Yoo Grand Award will win.)

842
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,650
She's not here.

843
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,760
(But he didn't see her!)

844
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,860
I'm pretty sure that Kwang Soo is
somewhere around here.

845
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,660
(While looking around
to find Kwang Soo...)

846
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,710
(He found Ji Hyo!)

847
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,240
Where's Ji Hyo?

848
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,640
(As soon as he spotted Ji Hyo,
he took Jae Suk to another area.)

849
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,950
- Ji Hyo!
- Follow me.

850
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,810
Ji Hyo!

851
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,140
(I'm safe now.)

852
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,950
I should find Kwang Soo.

853
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,880
(Jong Kook wins if he finds
Kwang Soo avoiding Ji Hyo!)

854
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,690
He must be crouching down
in a corner.

855
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,880
I felt like my heart was
going to stop.

856
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Where's Ji Hyo?

857
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,960
(Drone, quiet down!)

858
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,770
(Jong Kook can't go to the mudflat
because of Ji Hyo.)

859
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,860
Where is she?

860
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,700
(Yoo Grand Award is
desperately looking for Ji Hyo.)

861
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,940
- Where on earth is Ji Hyo?
- Gosh, that tall punk. Wait.

862
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,900
Gosh. Where is she hiding?

863
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,870
(Jong Kook is searching while
preventing him from finding Ji Hyo.)

864
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,070
- Let's find Ji Hyo.
- Where is he?

865
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,340
(At that moment!)

866
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,140
(He found a cameraman
filming someone on the mudflat.)

867
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,380
(Cameraman Yun Sang is filming
Ji Hyo from a distance.)

868
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,120
Wait.

869
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,150
(Something's fishy here.)

870
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,700
(Rushing)

871
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,730
(He started running
while Jong Kook was distracted.)

872
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,330
(There's someone down there.)

873
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,600
No, wait. Stop.

874
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,330
(If Ji Hyo gets caught,
Team Yoo Grand Award will win!)

875
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,440
Aren't you Ji Hyo?

876
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,450
(Aren't you Ji Hyo?)

877
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,070
(Found you.)

878
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,050
(All members of Team Kim Grand Award
are out.)

879
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,050
Why were you hiding
in a place like that?

880
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,290
Gosh, seriously.

881
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,150
- Team Yoo Grand Award wins!
- Oh, yes!

882
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,420
- Why were you hiding there?
- Jong Kook.

883
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,700
I saw Kwang Soo running
toward the ocean.

884
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,700
- What?
- Kwang Soo!

885
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,730
Kwang Soo, come out now!

886
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,060
Kwang Soo, we won!

887
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,540
Gosh, it's cold. It's so cold.

888
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,370
I'm so cold.

889
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,440
(He's shivering in cold without
hearing the news of victory.)

890
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,750
Oh, man. It's so cold.

891
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,910
I want to go home.

892
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,570
(It seems that the Prince of Asia
needs to be rescued urgently.)

893
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,840
Gosh.

894
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,950
(Waves are getting closer
to the shore.)

895
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,880
Oh, the tide is coming in.

896
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:50,350
(Cameraman Yun Sang is
coming to rescue the mudflat lover.)

897
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,690
- Kwang Soo, it's over.
- Yes?

898
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,420
- It's over?
- Yes.

899
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,260
We should get out of here now.
The tide is coming in.

900
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,620
- I didn't get caught, did I?
- No.

901
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,620
Oh, yes.

902
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,630
Did he actually go to the mudflat?

903
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,270
He went into the mudflat.

904
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,360
- What?
- He's unbelievable.

905
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,360
He's amazing.

906
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,040
He practically gave himself
a penalty.

907
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,780
Hey, did you say
he went into the mudflat?

908
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,140
Why did you go all the way there?

909
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,840
- What happened?
- We won.

910
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,750
We won? Yes! Okay!

911
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,690
I think that you guys
planned all this.

912
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,720
- That's not true.
- I think it was intentional.

913
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,420
- No. Don't be ridiculous.
- We tried to hide well.

914
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,230
I'm sure that you guys
conspired together.

915
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,350
- Never. Trust me.
- That's not true.

916
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,800
Go away! I'll be alone on my team.

917
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,320
- Don't forget that you signed...
- Go!

918
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,800
- the oath.
- You promised not to get mad.

919
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,540
- Go away!
- Come on, Jong Kook.

920
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,860
- Go!
- Show him the oath.

921
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,130
- He told us to leave.
- Give me the oath. This won't do.

922
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,270
Jong Kook is looking at the mudflat.

923
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,440
- He's looking at the mudflat.
- Jong Kook, please.

924
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,330
- He must be so cold.
- I'm so cold.

925
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,370
- I'm so cold.
- Put this on.

926
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,780
Put on your jacket. Why did you...

927
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,410
- First of all,
- What's wrong with you?

928
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,550
- you should've set the boundaries.
- It's so cold.

929
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,260
- How could I find him?
- Put it on.

930
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,260
Move!

931
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,730
Besides, I told everyone...

932
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,060
that I wouldn't let Jae Suk
go into my house.

933
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,800
Keep your promise, Jong Kook.

934
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,420
- I don't need any of you.
- Actually...

935
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,360
- Take off your jackets.
- Don't be like this.

936
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,800
- I don't need you guys.
- Come on. Don't take it off.

937
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,830
- I can't do this anymore.
- Don't be like this.

938
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,130
What's the point of signing
the oath?

939
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,630
I was wrong.

940
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,070
- You...
- I didn't expect them to win.

941
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,900
Don't even think of joining my team.
I'll be alone.

942
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,520
- I can't believe her.
- She already moved to that team.

943
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
She moved to that team already?

944
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,720
Jong Kook, look at this.
And don't get the wrong idea.

945
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,520
I think she did this
to make us laugh.

946
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,990
But I thought it'd be helpful.

947
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,120
- Show him.
- What did you write on it?

948
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,000
She painted over his eyes, crossed
off "Kim", and wrote "Yu".

949
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,970
- I had no expectations from her.
- That's unbelievable.

950
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,530
When she came into my room
and buttered me up,

951
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,630
I felt that something was fishy
about her.

952
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,130
Team Kim Grand Award lost
five points,

953
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,360
and Team Yoo Grand Award earned
six points.

954
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,870
- Okay!
- Good job!

955
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,830
- You can turn the game around.
- Exactly.

956
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,550
I'll make my team lose
and choose one person.

957
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,480
I'll choose one of the members
who joined me in the first round.

958
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,110
- He can't seem to drop it.
- I'm serious.

959
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,910
- I've made my mind.
- Show him the oath now.

960
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,690
- I'm willing to get a penalty.
- Give me the oath.

961
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,230
- I'll receive a penalty.
- You signed this 30 minutes ago.

962
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,260
You, Mudflat!
I'll teach you a lesson.

963
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,530
- Me? Why?
- You irk me more than anyone else.

964
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,530
Why?

965
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,160
I'm going to choose you.
You irk me for no reason.

966
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,540
- Why?
- "For no reason".

967
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,440
- What do you mean by that?
- Keep up the good work.

968
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,130
You even went into the mudflat.
Why didn't you dive in the ocean?

969
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,970
- Why?
- You see,

970
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,370
- I searched with Jong Kook.
- I won't team up with you guys.

971
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,010
- I understand why he's upset.
- Of course.

972
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,370
As soon as we started searching,
he took me to my house.

973
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,520
And we saw Suk Jin
just lying in the bed.

974
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,990
- You call that hiding?
- He wasn't even hiding.

975
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,110
Did you faint?

976
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,030
- You should've made an effort.
- He was so halfhearted.

977
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,730
It wasn't like that. Listen.

978
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,230
Ji Hyo was just standing outside.

979
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,660
I was confidently telling you
that I was there.

980
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,970
It was your fault.
You shouldn't have taken the covers.

981
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,000
Why were you hiding in his house
not mine?

982
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,130
I clearly told you guys
that I wouldn't come into my house,

983
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,870
and that you should stay
in the house.

984
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,330
When did you tell us that?

985
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,050
What do you mean? I told you
that I wouldn't let Jae Suk...

986
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,480
go into my house
since we would be tied together!

987
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,340
Ji Hyo, are you okay?

988
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,810
That was scary.

989
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,260
Read the oath again.

990
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,110
- Why did you even sign it?
- There's no point.

991
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,230
What's the point of signing it?

992
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,620
- Here you go.
- I won't win the race.

993
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,360
"I, Kim Jong Kook, hereby assure
that I dearly love..."

994
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,520
(I, Kim Jong Kook, hereby assure
that I dearly love...)

995
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,730
(all the cast members to the point
that I'd pick the stars for them.)

996
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,000
(I promise not to get upset
even if they don't choose me.)

997
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,960
(I also promise to listen to
and respect their opinions.)

998
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,440
- Yes, I know.
- You signed here.

999
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,500
(Additional Terms: 1. No eye contact
that lasts longer than 3 seconds)

1000
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,570
(2. No speaking
in a threatening tone)

1001
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,340
- He broke his promises.
- You signed this.

1002
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,840
- What's the point?
- He broke them so many times.

1003
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,810
Let's drop it. That's enough.

1004
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,650
It's time for the second mission.

1005
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,610
Before we begin the second mission,
you will choose your team again.

1006
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,020
We won the first round
despite the disadvantage.

1007
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,360
- Absolutely.
- You're amazing, Yoo Grand Award.

1008
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,960
We won eventually.

1009
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,020
Shall we go to our rooms now?

1010
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,420
The team leaders should go first.

1011
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,650
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1012
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,960
Please put on a blindfold and leave
in the same order as before.

1013
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,060
Why should we put on a blindfold?

1014
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,500
I've already made up my mind.
I'll choose the same team.

1015
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,340
Let's get some
good energy from him. Okay.

1016
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,440
(Haha chose
Team Yoo Grand Award again.)

1017
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,440
Hello, Yoo Grand Award.

1018
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,840
- Oh, my. Welcome, my comrade.
- Oh, my.

1019
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,710
Of course. I'm too scared
to join the other team.

1020
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,210
My dear comrades.

1021
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,320
The other team is so scary.

1022
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
(Suk Jin's choice is...)

1023
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,690
I should be loyal.

1024
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,110
(He chose Team Kim Grand Award.)

1025
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,860
- Let's do this!
- Suk Jin.

1026
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,980
I'm a loyal man.
I decided to stick with you.

1027
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,790
You said you'd leave my team
if we lost. Why did you come back?

1028
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,020
We'll win this time for sure.

1029
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,130
- But you should know...
- No, we won't.

1030
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,730
that no one else will
join this team.

1031
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,290
- Someone's coming.
- What?

1032
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,090
Se Chan, I knew it.

1033
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,170
(Here comes the man with a flower.)

1034
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,230
Don't give him things like this.

1035
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,610
- Please take this.
- Don't give me that.

1036
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:36,840
Please trust me. You know it was
a good place to hide.

1037
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,980
- Seriously...
- We don't need any more people.

1038
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,540
The three of us would be enough.
Let's do this.

1039
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,420
Jong Kook, I won't let you down
this time.

1040
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,610
(Kim Grand Award's allies are
gathering one by one.)

1041
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,480
Hey, Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo is here too.

1042
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,690
(Ji Hyo apologizes on her knees.)

1043
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,090
The same goes for her.
She should've hidden in the house.

1044
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,630
- Let me explain.
- Why were you out on the path?

1045
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,250
- I thought...
- Why were you out on the path?

1046
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,060
The beacon does not shine
on its own base.

1047
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,790
That's ridiculous.
The cameraman was...

1048
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,320
filming you sitting out there.

1049
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,520
Exactly. Hey! Where is he?

1050
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,460
That cameraman was so slow-witted.
Who was that?

1051
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,360
- It was Yun Sang.
- Stop it.

1052
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,070
You could just tell he was
filming someone.

1053
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,380
It's okay. We can win this time.

1054
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,650
What should I do?
What would be the best move?

1055
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,900
(Meanwhile, only the 2
troublemakers are left.)

1056
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,420
I can't think of a solution.

1057
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,840
Next, please go.

1058
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,920
What should I do? I'm off.

1059
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,590
(So Min is leaving
with heavy steps.)

1060
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,590
Why did Jong Kook get mad at me
when I wasn't on his team?

1061
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,520
He yells at me regardless of
whether or not I'm on his team.

1062
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,250
What does he want me to do?
Does he want me on his team or not?

1063
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,320
Next, please go.

1064
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,840
(Kwang Soo is the last one to go.)

1065
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,270
I hope one more cast member of
our show wins the Grand Award.

1066
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,810
My gosh.

1067
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,540
(The person
who chose Jae Suk is...)

1068
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,540
Who could that be?

1069
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,900
Who is it?

1070
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,920
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1071
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,520
Yoo Grand Award!

1072
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,980
- You're just unbelievable.
- Yoo Grand Award!

1073
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,230
- My gosh. She's...
- I've made up my mind.

1074
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,360
- I know.
- Yes.

1075
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,630
(And Kwang Soo chose...)

1076
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,500
- What?
- Hello!

1077
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,690
- Kwang Soo, you chose our team?
- Right.

1078
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,730
(Glaring)

1079
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,730
- Good.
- I always wanted to join this team.

1080
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,790
- Kwang Soo is here.
- Why did you come here?

1081
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,710
- I always wanted to join your team.
- Let's win this time.

1082
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,710
- Hey.
- I'll make sure we'll win.

1083
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,730
- You irk me most.
- Why?

1084
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,250
You and So Min are
in the bottom two.

1085
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,750
- Don't hate me.
- I will...

1086
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,520
- receive a penalty today.
- Don't say that.

1087
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,840
- Why will you get a penalty?
- All I'm thinking about is...

1088
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,920
which of you two I should choose
to get the penalty with me.

1089
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,340
- It'll be a segment of the show.
- I didn't have enough time.

1090
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,320
- "A segment of the show"?
- Yes.

1091
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,420
Who else joined the other team
other than Haha?

1092
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,980
- So Min.
- So Min? That team is weak.

1093
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,630
(Team Yoo Grand Award:
Haha, So Min)

1094
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,130
(Team Kim Grand Award: Ji Hyo,
Se Chan, Kwang Soo, Suk Jin)

1095
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,270
- Shall we go now?
- Everyone.

1096
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,270
- Yes?
- Yes?

1097
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,270
I'll explain the second mission.

1098
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,110
The first game was too advantageous
for the other team.

1099
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,960
- True.
- But fortunately,

1100
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,230
- with the other team members' help,
- Yes.

1101
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,440
we won.

1102
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,310
- Stop bringing that up.
- Are you talking about me?

1103
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,570
Don't mention it again.

1104
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,920
- You see,
- I know I was wrong.

1105
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,480
it helped me let go of my burdens,

1106
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,520
so I think I can be more relaxed
throughout the shoot.

1107
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,360
My gosh. He moved to the other team.
Gosh, that brat.

1108
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,630
- So Min, you surprised me.
- But...

1109
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,360
I didn't accept him fully
in my heart...

1110
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,520
when he joined my team
in the previous round.

1111
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,920
- You were ready to let him go.
- Exactly.

1112
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,400
- That team wasn't right for me.
- I know.

1113
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,000
Through the second mission,

1114
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,840
we'll see how witty and smooth...

1115
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,500
the two Grand Award winners are
as MCs.

1116
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,110
It's Do As I Say.

1117
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,110
- What is this?
- Do As I Say?

1118
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,710
- What is it?
- It sounds difficult.

1119
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,920
One member from each team
will play each round.

1120
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,610
The players stand facing each other
with a bowl of water between them.

1121
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,610
Okay.

1122
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,880
When the MC calls out
a certain body part,

1123
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,250
the players must touch it
with both hands.

1124
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,230
When the MC says, "Bowl",

1125
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,460
the one who grabs the bowl and pours
the water on the opponent wins.

1126
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,130
The game requires agility.

1127
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,070
What does the abilities of an MC
have to do with this game?

1128
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,110
- It requires agility.
- I see.

1129
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,340
I'm not good at games like this.

1130
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,270
Jae Suk gets extremely nervous
whenever we play games like this.

1131
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,900
- I'm not good at games like this.
- So Min is the worst.

1132
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,610
Each of you has to play
several rounds.

1133
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,480
And Haha, since you have
an injured back,

1134
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,710
- please be an MC.
- Understood.

1135
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,960
- Okay. We'll definitely win this.
- Okay.

1136
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,060
- Jong Kook, just enjoy the victory.
- We'll win this for sure.

1137
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,730
- I'm not expecting that.
- We'll definitely win this.

1138
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,020
Jong Kook, don't be like that.

1139
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,230
- Let's see how it goes.
- Don't be like that.

1140
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,730
I have one simple question.

1141
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,090
I want to know if Kim Grand Award
is upset right now.

1142
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,130
(I want to know if Kim Grand Award
is upset right now.)

1143
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,630
- No, I'm not.
- What?

1144
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,040
- I'm very excited now.
- Of course.

1145
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,540
- He says he's not upset.
- He's smiling.

1146
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,730
- I smile all the time.
- He denied it.

1147
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,750
- I smile all the time, you know.
- Your team members look...

1148
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,040
- He's smiling right now.
- Okay. I accept that.

1149
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,710
- Don't get the wrong idea.
- Exactly.

1150
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,420
By the way,
why do the team members...

1151
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,610
- comfort and encourage the leader?
- That's not true.

1152
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,420
Isn't it usually
the other way around?

1153
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,060
Well... I know.

1154
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:48,000
So who'd like to compete first?

1155
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,020
- First...
- How about Kwang Soo?

1156
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,900
- Kwang Soo, set an example.
- Got it.

1157
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,630
- Then...
- Jae Suk or So Min...

1158
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,690
Okay.

1159
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,810
- Jong Kook, you'll host the game.
- Me?

1160
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,630
Kwang Soo, you have to do well...

1161
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,710
if you want to get
on Jong Kook's good side.

1162
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,980
- I'll win for sure.
- Got it.

1163
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,400
- Let's do this.
- Touch the body part he names.

1164
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,920
Grab the bowl only
when he yells the word "Bowl".

1165
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Okay.

1166
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,110
Here we go.

1167
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,960
(Both are tense.)

1168
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,710
- Eyes.
- This isn't easy.

1169
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,150
Nose.

1170
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,250
Mouth. Knees.

1171
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,690
Right toes.

1172
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,150
Now, left toes.

1173
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,290
Right toes.

1174
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,590
Left toes, right toes.

1175
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,190
Hold on a second.

1176
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,960
(Gradually moving forward)

1177
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,400
- What?
- Stop walking toward it.

1178
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,710
- You were moving forward.
- This is wrong.

1179
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,270
- Got it.
- That's wrong.

1180
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,040
- Right toes.
- That's how he lived his life.

1181
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,540
Left toes.

1182
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,980
Left toes, right toes.

1183
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,190
Top of the head.

1184
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,690
Please stand back up.

1185
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,560
- Please stand back up.
- He's close to calling it.

1186
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,130
- He's close to calling it.
- Left chest.

1187
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,960
Right chest.

1188
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,150
Left chest.

1189
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,860
Right chest.

1190
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,020
Left chest.

1191
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,900
- Jae Suk, lower your hands.
- Lower your hands!

1192
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,270
- You...
- Lower your hands.

1193
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,500
- Hey!
- Your hands were up too high.

1194
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,400
- Your hands should be here.
- Don't be ridiculous!

1195
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,840
- Lower your hands.
- That's absurd.

1196
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,340
They should be down here.

1197
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,770
- Right here.
- No way.

1198
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,340
When you work out at the gym,
I bet you go like this.

1199
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,310
No way. Hey!

1200
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,540
Jae Suk.

1201
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,820
Are you kidding me?

1202
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,820
- Like this?
- Grab where your chest is at.

1203
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,040
(His nipples can't fight gravity.)

1204
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,860
- Seriously?
- Grab where your chest is at.

1205
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,960
Got it.

1206
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,790
(He lowers his hands a bit.)

1207
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,880
- Left knee.
- All right.

1208
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,290
Left knee, right knee.

1209
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,630
Left toes.

1210
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,290
Right toes.

1211
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,670
Left heel.

1212
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,440
He'll soon call it.

1213
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,860
(It's about time
he calls for the bowl.)

1214
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,170
Top of the head, bowl!

1215
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,170
Top of the head, bowl!

1216
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,900
- What?
- Look.

1217
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,980
I ducked.

1218
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,000
(Kwang Soo grabbed the bowl.)

1219
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,250
(But Jae Suk quickly ducked.)

1220
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,310
I ducked.

1221
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,380
(Yoo Grand Award outplays
Kwang Soo.)

1222
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,820
- Kwang Soo wins.
- Nice!

1223
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,380
- Okay!
- Good job.

1224
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,150
- Nice.
- Only one bowl remains.

1225
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,650
That was close.

1226
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,480
The score is 1 to 0.

1227
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,590
- Good.
- That was close.

1228
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,900
Kwang Soo, you're doing good.

1229
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,420
I didn't expect him
to say it without pausing.

1230
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,560
All right.

1231
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,820
Ears.

1232
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,900
Eyes, nose, knees.

1233
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,860
Left knee, right knee.

1234
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,960
Right shoulder, left shoulder.

1235
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,440
- You should stand up straight.
- Hey!

1236
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,000
- Are you kidding me?
- I was just getting ready.

1237
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,710
- Stop that.
- Got it.

1238
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,500
- He doesn't take sides.
- Right chest.

1239
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,710
(Right chest)

1240
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,520
- Stand up straight.
- Lower your hands.

1241
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,940
This is the spot.

1242
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,710
This is the actual spot.

1243
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,790
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1244
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,190
It's already quite low.

1245
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,210
- This is the spot.
- That's quite low.

1246
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,320
- My nipple is here.
- Okay.

1247
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,690
Head.

1248
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,360
Stand up straight.
Head, shoulders, knees,

1249
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,670
the buttocks, bowl!

1250
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,630
(Jae Suk was faster this time.)

1251
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,810
(He gets splashed in the face.)

1252
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,000
(He's nimble with accurate aim.)

1253
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,070
It's a tie now.

1254
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,040
- The score is 1 to 1.
- Who's up next?

1255
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,250
Okay. You did well.

1256
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,540
- Then...
- Hold on.

1257
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,690
Why am I against Suk Jin again?

1258
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,840
I always seem to be up against him.

1259
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,460
He sensed that So Min
would be up next,

1260
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,690
so he volunteered.

1261
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,230
- Jae Suk will host the game.
- Okay.

1262
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,590
(The weakest members
go head to head.)

1263
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,860
Sure.

1264
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,900
Here we go.

1265
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,320
I've been going up against
Suk Jin a lot lately.

1266
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,270
(He slowly takes off his jacket.)

1267
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:14,360
Bowl!

1268
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,630
(Bowl!)

1269
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,170
No, wait.

1270
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,500
I was taking off my jacket.

1271
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,810
(Splash!)

1272
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,110
(He gets splashed while laughing.)

1273
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,150
Why...

1274
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,880
Nice one. We scored, right?

1275
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,170
- That counts.
- No, it doesn't.

1276
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,270
I was taking off my jacket.

1277
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,440
How is this fair?

1278
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,090
- That's not fair.
- But the game was on.

1279
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,090
The game's supposed to be
between those two.

1280
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,460
- That's 2 to 1.
- All right.

1281
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,750
That's why...

1282
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,820
- How is this fair?
- You should've called a time-out.

1283
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,590
Why didn't you call a time-out?

1284
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,820
And he's the one who got splashed.

1285
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,420
- Why are you still dry?
- Suk Jin, what was that?

1286
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,290
Why did you take off
your jacket at that moment?

1287
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,130
Anyway, good job.

1288
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,040
- Good job.
- Okay.

1289
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,730
- Nice teamwork.
- Good job.

1290
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,210
- Talk about good teamwork.
- Let's go.

1291
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,650
- Unbelievable.
- Please take a step back.

1292
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,150
Call a time-out if you need one.

1293
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,150
(The unfair match
begins once again.)

1294
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,750
- You need to overcome this.
- And go.

1295
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,040
Pants.

1296
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,520
(Pants!)

1297
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,960
Pants.

1298
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,420
(Pants?)

1299
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,590
Pants?

1300
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:12,860
Yes, pants.

1301
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,500
(Maybe he meant to say, "Bowl".)

1302
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,820
- Wait.
- Don't be flustered...

1303
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,920
and grab your pants.

1304
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,730
Just grab your pants.

1305
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,170
What would you have done
if I were wearing a skirt?

1306
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,840
- A skirt?
- Unbelievable.

1307
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,110
That's so annoying, you know.

1308
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,610
All right.

1309
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,730
Thankfully, they're both
wearing pants.

1310
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,810
(Jae Suk hosts the game
just to entertain himself.)

1311
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:31,840
All right.

1312
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,150
(Everyone collects themselves
and the game restarts.)

1313
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,150
Head.

1314
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,150
- Shoulders.
- Shoulders.

1315
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,290
- Ears.
- Ears.

1316
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,650
Second toe.

1317
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,190
Second toe?

1318
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,420
Grab it with two hands.

1319
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,880
- I like how he is detail-oriented.
- With both hands.

1320
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,190
All right.

1321
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:47,920
The right fifth toe.

1322
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:49,690
Darn it.

1323
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,790
(He grabs his toe.)

1324
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,790
Mouth.

1325
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,460
(Mouth!)

1326
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,460
Mouth?

1327
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,840
What the...

1328
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,110
- What?
- After touching our toes?

1329
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,170
- Jae Suk.
- What's wrong?

1330
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,040
I can't believe
he made them touch their mouth.

1331
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,610
I mean...

1332
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,480
- After the toes...
- He's just being a menace.

1333
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,170
- That was a good one.
- What was wrong with it?

1334
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,170
- There are hygiene issues.
- That was a good one.

1335
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,210
- Be careful with it then.
- The mouth after the toes?

1336
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,820
Who cares, right?

1337
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,090
Be careful with it.

1338
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,360
- Why?
- You've got this.

1339
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,880
But I won.

1340
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,190
Let's move on to the next round.

1341
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,000
- Should I go next?
- Sure.

1342
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,750
- Haha, go ahead.
- Okay.

1343
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,320
- Is Jae Suk playing?
- From this point on,

1344
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,570
you'll play one round each.

1345
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,540
- Se Chan will probably win.
- Here we go.

1346
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,840
- Let's begin.
- Let's keep the winning streak.

1347
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,270
Let's agree to this
being our basic pose.

1348
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,900
- Okay.
- This will be our basic pose.

1349
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,170
Good idea.

1350
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,130
He can hinge at the hips well.

1351
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,310
Look at how flexible he is.

1352
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,570
- Check that out.
- Look.

1353
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,610
- All right.
- It hurts.

1354
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:41,820
Please shake hands.

1355
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,210
- Sure.
- Good game.

1356
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,790
High-five each other.

1357
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,110
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

1358
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,560
- Play fair.
- The game will begin.

1359
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,630
Applaud!

1360
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,190
(Wow!)

1361
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,400
- Massage each other's shoulders.
- Each other's?

1362
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,690
Yes, each other's.

1363
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,070
You're giving us useless orders.

1364
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,630
Those are some weird orders.

1365
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,770
I like the friendly vibes.

1366
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,170
Please rub your forehead.

1367
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,900
- Okay.
- All right.

1368
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,630
- Now your eyebrows.
- Okay.

1369
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,070
- And applaud.
- Applaud!

1370
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:12,840
- Hike up your pants a little.
- Got it.

1371
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,170
While eating kalguksu
with manila clams.

1372
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,520
- Kalguksu.
- All right.

1373
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,980
- We're eating.
- And...

1374
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,480
applaud!

1375
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,210
Are we at a market?

1376
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,360
Pants, pants,

1377
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,320
pants, pants,

1378
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,290
pants, pants, pants, pants,

1379
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,060
p, p, p, p,

1380
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,400
p, p, p, p, p.

1381
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,860
(The beat intensifies.)

1382
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,400
(Are you ready?)

1383
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,540
(Dance break!)

1384
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,590
Nice!

1385
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,900
Nicely done, Haha.

1386
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,980
(He bounces like crazy.)

1387
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,000
Good one, Se Chan.

1388
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:43,380
Don't forget
you're playing this game.

1389
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,880
- Nice.
- Keep going.

1390
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,250
(He's lost in the dancing.)

1391
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,880
- Pants.
- Go, go.

1392
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,820
(Things heat up on the dance floor.)

1393
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,610
(Singing)

1394
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,590
(The heated dancing...)

1395
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,090
(reaches its climax.)

1396
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,230
Bowl!

1397
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,090
(Jae Suk was quicker to the bowl.)

1398
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,000
(Se Chan was drunk on the fun
to properly reach for the bowl.)

1399
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,150
Nice!

1400
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,570
Your performance was great though.

1401
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,630
- Nice.
- Your performance.

1402
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,230
You were too invested
in your performance.

1403
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,440
- Next up are So Min and Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

1404
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,540
Nice one.

1405
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,570
Okay, show her what you've got.

1406
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,670
Ji Hyo, I'll have my eyes on you.

1407
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,610
- Jong Kook...
- You can make up for this.

1408
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,670
All right.

1409
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,440
- Right.
- Here we go.

1410
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,040
Let's go!

1411
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,840
- Let's keep it speedy.
- I'll start off with an easy one.

1412
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,290
- Head.
- Ji Hyo will definitely win.

1413
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,480
Shoulders.

1414
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,750
Knees.

1415
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,460
Stay on alert.

1416
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,920
Toes, knees.

1417
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,560
- He's close.
- Toes, knees.

1418
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,960
Use your upper body too.

1419
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,860
Toes, knees. Toes...

1420
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,340
- Is this a workout?
- Why are you making them work out?

1421
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,340
This isn't a workout program.

1422
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,810
- Your upper body should...
- Is this a workout?

1423
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,440
- Unbelievable.
- What's with the hands?

1424
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,270
- Why...
- They aren't here to work out.

1425
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,810
- Quality over quantity.
- Don't make them do squats.

1426
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:51,880
Do it properly.

1427
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,040
Toes, knees, toes, knees. Like this.

1428
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,340
- Why are you making them work out?
- Just do it for me.

1429
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,520
Lift your torso up slightly.

1430
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,980
Toes, knees.

1431
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,210
- You're not a gym teacher.
- Toes, knees.

1432
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,380
Is this a workout program?

1433
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,880
They're listening
to his instructions though.

1434
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,520
Grab your knees.

1435
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,790
Toes.

1436
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,500
- Knees.
- Check him out.

1437
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,460
- Toes, knees.
- He's loving it.

1438
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,860
- Toes, knees.
- Look at them.

1439
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,900
He's close to saying it.

1440
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,770
Seriously?

1441
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,730
(The deadlifts summon Bad Ji Hyo.)

1442
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,810
Just say it already.

1443
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,770
- The game should be played.
- Right.

1444
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,570
How long must this go on?

1445
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,900
She's right.

1446
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,840
- Right.
- I wanted you to work out.

1447
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,340
- An exercise...
- She's right.

1448
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,520
I just wanted you to work out.

1449
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,420
Ji Hyo, just bear with him, okay?

1450
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,650
Take deep breaths.

1451
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,820
- Ji Hyo, you've got this.
- Take deep breaths.

1452
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,520
You have the perfect pose though.

1453
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,960
Ji Hyo, I'm glad you did it.

1454
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,020
(Bad Ji Hyo said
what the others couldn't say.)

1455
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,400
Ji Hyo, good one.

1456
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,070
Toes, bowl.

1457
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,590
(So Min takes the win
over an exhausted Ji Hyo.)

1458
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,070
- Wow.
- Nice.

1459
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,360
(I won!)

1460
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,360
Nice.

1461
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,610
You gave her a hint,
but it didn't work.

1462
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:54,630
You did well though.

1463
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,040
The score is 4 to 4.

1464
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,810
- Okay.
- So this'll be the last round.

1465
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,310
- One last round.
- Right.

1466
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,750
- It'll end with this round.
- Right.

1467
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,150
- This'll decide who wins.
- Yes.

1468
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,880
- This'll be the last round.
- Our team will host the game.

1469
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:09,210
But Suk Jin once
hosted "Star Golden Bell".

1470
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,750
But it's our turn...

1471
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,980
to host the game.

1472
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,480
Let Se Chan do it this time.

1473
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,750
Sure, Se Chan can host the game.

1474
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,060
(Bitter)

1475
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,320
- Nice.
- We've done it many times,

1476
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,070
- so Se Chan...
- Suk Jin should.

1477
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,900
Suk Jin seems disappointed.

1478
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,340
No, I'm good.

1479
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,460
- Suk Jin.
- I'm good.

1480
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,570
Let Suk Jin host the game.

1481
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,940
- I'm fine.
- Suk Jin's sulking!

1482
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,270
Let him do it, darn it.

1483
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,500
- I'm fine!
- Seriously?

1484
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,750
- Guys, wait.
- Just go ahead.

1485
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,900
Suk Jin, go ahead.

1486
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,170
He's the former host
of "Star Golden Bell", remember?

1487
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,920
(Suk Jin reluctantly steps over
to the center.)

1488
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,920
Let's go!

1489
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,320
- Remember "Six Heroines"!
- "Six Heroines".

1490
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,020
<i>Catch rats, catch rats,
squeak, squeak, squeak</i>

1491
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,480
Here we go.

1492
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,730
This'll decide who wins, right?

1493
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,020
I like your tone!

1494
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,460
- Let's go, let's go!
- Let's win this.

1495
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,250
- Let's go!
- It's the final round!

1496
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,500
Okay!

1497
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,500
(The current Grand Award winner
of "SBS Entertainment Awards")

1498
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,670
(He aims to bring down
the previous Grand Award winner.)

1499
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:01,130
(The opponent is Jae Suk who holds
more Grand Awards than anyone.)

1500
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,150
(And the master MC Big Brother
who's suitable for the big match)

1501
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,380
(The big match
with perfect participants)

1502
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,750
(What will be the result?)

1503
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,980
Head.

1504
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:12,820
Ears.

1505
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:15,290
Nose!

1506
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,750
Eyes. Eyes, nose,

1507
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,650
ears. Ears.

1508
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,190
- He fell asleep!
- Jae Suk!

1509
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,920
(Because Suk Jin's
way of hosting is boring,)

1510
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,320
(Jae Suk slowly fell asleep.)

1511
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,790
- Jae Suk! Wake up!
- You're in the middle of a game!

1512
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,840
- You're playing a game!
- Give him some time.

1513
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,730
- Hey! What are you doing?
- You're in the middle of a game!

1514
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,340
- You're in the middle of a game!
- What do you think you're doing?

1515
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,340
It was so boring.

1516
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,810
- He fell deeply asleep.
- It'll get fun soon.

1517
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:38,810
- Give him some time.
- Jae Suk.

1518
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,770
- He was hosting it.
- Jae Suk!

1519
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:42,980
- I'm so sorry.
- Give him some time, Jae Suk.

1520
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,110
- I apologize.
- Give him some time, Jae Suk.

1521
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,020
- I can't stand it when it's boring.
- You know how he's like.

1522
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,650
- It'll get better soon.
- He has his own style.

1523
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:51,690
- He was just getting warmed up.
- It'll get better soon.

1524
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:52,750
Everyone!

1525
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,730
Everyone, if you play with that
mindset, it's bound to be boring.

1526
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,570
- You need to be open-minded.
- Jae Suk...

1527
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,130
I knew he'd do that the moment
he let Suk Jin host it.

1528
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,270
He was going to do that.

1529
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,400
I guess you're enjoying this.

1530
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,670
- I'll let you enjoy all you want.
- Okay.

1531
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,480
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

1532
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,840
I can't stand it when it's boring.

1533
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,250
- Do you find this fun? Okay.
- Yes.

1534
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,400
- It's okay.
- He was about to say...

1535
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,570
something fun right after that.

1536
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,980
He has his own tactics.
You should all give him some time.

1537
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,110
I'm sorry that I fell asleep.

1538
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,820
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- If you keep this up,

1539
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,750
- it'll get boring.
- I'm sorry.

1540
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,230
- Give him some time.
- Eyes.

1541
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,360
- Nose.
- Nose.

1542
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,690
- Ears.
- Ears.

1543
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,090
- Poke your nostrils. Mouth.
- Poke your nostrils.

1544
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,790
(This is where it's supposed
to be funny.)

1545
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,020
Poke your nostrils.

1546
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,040
(He told them to poke their nostrils
out of nowhere.)

1547
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,730
(A bystander passed out
after hearing Suk Jin.)

1548
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,860
- Ears.
- This is terrible.

1549
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,940
- Aren't you having fun?
- Sir, please get up!

1550
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,110
- Excuse me.
- Hey, hey!

1551
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:43,810
- Hey!
- He passed out. Hey!

1552
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,310
How can you pass out
when we're rolling?

1553
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,670
Sir, please get up!

1554
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,420
(A couple of professional
TV personalities passed out.)

1555
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,980
(How can you pass out
when we're rolling?)

1556
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,940
- You shouldn't fall asleep.
- It's not time to be sleeping.

1557
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,090
- Get up.
- Did you find that boring?

1558
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:57,250
- Wake him up.
- Were we in the middle of a shoot?

1559
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,820
- But...
- Get up, you guys.

1560
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,820
- Get up! Get up, So Min.
- Wake them up.

1561
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,730
- We are in the middle of a shoot.
- Wake them up.

1562
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,790
- Get up!
- We were rolling?

1563
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,900
- What's wrong with me?
- If you give me more time...

1564
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,360
If you play with that mindset,

1565
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,860
- it's bound to be boring.
- Get to your senses.

1566
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,400
Who told you that you can
fall asleep during the shoot?

1567
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,440
Who dares to fall asleep?

1568
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,460
Who...

1569
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,070
Who told you that you can
fall asleep during the shoot?

1570
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,650
(I need to come to my senses!
I need to wake up!)

1571
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,520
- Gosh, that was so boring.
- That's enough!

1572
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,340
- What's wrong with me?
- I said that's enough.

1573
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,690
Let me open the door.
Let's get some fresh air.

1574
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:26,920
- Let the fresh air in!
- Come on.

1575
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,940
Please open the door.

1576
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,090
- Why am I so sleepy today?
- It's okay.

1577
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,110
It's okay, everyone.

1578
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:32,480
Everyone, come here.
You need to wake up.

1579
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,560
We need to wake up!

1580
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,500
- Did you get some fresh air?
- Yes, it's nice.

1581
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,320
- Nostrils? That was...
- My gosh.

1582
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,960
Look at these ungrateful jerks.

1583
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,000
- Why would you curse at us?
- No, I meant...

1584
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,730
You're having so much fun,
aren't you?

1585
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,500
- I'll make this fun.
- Okay.

1586
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,340
- Knees.
- Knees.

1587
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,710
Knees, toes.

1588
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,900
- I'm so excited.
- Knees, toes, toes.

1589
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,340
Put your foreheads together.

1590
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,570
- Put your foreheads together.
- What?

1591
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:55,710
- Put your foreheads together.
- You can't fall asleep here.

1592
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,040
Put your foreheads together!

1593
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,340
(Put your foreheads together!)

1594
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,020
(Ji-rasoni who's been holding back
finally explodes.)

1595
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,320
Just do as you're told!

1596
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,820
Put your foreheads together!

1597
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,630
Do the finale pose
for Andre Kim's shows!

1598
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,020
- But we're wearing caps.
- But...

1599
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,820
- How could we...
- You should've checked...

1600
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,860
You should check in advance...

1601
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,130
- before telling us anything.
- He's right.

1602
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,570
- Everyone, if you keep this up,
- Okay, okay.

1603
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,360
it's impossible for you to have fun!

1604
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,670
- Hey, hey! Kwang Soo!
- What's wrong with you?

1605
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,570
- Don't pass out. Kwang Soo. No.
- Kwang Soo...

1606
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,110
He's sleeping with his eyes open!

1607
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:23,340
- Don't fall asleep!
- Hey.

1608
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,900
Don't fall asleep!

1609
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,570
- What was that?
- Don't fall asleep.

1610
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,020
(He gets startled and wakes up.)

1611
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,380
- Kwang Soo, you can't.
- Were we in the middle of a shoot?

1612
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,820
(A first-class MC who laughs
even when he's struggling)

1613
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,040
Don't fall asleep.

1614
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,290
(He washes his face with cold water
when he's sleepy.)

1615
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:36,520
- Don't fall asleep.
- Are you okay?

1616
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,730
(It's impossible to play the game
with Suk Jin hosting.)

1617
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,560
Okay, I got it. Since the atmosphere
is all ruined, I'll finish it fast.

1618
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,360
- I'll finish within 3 seconds.
- 3 seconds? Okay.

1619
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,690
- I'm not in great condition.
- Forehead.

1620
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,000
- Forehead.
- Eyes.

1621
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,820
You're not sleepy, are you?

1622
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,570
Forehead, eyes. Knees!

1623
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,940
Forehead.

1624
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,960
(Keeping the tension as it's
the last game, the game continues.)

1625
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,000
Guys!

1626
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,400
Eyes, ears.

1627
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,980
Nose.

1628
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,170
Bowl!

1629
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,170
(Bowl!)

1630
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,250
(He finally yelled out "bowl"!)

1631
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,290
Why aren't you grabbing it?

1632
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,250
- Yes!
- Are you asleep? He's asleep!

1633
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,750
- He fell asleep!
- He's asleep.

1634
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,520
(While they were in the middle
of the game,)

1635
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,460
(he couldn't fight against
the boredom and fell asleep.)

1636
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,770
(Are you asleep?)

1637
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:20,590
(He's asleep!)

1638
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,590
- We won!
- He fell asleep.

1639
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,690
- Is it over?
- We were in the middle of a game!

1640
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,360
It's over?

1641
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,440
But I just dozed off!

1642
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,000
But I just dozed off!

1643
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,710
(The final round was over
while he dozed off.)

1644
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,770
It's over already?

1645
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,020
- Yes!
- But I just dozed off!

1646
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,940
- We won.
- Isn't that cheating?

1647
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,210
I dozed off only briefly!

1648
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,440
- You should take responsibility!
- Why did you doze off?

1649
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,690
- What a shame.
- Listen!

1650
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,320
- Were you sleepy?
- I dozed off only briefly.

1651
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,360
- You must've been sleepy.
- I'm so sorry.

1652
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,480
I'm sorry, Haha.

1653
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,590
- We won.
- I had no idea.

1654
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,820
So he had a strategy all along.

1655
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,090
- Of course.
- That was his strategy.

1656
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,340
That was his strategy.

1657
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,540
- He used his skills though!
- But this is...

1658
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,840
- It's cheating! That's right.
- It's cheating.

1659
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,960
Didn't he hypnotize me?

1660
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,500
It's not fair!
He made us fall asleep.

1661
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,500
Didn't he hypnotize me?

1662
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,440
But Jong Kook overcame
the boredom...

1663
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,710
- and rightfully won.
- I had a good sleep in a long time.

1664
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,820
- That's good.
- That's why I didn't fall asleep.

1665
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,380
That's the power of deep sleep!

1666
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,790
(Getting deep sleep is the best!)

1667
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:14,750
Thanks to Suk Jin's hosting,

1668
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,560
Team Kim Grand Award won.

1669
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,560
(Thanks to Suk Jin who induced
sleep, Team Kim Grand Award won.)

1670
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,820
- I guess there's no other option.
- Yes!

1671
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,590
Everyone on Team Kim Grand Award
earned 10 points.

1672
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,230
And everyone on Team Yoo Grand Award
got minus three points.

1673
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,500
- So what's going to happen?
- So Min...

1674
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,690
Look at So Min.

1675
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,440
The team she's on always loses.
I'm sorry.

1676
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,840
- What do I do?
- So Min,

1677
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,040
- it's okay.
- What do I do?

1678
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,770
- I have such few points.
- I feel so refreshed.

1679
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,380
Thank goodness
I had a deep sleep last night.

1680
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,210
- I had a pig dream last night.
- I had a good sleep.

1681
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,250
We'll now have lunch.

1682
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,270
- Okay.
- Wow.

1683
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:45,980
The team leaders should wait
in their rooms.

1684
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,980
This time, there aren't any points
on the line.

1685
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,610
The rest of you will step outside,

1686
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:53,790
and you'll head to the room you want
with your bowl of rice.

1687
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,900
- You can have your lunch there.
- Okay.

1688
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,060
- Since we won't...
- Someone I want to have lunch with?

1689
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,590
Since no points are involved,
this is a popularity contest, right?

1690
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,790
- That's right.
- All right then.

1691
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,130
- Let's go.
- Oh, we're just having lunch.

1692
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,790
- It's not about our looks.
- I slept too much.

1693
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:04,630
Everyone had a good sleep.

1694
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,570
(Yoo Grand Award's room
during lunchtime)

1695
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:07,570
What's this?

1696
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,610
Oh, it's ramyeon.

1697
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:10,730
(Ramyeon?)

1698
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,810
Ramyeon is good enough for us.

1699
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,840
We don't need to eat much
for lunch.

1700
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,840
(All instant foods are prepared
for a ramyeon lover.)

1701
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,980
I love the menu.

1702
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,150
(He's satisfied.)

1703
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,480
Are they having ramyeon too?

1704
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,040
(What's Kim Grand Award
having for lunch?)

1705
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,060
What do I do?

1706
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,250
(The rest of the members
have to make their choices.)

1707
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,730
- What do I do?
- I've made up my mind.

1708
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,960
- Who are you picking?
- I want to eat comfortably.

1709
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,590
You're picking Jae Suk?
I also want to eat with Jae Suk.

1710
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,770
But you have to think carefully.
He'll get upset for real.

1711
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,320
- But lunch is okay.
- Don't think about that.

1712
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,790
- Lunch is okay.
- Lunch is okay.

1713
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:36,340
- So only when we play games...
- But you'll go to Jong Kook...

1714
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,840
and be adored by him.

1715
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,840
I'm not one to be adored by anyone.
He should be adored by me.

1716
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,130
What are you saying?

1717
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:44,270
- You did a lot of cute acts today.
- He's right.

1718
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,500
It's humiliating.

1719
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,840
- He did cute acts when he's 50.
- That's not true. I didn't do that.

1720
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,070
With eyes filled with love,

1721
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,820
- he wanted to be adored.
- I'm not the one to be adored.

1722
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,440
He's just a younger brother
who needs a pat on the back.

1723
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,460
Then I'll go first.

1724
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,560
- You can go next.
- Let's just close our eyes.

1725
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,420
- I'm off then.
- Okay.

1726
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,750
I'll go next.

1727
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,820
(Se Chan chooses the room first.)

1728
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,730
(He picked Jae Suk.)

1729
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,290
- My goodness.
- My goodness, Se Chan.

1730
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,730
I should eat with you...

1731
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,170
- to be comfortable.
- Of course.

1732
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,570
Se Chan...

1733
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,230
He doesn't eat ramyeon, you know.

1734
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,610
Of course we should have ramyeon.

1735
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:18,610
There you go.

1736
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,670
The girl who likes soups is here.

1737
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,110
We're having ramyeon.

1738
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:24,710
- I love ramyeon, Jae Suk.
- I make delicious ramyeon.

1739
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,520
Who is going next?
You should set off, Haha.

1740
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,210
I'm going to Jong Kook's room.

1741
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:32,920
I'm picking Jong Kook too.

1742
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,060
(The minions of Jong Kook
are on their way.)

1743
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,230
Which room are you picking?

1744
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,570
I don't know. What should I do?

1745
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,090
Which room are you picking?
Let's divide the members in half.

1746
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,730
If too many people go to
Jong Kook's room,

1747
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,770
- I'll go to Jae Suk's room.
- To Jae Suk?

1748
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:44,790
Yes.

1749
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,340
(But he picked Jong Kook.)

1750
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,310
- I'm loyal to you, Jong Kook.
- Suk Jin.

1751
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,440
Our lunch is like the penalty.

1752
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,670
Our lunch is the penalty.
Look at this.

1753
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,440
We prepared the foods
Jong Kook likes.

1754
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,210
You can have chicken breast
and low-sodium food for lunch.

1755
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:04,060
He doesn't eat like this!
He loves tangsuyuk and fritters!

1756
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,690
I eat cup noodles these days.

1757
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,290
- That's right.
- He doesn't eat these.

1758
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,650
How can we have almonds with rice?

1759
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,150
Why did they give us almonds?

1760
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,320
We could've been in big trouble.

1761
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,770
If he ate this alone...

1762
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,840
That'd be horrible.

1763
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,400
If that happened, I'd have
removed the photo of us smiling...

1764
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,840
that's hanging in our restaurant.

1765
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,770
But this is just a game.

1766
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:25,040
- No, it's not.
- Okay?

1767
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,750
Don't put your entire life on this.

1768
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,540
You picked Jae Suk for both rounds.

1769
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,020
- That's...
- You could've picked me once.

1770
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,340
- Don't you agree, Suk Jin?
- Haha.

1771
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,820
If you remove Jong Kook
from the photo, put me in.

1772
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,090
(Pro investor Ji found a chance
to invest his money.)

1773
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,130
Suk Jin, why would you
grab that chance?

1774
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,150
Suk Jin, go ahead.

1775
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,020
You can go ahead.

1776
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,520
My goodness. So Min.

1777
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,170
(So Min picked Team Yoo Grand Award
this time as well.)

1778
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,860
Can I put the noodles in?

1779
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,230
Where? The water is not boiling yet.

1780
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,340
Do you have ketchup?

1781
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,500
- I love...
- The ketchup is here.

1782
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,710
how you're being considerate.

1783
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:57,210
- "Can I put them in?"
- Thank you, Ji Hyo.

1784
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,380
Aren't we kind?

1785
00:58:58,670 --> 00:58:59,980
If it was Jong Kook,
he'd have said this.

1786
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,210
"Don't put it in."

1787
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:03,710
- "It's not good for your health."
- "Don't put it in, you punk!"

1788
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,980
"You're so thoughtless."

1789
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,480
He'd have said that.

1790
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,150
(Kim Grand Award is not
good at expressing his love.)

1791
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,980
This feels like a ramyeon club.

1792
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,020
- Right?
- Yes.

1793
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,360
The egg looks like a flower.

1794
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,400
(The egg looks like a flower.)

1795
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,400
It looks like thick clouds.

1796
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,400
I've never seen anyone who makes
meringue out of ramyeon.

1797
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,940
I love how no one is negative here.

1798
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,690
- Let's eat now! Get your portion.
- No one is negative. Now?

1799
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:25,710
Look at this.

1800
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,130
(They share the ramyeon in peace.)

1801
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,480
- This is how you should eat.
- Oh, like that?

1802
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,710
- Thank you.
- The noodles are cooked perfectly.

1803
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,270
There's more, so help yourself.

1804
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,670
- How did he make it so delicious?
- This is amazing.

1805
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,710
The noodles are so chewy.

1806
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,790
- Let's add gochujang.
- Add the chicken breast here.

1807
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:44,250
(Kim Grand Award loves
the protein-based meal.)

1808
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,730
(Putting chicken breast
into the chicken shake)

1809
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,060
That's the worst.

1810
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,520
It seriously is.
How do you eat it like that?

1811
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,150
It tastes okay because
the chicken breast doesn't smell.

1812
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,900
(Kim Protein, the PR ambassador
of chicken breast)

1813
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,170
It doesn't smell at all.

1814
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,090
(Kim Grand Award gets excited
for consuming protein.)

1815
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:58,900
- This is good.
- You're smiling?

1816
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,310
Try it. Try it like this.

1817
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,570
- It must be good. He's smiling.
- Okay, okay.

1818
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,500
- Kwang Soo, try it.
- I like it.

1819
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,810
Try it like this. It tastes okay.
Try it, Kwang Soo.

1820
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,150
Try it with the shake.

1821
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,540
Please come out!

1822
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,040
I feel sleepy now.

1823
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,610
Goodness, I'm so full.

1824
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,710
We had chicken breast.

1825
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,290
I heard you had chicken breasts.

1826
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:18,980
This place serves good food.
We had ramyeon,

1827
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,190
- meatballs, and sausages.
- We had meatballs too.

1828
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:23,250
- Sausages too.
- We even added eggs to ramyeon.

1829
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,560
How will you face Jong Kook now?

1830
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,900
What? It's okay, it's just a meal.

1831
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,500
But Jong Kook is really upset
right now.

1832
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,570
I won't see him then.

1833
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:30,790
(He acts tough.)

1834
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,460
- I'll run away.
- You've got some guts.

1835
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,170
I decided to stay on this team
for good.

1836
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,900
Ji Hyo must be sleeping in the room.

1837
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,900
(Ji Hyo must be
sleeping in the room.)

1838
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,210
- Really?
- She's really sleeping?

1839
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,750
She must think we are at Boracay.

1840
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:44,170
(Kim Grand Award's room)

1841
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:45,440
(Exclaiming)

1842
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,520
We're going out?

1843
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,650
- She's unbelievable.
- She must think we are at Boracay.

1844
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,520
- Hey.
- We're not at Boracay, Ji Hyo.

1845
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,520
- You fell asleep?
- What's happening?

1846
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,060
We're not at a vacation spot.

1847
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,380
- Why did you fall asleep?
- What's wrong with you?

1848
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,900
Why did you come out of that room?

1849
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,730
Come to your senses, Ji Hyo.

1850
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,520
Ji Hyo has been sleeping
since earlier.

1851
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,690
She fell asleep when you were
hosting, and she just got up.

1852
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,090
- I made you fall asleep?
- I'm sorry.

1853
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,570
- She even missed lunch.
- Thank you, Suk Jin.

1854
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,070
I slept soundly thanks to you.

1855
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,210
My youngest daughter hasn't been
able to sleep well recently.

1856
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,480
Could you host the game
at my place once?

1857
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,980
I'll pay a visit.

1858
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,380
- Oh, gosh.
- What's wrong?

1859
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,020
(The staff member who was behind
suddenly fell down.)

1860
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,570
You see?
Someone just fell asleep again!

1861
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:18,710
- She fell asleep because of you!
- Hey!

1862
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:19,940
We need Jae Suk here!

1863
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,150
- Suk Jin will get mad for real.
- Don't do that to Suk Jin.

1864
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,090
Why do so many people
pass out these days?

1865
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:25,560
Go and wash your face
with the seawater.

1866
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,590
(Go and wash your face
with the seawater.)

1867
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:27,860
Washing your face
wakes you up right away.

1868
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,590
Is today's special
about superpowers?

1869
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,630
Did you take a potion or something?

1870
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:33,630
(Did you take
a potion or something?)

1871
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:35,540
Is today really about superpowers?

1872
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,070
All right. Now this will be
your last mission.

1873
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,860
Your choice of team
will be very important.

1874
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:43,730
- That's right.
- I'll go first.

1875
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,840
(Ji Hyo sets off confidently.)

1876
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:49,570
It's cold outside, and they're
taking longer than I thought.

1877
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:51,270
(Opening)

1878
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:52,710
Oh, dear.

1879
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:55,090
(She opened the door confidently,)

1880
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:57,560
(but fell down right away.)

1881
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,820
- Ji Hyo.
- Gosh, it hurts.

1882
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:02,790
Hey, are you okay?

1883
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:04,500
Why would you greet me
with your foot?

1884
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,790
- Hey, well done.
- I was glad to see you.

1885
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,190
- You made the right choice.
- You see, I...

1886
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,360
Your last team should be my team.

1887
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,310
I should be with you until the end.

1888
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:13,400
Right. Well done.

1889
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:15,810
(Who will the other members choose?)

1890
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,980
Jae Suk.

1891
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,310
(Jae Suk!)

1892
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:20,840
(Suk Jin chose
Team Yoo Grand Award.)

1893
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,110
- Hey, Suk Jin.
- I chose your team at last.

1894
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,790
I think your team will win
the last mission.

1895
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:27,710
Gosh, you and your skill
to make everyone sleep.

1896
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,290
I'm choosing you no matter what.

1897
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,560
- My goodness.
- It depends on the game though.

1898
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,560
I think...

1899
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,250
we'll be having a quiz.
See? They set up everything for it.

1900
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,460
Gosh, I think
I'm really quick-witted.

1901
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,730
This is insane.

1902
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:41,730
Jae Suk!

1903
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,290
- Darn it, it's Suk Jin!
- Hey, Haha.

1904
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,630
- Hey.
- Haha is loyal.

1905
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,070
- My goodness.
- I'm loyal, aren't I?

1906
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,840
- My goodness.
- I ate with Jong Kook, but...

1907
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,710
- Haha.
- Hello, Jae Suk.

1908
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:53,170
- Hey, Jae Suk.
- You're here, Kwang Soo.

1909
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,320
- The empty-headed ones are here.
- I'm back home.

1910
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,420
- Gosh.
- Kwang Soo.

1911
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,420
You ran away from home though.

1912
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,590
This is what they set up
for the last game.

1913
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,320
- You need to sit here.
- It's a quiz.

1914
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,290
- It's a quiz.
- It's the last game, but...

1915
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,480
We'll win no matter what.

1916
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,820
Another one is here.

1917
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:07,820
Hello, did you enjoy your lunch?

1918
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:09,290
- My goodness.
- This is driving me crazy.

1919
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,690
- Everyone's joining Jae Suk?
- I can't believe it.

1920
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,920
(Things are getting worse
and worse.)

1921
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,590
We're family since we ate together.

1922
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,400
- There are six of us.
- You should've gone there.

1923
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,290
- You should join his team.
- Why?

1924
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:21,000
- You decided to just...
- This is driving me crazy.

1925
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,610
Look what they set up here.

1926
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:24,000
- What's happening?
- Another one?

1927
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,300
(What's happening?)

1928
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,410
- Hey!
- Oh, no.

1929
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:44,840
(Another member chose Jae Suk?)

1930
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,870
- What's happening?
- Another one?

1931
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,870
(Even So Min is joining
Team Yoo Grand Award?)

1932
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,620
- What's happening?
- But Jong Kook...

1933
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:50,680
Ji Hyo is the only one...

1934
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,850
(If So Min is here as well,)

1935
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,640
(then Ji Hyo is the only one
who's with Jong Kook?)

1936
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,220
There's only two of them?

1937
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,320
- Jong Kook must be really upset.
- Too many people are here, Bo Pil.

1938
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,490
Too many people are here.

1939
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:00,530
Jong Kook must be extremely upset.

1940
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:02,930
- I'm sure he's furious.
- Jong Kook must be upset.

1941
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:04,030
Then we...

1942
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:05,700
(Right then, the door opens again.)

1943
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,390
- Oh, gosh.
- You scared us.

1944
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:09,140
(Very tense)

1945
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,490
- You chose us too?
- Jae Suk.

1946
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:11,930
- Darn you!
- Jae Suk...

1947
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:12,930
Open the door quietly!

1948
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,840
Jae Suk is totally scared.

1949
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,870
What's going to happen?
I'm feeling anxious.

1950
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:21,140
Everyone has chosen their team.

1951
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,620
- They're done?
- Your team member...

1952
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,820
is Ji Hyo.

1953
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,320
Let's proceed
with the third mission.

1954
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,390
Jong Kook!

1955
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:31,120
It's okay. Don't worry. Well done.

1956
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,490
It's fine. I made up my mind...

1957
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,220
- But...
- to play alone anyway.

1958
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,530
What's going on, seriously?

1959
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,320
My gosh.

1960
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,030
(He's on his way to meet them.)

1961
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:41,430
Gosh. Fine.

1962
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:43,160
I've already chosen
who'll get the penalty.

1963
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,890
(The door to Team Yoo Grand Award's
room has finally opened.)

1964
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:47,100
(He's here.)

1965
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:50,300
- Hello.
- Oh, gosh.

1966
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:53,200
(Look at these guys.)

1967
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:55,100
(We can only hear them dry coughing.
The atmosphere is icy-cold.)

1968
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,140
Hey, Jong Kook.
Don't look at us like that!

1969
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,870
Don't look into my eyes
for more than three seconds.

1970
01:04:58,870 --> 01:04:59,950
- Why not?
- It says so on the contract!

1971
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:01,140
- 1, 2, 3.
- No, I'm not looking at you.

1972
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,720
- What's wrong?
- You're only allowed two seconds.

1973
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,590
Ji Hyo, come.
Where do you want to sit?

1974
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,260
- Where do you want to sit?
- Why did everyone...

1975
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,760
- Come sit in the center.
- You're wearing matching shirts.

1976
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,800
Of course we should.

1977
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,430
My goodness, this is...

1978
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:15,930
I thought we'd be playing a game
Jae Suk is good at.

1979
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:17,760
- I see.
- My goodness.

1980
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,570
Sure, I don't mind.
This is another segment anyway.

1981
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:23,200
- I think they're giving us a quiz.
- I think so too.

1982
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,200
All right. You can turn the tables
through this mission.

1983
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,220
- My gosh.
- Can I just turn them over?

1984
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,680
(They're about to be
turned over by Jong Kook.)

1985
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,490
That's not what he meant.

1986
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:35,090
Don't forget our contract.

1987
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,220
- I have a contract to protect me!
- What? What's wrong?

1988
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,120
Your eyes are...

1989
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,930
Don't stare at us
for more than 3 seconds.

1990
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:41,950
The way he talks...

1991
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:43,990
If they lose this time, they'll...

1992
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,160
- lose a lot of points, right?
- Minus six points.

1993
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,990
That's right.
They'll lose six points.

1994
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,530
I'm sorry,
but are you his girlfriend?

1995
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,010
- Is she...
- They look good together.

1996
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,260
You look good together!

1997
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,700
- You really do.
- You look good together.

1998
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,410
(They look like a couple from
the 1990s visiting Ganghwa Island.)

1999
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:01,100
I can't hold his arm
because his arm is too thick.

2000
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,010
We've been dating for a long time.

2001
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:04,620
- You've dated for a long time?
- Yes.

2002
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,140
- That's cute.
- We've been dating for a long time.

2003
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:08,850
- We've dated for a long time.
- That's nice.

2004
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:10,490
- How do you date for so long?
- Don't we look like a family?

2005
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:11,890
"How do you date for so long?"

2006
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:14,430
You can turn the tables
through the last mission.

2007
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:18,760
It's a mission to check
the intelligence of two smart men.

2008
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,700
- It's a quiz.
- It's called The Uncanny Quiz.

2009
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,370
- Yes!
- It's a quiz!

2010
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,970
Yoo Jae Suk!

2011
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:26,660
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

2012
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,280
- It's okay! Don't worry.
- Yoo Jae Suk!

2013
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,570
- It's okay! It's fine.
- Yoo Jae Suk!

2014
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:34,700
However, it's not an ordinary quiz.

2015
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:37,010
We've prepared fun questions
where you can use...

2016
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:39,490
your reasoning skills
and creativity.

2017
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:42,320
We'll give you a point if all of you
put your heads together...

2018
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,010
and manage to find the answer first.

2019
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,890
- We need to put our heads together?
- That sounds a bit off.

2020
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:49,600
But I have no reasoning skills
at all.

2021
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,930
Empty Head!

2022
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,820
Okay. Okay, I got it.

2023
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,890
(They're in trouble too.)

2024
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:56,890
Maybe they'll tell us
to write a letter each.

2025
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:58,530
- But that's...
- Then it will be...

2026
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:01,140
- a total mess.
- Six fools are... Oh, no.

2027
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,780
What did you just say?

2028
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:05,010
(Six fools)

2029
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,010
(What did you just say?)

2030
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:07,010
What?

2031
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:09,050
- Hey, come here.
- Let go!

2032
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:10,410
- Hey.
- Darn you.

2033
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:11,410
(The six fools flew into a rage.)

2034
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:13,050
- Let's drag him out of here.
- Hey, you.

2035
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:15,510
- Hey, did you call us 6 fools?
- "6 fools"?

2036
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:17,490
- It's "having many fools".
- I'm so offended.

2037
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:20,050
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
He meant to say that to us!

2038
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,530
- Did you call us fools?
- He meant to say that to us!

2039
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:23,300
But he was looking at me
when he said it.

2040
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,220
- All right.
- He meant our team.

2041
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,220
Nice job.

2042
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,340
It's a mission where you need
one genius rather than many fools.

2043
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,870
- Okay.
- You'll get...

2044
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:33,800
- a chance for each question.
- A chance.

2045
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,680
If you can't answer within three
minutes after hearing the question,

2046
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:38,640
one member of the team
can go outside...

2047
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,700
and look for the hidden hints...

2048
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,740
for three minutes.

2049
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,510
- Okay, okay.
- We are good at finding hints.

2050
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,220
Are you telling me
to run around all day long?

2051
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,450
Se Chan, it's cold outside.

2052
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:49,450
Put on a jacket.

2053
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,510
Put on a jacket now.

2054
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,550
You might have to run outside.

2055
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:54,350
Ji Hyo, let's wear a coat.

2056
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:55,620
(Ji Hyo, let's wear a coat.)

2057
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:56,990
Let's wear a coat.

2058
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:58,950
It will be nice to stay warm.

2059
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:00,600
It will be a 1-on-1 match
between me and Ji Hyo.

2060
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,990
Kwang Soo, put a jacket
around your shoulders.

2061
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:04,930
It will be a match.

2062
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:07,570
- I will reveal the first question.
- Okay.

2063
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,070
The first question.

2064
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,640
(Move one match to complete
the equation.)

2065
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,740
(However, do not touch
the equal sign.)

2066
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:15,950
What?

2067
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,620
(Thinking)

2068
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,010
(Slapping the table)

2069
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,240
(Does Jae Suk have an idea?)

2070
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,390
- The equation...
- Let me answer.

2071
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:25,090
- Will you answer right away?
- Yes.

2072
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,760
(Did Jae Suk figure out
the answer already?)

2073
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:27,760
What?

2074
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:29,050
Let me answer.

2075
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,120
I will move the match here.

2076
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:34,070
That works.

2077
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,260
That works.

2078
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,660
You can't touch the equal sign.

2079
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:40,510
- Gosh.
- Let me answer.

2080
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:41,940
Let me answer.

2081
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:43,440
There is a plus sign, right?

2082
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,400
Move the vertical match
so that it becomes an equal sign.

2083
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,440
No! Let me answer.

2084
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,010
- 1 equals 1 equals 1.
- Let me answer.

2085
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:49,070
- Correct.
- Okay!

2086
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:50,440
(Suk Jin changed the plus sign
to an equal sign.)

2087
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,480
The multiplication sign.

2088
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,720
- No, no.
- The equal sign works.

2089
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,410
The equal sign works.
1 equals 1 equals 1.

2090
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:56,260
Okay.

2091
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,410
(Suk Jin completed the equation
by moving one match.)

2092
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,260
All right!

2093
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:02,800
1 equals 1 equals 1.

2094
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,600
Okay.

2095
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,650
(Team Yoo Grand Award won 1 point.)

2096
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,190
Haven't you figured it out yet?

2097
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:08,820
- What did he say?
- I figured it out.

2098
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,360
- It just stood out to me.
- You make the same sign.

2099
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,840
Se Chan, you make
the same inequality sign.

2100
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,840
I thought you had to make
the multiplication sign.

2101
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,770
(He just claps.)

2102
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:19,270
I get it now.

2103
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,370
But why is 1 equals 1 equals 1?

2104
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:22,740
The numbers are the same.

2105
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:23,940
- We did it!
- Okay.

2106
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,370
- Let's go!
- Let's keep going.

2107
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,940
Did we win?

2108
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,220
- Yes.
- How did it end so soon?

2109
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:29,890
- Do you get it now?
- No.

2110
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:31,390
Let's keep going.

2111
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:33,320
- Jong Kook, it's okay.
- It's okay.

2112
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,450
(Team Kim Grand Award
lost a point to the 6 fools.)

2113
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,780
- Here comes the second question.
- Okay.

2114
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,930
(The second question)

2115
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:38,360
(Move 2 coins so that the sum...)

2116
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,430
(of the vertical and horizontal
lines is 70 cents each.)

2117
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:41,860
(However, you must maintain
the shape of a cross.)

2118
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:45,860
- Let's make it.
- 70 cents.

2119
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,030
As it is, the vertical line makes
70 cents...

2120
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,370
and the horizontal line
makes 50 cents.

2121
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:52,610
(The vertical line makes 70 cents
and horizontal line makes 50 cents.)

2122
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:54,070
- This works, right?
- Do we need to move two coins?

2123
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:55,070
Yes.

2124
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:56,910
Do we need to move two coins?

2125
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,550
Like this?

2126
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:59,850
(Kim Grand Award stacks the coins.)

2127
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:00,910
That's right.

2128
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:02,690
You must maintain
the shape of the cross...

2129
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:03,810
and have each line make 70 cents.

2130
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,560
No.

2131
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,590
In total?

2132
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,650
That's right.

2133
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,280
You must maintain
the shape of the cross...

2134
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,860
and have each line make 70 cents.

2135
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,150
- And we can only move two coins.
- Yes.

2136
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:13,190
(Suk Jin is thinking by himself.)

2137
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:14,730
This isn't easy.

2138
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:16,970
- And we can only move two coins.
- Yes.

2139
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:18,770
Should we stack the coins?

2140
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:20,360
If we do that...

2141
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,970
This isn't easy.

2142
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,510
(70 cents and 60 cents)

2143
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:24,570
(The vertical line makes
70 cents...)

2144
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:25,640
(and the horizontal line
makes 60 cents.)

2145
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

2146
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,570
- It's 60 cents.
- Get another coin.

2147
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,310
Move two coins.

2148
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:31,480
If we stack two coins...

2149
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,440
We did it. We are done.

2150
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,440
(Are they done already?)

2151
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,690
This is how you do it.
Let me answer.

2152
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:39,780
Stack the top coin
and the bottom coin in the center.

2153
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:41,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

2154
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,800
Stack the top coin
and the bottom coin in the center.

2155
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

2156
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,800
You stack the coins.

2157
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,930
(The problem required creativity.)

2158
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:48,930
Hey.

2159
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:51,900
I solved it,
but Suk Jin butted in at the end.

2160
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:53,610
- We solved it together.
- That's right.

2161
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:55,270
- We solved it together.
- This is great.

2162
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:56,640
Ajou University!

2163
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,770
(The man who went to Ajou University
did well.)

2164
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:58,770
This one will be hard.

2165
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:00,350
Team Kim Grand Award,
here comes the question.

2166
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:01,550
I will go and find the hints.

2167
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:03,270
You will get a piece of paper.

2168
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,940
Connect the dots
in a single stroke...

2169
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,980
without going over
the same dot twice.

2170
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,590
What?

2171
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,190
(Connect the dots
in a single stroke.)

2172
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:14,360
In a single stroke?

2173
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:16,620
Can you return to the line you drew?

2174
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:17,730
No, you can't.

2175
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:20,620
- You can't go over the dots twice.
- No.

2176
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,320
You can't go over the dots twice.

2177
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,300
(With bated breath,)

2178
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,360
How do you do this?

2179
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:27,730
Like this?

2180
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:29,640
(everyone focuses on
finding the solution.)

2181
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,770
By the way,

2182
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,140
are we entering a program
for gifted children?

2183
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:33,400
This is so hard.

2184
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:34,850
I feel dizzy.

2185
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,680
- I have no idea.
- I think I have motion sickness.

2186
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,440
I feel dizzy.

2187
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:40,410
- Try again.
- I am done.

2188
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,350
- I am done.
- Let me see.

2189
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:43,410
I did it.

2190
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:45,560
- I think I solved it.
- Really?

2191
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:47,060
Is he a genius?

2192
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:49,450
Suk Jin is on fire today.

2193
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:50,560
I will give it a go.

2194
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,800
He is incredible.

2195
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:53,060
- Watch.
- Okay.

2196
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:55,930
You make a horizontal line first.

2197
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,800
- Okay?
- Okay.

2198
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,970
Then you go here.

2199
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:01,970
Here, here, here,

2200
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:03,840
here, here,

2201
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,980
here, here, here, here, here.

2202
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:09,180
- I did it, right?
- You missed a dot.

2203
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,480
- He did it.
- I did it.

2204
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,240
- What? He did it.
- Suk Jin, you missed a dot.

2205
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:14,310
He did it.

2206
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,050
I just need to connect it.

2207
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,650
- I can do it again.
- Did he succeed?

2208
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:19,020
- I did it.
- What is up with Suk Jin?

2209
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,020
Really?

2210
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:21,560
- What?
- Suk Jin was a genius.

2211
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:22,990
"Finding Genius".

2212
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:24,300
He became a genius at the age of 56.

2213
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,520
- Watch.
- Go ahead.

2214
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,270
- What?
- Suk Jin was a genius.

2215
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:29,060
What is up with him?

2216
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,190
- You make a horizontal line first.
- "Finding Genius".

2217
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:32,490
He became a genius at the age of 56.

2218
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,940
Here, here, here,

2219
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:37,370
here, here, here,

2220
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:38,570
here...

2221
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,570
That wasn't what you did.

2222
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:42,200
Here, here,

2223
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,980
(He would have succeeded
had he gone up.)

2224
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,310
here...

2225
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,350
(He ended up going to the side
because he was in a hurry.)

2226
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:49,610
(They failed to win a point.)

2227
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:51,450
That wasn't what you did.
You succeeded earlier.

2228
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,810
- For goodness' sake.
- Try again.

2229
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:53,820
No, no.

2230
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,860
No, no. You fool.

2231
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,260
If you follow this method,
one part gets left behind.

2232
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:00,060
I couldn't do it on the board.

2233
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,820
- This is hard.
- Here, here...

2234
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:04,730
I couldn't do it on the board.

2235
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:06,610
(The old genius has a bad memory.)

2236
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,270
- I did it.
- I did it.

2237
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:09,510
- You did it.
- Let me show you again.

2238
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,840
- I did it.
- I did it.

2239
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,010
- You did it.
- Let me show you again.

2240
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:13,110
- You did it.
- I said it first, right?

2241
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:14,270
- I did it.
- It worked.

2242
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:15,870
I was mistaken. I did it.

2243
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:17,070
I can do it. I can do it.

2244
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:18,850
- Watch.
- Okay.

2245
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,390
That's right.

2246
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:21,940
(After making a horizontal line,
he connects the outer dots.)

2247
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,090
- Go up.
- Okay.

2248
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:24,090
(Go up!)

2249
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:25,150
That's right.

2250
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:26,190
Here.

2251
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,690
- Okay, okay.
- I did that first.

2252
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:29,860
(The old genius ended up giving
the answer to someone else.)

2253
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,490
I did that first.

2254
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,800
- Suk Jin.
- I didn't draw the last line.

2255
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,470
- You were so close.
- Why didn't you draw it?

2256
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:37,100
I didn't draw the last line.

2257
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,140
- Why didn't you draw it?
- Seriously.

2258
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,400
I gave him the hint
on the horizontal line.

2259
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,030
What's the point of being a genius
if you can't get a question right?

2260
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:44,510
I didn't look at what you did.

2261
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,870
Come on, Suk Jin.

2262
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:48,740
- I figured it out right away.
- Why didn't you draw the last line?

2263
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:50,050
"Finding Genius Suk Jin".

2264
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,520
("Finding Genius Suk Jin".)

2265
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,220
For the next question,
I will give you the props first.

2266
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:56,020
What is this?

2267
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:57,450
It's like "Die Hard".

2268
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,480
Move one cup...

2269
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:02,890
to make the bottom arrangement.

2270
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,520
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2271
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2272
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:07,900
Let's arrange the cups.

2273
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:09,490
- Okay.
- So 2, 3, and 4...

2274
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:10,990
- should be filled.
- Firstly...

2275
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,110
So we can either move a cup...

2276
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:14,400
or pour out the water from a cup.

2277
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,940
(Find a way to put 3 full cups
in the middle.)

2278
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:17,980
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

2279
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:19,770
- Is this possible?
- I am sorry, but...

2280
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,070
- Is this possible?
- I am sorry, but...

2281
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:24,650
- We can only move one cup, right?
- Yes.

2282
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:25,770
I can pour out the liquid...

2283
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,280
and put the cup here.

2284
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:28,550
(He reached the answer the fastest.)

2285
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:29,610
- What?
- What?

2286
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:30,860
I can pour out the liquid...

2287
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,280
and put the cup here.

2288
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,520
Okay.

2289
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,760
- What?
- What?

2290
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,520
I did it, right?

2291
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:38,300
Okay, okay.

2292
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,020
Everyone knows that!

2293
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,800
What was that?

2294
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:43,440
Everyone knows that!

2295
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,440
- What?
- I did it.

2296
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,470
Anyone can pour out the liquid
and put the cup at the end.

2297
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:48,640
The last question was much harder.

2298
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,270
Why didn't you do it
if you knew the answer?

2299
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:53,740
We were thrown off
because the last question was hard.

2300
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,550
Why were you thrown off?
It was so easy.

2301
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,150
By the way,

2302
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,890
you guys are surprised, right?
We are really good at this, right?

2303
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:01,240
We are good at figuring out tricks.

2304
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,190
Now comes the last question.

2305
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,150
The palm is facing up.

2306
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,590
From that pose,

2307
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:10,600
keep your wrist
and shoulder unmoving...

2308
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:12,120
and make the palm face down.

2309
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:14,190
You start with the palm facing up.

2310
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:15,270
- Can't we just do it?
- Both hands?

2311
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:16,300
No, one hand.

2312
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:19,730
But you can't turn your wrist.

2313
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:21,440
So we need to make
the palm face down.

2314
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,370
- Hold on. This is...
- This is...

2315
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,840
So we can't turn the wrist.

2316
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,570
Like this?

2317
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:28,270
We can't turn the wrist.

2318
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:30,410
The back of the hand
needs to face up.

2319
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,680
This isn't how you do it, right?

2320
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,980
Hey, isn't this the solution?

2321
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,310
From here,

2322
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:35,940
you can lean forward.

2323
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:37,780
Then your arm will get twisted.

2324
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,260
You will hurt your back.

2325
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,650
The hand needs to be like this.

2326
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:43,230
The body will stay the same.

2327
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:44,230
How?

2328
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,620
- How about this?
- You can't turn the wrist.

2329
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:49,190
- Like this.
- You can't turn the wrist.

2330
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:50,660
So you can't do this.

2331
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,230
Doesn't this count?

2332
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:54,030
I figured it out. Come here.

2333
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,400
- How?
- Let me answer.

2334
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,940
- Come here.
- How?

2335
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:59,480
- Put your head down.
- What?

2336
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:01,350
Your hand is like this, right?

2337
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,310
- Come here.
- What are you trying to do?

2338
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,740
- Get him up.
- What? How?

2339
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,180
1, 2, 3.

2340
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:07,690
Like this?

2341
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,850
Is this the solution?

2342
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:09,860
(The tall man is upside down.)

2343
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,980
(He feels like he has been forced
into a roller coaster.)

2344
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,320
- Is this the solution?
- Keep your head down.

2345
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,690
- Incorrect.
- Is it incorrect?

2346
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:17,300
- Is it incorrect?
- Hold on.

2347
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,020
You can't use the wrist.

2348
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,600
Don't turn the wrist.

2349
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:22,520
Don't turn the shoulder.

2350
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,530
(There is a way
to make the palm face up.)

2351
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:32,180
(The answer)

2352
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:36,870
(Bend the arm
at a 90-degree angle 6 times.)

2353
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:37,940
From here...

2354
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:41,280
- From here...
- You can't turn the twist.

2355
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:44,590
(What if you roll forward?)

2356
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:45,860
(The hand stays the same!)

2357
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:47,020
Nice.

2358
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,590
How does it work?

2359
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:49,860
That doesn't work.

2360
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:51,230
- Like this.
- What is this?

2361
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:52,360
Like this.

2362
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:53,900
Like this.

2363
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,860
Can't you do it
without moving the shoulder?

2364
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:57,340
Oh, the wrist.

2365
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,470
(Suk Jin got a hint
from Jong Kook's movement.)

2366
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,690
- Like this.
- Let me answer.

2367
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,060
Let me answer.

2368
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:02,860
From here,

2369
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:04,530
- do this.
- Okay.

2370
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,110
Then you do this and this.

2371
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:08,350
(What?)

2372
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:09,850
Then you do this and this.

2373
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:12,850
- Do it again.
- Right? From here...

2374
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:13,940
It's correct.

2375
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:15,850
- Right? From here...
- It's correct.

2376
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:17,780
- It's correct.
- Go down and come up.

2377
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:18,890
(Suk Jin came up
with a unique solution.)

2378
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,120
- It works.
- It works.

2379
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:23,300
From here, fold the arm.

2380
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,490
- Go down.
- Go down.

2381
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:25,690
- Then do this.
- Come up.

2382
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:27,560
(Fold, go down, and come up.)

2383
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,600
(Suk Jin's answer is correct.)

2384
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,800
(The old genius got
the last 1 point.)

2385
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,470
- I can't believe it.
- Suk Jin!

2386
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:34,610
I can't believe it.

2387
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:42,510
(The production crew's answer)

2388
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:44,270
From here, fold the arm.

2389
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:45,440
- Go down.
- Go down.

2390
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,740
- Then do this.
- Come up.

2391
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:48,590
(A new answer by Suk Jin)

2392
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:51,950
Jong Kook gave away the answer.

2393
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:53,190
I can't believe Suk Jin.

2394
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:55,120
You did this.

2395
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:57,320
It was an answer we didn't expect.

2396
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,430
Really?

2397
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:00,600
- This didn't occur to me.
- It's fascinating.

2398
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:03,160
When you get this kind
of question correct, you look sexy.

2399
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:04,730
- You look sexy.
- You look different.

2400
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,810
Our score is high.

2401
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,110
(Suk Jin won
the Empty Heads' envy.)

2402
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,810
This team won 12 points each.

2403
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:11,980
Well...

2404
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:14,050
This team lost two points each.

2405
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:17,440
The first place will receive a prize
and be exempt from the penalty.

2406
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,520
The 7th and 8th places will receive
the penalty.

2407
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:23,050
As for the penalty,
we put three flags outside.

2408
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,810
- Bring one each.
- What?

2409
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:25,950
Where are the flags?

2410
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,930
- That's the worst.
- The flags are in the water.

2411
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:31,360
- Okay.
- I will announce the results...

2412
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,760
on the board.

2413
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,860
- It's right.
- What is up with So Min?

2414
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,120
- The points...
- Kwang Soo.

2415
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,340
When did that happen?

2416
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:40,010
With 28 points,
Kwang Soo is the 1st place.

2417
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,160
Okay!

2418
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,470
He is exempt from the penalty.

2419
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:43,700
(The 1st place will receive a prize
and be exempt from the penalty.)

2420
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,730
I will now present the prize.

2421
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:47,270
- What is that?
- It's a trophy.

2422
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,400
- What is that?
- That's incredible.

2423
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,570
(Big Thumb Trophy)

2424
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,550
- He loves prizes like that.
- What is this?

2425
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:54,780
- What?
- It's a trophy.

2426
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:55,850
(The gold-toned prize
makes his eyes go wide.)

2427
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:58,910
We didn't know who would win.
I will write down the name now.

2428
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:00,760
- What is that?
- On a piece of paper?

2429
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,260
- What is that?
- That's...

2430
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:04,600
- It looks authentic.
- Is that gold?

2431
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,900
Are you writing down the name?

2432
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,900
2021 SBS Running Man,
Real Grand Award.

2433
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:09,900
(He wrote the name
without much consideration.)

2434
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,560
- Congratulations on winning.
- Congratulations, Kwang Soo.

2435
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,530
The big toe resembles Kwang Soo.

2436
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:15,610
It's not a big toe. It's a thumb.

2437
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:17,680
It's made of iron.

2438
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:19,230
Iron.

2439
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:20,270
This is...

2440
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:23,410
- When some time passes,
- I know.

2441
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:24,550
if would be hard
to find a place for it.

2442
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,310
(It would be the hardest
to find a place for it.)

2443
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:30,450
The members at the bottom are
Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.

2444
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:32,780
Pick a member...

2445
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,780
who will receive the penalty
except for Kwang Soo.

2446
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:35,980
Kwang Soo survived.

2447
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,150
Okay!

2448
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:39,190
Get ready, okay?

2449
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:42,800
- The one with long hair.
- The one with long hair.

2450
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:44,340
Get ready.

2451
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,940
Okay!

2452
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:46,970
(They are the 3 members
who will receive the penalty.)

2453
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:48,530
- This is great.
- Game over.

2454
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:51,440
- The other members can go home.
- Okay.

2455
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:54,270
- I feel bad.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2456
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:57,020
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

2457
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:59,370
The weather is warm.

2458
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,940
(The trio gets ready
to enter the mudflat.)

2459
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,520
Do we need to put on rubber boots?

2460
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,980
One of you needs to take off
the rubber boots.

2461
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,860
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2462
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,400
- All right.
- Play or lose,

2463
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,560
- rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2464
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,760
Okay!

2465
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,900
(So Min wins.)

2466
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:14,930
I will take them off.

2467
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:17,360
(Okay!)

2468
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,730
(Singing)

2469
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:23,200
(From head to toe)

2470
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,870
(You are lovely)

2471
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:26,340
She is such an eyesore.

2472
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:28,570
(So Min the traitor
gives an annoying ceremony.)

2473
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:29,570
I can go in barefoot, right?

2474
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:33,410
Bring a flag each
to complete the mission.

2475
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:34,740
I will go that way!

2476
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:37,810
Gosh, this will make me so healthy.

2477
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,650
Be careful. Your feet will sink.

2478
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:44,990
(Staggering)

2479
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:47,020
Your feet will sink. Be careful.

2480
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,640
What should I do? I am stuck.

2481
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,730
(She's the one who got stuck.)

2482
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:57,310
(While Ji Hyo was staggering,
So Min took the first flag.)

2483
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,030
Let's get off work. Let's go home.

2484
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:00,370
Let's hurry up and go home.

2485
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,940
Bye.

2486
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:06,890
(Yoo Grand Award is the one
in my heart.)

2487
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:09,650
(She gives an annoying ceremony
and goes home.)

2488
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:10,720
Bye.

2489
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,310
Let's go home.

2490
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

2491
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,820
(The last duo takes the flags
as well!)

2492
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:18,360
I got the flag!

2493
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:21,360
(This time, they open agencies!)

2494
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:23,400
(4 new agencies appear!)

2495
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,640
- No way.
- Just come in here.

2496
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:25,840
(To sign a contract
with an A-list free agent,)

2497
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,660
(they use all sorts of methods.)

2498
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,070
We do need that piece of paper.

2499
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:32,440
(A big-time free agent, Jessi)

2500
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,270
(Soliciting)

2501
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,050
(A big-time free agent, Woo Young)

2502
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:38,980
(After signing a contract
with the stars,)

2503
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:41,310
(they work hard
to bring up their price.)

2504
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:42,740
(It's the best!)

2505
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,110
(They reveal Jae Suk's weakness
for the audience!)

2506
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:48,060
(They succeed
in bringing up the price!)

2507
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:50,360
(But their contract price...)

2508
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,860
(continues to skyrocket.)

2509
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:57,400
(Some agencies
even go out of business.)

2510
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:01,060
(The proud celebrities continue
to make excessive demands.)

2511
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,840
(Kwang Soo cuts his mullet!)

2512
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,070
- Why?
- It's weird.

2513
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,230
(In this cut-throat industry,)

2514
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:08,150
(will the CEOs be able
to save their agencies?)

2515
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:09,810
I will get ready to sue them.

2516
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:12,650
- Why?
- You ridiculed me before everyone.

2517
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:14,520
(Catch the Stars Among Free Agents,
Stars' Contract War)
