1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,850
(The center of K-pop, Korea's
top 4 entertainment agencies)

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,950
(And four new agencies
are challenging...)

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,830
(their solid infrastructure
and capital strength.)

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,620
- What's this?
- Hello, CEO Ha.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,390
Hello, CEO Jeon.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,570
(Lee Kwang Soo is the CEO
of one of the new agencies.)

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,000
I started my own business.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,030
What business am I in?
Why do I have crayons here?

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,530
I should recruit good artists
to increase sales.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,410
I learned the business
working for CEO Ji.

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,750
It's not easy to learn how to run
an entertainment agency.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,950
I'm experienced in this business.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,540
What is this?

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,610
It will be hung up at the entrance.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,110
You should write down
the name of your agency.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,560
- Now?
- Yes. Write it down now.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,580
I'm not good at drawing.

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,650
Shouldn't this be outsourced?

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,030
The CEO isn't supposed
to do draw this himself.

20
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,290
It's J Entertainment.

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,930
Except for Se Chan,
all members have a J in their names.

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,140
Jong Kook, Jae Suk, and Ji Hyo.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,390
I don't care about Se Chan.

24
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,430
They all have a J in their names.

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,640
Jae Suk, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo.

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,140
They all have a J in their names
except for Se Chan.

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,470
So it's J Entertainment.

28
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,040
DK Entertainment.

29
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,950
Dirty Mustache Entertainment will
take care of all your businesses.

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,420
Dirty Mustache.

31
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,260
It's JBR World.

32
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,560
It's the world for Petty Gang.

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,730
It's a global firm
that spreads to the world.

34
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,530
It's Cocoa M Monkey
by Physical Contact.

35
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,030
Physical Contact.

36
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,060
I've always wanted to run
my own business.

37
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,370
You are the CEO of a new agency...

38
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,500
that will lead Korea's
show business industry.

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,010
And you need to sign a contract
with as many celebrities as you can.

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
So I have to sign a contract?

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,810
The CEOs will fight
against other CEOs,

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,070
and the celebrities will
fight against other celebrities.

43
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,040
Do you see the congratulatory money
for your business on the desk?

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
Yes.

45
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,890
It's for operating your agency,
so you can use it as you please.

46
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,710
Do I get real money?

47
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,790
No, it's not real money.

48
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,150
300 dollars?

49
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,120
(300 dollars of play money)

50
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,950
Do you know
when I'm struck with reality?

51
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,730
It's when I find crumpled up R money
in my pockets as I undress at home.

52
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,590
"Why did I try so hard
to get this money?"

53
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,010
As soon as I go home,
I just throw this away.

54
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,830
A lot of celebrities will visit
your office soon.

55
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,350
You will negotiate the pay...

56
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,740
and sign a contract
with the celebrities you want.

57
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,040
I should sign contracts
with good people.

58
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,820
I should share the money
with the celebrities.

59
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,720
It's a match among the CEOs.

60
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,690
Are you a CEO or an artist?

61
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,730
Is this a nail salon?

62
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,200
- That sounds good for you.
- Isn't that it?

63
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
- No.
- Is this a cafe?

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,730
- No, it's not.
- Cocoa...

65
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,320
- Cocoa...
- That's not true.

66
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,860
This is a major company.

67
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,040
We shouldn't be doing this.

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,640
We should reach an agreement
on the distribution of money.

69
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,140
- I know.
- The ratio should be...

70
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,670
You are not going to offer
more than 50 percent, are you?

71
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,640
- Of course not.
- It shouldn't be more than 5 to 5.

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,140
- Once we agree on this...
- Because...

73
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,950
- You can't run a business on that.
- If one of you offers...

74
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,350
too much money,

75
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,850
the rest of us will be in trouble.

76
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,920
The problem is that
Se Chan has nowhere to go.

77
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,610
Because...

78
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,890
Even guys like Se Chan...

79
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,760
can be useful if he works
24 hours a day.

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,820
It's not like that.

81
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,080
It is a lot better to have
one artist who's worth every penny.

82
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,520
- He just eats a lot.
- I'm sorry to say this,

83
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,600
- but...
- He just eats a lot?

84
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,100
- He eats a lot.
- Hey.

85
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,290
(The celebrity with poor efficiency
is coming in.)

86
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,440
- Who is that?
- Se Chan.

87
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,940
You're a top star who's here to sign
a contract with your new agency.

88
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,040
Am I a top star?

89
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,640
All right. I'm a rising star.

90
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,640
- What do you do?
- I'm a comedian.

91
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
(Rising Star, Yang Se Chan,
good at showing off his gums)

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,880
- A comedian?
- Yes.

93
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,220
Take a look around...

94
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,640
and negotiate your pay
with an agency you want.

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,920
I see.

96
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,420
You will fight
against other celebrities...

97
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,980
while the CEOs will fight
against other CEOs.

98
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,660
Oh, really? My gosh.

99
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,630
Look at the poor handwriting.

100
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,070
It's so lame.

101
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
This is...

102
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
Jeon So Min, my gosh.

103
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,600
She looks like a fraud already.

104
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,610
(Come here.)

105
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,610
You should come.

106
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,910
DK. Dirty Mustache Entertainment.

107
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,270
"Let's make money. Money.
Let's get rich and enjoy, achieve,"

108
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,380
"and share.
Let's create a meaningful life."

109
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,670
- This sounds good.
- Let's become rich!

110
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,390
- Welcome, Shareholder.
- This place sounds good.

111
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,980
- Gosh. Welcome, Mr. Yang Se Chan.
- Hello.

112
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,820
- I wanted to hear your offer.
- Right.

113
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,160
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

114
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,390
- I just want to hear it.
- Do you want coffee or green tea?

115
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,690
- I'm okay for now.
- Solomon's seal tea?

116
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,860
No, I don't need any coffee.

117
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,820
I would like to get right down
to business.

118
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Okay.

119
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,990
- You've been doing well recently.
- Right.

120
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,860
So, I... Let me be straightforward.

121
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,840
How much you're willing to
give me is important.

122
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,470
How much were you thinking?

123
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,410
Your T-shirt looks so shabby.

124
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,630
- What?
- This.

125
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,280
My gosh. This kid.

126
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,480
I'll set you up with a stylist.

127
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,810
- You work alone, right?
- No.

128
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,850
- I work with three people.
- Stop lying.

129
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,160
- Three people dressed me like this.
- Se Chan.

130
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,550
You work alone.

131
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,030
- You're going to dress me up?
- First,

132
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,360
I'll get you a stylist.

133
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,400
- You could sit here.
- Hold on.

134
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,620
You can sit here.

135
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,730
I like sitting at the head
of the table.

136
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,770
I'll honor your wishes.

137
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,630
- In return, I have a condition.
- What is it?

138
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,100
(In return, I have a condition.)

139
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,060
Shave your dirty mustache.

140
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,040
(Shave your dirty mustache.)

141
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,170
If you shave your mustache...

142
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,720
If you're willing to show me your
clean face without a mustache...

143
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,810
- Will you shave it?
- Okay. Let's go!

144
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,810
- Are you serious?
- Yes. Let's go.

145
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,440
Okay. Put it in writing.

146
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,420
(He's making a path of money
towards his office.)

147
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,460
(He uses his precious R money
to get one more person.)

148
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,670
(He's most sincere about R money.)

149
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,470
Let's play fair!

150
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,670
(It's 1 dollar.)

151
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,910
Hello.

152
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,110
You became a free agent, right?

153
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,410
- What?
- You're a free agent.

154
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,710
I become a free agent in July.

155
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,710
What is this? "DK?"

156
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,780
What's this?

157
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,240
I'm changing the interior. Hello.

158
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,720
- Are you the CEO?
- Yes.

159
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,680
- This place doesn't suit me.
- No, wait.

160
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,660
- You're so capable...
- Gosh. This.

161
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,330
- We just started anew.
- Is that so?

162
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,460
- This is a bit overwhelming for me.
- Hold on.

163
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,620
When the CEO puts a photograph
of themselves next to potted plants.

164
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,860
I'm willing to negotiate
the terms of your contract...

165
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,360
to fit whatever you want.

166
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,840
- It's usually 7 to 3,
- Right.

167
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,670
but in this current situation,

168
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,480
would you be willing to do 8 to 2?

169
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,170
- Is that a bit too much?
- Then...

170
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,610
- The celebrity gets eight?
- Superstar Yu.

171
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,080
Is there a problem here?

172
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,150
Why don't you come into my office,
Superstar Yu?

173
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,650
- Come in for a bit, Superstar Yu.
- "Superstar Yu?"

174
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,020
- Nobody is coming into my office.
- Hold on.

175
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,090
- Come on in.
- Get in line.

176
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,830
- Come with me!
- You have no business etiquette.

177
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,960
Hold on.

178
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,330
- Come in.
- Hold on. What is JBR?

179
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,360
It's the world for Petty Gang.

180
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,970
- Petty Gang?
- It's the Petty Gang World.

181
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,190
The competition
between the free agents is stiff.

182
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,790
Okay. I know. Of course.

183
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,770
- This place is crazy.
- The competition is stiff.

184
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,770
Se Chan.

185
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,910
What is this? Hold on.

186
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,000
It's money.

187
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,710
(He starts picking them up
as though he's entranced.)

188
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,240
Gosh, what is this?

189
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,170
Hold on.

190
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,780
(At the end of the path he follows
while seduced by the R money...)

191
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,850
- Hello.
- Hello.

192
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,150
(J Entertainment,
This company is for you J.)

193
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,540
- Goodness.
- We have a common ground.

194
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,750
- Right. Have a seat.
- Gosh, this is...

195
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,180
(CEO Kwang barely manages to
lure Superstar Yang.)

196
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,250
This is nice.

197
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,880
I was listening to what was going on
next door,

198
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,860
and he was trying to seduce you
with money.

199
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,420
This is a bit...

200
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,470
- Aren't you doing that too?
- No.

201
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,770
- Then I'll be leaving.
- No, hold on.

202
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,430
- You're seducing me with money.
- No, I'm not.

203
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,110
- This is just a gift.
- It's a gift?

204
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,970
- I'll accept it as cab fare.
- This is...

205
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,230
Don't think of me as a CEO.

206
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,500
Just think of me as a close friend.

207
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,080
I'm giving you allowance...

208
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,410
- as a friend.
- Allowance?

209
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,440
- It's a gift from your heart. Okay.
- Right.

210
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,350
What do you specialize in
at this agency?

211
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,740
To be honest, you can do...

212
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,420
- whatever you want here.
- I see.

213
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,290
Right, and...

214
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,750
As for how we split the pay...

215
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,730
I listen to everything
my celebrity wants.

216
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,030
- Is that so?
- I'll let you do whatever you want.

217
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,600
I'll be direct with you.

218
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,270
You just need to get rid of
the one thing that bothers me.

219
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,860
- Okay.
- I really hate...

220
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,000
the thing that bothers me.

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,610
Are you willing to...

222
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,930
Your mullet really bothers me.

223
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,980
(Your mullet really bothers me.)

224
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,300
I cut my mullet...

225
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,940
- From here...
- You want me to cut off the rest?

226
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,650
- The rest bothers me too.
- You want me to...

227
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,170
- Yes.
- cut everything off?

228
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,240
There's a part that flares out.

229
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,160
If you're willing to cut it off
for a neat look,

230
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,290
I'll sign the contract...

231
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,530
I'll sign the contract for 6 to 4.

232
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,690
- 6 to 4?
- I'll even consider 6 to 4.

233
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,600
The CEO next door said he'd
shave off his dirty mustache.

234
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,790
He agreed to it.

235
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,360
He agreed to shave his mustache?

236
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,410
He said he'd shave off everything.
That's what he said.

237
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,610
- Then I...
- He's very ambitious.

238
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,080
I would love to sign a contract with
someone who's willing to shave...

239
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,440
because I hate it
when something bothers me.

240
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,650
I don't like it...

241
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,540
when my CEO gets teased...

242
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,870
by other CEOs and artists.

243
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,090
Wait. Hold on.

244
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,740
Are you saying that
I'm getting teased...

245
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,050
for having a mullet?

246
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,380
Of course.

247
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,830
You are definitely getting teased.

248
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,960
I hate that.

249
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,150
I don't have any artists
in my company yet,

250
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,800
but if I had at least one person,

251
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,070
I would throw...

252
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,200
this coffee in your face.

253
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,620
- This hot coffee?
- Yes.

254
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,390
- Is that so?
- I'm not one to back down.

255
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,800
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

256
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

257
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,970
I'm Top Star, Song Ji Hyo.

258
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,710
Since you're a free agent now...

259
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,770
Thank you.

260
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,640
(Superstar Kook hums as he arrives.)

261
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,850
All of the agencies...

262
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,220
look a bit sloppy.

263
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,050
I'll take a look around.

264
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,880
In Running Man,
the person to have is Jong Kook.

265
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,520
"JBR." Hold on, I...

266
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,960
I'm going to take
a look around first.

267
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,120
Superstar Kim!

268
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,800
- Superstar Kim! Come in for a bit.
- Why?

269
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
- Superstar Kim!
- You're touting.

270
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,730
- No. It's not that.
- Hold on.

271
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,070
- Have a seat, Superstar Kim.
- Okay.

272
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,260
- Have a seat, Superstar Kim.
- Where?

273
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,070
- Over here. Have a seat here.
- Here? Okay.

274
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,400
- Okay.
- Superstar Kim.

275
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,310
- Listen to what I have to say.
- Okay.

276
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,630
I'll listen to what you have to say.

277
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,900
- Listen... So this is...
- Yes?

278
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,610
- This is the world of Running Man.
- Right.

279
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,110
- I think the best star here...
- Yes?

280
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,820
is Kim Jong Kook. It's because...

281
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,480
- Thank you.
- Yoo Jae Suk is nothing.

282
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,560
- It's not that.
- Thank you.

283
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,110
We have to look
at your capabilities.

284
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,880
- In the games, who has the brains,
- Right.

285
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,960
- speed,
- Speed.

286
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,020
- and power?
- Power.

287
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,060
Who is it?

288
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,520
It's none other than Kim Jong Kook.

289
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,890
- Honesty,
- Right.

290
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,390
- nobody else needs to come.
- A celebrity...

291
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,490
needs to be acknowledged...

292
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,860
- for their worth.
- Of course.

293
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,730
- I'm for real.
- This is the best.

294
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,440
Yang Se Chan, Song Ji Hyo,

295
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,980
or even Yoo Jae Suk,

296
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,130
doesn't compare to you.

297
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,180
You are worth a hundred of them.

298
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,270
(I'm tempted.)

299
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,770
- 9 to 1?
- 9 to 1?

300
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,350
Isn't 9 to 1 too much?

301
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,320
- What?
- Who is that?

302
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,450
- It's Jessi!
- Jessi!

303
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Hey.

304
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,560
(Special Guest, Jessi)

305
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,690
(An artist from abroad,
Likes Yoo Jae Suk)

306
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,480
(A real top star who is back with
"What Type of X," Jessi)

307
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,070
(A foreign big fish has come to
disturb the Running Ecosystem.)

308
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,120
- Hey!
- Hey!

309
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,760
Jae Suk!

310
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,530
(The happy Jae Suk Wannabe)

311
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,660
Hey, come on!

312
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,400
- Hey, come on!
- Hey!

313
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,680
(They welcome her intensely
with an American-style hug.)

314
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,210
- Jessi!
- Hi.

315
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,180
Physical Contact.
Physical Contact Entertainment.

316
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,910
- We love physical contact!
- Yes.

317
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,740
This reminds me of Hwagae Market.

318
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,510
(Another guest has arrived
at the free agent market.)

319
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,860
I feel like
I'm at an awards ceremony.

320
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,330
(2PM's Jang Wooyoung, New mullet
member, Wants to do variety shows)

321
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,150
Oh, my. Wooyoung.

322
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,620
(Wooyoung?)

323
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,700
Oh, my. Hello.

324
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,800
I...

325
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,230
- Hello. I...
- Hello.

326
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,470
- never met CEO Jeon before.
- My gosh. CEO Jeon.

327
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,400
(I'll greet you with a dance
at our first meeting.)

328
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,110
What... What are you doing?

329
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,350
Do you like to fish?

330
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,400
(He's flustered upon
their first meeting.)

331
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,980
CEO Jeon. What are you doing?

332
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,140
(She doesn't want to lose him,)

333
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,450
(so she's expressing her desire
to sign him through dance.)

334
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,050
She looks like something's
frustrating her.

335
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,090
- Hold on, CEO Jeon.
- Yes?

336
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,380
Superstar Song, come here.

337
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,150
- Come here.
- Okay. Let's have a meeting.

338
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,150
It's not just a meeting.
Come have a seat.

339
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,360
- I'll have a meeting with you.
- To be honest,

340
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm willing to stop here because...

341
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,630
What are you taking out?

342
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,230
I have money.

343
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,360
What is that?

344
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,900
- I'll give you 100 dollars each.
- Really?

345
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,480
If you sign with me,
I'll give you 100 dollars each.

346
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,180
- This is an incredible deal.
- Jong Kook...

347
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,640
I'll give you 100 dollars each,

348
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,140
and the terms of our contract
will be...

349
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,080
8.5 to 1.5. Let's do that.

350
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,910
- 8.5?
- They're offering 9 to 1, but...

351
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,010
- 8.5 to 1.5?
- It's 9 to 1.

352
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,010
8.5 to 1.5.

353
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,590
- I like it. I'll sign.
- Okay.

354
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,220
- I like it too.
- Okay. I...

355
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,480
I'll go with that.

356
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,650
- I'll sign with you.
- I'll sign with you.

357
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,880
Okay!

358
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,980
I really...

359
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,860
Superstar Kim.

360
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,100
- I'm done.
- Superstar Song.

361
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,830
Let's work hard together.

362
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,100
- Let's work hard together.
- Right.

363
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,360
- Goodness.
- Keep this hidden.

364
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,700
- You have a good mentality.
- Seriously.

365
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,070
Shall we take a photo together?
Here.

366
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,260
- Oh, really?
- Let's take one together.

367
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,630
- Let's take a photo.
- We need to take a photo?

368
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,730
This is a bit...
This is a bit old-fashioned.

369
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,550
- I'm old-fashioned.
- We...

370
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,850
I'm a bit old-fashioned.

371
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,720
We're a global company.

372
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,870
We will go abroad.

373
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,090
Sign the contract first.

374
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,880
No. You have to
shave your hair off first.

375
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,250
You're signing a contract with
an entertainment agency...

376
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,380
The celebrity gets 6,
and the CEO gets 4.

377
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,620
(The celebrity gets 6.
The CEO gets 4.)

378
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,930
This is an incredible deal.

379
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,990
Another agency is talking about
a 9 to 1 contract.

380
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,260
The rumors are floating around.

381
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,230
There aren't any 8 to 2.
They're all 9 to 1.

382
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,840
Jae Suk. Let's work together.

383
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,260
- We can be Co-CEOs.
- This is...

384
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,440
Here, Jae Suk.

385
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,080
I'll give you 9.5,
and I'll take 0.5. Okay?

386
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,500
Sign here.

387
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,810
- 9.5 to 0.5. Let's do it.
- Is it...

388
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,050
- Is it okay to do this?
- Let's do it.

389
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,680
Yang Se Chan will come in
when he sees you.

390
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,850
It's because I don't like
seeing you enjoy it.

391
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,140
6 to 4.

392
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,360
- I don't like your mullet.
- Yoo Jae Suk signed with me!

393
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,460
Okay!

394
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,510
(He signed Jae Suk?)

395
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,250
- I'll leave then.
- No. Hold on.

396
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,230
- He'll shave and get 6.
- No. It's not that.

397
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,860
He signed!

398
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,120
He signed with me!

399
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,470
Wooyoung signed with me!

400
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,440
For example, if you...

401
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,130
have a conflict with it
because of another shoot,

402
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,940
- I'll go someplace else.
- No, it's not that.

403
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,530
I'll cut it.

404
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,900
I can cut my hair.

405
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,400
(Is he really going to cut
his hair?)

406
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,350
I'll cut my hair.

407
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,820
Having a mullet isn't
that important to me.

408
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,880
(He grabbed the mirror,)

409
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,510
(but he can't help but laugh
at this situation.)

410
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,620
I...

411
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,460
I want CEO Lee...

412
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,930
Jessi has signed with me!

413
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,490
Be quiet!

414
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,600
- Hold on. Okay. I'll be quiet.
- Be quiet.

415
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,990
- My gosh.
- I need to announce it like this.

416
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,530
I can cut it.
Can you hold this for a second?

417
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,360
You have five minutes left!

418
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,640
(Kwang Soo is fiddling
with his hair.)

419
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,410
(He let his hair grow long
for his movie at first.)

420
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,690
(But his love for his hair grew big
as others made fun of it.)

421
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,720
(He has kept it long so far
without giving in to persecution.)

422
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
(What's Kwang Soo's choice?)

423
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,730
(Cutting)

424
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,360
(He cut his hair for real.)

425
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,130
(Flustered)

426
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,600
This is how I feel.

427
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,310
This shows how I'm feeling.

428
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,030
Fine. I like that.

429
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,730
For you, Se Chan...

430
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,310
(He cut his precious hair
just to recruit Se Chan.)

431
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,370
My hair means nothing.

432
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,480
Really?

433
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
So...

434
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,110
(CEO Lee is always
serious about R money.)

435
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,410
What's the big deal about my hair?

436
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,110
I can even shave my head.

437
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,650
(He's so flustered
that his gums are drying up.)

438
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,090
If you move to another agency,

439
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,730
I'll kill you.

440
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,960
I cut my hair for you.

441
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,860
Se Chan.

442
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,490
(Letting out a sigh)

443
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,530
(Shaking his head)

444
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,340
I'll...

445
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,530
- If you say anything stupid...
- All right.

446
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,770
(All right. Put it down.)

447
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,870
Put it down.

448
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,310
- This coffee is really hot.
- I get it.

449
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,180
I'll sign the contract.

450
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,510
- Sign it.
- Okay.

451
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,740
All right. I don't want 6 to 4.
Let's make it 7 to 3.

452
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,820
- Sign it. It's 6 to 4.
- All right.

453
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,590
You may go to your agency now.

454
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,020
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

455
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

456
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,460
Before we start the first schedule,

457
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,730
you will hold a press
conference to promote...

458
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,260
your agency and artists.

459
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,260
A press conference?

460
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,700
A press conference?

461
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,110
You will give a presentation
at the press conference.

462
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,900
We're doomed.

463
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,950
He can't give a presentation.

464
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,320
And the artists will get paid
after showing off their talents.

465
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,820
What?

466
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,780
Then it's good for So Min's agency.

467
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,980
Jae Suk, you should
show your ab muscles.

468
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,090
I don't have ab muscles.

469
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,590
- You don't?
- I don't.

470
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,990
You work out a lot.

471
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,300
And he should give a presentation.

472
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,990
So is it like a talent show?

473
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,600
Each team will give
a presentation in turn.

474
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,360
The other 3 CEOs,
1 director, and 1 writer...

475
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,210
will give marks
to your presentations.

476
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,370
And when the presentations are over,

477
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,910
each CEO and artist will
get their own scores.

478
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,370
And you will get paid
according to the scores...

479
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,090
from 1,000 dollars for first place
to 100 dollars for the last place.

480
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,110
(They will get paid
according to their scores.)

481
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,360
When all the missions are over,
the two CEOs...

482
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,430
and the two artists with
the least money will get a penalty.

483
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,020
(The 2 CEOs and 2 artists with
the least money will get a penalty.)

484
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,490
Gosh, we're in trouble.

485
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,570
Jae Suk, I have a question.

486
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,840
You're a famous MC,
so I have faith in you. But...

487
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,860
What's your question?

488
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,940
What are you good at?

489
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,840
(He can't think of anything
for the famous MC's specialty.)

490
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,500
- I...
- I just want to hear it.

491
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,180
The thing is,
I don't have a specialty.

492
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,550
- I can do a lot of things.
- I know.

493
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,010
- Exactly.
- Just a little.

494
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,190
I'll make Jessi a global star.

495
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,740
She speaks English,
and she can act as well.

496
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,460
She can show her acting
by crying or getting angry...

497
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,980
You should do that.

498
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,330
Can you do things like that?

499
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,930
- We should try acting.
- Right. Acting.

500
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,860
We should do something new
to get high scores.

501
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,120
A serious love scene.

502
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,200
What are you looking at?

503
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,730
It's not like that.
A serious love scene.

504
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,160
(What are you looking at?)

505
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,360
It's not like that.
Don't pick a fight.

506
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,430
Why does your acting
start like that?

507
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,200
- I don't know.
- Jessi.

508
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,430
Are you a bully?

509
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,310
- Let's say you two are lovers.
- So...

510
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,810
- there should be a storyline.
- Sure.

511
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,550
- Let's fight.
- We should fight.

512
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,280
What are you looking at?

513
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,350
- What are you staring at?
- What?

514
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,320
- What's the matter?
- You looked at me first.

515
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,590
Well... Are you a bully?

516
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,090
Yes.

517
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,950
Are you?

518
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,060
- Hey.
- All right.

519
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,100
Okay. I'll start by saying
"What are you looking at?"

520
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,920
I have great expectations for you.

521
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,300
- All right. I'll go first.
- Do you want me to go under?

522
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,630
Okay. I will...

523
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,160
Trust me. I'm strong on practice.

524
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,770
- I trust you, but what can you do?
- I'm serious.

525
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,930
I need to know.

526
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,200
Excuse me. What are you looking at?

527
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,670
(She starts
with the same line again.)

528
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,870
You looked at me first.

529
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,250
- I didn't.
- Are you picking a fight?

530
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,870
I am. What are you going
to do about it?

531
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,290
- Why are you picking a fight?
- So what are you going to do?

532
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,860
- What do you think?
- How was it?

533
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,760
(What do you think?
Isn't that amazing?)

534
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,950
- How was it?
- How did you like it?

535
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,300
- It was...
- I showed my wrath suddenly.

536
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,770
These days, my anger...

537
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,770
Give me my money back.

538
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,660
(DK Entertainment is
about to go down.)

539
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,690
Give me my money back.

540
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,690
Give me.

541
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,740
(Will he be able to overcome
the crisis at the press conference?)

542
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,310
- All right.
- I can do this.

543
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,740
I'll...

544
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,840
(Monkey by Physical Contact is also
thinking about Wooyoung's talent.)

545
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,130
Can you do any impressions?

546
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,780
I...

547
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,080
I'm an artist.

548
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,280
I do music and art.

549
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,380
What? "We've signed a contract?"

550
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,710
(We've signed a contract?)

551
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,650
- Like "We've got married."
- What's the name of this agency?

552
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,920
It's Physical Contact Entertainment.

553
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,830
- It means...
- I have a headache.

554
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,540
So we should be
intimate like family.

555
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,630
- We have a lot of things to do.
- Tell me.

556
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,630
What can we do?

557
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,280
Jong Kook can show off his strength.

558
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,780
So I was thinking about doing this.

559
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,370
You can crack a nut
with your buttocks.

560
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,320
- Cracking a nut with your buttocks?
- With the buttocks?

561
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
How would I do that?

562
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,020
He has muscular buttocks.

563
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,380
Put a walnut on a chair and...

564
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,380
- By sitting down?
- By sitting down.

565
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,610
You can crack it like that.

566
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,410
You don't have to squeeze
your buttocks to crack it.

567
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,620
You can do it though.

568
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,950
- Cracking a nut by squeezing them?
- You can do it,

569
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,100
- but it's not necessary.
- I can do that.

570
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,390
- You can, right?
- Of course I can.

571
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,300
- We don't have to try that hard.
- I know.

572
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,460
And...

573
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,240
- It's not easy to break an egg.
- Right.

574
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,160
So you'll try breaking it
with your arm.

575
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,770
- With my arm?
- On here. You can do this.

576
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,010
I'm sorry, but...

577
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,470
is this a super strength
show or something?

578
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,640
(Is this a super strength
show or something?)

579
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,550
(What is saying sounds
just like a strength show.)

580
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,410
Because Kim Jong Kook...

581
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,910
has already reached the top
as a singer.

582
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,140
- It's already been proven.
- I see.

583
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,290
- So you should show something new.
- I see.

584
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,380
CEO Lee, let's do this.

585
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,590
Specialty?

586
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,190
It's not about the specialty.
Tell me how you will introduce me.

587
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,300
First...

588
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,000
Se Chan.
You're good at finger flicks.

589
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,570
- I am.
- I know.

590
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,630
- It can be your specialty.
- It is my specialty.

591
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,570
(What else might there be?)

592
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,080
But... I'm a celebrity.

593
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,970
But my specialty is
just a finger flick?

594
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,400
You don't have to feel that way.

595
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,140
Oh, okay.

596
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,750
That's a great specialty.

597
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,610
- I know. It's a big deal.
- Sure.

598
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,050
So how are you going
to introduce me?

599
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,180
Can you put a dent in a car?

600
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,220
That's not my specialty, CEO Lee.

601
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,760
- In other agencies...
- Think about them.

602
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,060
Jessi and Jae Suk are...

603
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,450
preparing a show.

604
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,690
And what you want me to do
is just a finger flick?

605
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,600
I'd rather pay a penalty
and cancel the contract.

606
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,100
We have to show something
to get more money.

607
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,900
- Should we prepare a performance?
- We should.

608
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
There's something
that only you can do.

609
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,080
- Actually...
- I'm still an active comedian.

610
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,580
If I put together some skits
I'm doing now,

611
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,610
I can perform here
for a couple of hours.

612
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,820
Kwang Soo, we should
give a performance.

613
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,790
I should do the chorus thing.

614
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,290
- "Psychorus?"
- Yes. Let's do "Psychorus."

615
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,520
(Se Chan's suggestion
is "Psychorus.")

616
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,220
(Even though I try to catch it)

617
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,420
(You should catch)

618
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,720
(Even though I stop my heart)

619
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,800
(You can't stop it)

620
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,620
(It just slips through my fingers)

621
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,190
That's something only we can do.

622
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,160
- Sure. No one else can do it.
- You're right.

623
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,460
We should pick an easy song.

624
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,810
It should be exciting and has
lyrics that are easy to remember.

625
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,900
And it should be something
for which we can sing the chorus.

626
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,210
It's Jae Suk's song.

627
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,940
It's Yoo San Seul.

628
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,140
(It's the perfect song
for "Psychorus.")

629
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,990
- We will sing Yoo San Seul's song.
- A trot song.

630
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,090
Right. We can give a performance
with a trot song.

631
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,650
- We can make fun of his looks.
- Good.

632
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,180
His everything is ugly

633
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,180
(They lay the groundwork
with Yoo San Seul's song.)

634
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,220
(How would their "Psychorus" go?)

635
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,620
It will be a diss song.

636
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,190
Gosh, this is...

637
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,190
(Showcase of the top 4 agencies)

638
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,960
All right. We will start
the press conference...

639
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,840
where each agency will
introduce their artists.

640
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,110
A press conference.

641
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,110
- We will go public...
- You're the most...

642
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,240
- pathetic CEO here.
- He's lost a lot of weight.

643
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,810
- That's not true.
- You're...

644
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,310
And I saw you walk around
with short and quick steps.

645
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,440
Like this.

646
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,280
I put my artists first all the time.

647
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,610
- You do?
- They come first.

648
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,590
- That's the basic.
- Sure.

649
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,380
Did anyone of you sign
a contract of 9 to 1?

650
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,860
- What?
- A contract of 9 to 1.

651
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,880
We did.

652
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,860
- Some of us did it as well.
- He signed a contract of 9 to 1.

653
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
It's better than that.

654
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,120
That doesn't matter anyway.

655
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,160
Your CEO wants to be a celebrity.

656
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
What?

657
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,500
Your CEO is very ambitious.

658
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,600
What kind of CEO wears
sunglasses like that?

659
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,460
I found that out
after signing the contract.

660
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,540
- That the CEO has her own dream.
- That's right.

661
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,130
She wants to be a celebrity.

662
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,200
She wants to make her debut
using her artists.

663
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,550
The CEO...

664
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,370
"If things don't work out,
take a detour."

665
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,170
Excuse me.
Let me tell you something.

666
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,820
I've been in many
competitions like this before.

667
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,850
Competitions?

668
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,910
Shall we go first?

669
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,590
- She always grabs something.
- Will you go first?

670
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,260
How much can you offer?

671
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,490
It's a pun.

672
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,420
- My artist is good at puns.
- How much can you offer?

673
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,190
(Whispering)

674
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,860
- Hang on.
- How much?

675
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,130
You are...

676
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,270
The artists in my agency
keep telling me...

677
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,700
to say,
"What time is it now, Jessi?"

678
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,130
He's supposed to say it himself.

679
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,810
- Why would I say that?
- CEO Lee.

680
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,580
- I mean...
- You should embrace my joke.

681
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,580
- I'm not a celebrity.
- "What time is it now, Jessi?"

682
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,940
You should set an example.

683
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,140
"What time is it now, Jessi?"

684
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,380
We will now begin the press
conference to introduce new artists.

685
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,680
The other three CEOs will...

686
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,380
give marks to each presentation...

687
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,190
on a scale of 0 to 5.

688
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,300
And we have two more members
to represent the crew members.

689
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,270
They are Director Choi Hyung In
and Writer Han Ah Reum.

690
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,900
- Please give us good scores.
- That's only fair.

691
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,130
She's a fashionista director.

692
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,170
Right.

693
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,870
- I thought Hyung In was...
- She's all dressed up.

694
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,140
And Ah Reum usually wears a cap.

695
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,900
- Ah Reum and Hyung In.
- They look great.

696
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,410
They're all dressed up.

697
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,520
- What's this?
- It's Dirty Mustache.

698
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,490
DK Entertainment may
introduce their artists now.

699
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,620
Nice to meet you.
We are DK Entertainment.

700
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,650
Okay.

701
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,950
I'm Dirty Mustache.

702
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,890
- I won't say much.
- We're serious.

703
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,270
We have the most
popular celebrities here.

704
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,860
What do you think
they are doing here?

705
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,890
That's dirty.

706
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
Why is that?

707
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,770
(He tries to fill the silence
by talking some nonsense.)

708
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,040
This is a free place.

709
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,110
Everyone.

710
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,540
Is this a PR video or something?
What is this?

711
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,850
We are...

712
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,640
- Oh, and... CEO Ha.
- Yes?

713
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,820
Tell them the terms of my contract.

714
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,440
Everyone will get in line
to sign with you.

715
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,880
I can't reveal that.

716
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,680
- Just tell them.
- What is it?

717
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,990
- I can't reveal it.
- It must be unusual.

718
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,290
- What are the terms?
- Wait. Why did you say that?

719
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,880
- Don't reveal it.
- Why? Answer me.

720
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,000
- Why would you reveal it?
- He'll get to sign with more stars.

721
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,150
- Jessi, cover your ears.
- No.

722
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,660
- Jessi, cover your ears.
- No, I won't do that.

723
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,000
- Let's talk about it later.
- Oh, I guess...

724
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,630
- their terms are different.
- Why must I?

725
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,660
- Jessi, how much did he offer?
- Do they get paid differently?

726
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,930
- I think they're paid differently.
- Let's talk later.

727
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,040
- That must be the case.
- CEO Ha...

728
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,740
Jae Suk, the terms of our contracts
are the same. Am I wrong?

729
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,310
- Is yours higher than mine?
- It's not like that.

730
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,470
- It's not that.
- Is he paid more than me?

731
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,510
No.

732
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,470
(Gosh, I don't believe you.)

733
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,850
- I'm sure they're paid differently.
- Really?

734
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,910
- Haha.
- If that's the case,

735
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,910
Jessi must be upset.

736
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,490
- Trust me. That's not true.
- Hyun Ju.

737
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,860
- Is it true?
- No, it's not.

738
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,990
- Are you paid higher than me?
- I said, it's not true.

739
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,860
- No.
- That agency isn't transparent.

740
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,560
- Come back here.
- What a dirty business!

741
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,830
- I...
- You've been lowballed.

742
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,830
- Jae Suk, do you get 100 percent?
- No.

743
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,190
- No, he doesn't.
- No.

744
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,460
Hey, I get paid a lot too.

745
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,630
- Why did you say such a thing?
- Come on.

746
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,740
- Why would they bring that up?
- What kind of presentation is this?

747
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,860
- I mean,
- Hey!

748
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,900
why would they reveal
the profit-sharing ratio?

749
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,280
- I'm going to...
- Jessi.

750
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,740
Hear us out before getting angry,
okay?

751
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,170
- You know what I mean, right?
- "What Type of X."

752
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,670
- Okay.
- Let's go!

753
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,870
- Let's go. Let's get it.
- Yes!

754
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,940
Here we go.

755
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,970
("What Type of X" by Jessi)

756
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,090
Play it louder.

757
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,210
(CEO Ha trying to look cool)

758
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,290
(And Jessi with a charismatic face)

759
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,920
(Running)

760
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,090
- What? They startled me.
- What?

761
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,500
- She's so fabulous.
- Jessi!

762
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,960
DK!

763
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,460
- Come on!
- DK! Hey!

764
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,400
- DK, DK!
- Okay!

765
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,200
DK, DK!

766
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,580
(Haha promotes his agency
using her song.)

767
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,670
(Superstar Jessi)

768
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,470
I'd like to point out something.

769
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,750
- That was...
- Hey, hey!

770
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,490
Listen. It was...

771
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,290
Excuse me, Jessi. Jessi.

772
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,790
I'd like to clarify something.

773
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,860
It's about your choreography
we just saw.

774
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,950
Kwang Soo came up with
that dance move.

775
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,180
- Kwang Soo did?
- Yes.

776
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,150
- This dance move.
- Did she copy his dance move?

777
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,390
- What's that?
- That's different.

778
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,460
Show them. He did it first.

779
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,620
See? He did it first.

780
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,740
- Hey, I'm sorry, but...
- He did it first.

781
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,860
- You're being unreasonable.
- Jessi, you copied his dance move.

782
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,160
- Did I dance like that?
- I saw the same dance move.

783
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,810
- It's different.
- Exactly.

784
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,700
- No, it's different.
- Hey! PSY would never have...

785
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,470
made me do a dance move like that.

786
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,350
Why would she yell at me?

787
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,550
- Just drop it and sit down.
- She could've just said it.

788
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,880
- Why would she yell at me?
- That's how she talks.

789
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
- Okay. Let's accept it.
- She didn't yell.

790
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,320
- That's how she talks.
- All right.

791
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,410
- That's not all.
- Okay.

792
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,450
- She'll show you her dance.
- Okay. Let's go.

793
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,880
(That wasn't all?)

794
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,150
- Let's see.
- Go ahead.

795
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,220
Shall we play the song now?

796
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,270
Let's treat each other...

797
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,460
- Hey!
- You know...

798
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,540
(Be quiet!)

799
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,860
(He's genuinely taken aback.)

800
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,860
My gosh.

801
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,310
- She yells at everyone.
- What's this?

802
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,280
This is what's called "talent,"
okay?

803
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,430
- What do you mean by that?
- She just keeps yelling.

804
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,470
If I...

805
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,750
- I told you!
- She doesn't care if they're...

806
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,750
- on her team or not.
- If I...

807
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,640
If I stop working with this agency,

808
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,940
it wouldn't be because of the CEO,

809
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,090
but because of the celebrity
under the same agency.

810
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,380
(What a messed-up agency.)

811
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,710
I'm ready. Let's go.

812
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,090
Play it louder.

813
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,860
- What song is this?
- It's "Dance Monkey."

814
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,330
- Oh, that.
- Hands up!

815
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,060
Put your hands up!

816
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,620
- Put your hands up.
- She'll sing this song?

817
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,720
Did we do something wrong?

818
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,340
She's singing live!

819
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,270
It's a live performance!

820
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,360
(Amazed)

821
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,460
- She's singing live.
- This is amazing.

822
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,310
She's singing live.

823
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,370
This is really awesome.

824
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,470
(The other agencies want to
work with her.)

825
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,590
Here we go!

826
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,450
- She's so incredible.
- Oh, my.

827
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,860
Isn't she amazing?

828
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,860
(Scream! Queen Jessi!)

829
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,770
Jessi!

830
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,040
- Join my agency!
- She's incredible.

831
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
- Come join us, Jessi!
- That was awesome!

832
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,900
- That was insane!
- That was amazing.

833
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,280
She did too well when she was
the first one. I'm worried.

834
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,930
- Come on!
- You saw that, right?

835
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,310
- You saw that, right?
- DK Entertainment's superstar...

836
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,280
- Jessi is...
- What else do you want?

837
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,970
- Are you satisfied?
- That's not all.

838
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,790
- Come on. Come on.
- That's not all.

839
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,910
- We should fight now.
- Next up is...

840
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,560
- Korea's best MC...
- That wasn't all?

841
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,910
- that you all know.
- That wasn't all?

842
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,210
It's Yoo Jae Suk's turn.

843
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,260
Thank you.

844
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,060
You'll show your talents
only with a mic?

845
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,060
- Yes.
- That's a bold act.

846
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,260
I'm sorry,

847
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,300
- but you have no special talents.
- That's not true.

848
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,460
- Right here?
- I'll just...

849
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,800
- I thought you had no talents.
- I will...

850
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,040
- show you just a few things.
- Please be quiet.

851
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,270
- You have talents to show us?
- Be quiet!

852
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,630
Jae Suk can't do
any impressions either.

853
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,110
I can imitate a helicopter sound.

854
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,110
You can do that?

855
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,110
(Imitating a helicopter)

856
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,970
- What was that?
- He did it so halfheartedly.

857
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,370
- He has no talents.
- Good job.

858
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,350
- He has no talents.
- What's that?

859
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,940
- That was good.
- I can do it.

860
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,320
- Good job.
- Is he a little kid or what?

861
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,520
That was good.

862
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,760
- He'll show you his sense of humor.
- Yes.

863
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,880
- He can make good acrostic poems.
- Really?

864
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,560
- Give him any words or names...
- I'll improvise.

865
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,790
- Any names?
- I'll improvise.

866
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,650
Does any one of the staff members
want to try it?

867
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,000
- Who?
- Chan Hee.

868
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,160
- Cameraman Kang Chan Hee.
- Kang Chan Hee.

869
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,530
- Make one with his name.
- An acrostic poem.

870
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,770
- Kang Chan Hee?
- Start now. 1, 2, 3.

871
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,770
- Kang!
- Kang!

872
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,430
Kang Chan Hee.

873
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,660
- Chan!
- Why are you speaking in a dialect?

874
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,970
Closely looking at you...

875
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,040
- Good.
- Hee!

876
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,170
How ugly!

877
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,900
Thank you.

878
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,370
- Any names would do.
- Let's try another name.

879
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
This is just the beginning.

880
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,880
- I bet he prepared this one.
- Yes.

881
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,860
- Let's give him another name.
- I can do it with the name...

882
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,680
- of staff members I've never met.
- Wooyoung!

883
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,990
- Wooyoung! Wooyoung!
- I can do it.

884
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,090
- Wooyoung.
- Pardon?

885
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,300
- Wooyoung.
- Okay.

886
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,420
- Ready? 1, 2, 3. Woo!
- Woo!

887
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,960
(Woo)

888
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,040
Wooyoung.

889
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
(Seeing that he started with his
name again, it won't be good.)

890
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,770
- Wait.
- What's that?

891
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,740
- That made me uncomfortable.
- What was that?

892
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,970
- Why...
- Go on. Continue.

893
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,430
- That's not a talent.
- Go on.

894
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,550
- He did it in the same pattern.
- I can improvise.

895
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,580
You did it exactly the same way.

896
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,670
I can improvise.

897
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,110
You call their names first.

898
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,170
- It's just the same.
- How about he tries another name?

899
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,490
- Then this time, I will...
- How about Bo Pil?

900
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,880
read your fortune as well.

901
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,820
- What do you mean by that?
- I'll make an acrostic poem...

902
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,920
with one of your names...

903
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,860
that predicts your future.

904
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
- He'll read our fortune?
- That sounds great.

905
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,890
- I will...
- Hold on.

906
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,360
Are you saying
that fortune-telling is your talent?

907
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,770
- Yes.
- That's right.

908
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,160
- You can read others' fortune?
- I can read...

909
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,960
- only 5 people's fortune in 1 day.
- I've never heard that before.

910
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,270
- An acrostic poem to tell fortune?
- Me!

911
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,070
- I want to get my fortune told.
- That sounds unrealistic.

912
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,660
- I can read your fortune.
- CEO Lee.

913
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,470
- It's Jeon So Min, right?
- Yes.

914
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,580
Okay. Jeon... Jeon...

915
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,470
He's shaking so much.

916
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,610
Jae Suk, shall we give you
five minutes?

917
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,670
Do you want to take a break?

918
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,050
His lips turned purple.

919
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,170
Don't worry about me.

920
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,910
- Jeon So Min.
- 1, 2...

921
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,210
- Three.
- Do you want to know your fortune?

922
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,590
- Yes, I do.
- All right.

923
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,380
- An acrostic poem too.
- Are you trying to buy more time?

924
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,530
- No, I'm not.
- You're buying time to think.

925
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,360
- No. I can do it right away.
- Really?

926
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,920
- 1, 2, 3.
- He's bluffing.

927
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,360
Journey into your past life.

928
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
So!

929
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,430
- That must be...
- Jae Suk.

930
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,270
Jae Suk, your lips are so blue.

931
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,080
I haven't seen him that anxious
in a long time.

932
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,840
He can't stop moving his legs.

933
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,080
- It's because...
- He lacks a sense of humor.

934
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,020
I mean, your hand is shaking
so much.

935
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,350
Keep quiet.

936
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,090
You can't stop doing
the helicopter impression.

937
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,290
He didn't shake the mic
to make that sound.

938
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,410
He ruined the company value
that Jessi increased.

939
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,920
- Jae Suk ruined it.
- Should we write down the score?

940
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,150
0.3 points.

941
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,150
We did well. Okay. Great.

942
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,360
(Next up is CEO Lee's
J Entertainment.)

943
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,500
They prepared a lot.

944
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,070
They're doing "Psychorus."

945
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,310
Are you going to do "Psychorus?"

946
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,280
Is it allowed to do his comedy skit
he does on another show?

947
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,810
Jessi did the same.

948
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,310
She promoted her new song too.

949
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,210
My gosh. So what are you
going to do?

950
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,790
We're going to do
Se Chan's comedy skit.

951
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,610
We need your help. We'll pay you.

952
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,490
We'll cast Jae Suk
and pay him for his performance.

953
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,680
Are you asking me to sing?

954
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,420
- Yes.
- You just have to sing...

955
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,920
40 seconds from the beginning.

956
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,060
- 40 seconds?
- How much will you pay him?

957
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,270
I get paid differently...

958
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,530
for a live performance
and a lip-syncing performance.

959
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,130
- Why is it so complicated?
- How much for lip-syncing?

960
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,630
- Pardon?
- It's 20 dollars.

961
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,270
- Only 20 dollars?
- Really?

962
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,200
Make it to 50 dollars.
It's 50 dollars.

963
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,970
- What about a live performance?
- 100 dollars.

964
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,780
- Twice as much?
- Yes.

965
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,370
- 100 dollars?
- 100 dollars.

966
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,670
But I don't lip-sync the whole song.

967
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,820
I do sing some parts
over the recorded voice.

968
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,290
I have only 100 dollars left.

969
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,820
And I should spend it all
to hire you?

970
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,450
Then how about 20 dollars
for lip-syncing...

971
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,490
- 20 dollars?
- 40 dollars for singing live?

972
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,560
Yes, 40 dollars.

973
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,300
Can you mix them for 30 dollars?

974
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,720
- Singing and lip-syncing?
- Yes.

975
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,770
- 30 dollars.
- Can you do it for 30 dollars?

976
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,770
- Sing just a little bit.
- Okay.

977
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,100
- Just sing when you want to sing.
- Okay.

978
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,070
- 30 dollars. Okay.
- You have to pay him first.

979
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,360
I can give you a discount
if I don't have to...

980
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
- sing the whole song live.
- That's funny.

981
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,870
- It's funny.
- Oh, right. I'm sorry,

982
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,040
but will you upload a video clip?

983
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,640
- Pardon?
- Of course, we will.

984
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,750
Or else, why would we do this?

985
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,850
- He'll charge you more.
- You have to pay me more.

986
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,440
You have to pay extra 20 dollars.

987
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,320
What's the point of doing it
if we don't upload the video?

988
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,210
- We can do it all for 20 dollars.
- What?

989
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,060
- What song will he sing?
- Which song?

990
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,180
- Does it have to be him?
- We need Yoo San Seul's song.

991
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,860
- We already prepared a script.
- We need a trot song.

992
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,950
You mean,
"Hapjeong Station, Exit Five?"

993
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,360
- "Redevelopment of Love."
- "Redevelopment of Love."

994
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
I can sing that song.

995
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,690
Come on.

996
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,130
We should be paid by him.

997
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,540
- How much?
- You should pay us...

998
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,630
- How much?
- if you want to sing.

999
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,840
(Ra Jo Gi,
the Yoo San Seul impersonator)

1000
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,840
No, that's not good enough.

1001
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,010
- No way.
- I can do it.

1002
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,470
- No.
- Wait.

1003
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,170
- How much?
- I'll charge you...

1004
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,170
(They flat out rejected Ra Jo Gi.)

1005
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,170
- Then...
- I'll charge you only 10 dollars.

1006
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,850
Including the video clip,
I'll charge you 40 dollars.

1007
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,060
- 40 dollars?
- All they want is money.

1008
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,110
- 40 dollars.
- Why must I spend 150 dollars...

1009
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,880
- Let's settle for 40 dollars.
- out of the 200 dollars I received?

1010
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,330
You see, I rarely perform...

1011
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,860
as Yoo San Seul on other shows.

1012
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,000
I know.

1013
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,270
- They got him in their performance.
- Okay.

1014
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,890
- Here we go.
- Okay.

1015
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,890
Play the music.

1016
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,300
- Is this "Redevelopment of Love?"
- Yes, it is.

1017
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,780
("Redevelopment of Love"
by Yoo San Seul)

1018
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,810
We dedicate this song to our mentor
who taught us difficult idioms...

1019
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,510
- on Running Man.
- On Running Man.

1020
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,850
- The ugliest man on Running Man...
- The ugliest man on Running Man...

1021
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,280
- is you!
- is you!

1022
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,090
(Completely)

1023
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,550
- Completely ugly
- Completely ugly

1024
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,550
(Turn me over)

1025
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,650
He's not singing.

1026
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,520
- That won't make you handsome
- That won't make you handsome

1027
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,860
(From head to toe)

1028
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,650
- Even his crooked teeth
- Even his crooked teeth

1029
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,560
- 550,000 dollars for total makeover
- 550,000 dollars for total makeover

1030
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
(Completely)

1031
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,690
He wants to become
a completely different person

1032
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,100
(Turn me over)

1033
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,240
But he'll be the same
even if he were reborn

1034
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,460
(In my heart
that has never fluttered)

1035
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,610
- He has low nipples
- He has low nipples

1036
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,470
- He has low nipples
- He has low nipples

1037
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,780
(What's that?)

1038
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,350
J Entertainment will...

1039
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,710
- Hold on.
- give you a makeover.

1040
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,140
(J Entertainment will
give you a makeover!)

1041
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,180
Stop. Hang on a second.

1042
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,990
- He should sue them.
- That's all.

1043
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,860
- Shouldn't he sue them?
- I'm so upset.

1044
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,210
- Tell us how you feel.
- Hold on.

1045
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,220
- He has low nipples
- Hold on.

1046
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,590
I will get ready to sue them.

1047
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,590
- What do you mean?
- Why?

1048
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,860
- We properly...
- How dare you...

1049
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,590
- We didn't mean it like that.
- ridicule me...

1050
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,260
- in front of all these people?
- That's not our intention.

1051
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,740
- My career is over now!
- We didn't try to ridicule you.

1052
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,240
- That's not true.
- We didn't humiliate you.

1053
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,010
How dare they talk
about my nipples?

1054
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,760
- Exactly what made you upset?
- They talked about my nipples.

1055
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Exactly what part?

1056
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,140
"His crooked teeth" annoyed me too.

1057
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,510
- We had no choice.
- We had no choice.

1058
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,740
- I'll sue them for defamation.
- We said...

1059
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,220
I fully understand him.

1060
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,570
- You understand me, right?
- He was humiliated on stage.

1061
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,280
- No.
- He wasn't humiliated.

1062
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,640
That wasn't our intention.

1063
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,450
- It was fun and moving.
- Indeed.

1064
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,490
Besides, you didn't even sing
halfway through the song.

1065
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,720
You didn't sing live.

1066
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
We can't pay you the amount
we agreed on.

1067
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,200
- I said I'd lip-sync in some parts.
- True.

1068
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm so upset because you didn't ask
for my consent in advance.

1069
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,720
Excuse me. You're so good
at lip-syncing.

1070
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,890
How about you appear
on "I Can See Your Voice?"

1071
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,070
- You're so good at it.
- Do you think so?

1072
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,300
- Yes, you did a great job.
- I'm getting so many offers.

1073
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,510
- You should talk to...
- How much will you pay him?

1074
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,260
- He's really good at it.
- How much?

1075
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,910
- Let's talk about it later.
- Okay.

1076
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,640
- I hope to see you on the show.
- Okay.

1077
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,140
- You did an amazing job.
- Thank you.

1078
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,340
He was amazing.

1079
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,550
- Did you guys see his nipples?
- What?

1080
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,740
- Of course, we did.
- Where are they?

1081
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,550
- Point where they are.
- Hey, hold on.

1082
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,390
- Haha will...
- Hey, look.

1083
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,910
(Hey, look!)

1084
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,780
(Let me see...)

1085
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,550
- I saw his nipples.
- Don't tell them.

1086
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,760
- Gosh.
- Don't tell them.

1087
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,870
Hey, Kwang Soo.

1088
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,640
Lift his shirt up to
his belly button.

1089
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,470
- You two, don't do that again.
- Gosh, seriously.

1090
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,030
You should be grateful
that I'm letting it go like this.

1091
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,510
- We paid you.
- All right.

1092
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,140
You got some extra points
for those lines at the end.

1093
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,680
- Here's my autograph you asked for.
- What is this?

1094
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,550
Why do you keep giving me
your autograph?

1095
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,050
- Keep it.
- I already signed with Se Chan.

1096
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,340
Because of your ego...

1097
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,660
I never asked you
for your autograph.

1098
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,360
- Why do you keep giving me this?
- "Study hard."

1099
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,280
Why would you tell me to study hard?

1100
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,930
I just wanted to write
something nice.

1101
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,590
Next up is JBR World.

1102
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,030
(It's JBR World's turn!)

1103
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,640
We'll begin our presentation.

1104
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,410
- We'll introduce you to JBR World.
- Ji Hyo looks so awkward.

1105
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,800
Many talent agencies' names have
"entertainment" in them, right?

1106
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,840
But we used
the word "world" instead.

1107
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
It means that our company will
become international.

1108
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,550
And what JBR stands for is...
It's my mindset for work.

1109
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,220
I always tell myself to treat
the stars I work with sincerely.

1110
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,450
So JBR stands for...

1111
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:26,260
"Ji Suk Jin backs you up
with respect." That's what it means.

1112
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,160
Are you sleepy?

1113
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,530
(Did I doze off?)

1114
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,640
- Just to wake you up.
- Wait. Did you just slap him?

1115
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,840
- Please stay awake.
- I'm sorry.

1116
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,410
First of all, JBR World
has signed...

1117
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,340
with Kim Jong Kook and Song Ji Hyo,

1118
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,410
the strongest man and the ace
of Running Man.

1119
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,300
There were dating rumors
about them.

1120
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,410
What's the truth?

1121
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,620
I assure you that it's not true.

1122
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,840
- What if they break up?
- They break up?

1123
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,240
- Are you saying they're dating?
- Look at Jong Kook's face.

1124
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,340
They're dating?

1125
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,620
Look at his face.

1126
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,820
They've never been
in a romantic relationship.

1127
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,720
Why is he glaring
at the CEO of my agency?

1128
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,390
Calm down. I have a confession
to make.

1129
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,660
- Why is he glaring at him?
- Actually,

1130
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,360
I can't control Jong Kook.

1131
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,070
So don't provoke him.

1132
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,800
- As the CEO of his agency,
- Don't provoke him.

1133
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,840
- you should control him.
- I can't do it.

1134
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
- Try not to get on his nerves.
- I didn't mean anything.

1135
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,840
Kim Jong Kook,
also known as Superstar Kim,

1136
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,030
will show you his strength.

1137
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,200
That sounds good.

1138
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,340
- Do you want some walnuts?
- Yes, I do.

1139
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,470
Does anyone want to eat walnuts?

1140
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,140
Me! Can you crack one
right in front of me?

1141
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,490
- Yes, he can do that.
- Come over here,

1142
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,490
- and do it in front of us.
- Pick one.

1143
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,050
- I'll crack the one you pick.
- This one.

1144
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,410
- This one?
- Here we go.

1145
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,280
- She picked the hard one.
- But...

1146
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,490
(Kim Jong Kook,
the symbol of power!)

1147
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,660
(Would he be able to crack
a walnut with his finger?)

1148
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,430
(What?)

1149
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,760
He broke his finger!

1150
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,870
- Jong Kook just broke his finger.
- No, I didn't.

1151
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,910
- I didn't hit it straight.
- You can do this.

1152
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,200
- I missed it.
- You can do this.

1153
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,370
It was a mistake.

1154
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,780
- I saw his finger shaking.
- I missed it.

1155
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,970
Jong Kook, try this one.

1156
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,220
- Okay.
- Let's try that one.

1157
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,740
- His finger will swell up.
- His finger...

1158
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,740
(Will he succeed this time?)

1159
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,860
It must hurt.

1160
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,950
(Rolling)

1161
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,990
Stop it!

1162
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
Jong Kook.

1163
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,820
- Don't hurt yourself!
- Let me try just one more time.

1164
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,120
- Jong Kook, come on.
- Let go.

1165
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,800
- Let go of me.
- Stop it.

1166
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,970
I'll give you 0.3 points.

1167
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,090
Stop it.

1168
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,260
I'll give you 0.3 points.

1169
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,090
(He finally broke it into pieces.)

1170
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,760
- It's done. Good job.
- Okay.

1171
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,510
- It's delicious.
- Great job.

1172
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,970
- He did it. Give him a hand now!
- Listen.

1173
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,470
- Come on. Give him a hand.
- He's scary.

1174
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,610
- We've seen him cracking it before.
- Hey.

1175
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,070
He did a great job.

1176
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,820
- Next up is Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

1177
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
As for Ji Hyo...

1178
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,010
She gets lucky all the time.

1179
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:38,260
Today, she'll prove
that it's actually her ability.

1180
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,590
It wasn't just luck.
She made it happen.

1181
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,160
We prepared eggs here
for an egg breaking game.

1182
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,660
Half are cooked,
and the rest are raw.

1183
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,260
She'll pick out three eggs
that are cooked...

1184
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,110
and break them in front of you.

1185
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,010
We won't mark on the eggs.
She can memorize the locations.

1186
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,180
I'll put the cooked ones here.

1187
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,640
This one is raw. Why are there
more raw eggs than cooked eggs?

1188
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,550
She'll pick out a cooked egg
and break it before you...

1189
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,820
three times in a row.

1190
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,820
- Did you mark the eggs?
- No.

1191
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,970
Can we reposition the eggs?

1192
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,180
- Sure. Check them.
- We should check them.

1193
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,490
- Are you sure?
- You want to reposition them?

1194
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,950
- Go ahead.
- Of course, we should do it.

1195
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,180
- Why can't you trust us?
- We should check them first.

1196
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,360
We would never pull a trick.

1197
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,760
Half of them are raw.

1198
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,530
All right.

1199
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,370
Let's begin.

1200
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,570
In all three attempts,

1201
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,740
she'll choose a cooked egg,

1202
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,390
and break it to prove it.

1203
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,570
Hit it on your forehead, okay?

1204
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,970
- I hope she picks a raw egg.
- What do I do?

1205
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,870
- If she does, end your show, okay?
- Okay.

1206
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,640
- Do you think you can do it?
- Both of you like breaking things.

1207
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,780
Let's go.

1208
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,640
Hit it right on your forehead.

1209
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,740
Are you sure it's cooked?

1210
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,180
You shouldn't shake it.

1211
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,050
Now, hit it on your forehead.

1212
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,050
- Be more confident.
- One.

1213
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,510
- I don't think...
- Two.

1214
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,860
Three. Go!

1215
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,180
- Okay!
- Really?

1216
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,550
(She picked a cooked egg!)

1217
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,470
- Look.
- I picked the right one.

1218
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,760
Okay. Let's move on.

1219
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,890
- Next.
- Okay. Next.

1220
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:56,990
(She got lucky
in her first attempt.)

1221
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,760
- Let's go.
- She won't be so lucky this time.

1222
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,340
- You can get lucky once.
- Gosh. I'm worried.

1223
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,370
(I'm worried about her.)

1224
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,110
(She follows her hunch
to pick the second egg!)

1225
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,840
There are four boiled eggs...

1226
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,180
and five raw eggs left in the case.

1227
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,410
Are you sure?

1228
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,840
- Are you sure?
- Okay.

1229
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,050
- Let's go.
- If she succeeds again,

1230
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,590
- I'd be really surprised.
- Okay. It's a boiled egg.

1231
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,160
1, 2, 3.

1232
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,050
Okay!

1233
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,300
Oh, my. Really?

1234
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,220
- Twice in a row?
- Okay.

1235
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,390
- Aren't they all cooked?
- Okay.

1236
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,300
- No. Not all of them are cooked.
- One more time.

1237
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,070
Isn't she amazing?

1238
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,160
- Then...
- Let's check the eggs later.

1239
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,840
- check the eggs afterward.
- Okay.

1240
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,970
Check them.

1241
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,140
Okay.

1242
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,180
One more time. Just once more.

1243
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,180
Will she succeed?

1244
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,610
- I have faith in you.
- Here.

1245
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,180
- I'll cook it if it's raw.
- Cook it.

1246
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,990
(She made it this far
purely thanks to her luck.)

1247
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,490
Here I go. 1, 2, 3.

1248
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,390
(She picked a boiled egg!)

1249
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,820
(The lucky Superstar Song succeeded
despite the 8 percent chance.)

1250
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,260
- That doesn't make sense.
- It makes no sense.

1251
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,490
- It's true.
- No way.

1252
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,990
- Check them yourself.
- Try it.

1253
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,720
- Pick one and break it.
- No way.

1254
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Break it.

1255
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,430
(His face is covered with raw egg.)

1256
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,660
(Confirmation is complete.)

1257
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,370
He chose a raw egg.

1258
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,950
- I told you it was real.
- She actually pulled it off.

1259
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,180
- I was surprised by Ji Hyo too.
- We didn't pull a trick.

1260
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,320
- But we repositioned them.
- It was real.

1261
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,950
- I said, it was real.
- She actually did it.

1262
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,180
- Try it.
- She picked out the right ones.

1263
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,860
(Her face is covered with raw egg.)

1264
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,910
CEO Jeon.

1265
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,780
Stop it already.

1266
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,320
What happened? How did she do it?

1267
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,200
She actually picked the right ones.

1268
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,450
- She's incredible.
- It was real.

1269
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,570
Hey, seriously,
I think it was amazing.

1270
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,700
- Right?
- Yes.

1271
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,490
- The stars of JBR World.
- She got lucky.

1272
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,760
Please give them
a round of applause!

1273
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,490
Thank you.

1274
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,740
(The top stars' surprising talents
offset the CEO's weak speech.)

1275
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,280
I slept peacefully thanks to you.

1276
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,010
Last but not least,
Cocoa M Monkey by Physical Contact.

1277
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,280
Let me introduce
the artist at my agency.

1278
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,820
Why are you covering me?

1279
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,240
So you can make a great entrance.

1280
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,320
I'm sorry,

1281
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,660
but did you two break up recently?

1282
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,660
- No?
- No.

1283
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,220
- Anyway...
- You know,

1284
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,680
CEO Jeon falls in love easily.

1285
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,120
Dating within the agency...

1286
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,950
- isn't allowed.
- There are some agency CEOs...

1287
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,390
- marrying a star at the agency.
- True.

1288
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,260
- That's not the case.
- Many fall in love like that.

1289
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,660
- There are some couples like that.
- Come on. Stop it.

1290
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,570
I can't tell you that
because it's my private life.

1291
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,740
- What? Just tell them.
- It's my private life.

1292
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,340
- Tell them.
- That's not necessary.

1293
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,510
- We...
- You can just say it's not true.

1294
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,910
I guess she has something to hide.

1295
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,450
What makes this agency
so suspicious is...

1296
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,510
that the CEO is a bit strange.

1297
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,140
- Her behaviors are all strange.
- It's hard to read her face.

1298
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,360
- She's cheesy too.
- That's not true.

1299
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,510
He'll begin now.
Enjoy his performance.

1300
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,780
Oh, he'll dance.

1301
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:35,030
(He'll improvise a dance
to whatever song is played!)

1302
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,610
(The boneless wave dance!)

1303
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:46,740
Awesome!

1304
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,200
He's incredible.

1305
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,110
(The hipster's groove
that's perfect for the song)

1306
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,050
Wooyoung is such a great dancer.

1307
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,470
He really is a great dancer.

1308
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,050
He's a great dancer.

1309
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,490
Of course.

1310
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,860
(A song in a completely different
genre is played.)

1311
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,260
What's going on?

1312
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,300
(How will he dance to this song?)

1313
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,550
He can dance to any type of song.

1314
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,160
He's good.

1315
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:15,740
He really is a great dancer.

1316
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,570
(Popping and bouncing dance!)

1317
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,610
He's so good at this. He's amazing.

1318
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,700
He's so cool.

1319
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,800
He's amazing.

1320
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,340
He's really talented.

1321
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,340
(Everyone is amazed
by the professional performance.)

1322
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,680
(The last song is the hardest song
to dance, Lee Bak Sa's trot song!)

1323
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,820
Wooyoung, you're awesome.

1324
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,640
- This is amazing.
- He's really good at dancing.

1325
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,090
- He's such a great dancer.
- He's good.

1326
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,050
- He's awesome.
- I'm amazed.

1327
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,360
My, Wooyoung is
such a great dancer.

1328
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,620
- That was amazing.
- No one can beat him.

1329
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,030
- He's such a great dancer.
- Great job.

1330
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,070
- Where are you going?
- By the way,

1331
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,240
- Wooyoung did all the work.
- You're a great dancer.

1332
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,660
Wooyoung is such a great dancer.

1333
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,070
- He's an amazing dancer.
- Indeed.

1334
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,140
- I'm surprised.
- This isn't his first rodeo.

1335
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,240
CEO Jeon.

1336
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,610
Could you perhaps
dance for us instead?

1337
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,610
(Suk Jin's her biggest fan.)

1338
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,680
(CEO Jeon dances
whenever she's asked.)

1339
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,370
(Roars with laughter)

1340
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,410
- She's just crazy.
- Look at her expression.

1341
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,390
Her expression does it all.

1342
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,410
(Her expression does all the work.)

1343
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,260
Look at how confident she is.

1344
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,320
- Ms. Jeon, can you do this too?
- Her eyes.

1345
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,860
Her eyes do all the work.

1346
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,860
(The dinner show ends
with her dance performance.)

1347
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,360
- Her turns are good.
- Did you see her eyes?

1348
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,450
That's right.

1349
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,760
- Mr. Ji loves it the most.
- I know.

1350
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,870
- Mr. Ji...
- You're the best.

1351
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,200
I always deliver.

1352
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,340
- Like this.
- Dance for him often.

1353
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,200
The ones who love her dancing
are Suk Jin and our cameraman.

1354
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,200
(The press conference ends
with her captivating performance.)

1355
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,300
They were clapping.

1356
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,570
They absolutely love this.

1357
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,680
- The result is out.
- Okay.

1358
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,510
The one in 1st place
will receive 1,000 dollars...

1359
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,090
and 100 dollars will be deducted...

1360
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,220
with each lower ranking.

1361
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,410
I wouldn't mind
at least 600 dollars.

1362
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,760
The CEOs will receive their money
depending on their contracts.

1363
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,530
The money you earned
will be all yours.

1364
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,680
In first place is...

1365
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:49,950
Out of 25 points,

1366
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,160
this person received 20.7 points.

1367
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,340
(The one who'll win 1,000 dollars)

1368
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,370
It's Jessi.

1369
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,870
I gave you a high score.

1370
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,800
- Jessi.
- I gave you a high score.

1371
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,180
It's my first time winning
on Jae Suk's team.

1372
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,700
Jessi, you'll receive
1,000 dollars...

1373
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,010
and split it with Haha accordingly.

1374
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,820
In 2nd place with 18.5 points...

1375
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,140
is Wooyoung.

1376
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,320
(Wooyoung is in 2nd place!)

1377
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,450
You get 900 dollars.

1378
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,260
(Wooyoung receives 900 dollars.)

1379
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,620
In 3rd place
and getting 800 dollars...

1380
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,620
is Ji Hyo with 16 points.

1381
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,200
In eighth place is Haha.

1382
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,800
And in the last place...

1383
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,530
(In the bottom two
are Kwang Soo and Jae Suk.)

1384
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,800
Why is Jae Suk in the bottom two
after that performance?

1385
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,430
He did a good job.

1386
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,510
- That's what you all said.
- Why do I have a low score?

1387
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,660
And I was in a duo act, remember?

1388
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,010
He did what I did.

1389
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,430
Is this a joke?

1390
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,550
One received 4.75 points
while the other got 2.3 points.

1391
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,840
- 2.4 points?
- No way.

1392
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,470
The one with the lowest score
only gets 100 dollars.

1393
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:45,640
(Who will receive the lowest pay?)

1394
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,890
With 2.3 points...

1395
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,990
- is Jae Suk.
- Okay!

1396
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,410
(Jae Suk is in the last place!)

1397
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,360
Kwang Soo's happy
to be in ninth place.

1398
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,720
Right...

1399
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,800
How much do I get?

1400
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,430
- Unbelievable.
- You get 200 dollars.

1401
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:00,200
We'll settle the payments
at our next location.

1402
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,260
(Today's Schedule)

1403
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,660
It's now time
to renew your contracts.

1404
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,240
- Sir.
- Hold on for a second.

1405
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,370
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1406
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,700
You see...

1407
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,550
- You'll have to work...
- Yes?

1408
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,620
a little harder.

1409
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:18,340
I only say this because...

1410
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:21,120
you've put us in the red.

1411
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,550
That's just mean.

1412
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,050
- That wasn't my intention.
- That was harsh.

1413
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,120
I think we should
give it one more chance.

1414
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,320
First of all, I'd like my payment...

1415
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,860
You've got nothing
going for yourself right now...

1416
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,990
and haven't shown me anything,
so renew the contract.

1417
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:34,800
Let me give you your money first.

1418
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,090
(Jae Suk 9.5 versus Agency 0.5)

1419
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,530
Since you received 100 dollars,
you get 95.

1420
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
Your contracts...

1421
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,840
- are up for renewal.
- Suk Jin.

1422
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:43,410
- I mean, Mr. Ji.
- I'd like to renew your contracts.

1423
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,640
You should spend some of your money.

1424
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,950
No, this is for me to keep.

1425
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,550
We should get a signing bonus.

1426
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,950
I'll give you 100 dollars each.

1427
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,450
I'll give you that.

1428
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,550
- Really?
- Hand it over then.

1429
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,890
- I will.
- We'll take it right now.

1430
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:54,890
But my cut...

1431
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,490
- Your cut?
- It should be 7 to 3.

1432
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,720
- Because...
- We'll have to reconsider.

1433
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,360
We'll listen to some other offers.

1434
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,660
- Wait.
- We'll hear them out.

1435
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,620
- We'll hear their offers.
- Just their offers.

1436
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,030
- Because...
- That's not all, you know.

1437
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,800
The signing bonus is one thing.

1438
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,640
- Just hear me out.
- We might earn more later,

1439
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,660
- so 100 dollars...
- To renew our contract,

1440
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,780
you have to consider
what our friendship costs.

1441
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,530
- Ji Hyo.
- But...

1442
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,180
- 7 to 3, you say?
- You see...

1443
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,110
- Let's shop around first.
- That wasn't my only offer.

1444
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,740
- Sure thing.
- There's more!

1445
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,680
- We'll ask around first.
- All right.

1446
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,340
Unbelievable.

1447
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,490
I need to win big
in this next round.

1448
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,530
- Wait. Okay, how about this?
- Go ahead.

1449
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:32,950
I know you two are dating.

1450
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,320
(He gives them the role
of two celebrities dating.)

1451
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,570
Which is why I'll...

1452
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,820
We'll only sign
with the same agency.

1453
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,890
- I...
- Yes?

1454
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,430
- We move as a set.
- I'll make sure...

1455
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:45,430
this doesn't get out.

1456
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,800
- I know it all but...
- You'll keep it a secret?

1457
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,840
I will...

1458
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,510
Will you keep it a secret?

1459
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,570
(They play along
to get a bigger signing bonus.)

1460
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,240
- Are you sure?
- I know your secret.

1461
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,450
- Will you keep it a secret?
- I'll stop all articles.

1462
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:55,620
- Okay.
- Okay?

1463
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,840
- You'll stop the rumors?
- No articles will be published?

1464
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,450
Sign with me for 50 dollars.

1465
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,740
- 50 dollars?
- 50 dollars?

1466
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,050
Guys, wait. JK, please.

1467
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:04,620
- Not for 50 dollars.
- I have proof, you know.

1468
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,430
At another agency...

1469
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,860
I have a photo.

1470
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,050
At another agency...

1471
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,950
- What photo?
- Is he insane?

1472
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:13,200
I mean it. Should I show you?

1473
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,430
(He only has photos
of Dream on his phone.)

1474
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,590
- Okay, I hear you.
- CEO Ha.

1475
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,200
- Sure.
- CEO Ha.

1476
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,870
So you and me...

1477
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,910
We'll receive the penalty
at this rate.

1478
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,430
Anyway, I've offered you
everything I have.

1479
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,700
(A signing bonus of 100 dollars
and a 9 to 1 split)

1480
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,050
- Okay, good.
- There we go.

1481
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,950
What do you say to 9.5 to 0.5?

1482
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,550
- What?
- 9.5 to 0.5.

1483
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,550
(He offers Jessi
a groundbreaking deal.)

1484
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,910
- I'll get to take home a lot.
- Sure.

1485
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,320
I'm down.

1486
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,930
- Here?
- Yes, here.

1487
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:41,930
(Jessi signs with J Entertainment.)

1488
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,200
What I honestly want to do
is sign you for life.

1489
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,300
To prove our partnership,
I suggest 7 to 3.

1490
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:48,660
Really?

1491
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,700
Jessi.

1492
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,970
- Just run.
- Jessi, wait.

1493
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,510
- You should give up 280 dollars.
- What will you offer me?

1494
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:55,680
How much will you offer me?

1495
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,110
- What?
- I'll sign for 1,000 dollars.

1496
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,570
Why? I'll sign for that much.

1497
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,300
Please finalize your deals.

1498
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,220
No, not yet.

1499
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,620
It can't be over just yet.

1500
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,090
Hold on. I haven't signed anyone.

1501
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,860
- Let's sign the contract.
- 8 to 2.

1502
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,860
Give me 200 dollars.

1503
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,010
- Se Chan, go.
- Okay, fine.

1504
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:12,450
- I heard you.
- Let's do this.

1505
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,390
- On one condition.
- What's that?

1506
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,550
Draw a unibrow.

1507
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,120
- Okay, fine.
- Show me you mean it.

1508
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:18,620
You only have eyes for me.

1509
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,990
Please finalize your deals.

1510
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,840
- Everyone's taken.
- Jong Kook.

1511
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,530
Please finalize your deals.

1512
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,160
Hey! Jong Kook!

1513
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,140
- Ji Hyo, come back.
- How much?

1514
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,340
- Come quick.
- Name your offer.

1515
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,740
- What?
- How will we split the money?

1516
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,740
(Jong Kook won't sign
until he's treated right.)

1517
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,640
- It'll be the same.
- What?

1518
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,220
It'll be the same as before.

1519
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,410
- The same as before?
- Yes, with something extra!

1520
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,990
- The same as before?
- 50 dollars.

1521
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,090
(That's not a bad deal.)

1522
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,090
Yes, with something extra!
Ji Hyo, too.

1523
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,180
A signing bonus of 50 dollars.

1524
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,680
Should I tell the world
that you're dating?

1525
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,220
You don't want that.

1526
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,820
(CEO Ha threatens them.)

1527
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,030
I haven't signed anyone yet.

1528
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,620
- Wait.
- I'll give you a better offer.

1529
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,660
Suk Jin.

1530
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,660
I think it's over for you.

1531
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,390
- What if you can't sign anyone?
- What time is it?

1532
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,470
- Here.
- What if you can't sign anyone?

1533
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,870
Then, 10 to 0!

1534
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,240
- 10 to 0.
- 10 to 0?

1535
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,050
- Let's go.
- 10 to 0?

1536
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,800
- 10 to 0 is insane.
- Let's go.

1537
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,180
- 10 to 0?
- 10 to 0.

1538
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,140
- 10 to 0?
- You can't offer that.

1539
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,510
What happens if a CEO
can't sign any celebrities?

1540
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,550
The agency will be shut down,

1541
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:14,590
and the CEO will have
to sign with another agency.

1542
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:15,760
You'll have to sign
with an agency yourself.

1543
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,820
- Really?
- Hold on.

1544
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,360
- I just mean that...
- 10 to 0. Seriously?

1545
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,360
I... Jessi, you haven't signed
with an agency yet, have you?

1546
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,120
- Don't be ridiculous.
- CEO Ji.

1547
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,390
Just sign with an agency
as a celebrity.

1548
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,870
I...

1549
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:27,930
That suits you better.

1550
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,390
- Okay.
- It's a 9 to 1 deal.

1551
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:30,760
- Cheers.
- This will be fun.

1552
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,510
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo,
can at least one of you join me?

1553
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,200
10 to 0!

1554
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,410
Please finalize your deals.

1555
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,280
I'll split 10 to 0!

1556
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,570
Suk Jin has made his debut.

1557
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,450
(The oldest rookie ever)

1558
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,990
Goodness, Junior Ji.

1559
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,860
- Junior Ji.
- How about you sign with me?

1560
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,490
You're many years my junior.

1561
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:52,860
- How much do you have?
- What?

1562
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,320
- How much do you have?
- I think...

1563
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,720
about 500 dollars.

1564
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,260
To register for the shutdown,
you must pay 300 dollars.

1565
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,820
Why must I shut down my business?

1566
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,890
- Was that always the rule?
- Must I be shut down?

1567
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,740
Must you pay
to shut down your business?

1568
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,240
Is this how one's business
is shut down?

1569
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,870
(He puts aside the honor
that was overwhelming for him.)

1570
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,110
(Just like his stocks,
his business is shut down.)

1571
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,140
Suk Jin, why don't I get you
on "Dongchimi" next week?

1572
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,410
How about "Flaming Youth?"

1573
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:18,910
You should start
with "Flaming Youth."

1574
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:19,990
- "Flaming Youth."
- Right, "Flaming Youth."

1575
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,860
- "Flaming Youth..."
- That's an option.

1576
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,320
- Then...
- Please step back.

1577
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,510
- Step back.
- Who'll sign him?

1578
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,160
- Then...
- I'll sign him.

1579
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,390
- No, I will.
- We will.

1580
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:28,700
How about 8 to 2...

1581
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,760
with a signing bonus?

1582
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,820
- 8 to 2.
- A bonus...

1583
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:32,990
Here. I'll sign with them.

1584
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,430
An 8 to 2 split
with a signing bonus of 50 dollars.

1585
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,840
It would've been funny
if he signed you as a manager.

1586
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,200
Lucky Kwang Soo.

1587
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:45,110
Here's your first gig
as superstars today.

1588
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,070
You will play to be
the last man standing...

1589
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,550
- in Informal Talk Golden Bell.
- Informal Talk Golden Bell?

1590
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:51,840
Yes, Informal Talk Golden Bell.

1591
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,840
A randomly chosen person...

1592
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,950
will come up with a question
in his or her head.

1593
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,280
It'll then be asked
to anyone of their choosing.

1594
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:05,220
The question will be answered.
If you get it wrong,

1595
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,990
you'll be eliminated.

1596
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,260
The agency will come last.

1597
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,390
Having signed a lot of people
will pay off.

1598
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,740
No second chances?

1599
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,260
Having signed a lot of people
will pay off.

1600
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,530
You're right.

1601
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,030
Wait, it's a quiz?

1602
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,740
Shouldn't you have
told us that beforehand?

1603
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,340
You should've signed with me.

1604
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,950
Didn't you see how I was last week?

1605
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:20,950
Unbelievable.

1606
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,680
Asking the questions
isn't easy either.

1607
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,320
- Of course.
- You need to know it first...

1608
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,390
to ask others.

1609
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,590
Exactly.

1610
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:29,510
What's something
that only I would know?

1611
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:33,050
The name of the game is
Informal Talk Golden Bell.

1612
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,090
- Right.
- Sure.

1613
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:37,030
You're all supposed
to be the same age,

1614
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,300
so you must be
informal with each other.

1615
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,430
Say any formal words
and you'll be eliminated.

1616
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,140
I love games like that.

1617
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,240
Me too.

1618
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,740
- We're to speak informally.
- Can I be informal with you?

1619
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,140
You always have been.

1620
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,340
Yes, you always have.

1621
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,240
We can't say "oppa"
or "hyung," right?

1622
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,550
No, you're all supposed
to be the same age.

1623
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,240
Wooyoung's the luckiest.

1624
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,340
I'm the one who has most to lose.

1625
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,620
Doesn't Suk Jin
have it the easiest?

1626
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,140
- Exactly.
- Suk Jin...

1627
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,760
is already informal with everyone.

1628
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,660
I made the right choice
signing Suk Jin.

1629
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,160
It's impossible for me
to make any mistakes.

1630
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,820
- But we...
- He's informal with everyone.

1631
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,320
Jessi has never been
formal with me before.

1632
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,260
- You've never been that way.
- What do you mean?

1633
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,430
- You're always informal.
- Hey!

1634
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:16,300
Hey, what?

1635
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,140
Treat me like you always have.

1636
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,800
This is the best game
for Suk Jin and Jessi.

1637
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,340
- How annoying.
- Here we go.

1638
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,030
You know what
an Informal Talk Game is, right?

1639
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,240
- Of course.
- Go!

1640
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,640
(The Informal Talk Game begins.)

1641
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,740
(Anyone who speaks formally
will be eliminated.)

1642
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,640
- No one's talking.
- Be informal with each other.

1643
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,720
Suk Jin, stop shaking your legs.

1644
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,740
The game has begun.

1645
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,090
It's not like I have
to speak formally.

1646
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:37,950
- The rules are different.
- Of course not.

1647
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,220
Suk Jin, you can't
get upset though.

1648
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,950
We're all the same age, right?

1649
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,530
Jessi's kind of flustered though.

1650
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,220
Jessi, you can speak
informally with everyone.

1651
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,720
- We're all friends here.
- Be informal with the staff too.

1652
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,990
What's your surname?
Park, Lee, or Kim?

1653
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,030
Shut it.

1654
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,970
It's Ho.

1655
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,240
- Her surname is Ho.
- Jessi...

1656
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,300
It's Ho Hyeon Ju.

1657
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,200
- Okay?
- Jessi Ho.

1658
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,030
- That's right.
- Ho Hyeon Ju.

1659
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,200
Gosh, this is...

1660
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,050
Hey, Jong Kook. Say something.

1661
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,120
Why are you so sullen?

1662
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,140
- Jong Kook.
- Why are you so sullen?

1663
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,620
Use your words, Jong Kook.

1664
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,780
I don't use words.

1665
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,410
(I don't use words.)

1666
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,620
(Breathless)

1667
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,910
- Hold on.
- My goodness.

1668
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,820
- This is...
- Friends say that...

1669
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,430
- to each other, okay?
- This is ridiculous.

1670
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,490
This is the Informal Talk Game.

1671
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,700
How are we supposed to play
the Informal Talk Game?

1672
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,890
- This is the Informal Talk Game.
- "I don't use words."

1673
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,140
You should use words
since this game is about talking.

1674
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,390
- Is he a thug?
- What is this?

1675
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:24,870
- Seriously.
- I don't use words.

1676
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,140
I usually don't use words.

1677
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,200
- Is that so? Okay. I got it.
- Yes.

1678
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,200
I don't use words either.

1679
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,200
- We are a team.
- I am sorry, Se Chan.

1680
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,570
Sir, may I write a question now?

1681
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,320
No, you can't write it yet.

1682
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,180
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

1683
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,180
You spoke formally.

1684
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,340
I was talking to the producer.

1685
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,360
You have to speak informally
even to the producer.

1686
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,430
(They begin to discuss
to whom they can speak informally.)

1687
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:46,950
From now on, speak informally
to the production crew as well.

1688
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,180
- Really?
- Really?

1689
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,300
- All right.
- To the production crew as well?

1690
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,700
- To the production crew as well?
- Speak informally to everyone.

1691
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,800
- Hey.
- All right.

1692
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,490
Chan Hee. Hey, Chan Hee.

1693
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,030
(He summons
the main camera director.)

1694
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,300
(Film us over here.)

1695
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,300
Film us over here.

1696
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,070
Are we speaking informally
to everyone?

1697
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,610
- We shouldn't do that to Chan Hee.
- Chan Hee.

1698
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:03,930
- Chan Hee.
- We shouldn't do that to Chan Hee.

1699
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,200
(Kang Chan Hee, a camera director
with 36 years of experience)

1700
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,410
We shouldn't do that to Chan Hee.

1701
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:07,870
- We shouldn't touch Chan Hee.
- Seriously.

1702
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,820
- Hey! Punk!
- Leave Chan Hee out of this.

1703
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,510
- That's right.
- We shouldn't do that to Chan Hee.

1704
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,410
- Okay.
- Hold on.

1705
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,990
Chan Hee must be angry.

1706
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,680
- His face is red.
- Leave Chan Hee out of this. Stop.

1707
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,680
Stop.

1708
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,450
Chan Hee, don't be upset.

1709
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,800
Chan Hee, that's how it is.

1710
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,220
The first question is important,

1711
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,320
so let's play rock-paper-scissors,
shall we?

1712
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,870
- What?
- Do you speak informally too?

1713
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,390
(Why are you speaking informally?)

1714
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,840
Why are you speaking informally?

1715
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,800
- Why are you speaking informally?
- What was that?

1716
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,610
- Do you speak informally too?
- What was that?

1717
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,340
Are we playing the game
with everyone in the building?

1718
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,700
- Hold on.
- Hey.

1719
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,780
Maybe he proposed the game
to speak informally to us.

1720
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,620
Hey, Beanpole, say something.

1721
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,220
Am I Beanpole?

1722
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,490
Who else would be Beanpole?

1723
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,620
- It's a nickname.
- Listen, everyone.

1724
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,050
Sometimes, I use my fist
without thinking.

1725
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,360
You should move out of the way.

1726
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,620
Sit down!

1727
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,030
All right.

1728
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,620
Which Ho Clan is your family from?

1729
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,800
Be quiet.

1730
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,970
The Be Quiet Ho Clan?

1731
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,760
Which Ho Clan is your family from?
You don't know, right?

1732
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,570
You don't know those things, right?
You should know.

1733
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,160
What was that?

1734
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,430
(He admonishes her
with a monologue.)

1735
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,180
- You are so childish. Suk Jin.
- What was that? Seok Sam.

1736
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,340
- You are so childish.
- What was that?

1737
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,010
- Suk Jin, you are so childish.
- Seok Sam.

1738
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,620
It was such a petty revenge.

1739
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,620
Seok Sam.

1740
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,340
Seok Sam, don't be like that
to your friend.

1741
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,590
Steamed Monkfish, be quiet.

1742
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:20,990
- Steamed Monkfish?
- Steamed Monkfish.

1743
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,510
- Be quiet, you punk.
- "You punk."

1744
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,090
"You punk?"

1745
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,090
- What?
- Don't swear at your friend.

1746
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,220
Why not?

1747
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,950
I could hit you!

1748
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,120
Suk Jin, hold yourself back.

1749
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,120
- Suk Jin.
- Are you scared?

1750
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,220
- What?
- Are you scared?

1751
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,800
I will hit your temple
with my knuckle.

1752
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,760
Hey, hey. Stop talking.

1753
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,510
You are one
who needs to stop talking.

1754
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:44,030
(You are one
who needs to stop talking.)

1755
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,300
Seriously.

1756
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,780
- Seok Sam.
- Stop talking, you punk.

1757
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,180
Seok Sam must be in a good mood.

1758
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,220
He looks so awkward.

1759
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,450
- Seriously.
- He was serious.

1760
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:51,570
- Hey.
- Stop talking.

1761
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,450
I can't believe this guy.

1762
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,410
- For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

1763
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:57,010
- For goodness' sake.
- Go ahead.

1764
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,510
Any one of us
can give the question, right?

1765
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,120
Shall I give a simple one?

1766
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,620
- You shouldn't do that.
- You shouldn't do that.

1767
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,300
Give a hard one
that can finish off a team.

1768
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,550
I don't know if I can do that.

1769
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,700
Kook Jong is
unexpectedly knowledgeable.

1770
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,390
- He is pretty smart.
- Yes.

1771
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,200
He is pretty smart.
Isn't that right, Kook Jong?

1772
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,910
You are going to die.

1773
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,800
What? I just...

1774
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,800
Se Chan.

1775
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,180
None of your clothes match
the color of your hat,

1776
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,510
but I can help you with that.

1777
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,410
That means he will make me bloody.

1778
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:23,820
- Gosh, Kook Jong.
- I can help you with that.

1779
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,240
Let's watch what we say.

1780
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,510
I want to ask them a question first.

1781
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,910
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

1782
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,590
He must have a question in mind.

1783
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,950
It should be
a general knowledge question.

1784
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,030
(He racks his brain
for a general knowledge question.)

1785
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,450
- Come on.
- Ask a general knowledge question.

1786
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,490
- Ask a general knowledge question.
- General question.

1787
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:39,200
I can take out two members.
Shall I go first?

1788
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,430
You can't take out anyone.

1789
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:41,430
(Laughing)

1790
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,300
Hold on. Listen.

1791
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,930
You probably
won't get it right, Beanpole.

1792
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,930
- Don't copy someone's answer.
- We won't do that.

1793
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,200
- In any case,
- Cover your answer.

1794
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,010
it's more advantageous for you
if your team members get eliminated.

1795
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,030
That's right.

1796
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:53,110
All right. Give me...

1797
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,720
- the name...
- Oh, my goodness! No!

1798
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,410
of the Russian president.

1799
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:00,490
- The full name?
- Give me the full name.

1800
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,160
He knows that from playing games.
He always goes back to it.

1801
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,720
Gosh.

1802
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,590
- Don't look.
- I expected something harder,

1803
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,030
- Se Chan.
- Don't show your answer.

1804
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,870
(He learned about "Vladimir Putin"
2 years ago during a quiz.)

1805
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,700
(His unbelievably wrong answer...)

1806
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,160
(got him ridiculed.)

1807
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,610
(Give me the full name
of the Russian president.)

1808
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:27,510
(It's the only question
Se Chan knows the answer to.)

1809
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:29,070
(He is happy
to use the question once again.)

1810
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,840
I know the answer.

1811
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,680
I don't know.

1812
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,220
Some members will be eliminated.

1813
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,590
- He chose the right team.
- Se Chan...

1814
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:38,450
doesn't know much...

1815
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,530
- other than that.
- Seok Sam.

1816
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,120
You shouldn't say that so loudly.

1817
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,200
All of them might get eliminated.

1818
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,160
Didn't you write the same answer
the last time?

1819
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,300
Was it incorrect?

1820
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,070
(He has a poor memory.)

1821
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,430
Didn't I get it right?

1822
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:51,090
(Talking loudly)

1823
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:55,140
Be quiet!

1824
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,950
Hold on, Jessi.

1825
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,510
- Hold on.
- My goodness.

1826
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,070
What was that? Hold on.

1827
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,950
- Jessi, what was that?
- Jessi.

1828
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:06,910
Jae Suk, that was like
a comedy skit.

1829
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,510
- It was fun, right?
- It was so much fun.

1830
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:09,820
- You should whisper.
- It was fun, right?

1831
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,720
- It was fun.
- It was so much fun.

1832
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,930
It was fun.

1833
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:15,160
"Be quiet!" That was perfect.

1834
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,430
- It was so much fun.
- "Be quiet!"

1835
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:18,120
- "Be quiet!"
- What a fun comedy skit!

1836
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,870
All right.
Did you write down the answer?

1837
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,430
The four of you will reveal
your answers first.

1838
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:23,140
1, 2, 3.

1839
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,260
Reveal the answers.

1840
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,530
I am not sure.

1841
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:28,430
- Putin.
- The two of them knew.

1842
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,180
- Se Chan, reveal the answer.
- I don't know the first name.

1843
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,870
(Thankfully, Empty Head wrote
the name correctly.)

1844
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,470
- Vladimir Putin.
- Okay. I am not sure.

1845
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,820
- I got it right.
- Putin.

1846
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,340
(Jessi failed to write
the full name.)

1847
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,090
Seeing the answer
brings back memories.

1848
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,010
Kwang Soo, what did you write?

1849
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,890
- What did you write?
- What did you write?

1850
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:46,430
- General...
- General ID Putin?

1851
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:48,260
- I could only remember Gorbachev.
- General...

1852
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,300
Gorbachev!

1853
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,800
My goodness.

1854
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,870
Beanpole, I knew you would fail.

1855
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:54,200
We lost two members.

1856
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,030
- Jessi and Kwang Soo are out.
- Okay.

1857
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,340
Does that mean I can't play?

1858
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,490
- That's right.
- I can't even ask a question?

1859
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,660
She can't even ask a question?

1860
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,660
What kind of a rule is that?

1861
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,070
(The 1st question took out
2 members.)

1862
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,200
- This one will be hard.
- Ask about the capitals.

1863
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,070
It's a matter of choosing
which team to eliminate.

1864
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,870
- The team might get eliminated.
- This one...

1865
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,720
will be hard.

1866
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,510
- It will be hard.
- Ask about the famous capitals.

1867
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,720
Which country?

1868
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,160
Jae Suk,
you should ask the other team.

1869
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,720
You know that we have no hope.

1870
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,550
I think this question will eliminate
the entire team.

1871
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,220
Jae Suk, it won't be entertaining
if it eliminates the entire team.

1872
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,320
Hey, Big Mouth.

1873
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:29,390
You should stop chattering.

1874
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,090
I like your mustache.

1875
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:32,470
Hey, you with too much space
between the eyebrows.

1876
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,610
- Look at his eyebrows.
- Hey, Glasses.

1877
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:36,930
- You are wearing glasses too.
- I can't believe you.

1878
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,340
- They are going to fight.
- Punk,

1879
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,450
- did you call me Glasses?
- All right!

1880
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:41,180
- Glasses.
- Glasses.

1881
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,410
Glasses was a popular nickname
in our time, right?

1882
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:45,070
Be careful what you say, okay?

1883
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:47,890
This team doesn't have anyone
who can ask a difficult question.

1884
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:48,990
You are right. Let's end that team.

1885
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,680
- End that team. That's right.
- That's right.

1886
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,220
- Seok Sam. Seok Sam.
- You have a point.

1887
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,490
We need to end them
when we have a chance.

1888
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,260
Will it be about the capitals?

1889
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,700
When I ask a question
about the capitals...

1890
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,490
- Would you make a promise?
- I don't know about the capitals.

1891
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,200
(Would you make a promise?)

1892
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,570
If one member survives... What?

1893
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,070
- You spoke formally.
- Hey.

1894
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:07,300
- Yes!
- Suk Jin.

1895
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,930
- Come on.
- What was that?

1896
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,870
- Sit down.
- This is driving me crazy.

1897
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,910
Why did you suddenly speak formally?

1898
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:15,010
Hey, good job!

1899
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,510
- He was acting up.
- Good job.

1900
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:17,840
- He was acting up.
- Hey.

1901
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,820
- He was acting up.
- He was acting up.

1902
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:22,090
- I knew he would mess up.
- Why did you speak formally?

1903
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,590
- Everyone is younger than you.
- This is driving me crazy.

1904
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:25,590
You are the oldest.

1905
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:27,320
Seok Sam, this is ridiculous.

1906
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,200
It's okay. All right. Good luck!

1907
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,490
- Seok Sam.
- For goodness' sake.

1908
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,200
Jae Suk, you are the only one left.

1909
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,490
Then I...

1910
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,390
I don't know much about capitals,
big brother.

1911
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,390
(I don't know much about capitals,
big brother.)

1912
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:39,610
(Oh, no.)

1913
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,510
Jong Kook is out.

1914
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:44,930
- Why?
- "Big brother."

1915
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,240
(A strong candidate
eliminated himself.)

1916
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,510
"Big brother."

1917
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:48,610
Why did you do that?

1918
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:49,970
Did Jong Kook speak formally?

1919
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:52,410
The only knowledgeable member
should have known better.

1920
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,590
- Jong Kook is so nice.
- Seriously.

1921
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,680
Sit down.
It's your fault, you punk. Sit down.

1922
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,990
This is exactly
why I am keeping quiet.

1923
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:00,680
Jong Kook is eliminated.

1924
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:03,490
Let's end this team
so that we can place second.

1925
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:04,530
- Okay.
- End this team.

1926
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,070
All right. That's a good move.

1927
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:08,090
- Here comes the question.
- Go ahead.

1928
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,260
- I think this is a good one.
- We need to place second.

1929
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,200
- What's the capital of Argentina?
- This is...

1930
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,760
- I know this one!
- The level of difficulty is right.

1931
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,910
- You know the answer, right?
- Yes.

1932
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:16,910
I know the answer too.

1933
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:20,180
It can be confusing
since there are many syllables.

1934
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,620
(Unsure)

1935
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,450
- Argentina?
- Messi.

1936
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,410
You know, he is smart.

1937
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,510
Why did you have to ask a question
about the capitals?

1938
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,180
I don't know much
about the capitals.

1939
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,760
Gosh, I...

1940
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,660
(Laughing)

1941
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,950
Se Chan drives me crazy.
Is that really your answer?

1942
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,620
Doesn't it seem like an answer?

1943
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,890
A little bit. I...

1944
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:44,030
I have no idea.

1945
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,030
Se Chan.

1946
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,070
All right.

1947
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,610
- All right.
- 1, 2, 3.

1948
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,300
- For goodness' sake! Maradona?
- Luxembourg?

1949
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,800
This is insane.

1950
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,860
- For goodness' sake! Maradona?
- Luxembourg?

1951
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,320
Madrid?

1952
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,240
- Luxembourg?
- This is insane.

1953
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,800
- Luxembourg is a country.
- I mean...

1954
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,470
- Luxembourg is a country.
- A, A

1955
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:30,710
- Argentina
- Argentina

1956
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:33,300
- Lu, Lu, Luxembourg
- Lu, Lu, Luxembourg

1957
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,170
- A, A... That's how the song goes!
- You know,

1958
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,780
she hugged the sketchbook
as if she had the correct answer.

1959
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,720
(She was serious about
keeping her answer secure.)

1960
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,920
I don't know the answer.

1961
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,010
Jae Suk, reveal the answer.

1962
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:44,090
(Jae Suk's answer)

1963
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,110
- Buenos Aires.
- That's right!

1964
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,780
(Buenos Aires)

1965
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,260
(Empty Heads act like
they knew the answer.)

1966
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,530
All right.

1967
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,460
All three members are out.

1968
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,650
I didn't know
all of them would get eliminated.

1969
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:57,260
All of us got eliminated.

1970
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,090
Now, one of you will give a question
and attack.

1971
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,240
Why...

1972
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,510
Mustache.

1973
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,440
Give them a nonsense quiz.

1974
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,630
(Give them a nonsense quiz.)

1975
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:08,630
They have no sense,
so give them a nonsense quiz.

1976
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:09,800
- Hey!
- Ji Hyo will give a question.

1977
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,070
"They have no sense,
so give them a nonsense quiz?"

1978
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:13,110
They have no senses.

1979
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,820
Give them a nonsense quiz, Mustache.

1980
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,440
Ji Hyo will give a question.

1981
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,090
Ji Hyo will give a question.

1982
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,190
Will Ji Hyo give a question?

1983
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,320
Go ahead.

1984
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,920
(Hesitant)

1985
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,030
- I...
- You can be mean. Hurry up.

1986
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,460
- Hey.
- There you go.

1987
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:28,900
- Go ahead.
- Change your tone.

1988
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:32,530
Who directed "New World,"
the movie I appeared in?

1989
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:34,940
Gosh, he might know the answer.

1990
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,240
- I love this director.
- He might know the answer.

1991
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,280
(Unsure)

1992
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,530
- I love this director.
- He might know the answer.

1993
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,070
- This question...
- The director of "New World."

1994
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:45,340
- Do you know?
- He is a well-known director.

1995
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:48,470
- It isn't Park Chan Wook.
- No.

1996
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:49,840
No.

1997
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,110
- P.
- What?

1998
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:52,550
- P?
- P.

1999
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,150
She gave him a big hint.

2000
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:55,920
That means his last name is Park.

2001
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:57,720
It's right.

2002
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,820
Park Hang Seo.

2003
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,260
So Min heard that his initial is P
and went,

2004
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,300
"Park Hang Seo."

2005
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,490
You are so sharp.

2006
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,400
- Park Hang Seo.
- You are so sharp.

2007
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:08,630
That's just...

2008
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:10,240
So Min, you are sharp.

2009
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,940
- Park Hang Seo.
- It's a good answer.

2010
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,050
- I don't know. I have no clue.
- My goodness.

2011
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,400
- Jae Suk.
- Come on.

2012
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,610
Park Soo Chan.

2013
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,050
Reveal the answer.

2014
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,940
- The answer is Park Hoon Jung.
- Park Hoon Jung.

2015
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,780
I had no clue.

2016
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,260
Director Park, I am sorry.

2017
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,590
The two of you placed first.

2018
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,420
(Haha and Ji Hyo placed 1st.)

2019
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,820
I eliminated myself...

2020
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,300
- and saved you guys.
- Jong Kook, it's all thanks to you.

2021
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,760
- I know that.
- I save you guys.

2022
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,220
I know that. You are good.

2023
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,920
- Give me a bonus.
- All right, all right.

2024
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,800
Since the two of you placed 1st,
you get 1,000 dollars each.

2025
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,840
- Jae Suk, you get 800 dollars.
- 800 dollars?

2026
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,400
Since So Min, Se Chan, and Wooyoung
placed fourth,

2027
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,860
they get 700 dollars each.

2028
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:46,900
That isn't much.

2029
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,940
The 5th place, Jessi and Kwang Soo
get 200 dollars each.

2030
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,240
(Jessi and Kwang Soo
get 200 dollars each.)

2031
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,470
Let's move on to the last schedule.

2032
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:53,880
Okay. I will do better this time.

2033
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:57,240
- Look at this.
- What is this?

2034
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,990
I think we will do something
embarrassing.

2035
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:01,610
The smell makes me want
to wash my hair.

2036
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,760
What is this?

2037
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,460
I think the floor is slippery.

2038
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,090
This is no joke.

2039
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:08,360
This time,

2040
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,400
CEO Lee needs to work hard.

2041
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,690
(He suddenly has a mole
on his face.)

2042
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,030
I need to put a mole on you.

2043
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:16,670
(CEO Lee lost in a bet
and got a giant mole from Se Chan.)

2044
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:17,740
Everyone,

2045
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,280
the last schedule requires...

2046
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,470
both physical
and variety show skills.

2047
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:24,280
- It's the Running Arcade.
- Arcade.

2048
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,110
- So Min, our lives depend on this.
- Yes.

2049
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,570
Here is the game you will play.

2050
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,740
Two members will face each other.

2051
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:33,260
Let's say the production crew says,
"Spin once. 1, 2, 3."

2052
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,380
Then both members need
to spin once at the same time.

2053
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:38,260
But there will be a word
on your back.

2054
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,920
Look at the other member's word
and answer correctly to win.

2055
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:43,820
- We just need to read it?
- Yes.

2056
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:47,240
The words on the backs must be hard.

2057
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,800
- That's right.
- Hard words.

2058
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,170
How hard?

2059
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,070
Jessi, you will get the word
you know.

2060
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:53,210
Really?

2061
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:55,940
The winner will receive
500 dollars...

2062
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:59,070
and the loser will receive
100 dollars.

2063
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:00,510
This isn't a team competition.

2064
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,050
No, it isn't.

2065
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,690
You see the spoons
on the floor, right?

2066
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:04,820
Draw one each.

2067
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,650
1 and 2 will go against each other.
3 and 4 will go against each other.

2068
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:08,880
(Everyone draws a spoon.)

2069
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,820
- Let's draw a spoon each.
- Let's draw a spoon each.

2070
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,720
- I am number 1.
- I am number 3.

2071
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:14,460
- Come on!
- Me?

2072
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:15,990
Gosh, I will go against CEO Lee.

2073
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,030
Why do I need
to go against Jong Kook?

2074
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:20,800
Numbers 1 and 2, please come on out.

2075
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:23,130
This isn't easy. Wooyoung.

2076
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,440
Hey, Wooyoung. This is hard.

2077
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,130
- Is it very slippery?
- Is it hard?

2078
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,340
It's very slippery.

2079
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,400
Hey, hey. This is no joke.
Come here. It's even worse here.

2080
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:34,280
(Slippery)

2081
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,380
This is...

2082
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,990
- Oh, my goodness.
- How will you spin?

2083
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,320
You have to spin like this.

2084
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,380
(Simply balancing oneself is
a struggle.)

2085
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:42,320
Hey, I can't spin.

2086
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,380
This is hard.

2087
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,590
You need to spin fast
to see the other person's word...

2088
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,050
- and have a chance to answer.
- We spin twice, right?

2089
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,800
I will tell you how many times
and count to three.

2090
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:53,990
Why are the words so hard?

2091
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:55,530
(Creme brulee, Eucalyptus)

2092
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,630
- Jong Kook.
- Okay.

2093
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,240
Okay. Let's begin.

2094
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:00,670
Oh, my goodness.

2095
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,280
Spin twice. 1, 2, 3.

2096
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,550
Spin twice. 1, 2, 3.

2097
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,280
(Both of them flinch.)

2098
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,840
- This won't do.
- You...

2099
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,590
He saw it.

2100
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,920
- He saw it.
- The word was visible.

2101
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,820
It's hard to figure out the word
even when you see it.

2102
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:23,070
Show us the triple axel, Jong Kook.

2103
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:25,630
Let's go. 1, 2. Go!

2104
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,880
(His attempt to appear cool
results in slapstick comedy.)

2105
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,210
(Flustered)

2106
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:39,470
(What? I think I see the word.)

2107
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:41,470
(His face is red
from embarrassment.)

2108
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,440
(It has been a while
since he showed slapstick comedy.)

2109
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:45,840
This is it!

2110
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,610
Keep going.

2111
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:48,780
My goodness.

2112
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,930
- That's good.
- Look at the word.

2113
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,280
Wooyoung, look at the word
when he falls down.

2114
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,060
- This is fun.
- You can't stay on the floor.

2115
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,300
This is fun.

2116
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:57,470
One spin remains.

2117
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,770
(Wooyoung's last spin)

2118
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,310
- He did a good job.
- He spun twice.

2119
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:07,310
He spun very fast earlier.

2120
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,880
- Spin the other way.
- The other way.

2121
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,480
(He takes a deep breath
and prepares for the triple axel.)

2122
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,480
(The war of nerves begins.)

2123
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,810
(Gosh!)

2124
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:19,680
Look at the word. Look at the word.

2125
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,480
We should protect
Jong Kook's dignity.

2126
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,760
Jong Kook.

2127
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,650
It's so funny to see you fall.

2128
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:28,990
It's the first time
I had so much confidence...

2129
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,670
during a match against Jong Kook.

2130
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,030
Let me answer.

2131
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:34,340
(Does he know the answer?)

2132
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,510
(Wooyoung will go first!)

2133
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,030
Creme broller.

2134
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,570
(Incorrect)

2135
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:43,480
(He was close!)

2136
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,270
- It's so hard.
- What is...

2137
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,520
All right.

2138
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,720
Let me answer.

2139
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,270
(Jong Kook shouted out,
"Let me answer!")

2140
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:50,480
Eucalyp...

2141
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,780
(Eucalyp...)

2142
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:52,890
Eucalyp...

2143
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:55,180
(Will he get the correct answer,
"Eucalyptus?")

2144
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,960
Eucalyps.

2145
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:58,230
No, no.

2146
01:09:58,230 --> 01:09:59,520
("Eucalyps" is incorrect)

2147
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,230
(Gosh, he was close.)

2148
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,020
Both of them were so close.

2149
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,800
I think it's the word I know.

2150
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,600
- I am certain you have heard of it.
- I am certain of it.

2151
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,640
After you do three spins,

2152
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:10,560
you will get one more chance
to answer.

2153
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,030
Then the person who got
more syllables right will win.

2154
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:15,230
- Syllables?
- Both of you are nearly there.

2155
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:17,310
1, 2, 3.

2156
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:18,400
Let's go.

2157
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:20,440
Did they mix it up?

2158
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,570
(Wooyoung begins to turn
on the spot.)

2159
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,850
One spin.

2160
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:24,980
Hold on.

2161
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,150
Wooyoung doesn't fall down.

2162
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:28,590
Hold on.

2163
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:32,990
It's because he dances.

2164
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:35,060
It will be game over
if one of them falls down.

2165
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,520
(Screaming)

2166
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:39,170
(His sense of balance failed
as soon as Jae Suk was done.)

2167
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,490
- Two.
- Fall on your back.

2168
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:42,640
- Two.
- Fall on your back.

2169
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,210
- He saw the word.
- That's good.

2170
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,380
What will it be?

2171
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,570
(He throws his body
and lands on his butt.)

2172
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:51,810
I will give him 10 points.

2173
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:53,310
- He didn't see it.
- 10 points for slapstick comedy.

2174
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,980
- Since Kim Yoo Na...
- 10 points for slapstick comedy.

2175
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,310
- It's fun to see Jong Kook fall.
- It's fun.

2176
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:59,440
- Seriously.
- He is cute.

2177
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,980
- It's so rare.
- It's so rare to see him fall.

2178
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,730
He is cute.

2179
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:05,780
Now, you will get a chance
to guess the answer.

2180
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:07,960
- Wooyoung, go first.
- Let me answer.

2181
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:10,270
Creme brolee.

2182
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,320
("Creme brulee" is correct.)

2183
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:13,990
You will recognize the word
once you hear it.

2184
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,100
(Eucalyptus)

2185
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,430
Eupocalyse.

2186
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:17,930
(Eupocalyse)

2187
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:19,030
Wooyoung won.

2188
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:20,980
It was "Eucalyptus."

2189
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,310
- It was "Eucalyptus."
- Eucalyptus.

2190
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:23,980
Eucalyptus.

2191
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,480
The plant koalas eat.

2192
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,980
You were off
by one syllable earlier.

2193
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,740
Numbers 3 and 4.

2194
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:30,740
It's Suk Jin versus Ji Hyo.

2195
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:31,780
(Suk Jin versus Ji Hyo)

2196
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,020
It's a big match.

2197
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:34,650
Here comes Suk Jin

2198
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:36,180
Yes, yes, yes

2199
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,180
(Slippery)

2200
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:38,460
This is no joke.

2201
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,760
Here comes Suk Jin

2202
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,100
Move out of the way

2203
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,670
(Since his company went bankrupt,
victory is his only chance.)

2204
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:45,100
These words are easy.

2205
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:47,190
Gosh, these words...

2206
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,730
- These words are easy, right?
- Yes.

2207
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,900
All right.

2208
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,430
- Make 1 spin. 1, 2, 3.
- I can't see the word.

2209
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:53,430
What is it?

2210
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,530
What is it?

2211
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:57,900
Suk Jin has a beautiful form.

2212
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,070
Okay, okay.

2213
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,480
He has a beautiful form.

2214
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,020
He has nice knees.

2215
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,640
Suk Jin has a nice body.

2216
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,850
Seriously.

2217
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:07,060
- I...
- Let me answer.

2218
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,090
- What?
- Asian black bear.

2219
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,480
("Asian black bear" is correct.)

2220
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,560
What?

2221
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:12,850
Did she see it?

2222
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,350
(He leaned forward
to pull his pants down.)

2223
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:15,890
(Staring)

2224
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:17,490
- Let me answer.
- What?

2225
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:19,770
(She just read the word she saw.)

2226
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,360
(Thanks to his foolishness,
she had an easy win.)

2227
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:25,340
(What? Did she see it?)

2228
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,570
What?

2229
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:28,180
- What did Suk Jin do?
- What was that?

2230
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:30,140
She saw the word
when you pulled down your pants.

2231
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,240
What happened?

2232
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,480
He showed her the word...

2233
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,640
while he was pulling down his pants.

2234
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,180
- That was no fun.
- Why...

2235
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,940
You ruined this fun game.

2236
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:38,980
I shouldn't have signed a contract
with him!

2237
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,260
- What was that?
- When he pulled down his pants...

2238
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,680
Ji Hyo, you are the best.

2239
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,760
Did you see it
when I pulled down my pants?

2240
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,430
- Why did you make it boring?
- Suk Jin, that was just wrong.

2241
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,600
I can't believe it.

2242
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,630
Good luck.

2243
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,890
Next up
are Se Chan and Kwang Soo.

2244
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:52,270
Okay.

2245
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:53,730
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

2246
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,010
(Galapagos Islands,
an archipelago in the Pacific)

2247
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:59,560
(Einspanner, espresso with water
and whipped cream on top)

2248
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,880
These words are hard.

2249
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:02,810
Kwang Soo wouldn't know the word.

2250
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:04,640
They wouldn't know
even when they see the words.

2251
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,740
(These words aren't
in their vocabulary.)

2252
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:06,770
Two spins.

2253
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:08,140
Kwang Soo wouldn't know the word.

2254
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,520
- Come on.
- He would know.

2255
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,390
Come on.

2256
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:14,760
(Triple axel)

2257
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,850
(He decided to spin in the air.)

2258
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,020
He spun.

2259
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:19,650
He spun. Come on.

2260
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:20,690
(Panting after one spin)

2261
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,060
He was in the air.

2262
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,020
It could be confusing for Kwang Soo.

2263
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:26,890
(They spin at the same time.)

2264
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:28,270
Se Chan, you have
one more turn to go.

2265
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,600
- This is...
- I will see it no matter what.

2266
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,930
- I will see it no matter what.
- But you don't know this word.

2267
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:34,510
Wouldn't Kwang Soo know?

2268
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:39,070
I know.
I will see it no matter what.

2269
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:40,420
(The smell of money...)

2270
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,810
He is using money.

2271
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,240
(makes him bow.)

2272
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,390
Okay, okay.

2273
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:45,440
(He shows slapstick comedy
to thank him.)

2274
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,760
All right. Here you go.

2275
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,060
(A dollar is enough...)

2276
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,300
(to have him on the floor
like a dog waiting for a snack.)

2277
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,520
Okay.

2278
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:57,630
- Throw it behind him.
- This is funny.

2279
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:58,890
Spin, Se Chan.

2280
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:00,170
Spin.

2281
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:01,770
(He completes a spin
after blinding Kwang Soo.)

2282
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:04,230
(It's the perfect strategy
for the man who loves money.)

2283
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:05,810
Why are they so funny?

2284
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:08,340
Three spins. 1, 2, 3.

2285
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,900
Spin first.

2286
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,570
They can't guess the words.

2287
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,770
Did you spin once?

2288
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,740
He saw the word.

2289
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,740
(After the mosquito jump,
Superstar Yang spins.)

2290
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,780
He saw the word.

2291
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,280
(He showed his back for a second.)

2292
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,320
Hold on.

2293
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,180
You were right in front of me!
You saw the word!

2294
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,930
- Step back.
- He doesn't know what he saw.

2295
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,520
Kwang Soo doesn't know what he saw.

2296
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,800
- He doesn't know what he saw.
- He doesn't know what he saw.

2297
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,860
What was that?

2298
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,470
- Seriously.
- You saw the word clearly.

2299
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:34,530
You saw the word clearly.

2300
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:36,530
- Don't you know?
- You saw the word clearly.

2301
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:38,710
- You saw the word clearly.
- Don't you know it?

2302
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:41,210
Did I see "Garlic?"

2303
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,550
Garlic...

2304
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:44,600
Let me answer.

2305
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:46,240
Galas papa.

2306
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,420
- No, no.
- You are close.

2307
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,520
(He is close to the correct answer.)

2308
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,940
- Do I have one spin left?
- Yes.

2309
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,480
I will end it this time.

2310
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,850
(It's Se Chan's turn to spin.)

2311
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:57,350
Just spin.

2312
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:58,350
I will give you 10 dollars.

2313
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,130
- 10 dollars is a lot.
- 10 dollars.

2314
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,800
- 10 dollars.
- 10 dollars is a lot.

2315
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,890
Close your eyes.

2316
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:04,600
- What?
- Close your eyes when I spin.

2317
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,640
The two of them
are making the game dirty.

2318
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,970
I will close 1 eye for 10 dollars...

2319
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:13,030
and 2 eyes for 20 dollars.

2320
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:17,900
Okay. I will put the money
on the floor.

2321
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,070
Okay. I will put the money
on the floor.

2322
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,180
(He pretends to throw the money...)

2323
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,810
(and spins quickly
while Kwang Soo looks down.)

2324
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:26,050
He didn't see it.

2325
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:27,650
- He spun so fast.
- He is so good at spinning.

2326
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:29,480
- He is so fast.
- I will guess the word now.

2327
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,850
- I completed the spins.
- Let me answer.

2328
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:31,980
Galas pepper.

2329
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:34,990
Einspepper? Eins...

2330
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,060
What comes after "Galas?"

2331
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,270
You are nearly there.

2332
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,770
Let me answer. Galas pass.

2333
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:39,770
(They can't get closer
to the answer.)

2334
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,690
- Einsupepper.
- No.

2335
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:42,930
Einsperm.

2336
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,140
Galaspar.

2337
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,570
This is driving me crazy.

2338
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:49,210
If you just look at the word
and shout it out,

2339
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:50,810
I will count it as a correct answer.

2340
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,140
Just go for the word.

2341
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:54,070
Gosh, I don't want to make this game
so dirty.

2342
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:55,920
CEO Lee, you and I go way back.

2343
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:58,180
This is a bit too much.

2344
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,520
CEO Lee, come on.

2345
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,460
The thing is, I don't have
much money.

2346
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,630
CEO Lee.

2347
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:04,850
Se Chan, use your muscles.

2348
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,850
(Slapping)

2349
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,730
(Superstar Yang attacks first.)

2350
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,100
What is going on?

2351
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:12,630
You can't rip it off.

2352
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:13,730
- There you go.
- That's good.

2353
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,390
You can't rip it off.

2354
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:18,140
He is trying to put it in his eyes.

2355
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,430
He plays dirty.

2356
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,400
Se Chan is winning.

2357
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,210
Se Chan is winning.

2358
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,070
This is like the UFC.

2359
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:26,400
Come on.

2360
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,070
(What?)

2361
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,610
(Se Chan overthrows a man
who is nearly 2m tall.)

2362
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:35,610
(The 2m beanpole falls
like a drunk man.)

2363
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,260
(The UFC enthusiast is excited.)

2364
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:40,820
On the slippery floor,
he is nothing.

2365
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,060
That's some technique.

2366
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,100
That's so funny.

2367
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,060
- It's a nice technique.
- That's some technique.

2368
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,060
This is the best.

2369
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:50,730
- The back...
- The floor is slippery.

2370
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,710
I knew this round would get dirty.

2371
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:56,810
(Beanpole uses his specialty.)

2372
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:59,050
Kwang Soo won't go easy on you.
You know how he is.

2373
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,520
Go between his legs.

2374
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,550
(He fights with seriousness.)

2375
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,940
This is so funny.

2376
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:04,220
Se Chan!

2377
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,550
(It's a dogfight.)

2378
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,280
Look at his facial expression.

2379
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:09,590
His expression changed.

2380
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,780
Come on.

2381
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:14,100
- Hey.
- He went insane.

2382
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,600
Kwang Soo went insane.

2383
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,170
- Kwang Soo went insane.
- Kwang Soo went insane.

2384
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:18,270
(Se Chan flips the crazy man.)

2385
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,670
Kwang Soo went insane.

2386
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,100
It's like an amusement park.

2387
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,010
I knew this would happen.

2388
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:26,100
He is looking at the word.

2389
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,980
- Kwang soo pulled it towards him.
- He is looking at it.

2390
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:29,570
Se Chan's arms are shorter.

2391
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:31,400
(He finally grabs it.)

2392
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:32,570
Let me answer.

2393
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,740
Galapagos Islands.

2394
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,810
Correct.

2395
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,680
(CEO Lee won.)

2396
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,180
Einspanner?

2397
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,640
- Correct.
- What is that?

2398
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,760
Coffee.

2399
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,960
It's a type of coffee.

2400
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,890
- It was so hard.
- I know.

2401
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,930
"Galapagos Islands" is a bit better.

2402
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:46,960
What is that?

2403
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,800
An archipelago. Galapagos Islands.

2404
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,970
An archipelago?

2405
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:52,930
Are you pretending to know it now?

2406
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:54,190
I had no idea.

2407
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:55,190
Kwang Soo won.

2408
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:56,270
Yes!

2409
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,060
- Okay.
- It was a great match.

2410
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:00,530
Now, everything is over.

2411
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:03,600
After I pay up,
we will calculate the total.

2412
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,770
For goodness' sake.

2413
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,920
The CEOs will fight
against other CEOs,

2414
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:10,090
and the celebrities will
fight against other celebrities.

2415
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:11,780
(Among the 7 celebrities,
the top 4 will get the prize...)

2416
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,050
(and the bottom 3
will get the penalty.)

2417
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,060
Okay, everyone.

2418
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,020
I will announce the rankings
of the three CEOs.

2419
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:19,320
Only the last place gets
the penalty, right?

2420
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,520
Yes. Only the last place gets
the penalty.

2421
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,060
Had I remained a CEO,
I would have avoided the penalty.

2422
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:26,890
With 1,961 dollars,
CEO Jeon So Min takes 1st place.

2423
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:28,430
(CEO Jeon takes 1st place.)

2424
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:29,860
1,961 dollars?

2425
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:30,900
CEO Jeon!

2426
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,310
(She placed 1st
thanks to Superstar Jang.)

2427
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:34,600
People who didn't recruit
many celebrities are the winners.

2428
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,240
I should have only recruited
the indispensable ones.

2429
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,570
(Recruiting 1 witty celebrity was
the best tactic.)

2430
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:40,810
In second place is...

2431
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:44,050
(CEO Lee's J Entertainment has
Jae Suk, Suk Jin, and Jessi.)

2432
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,890
(CEO Ha's DK Entertainment has
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

2433
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:47,960
In second place is...

2434
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,430
CEO Lee Kwang Soo with 986 dollars.

2435
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:51,430
Okay!

2436
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:53,130
My goodness.

2437
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:54,560
- Thank you.
- See?

2438
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,130
You should be grateful to us.

2439
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,970
You are right.

2440
01:18:57,970 --> 01:19:00,930
CEO Haha with 620 dollars
will receive the penalty.

2441
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,170
So Min and Kwang Soo
will receive the prize.

2442
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,060
The prize.

2443
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,840
Now, the six superstars
and Suk Jin.

2444
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,730
"And Suk Jin."

2445
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:10,940
- What?
- "And Suk Jin."

2446
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:12,810
The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places
will receive the prize,

2447
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:14,270
and the 5th, 6th, and 7th places
will receive the penalty.

2448
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:15,570
The 5th, 6th, and 7th places.

2449
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:18,090
With 2,355 dollars,
Song Ji Hyo takes 1st place.

2450
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,240
Really?

2451
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,520
She is unrivaled.

2452
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:22,350
She has so much money.

2453
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:25,480
With 1,485 dollars,
Kim Jong Kook takes 2nd place.

2454
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,520
Me?

2455
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:29,260
- It must be the signing bonus.
- The signing bonus.

2456
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,320
I signed a contract
with the right company.

2457
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,520
In third place is...

2458
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:34,670
Yoo Jae Suk with 1,405 dollars.

2459
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:36,530
Congratulations.

2460
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:41,310
Among the remaining 4,
only 1 will avoid the penalty.

2461
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,530
- Who are the four?
- Me and...

2462
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:44,600
Wooyoung, Jessi, Suk Jin,
and Se Chan.

2463
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,350
Will I be exempt?

2464
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:48,480
Only one will avoid the penalty.

2465
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,520
Only one.

2466
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,740
I will announce the fourth place
who will avoid the penalty.

2467
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,050
(This person persevered
in the cutthroat show business.)

2468
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:54,350
Congratulations.

2469
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:58,320
(Which celebrity placed 4th?)

2470
01:19:58,890 --> 01:19:59,960
Yang Se Chan.

2471
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,560
Why?

2472
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,630
Lucky!

2473
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:04,990
I am proud of him.

2474
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,300
- What did he do?
- With 1,280 dollars,

2475
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,270
- Yang Se Chan placed fourth.
- Okay.

2476
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,390
Come on.

2477
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:10,770
I won't receive the penalty.

2478
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:14,270
Except for the four people
who will receive the penalty,

2479
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:17,310
everyone will be given
the hallabong set from Jeju Island.

2480
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,400
Really?

2481
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:20,570
Hallabong is nice.

2482
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,440
I will announce
what the penalty will be.

2483
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,550
(The 4 members' penalty
gets revealed.)

2484
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:25,590
The penalty is...

2485
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:28,590
(The 4 members' penalty
gets revealed.)

2486
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:32,520
The penalty is making
100 autographs for the fans.

2487
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:35,350
My autograph is really easy. Watch.

2488
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:37,520
- Here.
- This is mine.

2489
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:39,170
I made it that way.

2490
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,340
How is that "Ha?"

2491
01:20:42,490 --> 01:20:43,560
Haha.

2492
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,810
(It's not Dream's doodle,
but Superstar Ha's autograph.)

2493
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:47,400
It's not easy to make
100 autographs.

2494
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,270
Your wrist begins to hurt.

2495
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,940
I made 100 autographs already.

2496
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,140
This is the last one.

2497
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,210
- All done.
- Yes.

2498
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:54,720
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2499
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,570
Thank you.

2500
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:58,940
(We thank Jessi and Wooyoung
for joining us.)

2501
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:01,890
(It's another day at work...)

2502
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:05,480
(or not!)

2503
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,060
Se Chan!

2504
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:10,020
(Please show us your gums!)

2505
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,470
(I haven't brushed my teeth yet.)

2506
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:12,800
What is this? Did the shoot begin?

2507
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,360
(They turn into
idol singers overnight!)

2508
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,670
You are so pretty!

2509
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:22,070
(But their fame doesn't last long.)

2510
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,640
(The popular idol group appears!)

2511
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:31,780
(They topped the military charts...)

2512
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:34,060
(as well as regular music charts.)

2513
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:37,130
(Brave Girls came back
as the top idol group.)

2514
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,600
(They star on Running Man
as they wanted.)

2515
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,060
(The members show...)

2516
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:47,360
(how things are done
on Running Man.)

2517
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:49,230
(Best reactions!)

2518
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,670
(We want to do everything we want.)

2519
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,310
(So we prepared this.)

2520
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:54,840
(The tenacious idol artists...)

2521
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,140
(getting used to a variety show)

2522
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,210
(How will the day end?)

2523
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:00,240
(Idol Star Project,
A day of Brave Idol Artists)
