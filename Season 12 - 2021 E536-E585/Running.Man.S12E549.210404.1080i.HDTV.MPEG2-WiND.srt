1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,520
(Spring has come...)

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,790
(without telling us
where it came from.)

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,990
It's coming.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,100
There it is.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,130
It's here.

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,390
(What?)

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,870
The cameras are here.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,740
(People with dark clothes
and dark faces)

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,470
(Who are they?)

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,100
(It's a must for idol stars,
the photoshoot on the way to work.)

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,150
(Fans gather together...)

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,120
(to appreciate the charm
of their favorite stars.)

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,240
(But the photoshoot
for the members of Running Man...)

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,190
(only has the production
crew members.)

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,190
(And that's not all it is.)

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,690
(Dear stylists, this is
the production crew of Running Man.)

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,390
(We're going to have a photoshoot
on the way to work.)

18
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,400
(So we'd like you to film
your artists in their cars.)

19
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,000
(Okay. We will!)

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,500
(Got it.)

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,330
(It's the Running Man
photoshoot on the way to work.)

22
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,640
(How will the members look
on their way to work?)

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,070
It's coming.

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,440
It's here.

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,470
- It's coming.
- So Min!

26
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,180
- So Min.
- She's here.

27
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,370
Look over here.

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,770
(The first celebrity to arrive
is Jeon So Min.)

29
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,120
- So Min.
- We love you.

30
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,580
So Min!

31
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,090
- Show us your face!
- So Min.

32
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,590
What is going on? What's that?

33
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,090
I don't have a microphone.

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,590
Show us your face.

35
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,650
- So Min!
- What are they doing?

36
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,300
(Fake cheers)

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
- Jeon So Min!
- So Min, I love you.

38
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,670
What are you guys doing?

39
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,060
You're so pretty.

40
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,400
- You're beautiful.
- So Min!

41
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,310
(So Min starts to respond
to the cheers.)

42
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,110
- Look at us.
- So Min!

43
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,140
What are you doing?

44
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,250
- You're so pretty.
- Please strike a pose for us.

45
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,590
(The top actress gets
off her car.)

46
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,110
(They pretend to cheer for her.)

47
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,150
You're beautiful.

48
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,780
You look stunning.

49
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,030
You look amazing.

50
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,450
- You're so pretty.
- I love you.

51
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,760
(As she strikes some tacky poses,)

52
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,360
(the fans don't know how to react.)

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,310
Thank you for waiting for me here
when it's so cold.

54
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,030
Can you hear me?

55
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,170
Hello, everyone.
What are you guys doing here?

56
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,870
What's happening?
What am I supposed to do?

57
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,050
Why are you doing this?

58
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,710
What are we doing? My way to work?

59
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,950
Why are you filming my way to work?

60
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,850
(Song Ji Hyo is coming!)

61
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,320
- Song Ji Hyo is coming.
- No.

62
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,130
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?

63
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,660
What is going on?

64
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,260
(Running toward Ji Hyo)

65
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,450
Guys.

66
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,990
(As they feel uncomfortable around
So Min, Ji Hyo's car pulls over.)

67
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,570
Guys. Why are you filming this?

68
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,760
What's that?

69
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,110
There's Song Ji Hyo!

70
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,980
(Dazed)

71
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,770
- It's Song Ji Hyo.
- Song Ji Hyo is here.

72
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,300
Isn't that So Min over there?

73
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,950
Show us your face.

74
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,790
- Ji Hyo.
- What is going on?

75
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,010
- Hello.
- Ji Hyo.

76
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,050
Ji Hyo!

77
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,260
- Please get off here.
- Ji Hyo.

78
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,890
Ji Hyo, show us your face.

79
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,950
What are you doing now?

80
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,800
- We're filming your way to work.
- Let us see your face.

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,390
You're so pretty.

82
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,600
Please strike a pose for us, Ji Hyo.

83
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,490
Pose for us.

84
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,570
(Here you go.)

85
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,140
You have such a pretty face.

86
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,640
What is going on?

87
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,980
We have a lot of fans here.

88
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,430
Are they fans?

89
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,240
There's Sung Oh.
They all are our crew members.

90
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,880
Make a heart for us. Please, for us.

91
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,290
(All right.)

92
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,420
What is this?

93
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,860
Are you filming our way to work?

94
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,080
(The photoshoot of So Min
and Ji Hyo's way to work is done.)

95
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,130
- It's coming.
- My gosh.

96
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,020
It's Kim Jong Kook.

97
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,660
He's Kim Grand Award.

98
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,230
Please get out of the car.

99
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,230
(The third one to arrive
is Kim Jong Kook.)

100
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,640
What's going on?

101
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,330
Kim Jong Kook!

102
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,460
Please show us your face.

103
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,040
Did you guys bet money
on me or something?

104
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,380
Jong Kook, show us your ab muscles.

105
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,010
What are you talking about?

106
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,270
- Show us.
- Please, Jong Kook.

107
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,270
- What are you doing?
- You're so handsome.

108
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,920
Please pose for us.

109
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,290
- Do you want me to do a pose?
- Yes.

110
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,480
(He is obedient to his fans.)

111
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,390
What are we doing?

112
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,260
- Make a heart for us.
- What?

113
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,490
Make a heart.

114
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,700
A heart?

115
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,300
(A heart?)

116
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,570
You're scary.

117
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,760
(He's saying harsh words
behind the mask.)

118
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,040
That's enough. All right.

119
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,540
This is so awkward.

120
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,640
Okay. That's enough.

121
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,570
(Next up is Se Chan.)

122
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,570
Are they fans?

123
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,570
What?

124
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,520
He's getting off.

125
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,090
Yang Se Chan!

126
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,290
Show us your face.

127
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,110
Se Chan, you're so handsome.

128
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,960
Look at your gums.

129
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,030
Show us your gums.

130
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,380
(All the cheering makes
Star Yang freeze.)

131
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,320
- Show us your smile.
- Let us see your gums.

132
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,770
- We want to see your gums.
- Show us your gums.

133
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,360
I didn't brush my teeth yet.
All right.

134
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,060
- You look so cool.
- Strike a pose for us.

135
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,280
Am I doing this right?

136
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,730
You're so handsome.

137
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,780
Please talk to us in English.

138
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,170
- Pardon?
- Speak in English.

139
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,670
Hey, don't make fun of me.

140
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,550
Hi. Thank you.

141
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,980
I love you. Gosh, what's going on?

142
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,310
Please show us your handsome face.

143
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,230
Hey, you are...

144
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,480
You punk! Come here.

145
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,490
What is going on?

146
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,230
Show us Empty Head.

147
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,300
- What about Empty Head?
- Empty Head!

148
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,100
(Empty Head has gotten
a lot of fans already.)

149
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,990
(Empty Head)

150
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,230
What's that? Don't make fun of me.

151
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,480
Don't tease me. I should go.

152
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,570
What is going on?

153
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,940
- We love you.
- Thank you.

154
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,480
Thank you.

155
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,050
(He shows off his gums
making a heart with his fingers.)

156
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,980
(The hope of Empty Heads,
Star Yang with pretty gums is here.)

157
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,240
- It's coming.
- It's coming.

158
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,750
(The fifth car is pulling over.)

159
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,530
(Yoo Jae Suk shows up.)

160
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,990
It's Yoo Jae Suk!

161
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,900
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

162
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,030
Show us your face.

163
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,900
Jae Suk, show us
the grasshopper dance.

164
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,060
You're so handsome.

165
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,630
Seon Myung, did you say crazy?

166
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
(Unlike other stars,
he knows himself very well.)

167
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,840
Seon Myung, what was that?

168
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,670
Strike a pose for us.

169
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,040
Will you stay quiet?

170
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,850
- Take off your mask.
- Do you want to be in trouble?

171
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,480
Hey, do you want me
to teach you a lesson?

172
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,650
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

173
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,420
- What are you guys doing?
- Jae Suk.

174
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,250
Bo Pil, what are you doing now?

175
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,750
- What's going on here?
- We love you.

176
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,880
Hey.

177
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,050
- There's Haha.
- Haha!

178
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,420
Hey!

179
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,560
(Yoo Jae Suk is out.)

180
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,600
- Haha!
- Hey. What do you want?

181
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,470
This is mine. Why would I
give this to you?

182
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,210
Why do you want my microphone?

183
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,170
So what is going on?

184
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,150
- Haha.
- You're so cool.

185
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,650
- Haha.
- Pose for the camera.

186
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,240
Strike a pose for us.

187
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,480
I love your pants.

188
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,520
Hang on. I'm not ready yet.
I'm not ready for this.

189
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,590
- What's that?
- It's Kwang Soo!

190
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,750
What are you doing?

191
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,120
- What is going on?
- What's all this?

192
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,790
- It's Lee Kwang Soo.
- He's getting off.

193
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,460
Show us the mosquito dance.

194
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,300
- What?
- The mosquito dance.

195
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,730
Show us the mosquito dance.

196
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,100
- Mosquito dance?
- It's Seon Myung.

197
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,430
- Hey.
- And there's Hyung In.

198
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,230
Please strike a pose
for the cameras.

199
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,780
(These 3 members are known
to be bad at posing.)

200
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,150
(Kwang Soo, try doing ET hands.)

201
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,500
Kwang Soo, try doing ET hands.

202
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,070
(Kwang Soo's specialty,
the trivet hand)

203
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,740
- It looks like an alien.
- You look great.

204
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,050
(The 3 ugly celebrities)

205
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,380
They're filming something.

206
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
(Suk Jin is
the last one to show up.)

207
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
What's going on?

208
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,250
I'm not ready yet.

209
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,750
It's Suk Jin.

210
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
- Suk Jin is here.
- It's Suk Jin.

211
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,060
- Kwang Soo.
- Do you have any raw eggs?

212
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,670
Did we get here on time?

213
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,040
Are we here too early?

214
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
(The stylist is acting.)

215
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,500
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Ji Suk Jin.

216
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,240
- What was that?
- Ji Suk Jin.

217
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,870
- Do you want me to get off?
- Yes.

218
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,210
Ji Suk Jin.

219
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,650
I'm not wearing makeup.

220
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,590
- Look at his white pants!
- You look great.

221
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,920
We love you.

222
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm not ready yet.

223
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,420
You look amazing.

224
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,290
- You're so cool.
- You're the best.

225
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,660
What are we doing?

226
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,300
Strike a pose for us.

227
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,060
A pose? Gosh.

228
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,120
Show us the moonwalk.

229
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,270
- Big Nose.
- You look amazing.

230
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,360
Hey. What are you doing?

231
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,570
- Hey.
- Bye.

232
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,070
- Bye.
- Hey.

233
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,240
What are you doing?

234
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,850
The stocks fell again today.
How are you feeling?

235
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,480
I feel terrible. See you.

236
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,090
Have a nice day. See you.

237
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,380
(The door is open again.)

238
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,290
Hey!

239
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,320
(White Pants gets off again.)

240
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,960
My gosh.

241
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,160
(Mr. White Pants gives up
and comes back right away.)

242
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,170
(The door is open again.)

243
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,370
(Morning rage)

244
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,700
I can't believe this.
Hey, get out of the car.

245
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,410
Get off. I'll drive.

246
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,640
(What?)

247
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,280
Hey!

248
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,880
You little...

249
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,580
(The photoshoot of his way
to work is over like that.)

250
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,050
- He's wearing white pants.
- I can't believe this.

251
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,290
(The photoshoot of the 8 members
is over with Mr. White Pants.)

252
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,290
Done.

253
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,320
It's over.

254
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,390
(Now they change clothes
to shoot the opening.)

255
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,720
- Why are you doing this?
- What?

256
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,000
You have 30 years of experience.
You don't need a funny outfit.

257
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,270
Let's hurry and start the opening.

258
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,830
- The audio is...
- Hello.

259
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

260
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,740
- What's wrong?
- Just stand here.

261
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,010
- Let's begin.
- Hello.

262
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,670
- Start.
- Start.

263
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,440
- Suk Jin.
- Gosh, Suk Jin.

264
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,940
- You look like No-Face.
- What's wrong with him?

265
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,420
I think he put it on
so we can make fun of him.

266
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,580
- Suk Jin.
- Gosh, Suk Jin.

267
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,580
- What?
- You look like No-Face.

268
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,660
What's wrong?

269
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,080
Do you not know
anything about fashion?

270
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,320
It's not like that.

271
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,490
Fashion is all about new challenges.

272
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,760
- Challenge.
- You shouldn't feel ashamed.

273
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,130
- You look like Piccolo.
- Don't laugh at me.

274
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,920
- He's more flushed than ever.
- No, that's not true.

275
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,190
I don't know what to say.

276
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,140
I can't even make fun of you.

277
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,740
Look at the other
stylists over there.

278
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,430
They're shocked.

279
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,240
- Look at Eun Ju and...
- The other stylists...

280
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,750
Even a rookie comedian
wouldn't wear something like that.

281
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,840
You should bring outfits like this.

282
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,470
They look too conservative.

283
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,310
- This is a weekend variety show.
- This is just too much.

284
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,580
It's not too much.

285
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,490
It's true that fashion
is all about new challenges.

286
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,680
Let me hang my jacket
on your shoulder.

287
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,420
My gosh.

288
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,260
(It's the new human hanger
for SS season in 2021.)

289
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,550
- My gosh.
- I mean...

290
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,820
And it's hanging so well.

291
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,370
- It works well.
- It is a good hanger though.

292
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,870
(Piccolo bursts into laughter
looking at his shoulder.)

293
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,090
What is this?

294
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,900
- Gosh.
- Seriously...

295
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,540
- This is...
- It doesn't slip.

296
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,270
It's still there.

297
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,170
- It doesn't slip.
- I'm serious.

298
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,670
Maybe Suk Jin wanted
to wear this himself.

299
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,150
It doesn't look good on him though.

300
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,510
The thing is...

301
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,440
We got this jacket sponsored.

302
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,570
So?

303
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
(He can even use the shoulders
like a chin-up bar.)

304
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,080
- I can hang on his shoulder.
- Are you wearing it right?

305
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,710
- Are you wearing it properly?
- Yes.

306
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,920
Can I do chin-ups
with your shoulders?

307
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,950
Is it supposed
to make you look taller?

308
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,950
The weather is warm now,
so my stylist thought...

309
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,900
today would be my last chance
to try this one.

310
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,130
- You should wear it.
- The jacket looks good.

311
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,590
(While they just nod along
with Suk Jin's excuses...)

312
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,090
(People start to scream.)

313
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,200
Someone's here.

314
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,670
What's wrong with him?

315
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,640
- What's going on?
- Is that your cameraman, Kwang Soo?

316
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,100
- He just left.
- It's Brave Girls!

317
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,010
- What?
- Is Brave Girls here?

318
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,470
(Brave Girls?)

319
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,710
(The reason the cameramen just
left their spot during the opening)

320
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,020
- Hello.
- Please look over here.

321
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,660
Please look at the camera.

322
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,290
("Rollin'" by Brave Girls made
a comeback on the music charts...)

323
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,130
(thanks to the power of soldiers.)

324
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,950
(They became popular with a song
released 4 years ago...)

325
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,900
(thanks to the power of K-Army.)

326
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,960
(Eun Ji, Yoo Na, Yoo Jeong, Min Young)

327
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,740
(Big Eyes Queen, Bobbed-hair Queen,
Squirtle Queen, Vocal Queen)

328
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,960
(They are the real stars
for the heated photoshoot.)

329
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,800
- Brave Girls!
- What's going on?

330
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,670
They're Brave Girls.

331
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,200
Rollin', rollin', rollin'

332
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,280
(They join Running Man
after the photo time.)

333
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,710
(He's serious about "Rollin'.")

334
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,990
This is so nice.

335
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,450
Come on here.

336
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,710
It's Brave Girls who sang "Rollin'."

337
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,760
Hurry and come up on here.

338
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,590
Rollin', rollin', rollin'

339
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,030
(This is the real "Rollin'.")

340
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,720
This is it.

341
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,190
This is really popular.

342
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,400
("Rollin'" by Brave Girls)

343
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,270
- Baby!
- Baby!

344
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,800
(They will never forget today,
the day they met Brave Girls.)

345
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,580
Get ready.

346
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,030
Let's get ready to dance.

347
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,820
Everyday.

348
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,220
- Everyday
- Everyday

349
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,240
Let's go!

350
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,200
Rollin', rollin', rollin'

351
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,470
(They feel great joy
listening to the killer chorus.)

352
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,390
- Hey!
- Hey!

353
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,920
Get ready to dance like this.

354
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,680
- The stingray dance.
- The stingray dance. Let's go.

355
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,660
(Here's the stingray.)

356
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,900
Let's go.

357
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,590
(The seafood guys...)

358
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,130
(and dancing stingrays join them.)

359
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,740
(This is how the military stars have
become the nation's beloved stars.)

360
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,100
(The Vocal Queen's finale)

361
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,100
(They topped music charts
with a song released 4 years ago.)

362
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,070
(They're the popular idol group,
Brave Girls.)

363
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,620
Brave Girls!

364
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,970
All right, everyone.

365
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,990
After four years,

366
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,680
they made a splendid comeback
on music charts.

367
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,080
- Congratulations.
- They never die.

368
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,720
- It calls for celebration.
- Sure.

369
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,220
- It's amazing.
- They're Brave Girls.

370
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,530
- They're Brave Girls.
- 1, 2, and 3.

371
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,690
- Hello, we're Brave Girls.
- Hello, we're Brave Girls.

372
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,960
They must've been through a lot.

373
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,740
Actually, I met them...

374
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,170
on another show.

375
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,540
It's been two weeks.

376
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,960
And they've changed a lot
only in two weeks.

377
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,780
Like how?

378
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,910
- In general...
- Their vibe?

379
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,050
- I can tell their agency...
- The agency's support?

380
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,810
is supporting them a lot.

381
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,920
- Is that true?
- Yes. Sure.

382
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,390
Things have changed a lot
at our agency.

383
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,550
The microphone.

384
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,990
You're not performing
at a military camp.

385
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,020
This isn't a military camp.

386
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,760
You don't need the microphones.

387
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,190
Things have changed a lot
at our agency.

388
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,160
People from our agency are
monitoring us for the first time.

389
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,170
That's right.

390
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,920
- Are they monitoring you?
- Yes.

391
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,740
So...

392
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,770
Other than what Squirtle Queen said,

393
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,040
what else has changed, Min Young?

394
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,430
We don't have to be
on a diet anymore.

395
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,540
The CEO...

396
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,600
Honestly, the CEO is
the one who's fat.

397
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,920
(Honestly, the CEO is
the one who's fat.)

398
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,020
(They feel liberated.)

399
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,050
Is he your age?

400
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,490
- Yes. We're friends.
- Really?

401
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,350
- Brave Brother.
- He's my friend.

402
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,450
He was so happy
that he called me dead drunk.

403
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,580
- To people around him...
- Because he was happy?

404
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,130
- Yes.
- He's really excited.

405
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,420
- He is.
- So the thing is,

406
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,630
it's been six years
since their debut.

407
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,870
And this is their first appearance
on a TV variety show.

408
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,870
- That's right.
- Is that true?

409
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,470
This is the variety show
we've always wanted to join.

410
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,910
We talked about Running Man a lot.

411
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,010
We're honored.

412
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,550
(Thank you, Brave Girls.)

413
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,750
Let's be honest.

414
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,420
You wanted to see us, right?

415
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,290
- Yes.
- I see.

416
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,080
(He sounds so brazen
just like his high shoulders.)

417
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,260
Shoulder King, stay out of this.

418
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,920
Shoulder King, stay quiet.

419
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,660
- Here we go again.
- Let me shake hands with you.

420
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
- Okay.
- Power shoulders.

421
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,220
I like your jacket.

422
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,420
- Today...
- Your jacket is...

423
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,720
I heard we'd have
Brave Girls here today.

424
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,740
(They're flustered by his fashion.)

425
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,960
He just asked me...

426
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,930
- what Squirtle Queen means.
- When I heard about Brave Girls...

427
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,640
"What does Squirtle Queen mean?"

428
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,070
He asked, "What does
Squirtle Queen mean?"

429
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,970
So I told him
that it means crossing legs.

430
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,050
He did say that.

431
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,550
He doesn't know anything.

432
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,780
Do you know what it means?

433
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,490
- You're unbelievable.
- You're unbelievable.

434
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,390
Today, we're going to have
A Day of Brave Idol Stars Race...

435
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,530
where you can experience
a day of popular idol stars...

436
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,760
with the popular idol group,
Brave Girls.

437
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,630
You will carry out missions
as an idol group of four.

438
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,960
After each mission, you will get
trophies according to the results.

439
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,590
- First place gets five trophies.
- We'll be idol groups.

440
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,870
Second place gets three.

441
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,270
And third place gets one trophy.

442
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,300
And the trophies you win...

443
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,340
will be distributed according to
the seniority decided by the leader.

444
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,410
Really?

445
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,470
(The trophies are distributed
as instructed by the leader.)

446
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,550
The three members with
the most trophies will get prizes.

447
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,390
And the three with the fewest
trophies will get a penalty.

448
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,180
Three people will get a penalty.
That's a lot.

449
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,790
But you're supposed to experience
a day of popular idol stars today.

450
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,590
So the missions will be
judged like music shows.

451
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,690
The winners won't be decided
only by the results of the missions.

452
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,930
We will have special judges
to give you points...

453
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,400
which will be applied
to the results.

454
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,330
Aren't the judges our crew members?

455
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,640
So it's important to gain
favor with the judges.

456
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,100
We've divided you into three groups.

457
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,340
- Okay.
- All right. Tell us.

458
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,570
The first group is...

459
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,710
Yoo Jeong, Jae Suk,
Kwang Soo, and Ji Hyo.

460
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,490
(Idol Group No.1: Yoo Jeong,
Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo)

461
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,340
The first group is Min Young,

462
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,160
Jong Kook, So Min, and Haha.

463
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,160
Okay.

464
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,550
- Good.
- The third group is...

465
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,680
Eun Ji, Yoo Na, Suk Jin,
and Se Chan.

466
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,900
Okay.

467
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,550
(Idol Group No.3: Eun Ji, Yoo Na,
Suk Jin, Se Chan)

468
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,130
Is he our CEO?

469
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,300
Is that it?

470
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,170
We don't need him as our member.

471
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,830
The CEO can't perform on stage.

472
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,830
(That's how they got
three idol groups.)

473
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,100
Now I want you
to choose your team leader.

474
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,240
The leader won't change today.

475
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,970
- It won't change?
- Really?

476
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,010
They should be the leaders.

477
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,370
You don't want
to be the leader, do you?

478
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,550
Come here.

479
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,680
- I want to be the leader.
- You can be the leader.

480
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,580
- Eun Ji is the leader.
- Eun Ji is our leader.

481
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Squirtle Queen is our leader.

482
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,810
And Vocal Queen should
be our leader.

483
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,490
All right. I'll give you
the first trophies right away.

484
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,490
Right now?

485
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,550
Do you remember the photoshoot
you had when you got here today?

486
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,800
The top three members
with the best photos...

487
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,970
will get one trophy each.

488
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,830
- I was too shy.
- I should've done it right.

489
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,100
First, I'll show you
each of your best shots.

490
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,070
- This looks so good.
- I look like a celebrity.

491
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,300
This is so pretty.

492
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,680
When did they take pictures of me?

493
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,720
Here are the top three.

494
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,310
(Who are the top three
chosen by the SBS PR Team?)

495
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,720
It's me.

496
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,960
So Min deserves it.

497
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,150
Oh, Squirtle Queen.

498
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,730
(These three idols looked confident
on their way to work.)

499
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,800
The top three members
with the best shots...

500
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,260
will get this.

501
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

502
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,430
You get one trophy each.

503
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,440
- It's not for my team?
- They get it personally.

504
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,090
Is this for me?

505
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,240
- Gosh, thank you.
- I don't share it with my team.

506
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,980
Let's begin the first mission then.

507
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,340
- Right away?
- This is the quality idols need.

508
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,340
For the first mission, you should
show off your versatile talents.

509
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,220
It's called the Brave Showcase.

510
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,380
Brave Girls prepared
their specialties for today.

511
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,720
We will have a showcase
where you can show your talents.

512
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,550
And you will get
5, 3, and 1 trophies each...

513
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,230
according to the results
of the showcase.

514
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,650
When the four rounds are over,

515
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,550
the winners will be decided...

516
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,930
by the points you win...

517
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,000
and the scores of the 20 judges
who are reservists...

518
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,210
- and civil defense members.
- Okay.

519
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,740
Staff members who are reservists
and civil defense members.

520
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,940
For your information,
the judges have label stickers.

521
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,180
- That's right.
- It says "reservist."

522
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,570
They will give you scores.

523
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,780
I'm no longer a member
of the civil defense.

524
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,870
Me neither.

525
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,020
(It's important to get
good scores from the judges.)

526
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,340
All right

527
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,810
I didn't know I'd be wearing
this jacket for such a long time.

528
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,260
- It's heavy, isn't it?
- It doesn't seem to end.

529
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,960
I should change my clothes
after the opening.

530
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,120
It's not heavy.

531
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,650
Suk Jin says his shoulders hurt.

532
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,000
(Usually, the opening would end now,
and they would get changed.)

533
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,770
(Suk Jin became impatient
as it went on for longer.)

534
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,770
- Hey.
- You can do whatever you want.

535
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,390
(Actually, earlier on...)

536
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,700
- Won't we get changed, Kwang Soo?
- the winners will be decided...

537
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,130
- Won't we? Why won't this end?
- by the points you win...

538
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,900
(Giggling)

539
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,680
- I heard that we won't get changed.
- Really?

540
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,780
(They will play the games
in their opening outfits unusually.)

541
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,870
The first round is dance,
which is Min Young's special talent.

542
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,310
(Team Main Vocalist,
Specialty: dance, majored in dance)

543
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,520
The team whose members danced...

544
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,340
in the most creative way using one
of the items in front of you wins.

545
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,520
- It's difficult.
- For example...

546
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,720
Can we go first?

547
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,150
- It's better to go first.
- Yoo Na.

548
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,490
- Okay. Go ahead.
- It's always better to go first.

549
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,590
- Is that a sword?
- Yes, I brought it.

550
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,960
We'll dance now.

551
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,230
Min Young will start dancing.

552
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,560
Play an upbeat song.

553
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,300
- Is she going to do a sword dance?
- Let's go!

554
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,470
(She's starting doing
a powerful sword dance.)

555
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,540
What's that?

556
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,900
- She's incredible.
- Go, Min Young!

557
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,570
(She's dancing like crazy
with two swords.)

558
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,070
Faster.

559
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,180
(She's dancing excitedly
as if she'd cut everything.)

560
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,280
I've never seen anything
like this before.

561
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,220
(No other idols have demonstrated
a sword dance before!)

562
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,250
- Gosh. What is she doing?
- She's drunk.

563
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,550
- She's a girl in a nightclub.
- What's that?

564
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,550
- A drunkard is here!
- She's in a nightclub.

565
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,650
- Oh, a nightclub?
- Drink up!

566
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,550
(The drunk girl is enjoying herself
in a nightclub as always.)

567
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,030
(She's looking for a life companion
while drinking alcohol.)

568
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,000
- She's so drunk.
- There she goes!

569
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
(The song is reaching its climax
as she gets more and more excited!)

570
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,510
(Throwing up!)

571
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,400
(It's what often happens
in real life.)

572
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,570
- Is she throwing up?
- Oh, she's throwing up?

573
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,110
That's a good one.

574
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,690
(It's exciting.)

575
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,910
(Whispering)

576
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,550
Let's just throw water
at each other.

577
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,790
That'd be the best. Let's do that.

578
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,990
Is this what you want to see?

579
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,760
- You should've told us sooner.
- We'll give it a try.

580
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,700
- We'll do it.
- It's easy to pretend to throw up.

581
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,860
- We'll do it again.
- We'll all take off our shirts.

582
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,940
- They're taken aback.
- Okay. Play a similar song for us.

583
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,160
- Jump in whenever you want.
- Okay.

584
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,710
He's coming.

585
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,130
Is he entering the club?

586
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,570
(The seductive man is entering.)

587
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,310
(I'll show you.)

588
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,410
What's with your face?

589
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,290
(Shaking hips)

590
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,820
(Yang Ssaebssaeb is dancing
like a fish in water.)

591
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,490
What's going on? What's this?

592
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,620
(He's imitating a parvenu dancing
in a nightclub for the first time.)

593
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,060
(But then Shoulder King showed up
with a sword.)

594
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,860
(He assassinated Se Chan
while he was making everyone laugh.)

595
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,100
(What?)

596
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,640
(He has a feeling
that this will fail somehow.)

597
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,900
(Suk Jin is pretending
he's excited.)

598
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,750
(The illogical twist
of the story...)

599
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,250
(made everyone stop cheering.)

600
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,080
- That's all. Thank you.
- You should've killed me at once.

601
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,960
- I don't think that went well.
- You should've killed at once.

602
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,580
You should've killed me
with one blow.

603
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,590
Why? It was okay.

604
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,500
Stabbing me three times
didn't look good.

605
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,090
Honestly, it was funny
until Suk Jin showed up.

606
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,560
Why did you bring a sword?

607
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,390
(He killed the mood
with his sword as well.)

608
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,560
- It'll be funny when it airs.
- It's okay. Don't worry.

609
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,740
Gosh, seriously.

610
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,040
I'm worried. What do we do?

611
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,780
We'll play the music now.

612
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,250
(Team Squirtle is under a lot of
pressure as it's the last team.)

613
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,250
- I'll just follow you.
- Here they go!

614
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,310
(Yoo Jeong stepped up!)

615
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,810
(Twerking)

616
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,810
Yoo Jeong is doing great.
She's such a great dancer.

617
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,910
Let's go!

618
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,350
- Her outfit, I mean.
- Awesome!

619
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,000
Come on. Twerk with her!

620
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,550
Ji Hyo, go ahead and twerk!

621
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,770
Ji Hyo, just do as she does.

622
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,120
That's good.

623
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,970
(Wiggling)

624
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,300
That's good.

625
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,710
(She's flapping as if there's
something wrong with her.)

626
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,010
Ji Hyo.

627
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,100
(An executioner with a sword
appeared to stop her.)

628
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,370
- That's so funny.
- We did well.

629
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,070
- Yoo Jeong, you did a good job.
- We're done.

630
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,400
We've done everything we could do.

631
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,140
Look. Jong Kook is showcasing
his special talent.

632
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,250
- Stand in line. He might kill us.
- That's cool.

633
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,580
(He's showcasing his real talent.)

634
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,350
He looks like Na Han Il, the founder
of the Haidong Gumdo Association.

635
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,550
We're tallying the scores
of the people in the reserve.

636
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,270
The winning team
of the first round is...

637
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,930
(The creativity is most important!)

638
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,560
(Which team could win
and get five points?)

639
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,860
- Team Main Vocalist.
- I knew it.

640
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,060
(Team Main Vocalist wins.)

641
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,940
- What should we do?
- Why? Oh, I get it.

642
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,070
- The vomiting performance?
- That and the sword dance.

643
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
I approve.

644
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,570
(Everyone accepts the result.)

645
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,510
- The second round is...
- Yes.

646
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,050
- the big eyes contest.
- I see. But it's...

647
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,380
- We'll definitely win this round.
- But...

648
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,880
The big eyes contest.

649
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,140
- But...
- We'll definitely lose.

650
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,190
- Our team...
- It's...

651
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,150
We have Jae Suk... I mean,
Jong Kook is on our team.

652
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,150
We lost.

653
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,760
I think you don't even have to
open your eyes widely to win.

654
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,430
We'll measure the vertical length
of your eyes.

655
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,500
The person with the highest result
wins.

656
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,200
- Like this?
- Is using hands not allowed?

657
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,440
Sorry? Correct. You're not allowed
to use your hands.

658
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,740
You should open them widely.

659
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,470
- My, what big eyes you have.
- She has such big eyes.

660
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,510
She has really big eyes.

661
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,440
- Kwang Soo also has big eyes.
- I have big eyes.

662
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,210
(Opening his eyes widely)

663
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,330
- He has big eyes.
- His eyes are...

664
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,780
- bigger than I thought they were.
- He has big eyes.

665
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,180
- He does have big eyes.
- Bring it on.

666
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,980
None of them can beat her.

667
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,410
We'll measure the eyes
of the challengers first.

668
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,750
- Kwang Soo will go first.
- Okay.

669
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,910
He has large eyes.

670
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,460
Oh, gosh. Kwang Soo.

671
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,580
- Let me see.
- Kwang Soo...

672
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,380
- Hands off.
- You can't use your hands.

673
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,230
- They're so big.
- Indeed.

674
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,500
(They're frightened by the mad look
on his face.)

675
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,090
- Oh, goodness.
- My gosh. Look at him.

676
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,500
- Stay still.
- Why am I feeling so dizzy?

677
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,660
I'll look.

678
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,000
Open them as wide as you can.

679
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,270
(He used every muscle in his face
he could use.)

680
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,830
- 2cm. It's 2cm.
- 2cm. Yes, 2cm.

681
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,130
- 2cm.
- It's 2cm.

682
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,710
- We might win.
- 2cm.

683
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,210
- So Min has big eyes too.
- I wonder if she can win.

684
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,480
- So Min has really big eyes.
- Also, I have...

685
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,900
- bulging eyes.
- She has big eyes.

686
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,980
Really?

687
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,020
- Measure it right away, okay?
- I'll do that.

688
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,840
(How big could Big Eyes Queen
on Running Man So Min's eyes be?)

689
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,910
(The aggressively bulging eyes)

690
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,990
She looks scary.

691
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,310
My gosh. Look at her.

692
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,380
- She has really big eyes.
- She has very big eyes.

693
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,620
- Her eyes are so big.
- Please.

694
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,550
- They look like they'll pop out.
- That's why she's called a frog.

695
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,200
It's 1.9cm. 1.9cm.

696
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,530
(It's 0.1cm shorter
than Kwang Soo's.)

697
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,440
- 0.1cm. You can check it yourself.
- Really?

698
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,500
- Really?
- Yes.

699
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,060
- They're so big.
- Jong Kook, you should try it.

700
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,660
- Jong Kook, give it a go.
- You should.

701
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,040
- What? Are you teasing him?
- Let's do this.

702
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,630
Nothing's impossible.

703
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,780
- I have big eyes.
- I know.

704
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,340
- Let me see.
- People just don't know that.

705
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,550
They might be hidden somewhere.
Let's check it.

706
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,980
- Give me just a second.
- Okay.

707
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,990
(Breathing in)

708
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,380
(He's opening his eyes
as wide as possible.)

709
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,190
1cm.

710
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,550
(It's bigger than I thought though.)

711
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,790
I just said the truth.

712
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,960
Only 1cm?

713
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,050
- 1cm?
- Hey, I was quite generous.

714
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,770
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo and Se Chan
are cooking up a ruse.)

715
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,890
To make my eye look like it's open
when it's actually closed.

716
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,090
(He probably asked for this.)

717
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,300
Okay. Done.

718
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,800
You can close this eye.
Try closing it.

719
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,100
- Did you draw the pupil too?
- Of course.

720
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,710
No. It doesn't look like an eye.

721
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,050
It doesn't look like an eye.

722
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,750
- They're not as big as I thought.
- You punk.

723
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,290
(Se Chan scribbled on his eyelid
and ran away.)

724
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,410
Now...

725
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,690
Kwang Soo had a fake eye drawn
on his face.

726
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,930
What's that?

727
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,760
(The problem is that it doesn't
look like an eye at all.)

728
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,000
What's with that eye?

729
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,500
- Why is the eye so big?
- My gosh.

730
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,700
- Kwang Soo's result is 2cm.
- 2cm.

731
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,030
- I think I'm done for.
- Why?

732
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,470
- It's Eun Ji's turn now.
- I just measured it,

733
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,770
- and it's not as big as I thought.
- Don't worry.

734
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,940
- Eun Ji, it's your turn.
- Let's try it again.

735
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,510
- Eun Ji is the last one to go.
- Eun Ji.

736
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,270
- Be confident.
- Big Eyes Queen.

737
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,740
I'm sure it's longer than 2cm.

738
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,400
- Her eyes are unbelievably big.
- Eun Ji, look up.

739
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,840
Chin down, and look up.

740
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,340
- Chin down.
- No.

741
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,110
- Look up. That's good.
- Look up.

742
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,220
Yes. That makes it bigger.

743
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,950
(Kwang Soo is in first place. What
could Big Eyes Queen's result be?)

744
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,990
I'm sure it's longer than 3cm.

745
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,460
It's about 1.9cm.

746
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,310
- No way.
- Check yourself. It's about 1.9cm.

747
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,690
- Kwang Soo wins?
- Then Kwang Soo is the winner.

748
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,000
- Yes, he's the winner.
- Eun Ji, look up.

749
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,090
I don't believe it.

750
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,390
(Suk Jin is measuring it again
to be fair.)

751
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,770
I don't believe it.

752
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,160
- It's shorter than 2cm.
- Hey.

753
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,770
- Then our team...
- Come here.

754
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,940
- Kwang Soo...
- Oh, my.

755
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,130
- Oh, no.
- I'll measure his eye again too.

756
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,900
- Vocal Queen.
- Please measure it accurately.

757
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,440
I think I should try it again.

758
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,680
Maybe your eyes are
horizontally long.

759
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
(He's giving it his all.)

760
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,180
How could his eye be 2cm long?

761
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,370
Maybe they're horizontally long.

762
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,870
(Laughing)

763
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,190
- It really is 2cm.
- Is it really 2cm? Are you sure?

764
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,550
- Give me another chance.
- Is it really 2cm long?

765
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,880
Do I really have bigger eyes
than her?

766
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,760
- My eyes are bigger than hers?
- This is hilarious.

767
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,930
- Kwang Soo.
- I beat them all.

768
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,320
- That's unbelievable.
- Give me another chance.

769
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,850
I have really big eyes.

770
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,500
I have bigger eyes
than Big Eyes Queen!

771
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,470
Isn't it that his skin stretches
well, not that his eyes are big?

772
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,660
- Eun Ji's result is about 1.9cm.
- Wait.

773
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,800
- Let me try it again.
- Measure it again.

774
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,100
- This is your last chance.
- I'm sure it's longer than 2cm.

775
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,800
- This is your last chance, Eun Ji.
- You can do this!

776
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,210
Big Eyes Queen!

777
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,980
- Her eyes look so big.
- Look up.

778
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,310
- Try to open them more widely.
- Eun Ji.

779
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,680
Her eyes take up half of her face.

780
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,880
- That's not good enough.
- Oh, my gosh.

781
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,110
That's not how you should use
your eye muscles.

782
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,690
- You can't get a good result.
- By the way...

783
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,350
You know, Eun Ji...

784
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,190
That will become a meme.

785
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,760
(Mad Eyes King)

786
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,650
Is it really 2cm long?

787
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,800
(It's 2cm long no matter how many
times they measure it.)

788
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,970
- It's true. It's 2cm.
- I think my eyes got bigger.

789
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,270
- Okay!
- We lost.

790
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,800
I'll explain.

791
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,860
Eun Ji, you do have bigger eyes
than him,

792
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,630
but you just can't open your eyes
like he does.

793
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,800
You shouldn't just open them
like you did.

794
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,980
Your eyes look...

795
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,450
Your eyes look much bigger than his
when they're normally opened.

796
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,980
(He's showing his skill
that helped him win.)

797
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,790
- Team Squirtle wins.
- Okay!

798
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,080
(Team Squirtle wins thanks to
Kwang Soo's mad eyes.)

799
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,220
That was awesome.

800
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,320
(It's time for the third round!)

801
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,030
The third round is
Yoo Jeong's special talent.

802
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,350
Singing any songs sadly.

803
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,470
- Yes.
- Sounds good.

804
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,500
- Singing an exciting song sadly?
- Yes.

805
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,660
Regardless of the genre, the person
whose song sounds the saddest wins.

806
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,710
Okay.

807
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,470
Before we begin,
Yoo Jeong will demonstrate it.

808
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,940
- Okay. Yes.
- Yoo Jeong, show us how to do it.

809
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,780
She always smiles
and looks so cheerful,

810
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,450
- but she sings songs sadly?
- She's versatile.

811
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,780
She's unpredictable.

812
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,870
Then...

813
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,190
I'll sing one of our songs
"We Ride."

814
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,950
"We Ride" is an exciting song.

815
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,380
("We Ride" is a refreshing
city pop song.)

816
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,760
(She smiles more cheerfully
especially when she performs it.)

817
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,150
(How will Squirtle Queen
who always smiles sing it sadly?)

818
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,800
(She's immersing herself
in emotion.)

819
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,970
(However, it doesn't sound
very sad.)

820
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,540
(Everyone is forcing themselves
to feel sad.)

821
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,750
(Sad thoughts, sad thoughts,
sad thoughts)

822
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,370
Squirtle Queen!

823
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,840
(Stop it!)

824
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,610
(The party lovers who are still
excited started dancing too.)

825
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,080
Squirtle Queen!

826
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,760
- It sounded so sad.
- It was so sad.

827
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,930
It was so sad that I almost cried.

828
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,430
- Ji Hyo, you almost cried?
- I almost cried.

829
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,120
- Is that true?
- Can't you see my teary eyes?

830
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,430
Ji Hyo actually teared up.

831
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,240
- Do you want to hear a sad song?
- Yes.

832
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,390
It's easy.

833
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,300
- Go, Se Chan!
- Se Chan will sing?

834
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,770
We'll show you sadness.

835
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,100
(Wailing)

836
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,300
The song title is...

837
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,610
He's crying already.

838
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,690
He started crying
even before starting singing.

839
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,960
He's going to sing
"Gee" by Girls' Generation.

840
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,110
I'll sing a song for you.

841
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,790
- He's crying.
- My gosh.

842
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,800
(He's planning to make everyone
laugh until they start crying.)

843
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,700
(He's already crying.)

844
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,590
(He'll sing "Gee" feeling sad.)

845
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,590
He's just crying.
He's not singing sadly.

846
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,510
You are so beautiful
I can't look you in the eyes

847
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,940
You take my breath away
Gee, gee, gee, gee, baby, baby

848
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,940
(Crying his heart out)

849
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,570
- I can't even look at you
- Look at his face.

850
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,870
He looks so ugly.

851
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,140
You just look like an idiot.

852
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,580
(He's just a sad idiot.)

853
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,490
Hey, that's not... Seriously...

854
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,080
- Why?
- That's not...

855
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,690
- It's sad.
- singing sadly.

856
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,350
- Why?
- It sounds sad.

857
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,320
- You just cried while singing.
- I cried because it was sad.

858
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,350
- That's not right.
- It was sad.

859
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,390
- It was sad.
- We're all so sad.

860
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,530
- It was sad.
- Don't be ridiculous.

861
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,300
Se Chan, can you come out
while crying again?

862
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,860
(The sad idiot appears again.)

863
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,470
(Please... Give me the mic.)

864
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,830
You make my heart flutter

865
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,840
Whenever I see you
My heart pounds

866
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,870
I'm so sad right now.

867
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,750
- My gosh. I can't believe you.
- That was so funny.

868
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,380
- He looked so ugly.
- My gosh.

869
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,050
You can't cry while singing
to make it sad.

870
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,460
- He made us want to cry too.
- I teared up.

871
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,620
That was awesome.

872
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,290
He made me cry.

873
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,700
- We all burst into tears.
- I cried too.

874
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,270
- So Min will go first.
- Okay.

875
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,060
- What song should I sing?
- She's full of emotions now.

876
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,060
Watch carefully. Look at her face.

877
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,630
- She'll cry too.
- She'll cry in ten seconds.

878
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,400
(What is she going to do?)

879
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,180
Looking here

880
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,070
(Sobbing)

881
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,840
Looking there

882
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,220
- She's actually crying.
- Isn't she just crying?

883
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,310
Look at this.

884
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,850
- She actually cried tears.
- She's acting.

885
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,620
- Look at this.
- My goodness!

886
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,880
(Surprised)

887
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
She's acting.

888
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,230
That's just acting.

889
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,300
She's acting, not singing.

890
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,590
(She's singing the song from "Dooly
the Little Dinosaur" in tears.)

891
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,270
She actually cried.

892
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,630
(Jae Suk started dancing
to make her laugh.)

893
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,800
(Wailing)

894
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,680
(But she doesn't care
and even started wailing.)

895
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,300
Why do you have to do that?

896
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,840
I don't understand. Why...

897
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,210
- What is this?
- It's so exciting.

898
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,280
(The dance of satisfaction)

899
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
- She actually cried.
- My goodness.

900
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,290
(So Min's acting was
fit for a serious drama.)

901
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,020
Good job. We win.

902
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,260
- She cried.
- How does she cry in ten seconds?

903
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,620
- It's okay.
- She's incredible.

904
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,150
- She's currently in first place.
- Her facial expression was good.

905
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,890
- I'm so sad.
- Of course, it was sad.

906
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,390
- It was so sad.
- She cried while singing.

907
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,970
- We need a plan.
- You're right.

908
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,160
We win.

909
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,300
- Yoo Jeong.
- Yes?

910
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,500
- Do you think you can cry?
- No, I can't.

911
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,470
I'm sorry. I can't cry.
I know I should cry, but I can't.

912
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,980
I think Jae Suk can make us sad
by singing without his glasses.

913
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,680
Right. That will be so sad.
I'll be sad too.

914
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,300
It'll be really sad
if he takes off his cap and glasses.

915
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,780
- I'll sing.
- He already looks sad.

916
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,840
(He decided to take off his glasses
to save his team.)

917
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,050
He looks so sad. My gosh.

918
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,380
It's sad because he's ugly.

919
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,610
I felt sad once he took off
his glasses.

920
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,760
It's sad because he's ugly.

921
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,380
Can you play the song I want?

922
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,880
- What song?
- It's god's song.

923
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,050
- When will you start singing?
- You should sing.

924
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,760
- I know I should sing.
- Oh, gosh.

925
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,120
- Hold on a second.
- Stop acting. You should sing.

926
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,270
You see...

927
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,590
"Love and Remember."

928
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,040
"Love and Remember?"
That song is actually sad.

929
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,510
You're supposed to sing
an exciting song.

930
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,240
You should choose an exciting song.

931
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,600
This game is about singing
a song that's not sad in a sad way.

932
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,640
He doesn't follow the rules.

933
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,070
Don't talk to me.
I'm trying to get into emotion.

934
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,050
His face looks even uglier now.

935
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,950
- He's being aggressive.
- My gosh.

936
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,790
- What a mess.
- He rarely acts like this.

937
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,050
This is a total mess.

938
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,610
Doesn't he look weird?

939
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,990
Come here.
Come and look at his face.

940
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,150
- He looks so weird.
- He looks sad.

941
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,390
Now I see why people can't recognize
Superman when he's wearing glasses.

942
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,500
The intro alone makes me so sad.

943
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,300
(How will he make this sad song
sound even sadder?)

944
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,800
Shouldn't he start singing?

945
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,300
Shouldn't he sing?

946
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,940
- What are you doing?
- What's this?

947
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,780
He's even lip-syncing!

948
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,570
- god! god!
- Oh, my gosh.

949
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,100
That's ridiculous. What is he doing?

950
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,180
- What is this?
- What is this?

951
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,680
- You're supposed to sing.
- What is this?

952
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,990
This is just "The Yoo Jae Suk Show!"

953
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,110
What's this?

954
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,910
- Cut it out!
- He's lip-syncing. Gosh.

955
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,290
What are you doing?

956
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,790
Gosh. What is he doing?

957
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,550
His face looks sad though.

958
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,000
What's that?

959
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,030
Your face makes us so sad.

960
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,320
Watching you makes us feel sad.

961
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,360
(He suddenly lied down.)

962
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,700
My gosh.

963
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,240
Why is he lying on the ground?

964
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,740
You shouldn't sleep here.

965
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,040
You shouldn't sleep here.

966
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
You shouldn't... Excuse me.

967
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,070
Look at Chan Hee.
He put his camera on his shoulder.

968
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,070
- Chan Hee is going to...
- He'll show his skills.

969
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,250
It reminded him of old memories.

970
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,280
Chan Hee started filming him
in the old-fashioned style.

971
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,840
(Chan Hee's camera)

972
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,020
Do you call this
singing a song sadly?

973
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,790
You should sing it sadly.

974
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,460
Gosh. What are you doing?

975
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,120
I think we should stop him.

976
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,700
- Jae Suk, stop it.
- You should stop him.

977
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,230
Jae Suk, come on.

978
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,200
- Right.
- Jae Suk, come on.

979
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,060
(The overly excited man is
being dragged out.)

980
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,330
That was funny.

981
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,100
- Jae Suk, pull yourself together.
- Slap me.

982
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,430
Okay.

983
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,430
(He finally pulled himself together
after a slap.)

984
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,430
What's wrong with him?

985
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,310
- Chan Hee...
- You should've sung it sadly.

986
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,740
Chan Hee, I'm disappointed by you.

987
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,350
I only grabbed you lightly.

988
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,310
- Did you really have to do that?
- He gets upset about everything.

989
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,470
I'm really upset.

990
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,180
- Why are you always so upset?
- How could he do that to me?

991
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,350
- It was a close call.
- I see.

992
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,350
- We had a discussion.
- I bet So Min won.

993
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,390
Although some of you won't be
happy about the result,

994
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,330
- Team Squirtle wins.
- Yes!

995
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,760
- But...
- He lip-synced...

996
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,430
- I love you
- Why?

997
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,390
- Right.
- He didn't even sing.

998
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,490
He just acted.

999
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,990
Chan Hee, you did a great job.
We made a great team.

1000
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,060
I liked the way you pushed me away
with an annoyed look on your face.

1001
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,870
He practically twisted your arm.

1002
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,310
That's when your performance
became sad.

1003
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,310
(The performance with Chan Hee
was the game changer.)

1004
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,470
You did a great job.

1005
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,180
Your mission scores came out.

1006
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,370
We're waiting on the reservists
and civil defense members' scores.

1007
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,410
- We might get a high score.
- We did well.

1008
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,890
Oh, right. I forgot about that.

1009
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,180
It's practically a popularity poll.

1010
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,890
- The result came out.
- Let's go!

1011
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,280
First of all, the mission scores...

1012
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,890
I'll announce the team
in third place...

1013
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,870
- based on the total scores.
- The team in third place.

1014
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,200
(Team Big Eyes, Team Squirtle,
Team Main Vocalist)

1015
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,970
- Okay!
- Our team?

1016
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,530
- Our team?
- Yes.

1017
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,330
- We're in third place.
- Gosh.

1018
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,310
One of the remaining teams is
in first place.

1019
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,970
- We're in third place.
- Okay.

1020
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,100
- We'll show you the result now.
- Okay.

1021
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,310
The team in second place is...

1022
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,310
(Team Big Eyes, Team Squirtle,
Team Main Vocalist)

1023
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,580
(Team Main Vocalist: 1st place,
Team Squirtle: 2nd place)

1024
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,470
Really? Hey, we're the winning team.

1025
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,180
- It's hard to believe.
- I'm so happy.

1026
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,280
- We're the most popular team.
- Exactly.

1027
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,390
I can't... Oh, my. I'm excited.

1028
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,160
- This is awesome.
- It's because of her sword dance.

1029
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,300
As a result, this team
is the winning team.

1030
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,600
Team Main Vocalist.

1031
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,370
Team Squirtle is in 2nd place,
and Team Big Eyes is in 3rd place.

1032
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,930
- It's okay.
- I can't accept it though.

1033
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,700
It's time for you to distribute
the trophies you earned.

1034
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,970
The team leaders should decide
the order of getting trophies.

1035
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,580
- Can the leader be the first?
- Of course.

1036
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,680
So she can get as many trophies
as she wants.

1037
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,720
The winner has 5, 2nd place has 3,
and 3rd place has 1.

1038
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,180
The team leaders, please announce
the first person to go.

1039
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,580
Well... Kwang Soo...

1040
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
- Yoo Jeong, wait.
- Okay!

1041
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,180
- Oh, no. That was a mistake.
- Hey, wait. Not yet.

1042
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
(The big mistake
that Yoo Jeong made...)

1043
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,300
(gave Kwang Soo
a great opportunity.)

1044
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,330
- Not yet.
- She'll choose again?

1045
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,300
- We'll start over again.
- Come back.

1046
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,220
- Hey, Yoo Jeong.
- She changed her mind.

1047
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,240
- Why, Yoo Jeong?
- You almost made a big mistake.

1048
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,490
- I was going to take just one.
- Yoo Jeong.

1049
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,600
She made a mistake.

1050
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,870
- Yoo Jeong, you made a big mistake.
- You're right.

1051
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,970
- Right.
- I forgot.

1052
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,240
Then I'll let Ji Hyo go first.

1053
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,310
- Me?
- Yes.

1054
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,680
Who goes next?

1055
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,350
- Don't you think...
- You should go next.

1056
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,970
- Okay. And then you go next.
- You go after her.

1057
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,990
I'll be the 3rd,
and he'll be the 4th.

1058
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,580
What changed your mind?
You picked me first earlier.

1059
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,510
- Drop it.
- Have you all made your decisions?

1060
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,160
Just follow the leader's decisions.

1061
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,260
- I just want to know why.
- It's up to her.

1062
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,720
Right. She should decide the order
as our leader.

1063
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,350
The first members,
please step forward.

1064
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,370
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

1065
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,870
The leader gets two...

1066
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,530
Eun Ji, you can leave it in the box.

1067
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,800
You can take it or not.
It's up to you.

1068
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,870
You can leave it there
for your team members.

1069
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,260
You can take all of them
if you want.

1070
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,010
- Take as many as you want.
- Absolutely.

1071
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,870
- It sparkled... Gosh.
- Oh, boy.

1072
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,180
(She tried to take it secretly
but dropped it in front of them.)

1073
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,950
- She dropped it. My gosh.
- She dropped it.

1074
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,950
She dropped it.

1075
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,780
- Next.
- We don't even have to go.

1076
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,080
- Put it back in there.
- Go on.

1077
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,680
I'll be reasonable
and conscientious.

1078
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,890
- You didn't take too many, right?
- No.

1079
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,080
Next, step forward.

1080
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,060
(Kwang Soo, the last person
from his team...)

1081
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,260
(tries to find a trophy in the box.)

1082
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,260
(Empty)

1083
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,800
(Oh, I get it.)

1084
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,260
(So this is how you'll do it.)

1085
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,660
I didn't get any either.

1086
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,530
It was already empty.

1087
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,370
- Really?
- Yes.

1088
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,370
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.)

1089
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,100
- We have the most trophies, right?
- Yes.

1090
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,560
Yes. We have five.

1091
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,580
You take 2 as the leader
and give 1 to each of us.

1092
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,350
2 for the leader,
and 1 for each of us.

1093
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,080
- Okay?
- Yes. That'd be fair.

1094
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,780
Take 2 and give 1 to each of us.

1095
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,510
- You're so pretty.
- That'd be really nice.

1096
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
Must I show them
how many I'm taking out?

1097
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,580
No, you can put them
in your bag secretly.

1098
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,680
You shouldn't let us know.

1099
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,260
- I trust you.
- Take it.

1100
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,120
Oh, she's taking one more out.

1101
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,160
Stop.

1102
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,620
You're taking too many
when you're the first to go.

1103
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,300
- She's taking too many...
- Oh, man. I hear them clattering.

1104
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,890
- So Min.
- I told you not to do that.

1105
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,600
Min Young made a good plan.

1106
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,870
- I chose So Min.
- She'll put blame on So Min.

1107
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,910
Is that right?

1108
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,930
So Min, I heard them clattering.

1109
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,240
- I have only 1.
- Let me have 1 too.

1110
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,180
You received one
before we began the missions.

1111
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,350
- Who's going next?
- Who is next?

1112
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,580
(Jong Kook is the third.)

1113
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,640
It's taking him so long.

1114
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,620
- Hey, do you still believe her?
- Come back, Jong Kook.

1115
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,680
We've been doing this
for over ten years.

1116
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,620
- It wasn't me. Trust me.
- I'll rip off the bottom.

1117
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,260
Oh, I see. I guess...

1118
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,060
- you're still holding onto hope.
- It was Min Young.

1119
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,060
My gosh. How could they do this?

1120
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,990
(Chuckling)

1121
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,970
- Gosh.
- Jong Kook, I took only one.

1122
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,100
It's already empty? That's so mean.

1123
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,200
- We told Min Young to do...
- This is how we...

1124
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,910
everything she wanted, and she
actually followed our advice.

1125
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,510
- That's not true. It wasn't me.
- My gosh.

1126
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,600
Now, we'll move
to the next location.

1127
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,080
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1128
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,780
We rarely wear...

1129
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,050
our opening outfits
for so long like today.

1130
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,640
- Exactly.
- I didn't expect this.

1131
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,950
I know, right? It's nice.

1132
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,060
Just so you know,

1133
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,010
apart from Min Young,

1134
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,560
the other had already
moved out of their house.

1135
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,930
What do you mean by "moved out?"

1136
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,330
To look for another career path.

1137
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,350
They were close to
quitting this industry.

1138
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,660
- To get another job,
- That's sad to hear.

1139
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,970
- Yoo Jeong studied for a test.
- Right.

1140
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,260
- She studied Korean history.
- Really?

1141
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,160
- Yes, Korean history.
- She took classes.

1142
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,660
But then your song
received an explosive response.

1143
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,140
They were all getting ready
for a new chapter in their lives,

1144
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,100
but things took a 180 turn
because of that one video.

1145
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,740
Jae Suk once looked
for part-time jobs too.

1146
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,280
- Right.
- He was thinking about quitting.

1147
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,720
- After becoming a comedian?
- Yes, after.

1148
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,680
Suk Jin, what were you going to do
after quitting Running Man?

1149
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,810
- Yes, tell us.
- What?

1150
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,810
What were you going to do?

1151
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,660
Suk Jin took an interest
in real estate.

1152
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,220
Real estate?

1153
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,120
- But...
- Don't you need money for that?

1154
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,390
What's the point in just looking?

1155
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,890
There's no need to worry about me.

1156
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,830
Worry more about yourselves.

1157
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,060
Why would you worry about me?

1158
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,830
- Did you just get angry with us?
- Why do you sound annoyed?

1159
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,310
I wasn't annoyed.
That was me just voicing my opinion.

1160
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,370
No, you were annoyed just now.

1161
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,510
My tone was elevated, that's all.

1162
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,640
Let's take a short break.

1163
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,030
Your identity's crumbling.

1164
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,470
- You were annoyed just now.
- You were.

1165
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,140
- I wasn't.
- You were.

1166
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,120
- I wasn't.
- But you were.

1167
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,720
Thanks to Brave Girls being here...

1168
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,890
Gosh, thank you.

1169
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,390
- Your mother must be thrilled.
- She is.

1170
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,760
Of course, she is.

1171
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,510
Yoo Jeong cried her eyes out
while holding onto her mom.

1172
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,660
Who did?

1173
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,950
They're all in their 30s now.

1174
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,850
- You're older than I thought.
- Exactly.

1175
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,620
That's why I find this more amazing.

1176
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,760
How nice is it to see people...

1177
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,930
find their big break in their 30s?

1178
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,660
- It really is cool.
- Thank you.

1179
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,970
You're giving hope
to the youngsters of this era.

1180
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,510
Why don't we eat quietly?

1181
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,470
(He stops Suk Jin
from saying anything more.)

1182
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,080
(Suk Jin's patronizing words
are stopped.)

1183
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,450
Who was that?

1184
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,870
Who talked while eating?

1185
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,080
He even described them
as youngsters.

1186
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,660
- Youngsters.
- He's right.

1187
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,160
And now Suk Jin eats quietly.

1188
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,660
If you see me
raising my hands at them,

1189
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,300
just think that it was inevitable.

1190
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,970
- What was that?
- If I hit them...

1191
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,760
Min Young thinks he's the funniest.

1192
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,800
- Suk Jin?
- Yes.

1193
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,870
He is.

1194
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,030
He's been enjoying
his heyday recently.

1195
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,810
- It's the Ji Suk Jin Show.
- You know...

1196
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,780
- He's had a major resurgence.
- It's true, Yoo Jeong.

1197
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,450
- That's right.
- A major resurgence.

1198
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:08,120
- Suk Jin...
- He's had a major resurgence.

1199
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,450
We made it happen for him.

1200
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,310
The more he ages,

1201
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,240
the more childish he becomes.

1202
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,950
He gives hope
to youngsters of this world.

1203
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,450
Today, you're the members
of a popular K-pop group.

1204
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,080
- A four-member group.
- Right.

1205
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,120
Just like the nicknames
the members of Brave Girls have,

1206
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,850
let's come up with one
for all of you.

1207
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,390
We said a few earlier.

1208
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,760
- He's Gum King.
- Gum King.

1209
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,890
I'm Gum King.

1210
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,700
(Pinkish Gum King)

1211
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,430
- Gum King.
- Gum King?

1212
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,470
- Gum King?
- Yes, Gum King.

1213
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,910
How is that so funny?

1214
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,580
Don't bother memorizing that.

1215
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,450
- Gum King.
- You could be...

1216
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,470
Call me Nose King.

1217
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,240
But you were Shoulder King.

1218
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,990
- No, wait.
- I took off that jacket.

1219
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,220
- Nose King.
- Nose King?

1220
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,930
- Nose King.
- Sleep if you're tired.

1221
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,680
Ji Hyo is Enough Queen.

1222
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,930
- Enough Queen.
- It suits her.

1223
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,330
- So Min's the Nutty Queen.
- Nutty Queen.

1224
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,300
Jae Suk can be Citron King.

1225
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,660
And Haha...

1226
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,990
So Min named me Citron King.

1227
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,100
- What's that?
- Citron is "yuja" in Korean.

1228
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,660
I'm Citron King
because my name sounds like "yuja."

1229
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,160
(Citron King, Nutty Queen,
Enough Queen)

1230
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,470
What about Kwang Soo?

1231
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,740
- Kwang Soo?
- Just Han Ki Bum.

1232
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,910
Long King.

1233
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,080
- Long King?
- Yes, Long King.

1234
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,120
- Long King?
- Call him Long King.

1235
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,370
- Then I'll be Short King.
- Short King!

1236
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,510
Short King.

1237
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,720
(Han Ki Bum's brother Long King,
The short Short King)

1238
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,310
- He's Muscle King.
- Muscle King.

1239
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,760
- Muscle King.
- Muscle King.

1240
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,780
(The protein-loving Muscle King)

1241
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,950
Shouldn't he be Muscle Queen?

1242
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,760
- Muscle Queen!
- Muscle King.

1243
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,870
(She seems like a talented golfer.)

1244
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,390
Since you all have your nicknames,

1245
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,300
we'll play a game with them.

1246
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,530
A game?

1247
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:42,470
With the nicknames
coined with love by your fans,

1248
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,580
you'll play
Nickname Frying Pan Game.

1249
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,700
Play Nickname Frying Pan Game...

1250
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,240
with the nicknames
you gave yourselves.

1251
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,740
- I'm terrible at games like this.
- You'll also...

1252
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,240
be using the beat
in the strawberry game,

1253
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,160
as in 1, 2, 3, 4.

1254
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,280
Starting with the left shoulder?

1255
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,760
- 1, 2, 3, 4?
- Yes.

1256
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,120
- Like this?
- Yes, the four beats.

1257
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,800
Is your nickname Han Ki Bum?

1258
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,100
It should end with King.

1259
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,890
He's Long King
while Haha's Short King.

1260
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,200
Long King and Short King.

1261
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,600
Nose King and...

1262
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,240
Is it your turn
if I call out "Ki Bum, two?"

1263
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:13,600
The nickname should end with King.

1264
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,830
King?

1265
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,140
It wouldn't be Ki Bum King.

1266
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,010
(He can't shake off
the image of his doppelganger.)

1267
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,600
- Are we playing in teams?
- Yes, teams.

1268
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,310
- We're playing in teams.
- Teams!

1269
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,220
- In teams.
- Ji Hyo, do well, okay?

1270
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:25,910
- We've got this.
- Yoo Jeong, do well.

1271
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,810
- Sure.
- Don't attack your teammates.

1272
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,260
- Don't attack your teammates.
- No way.

1273
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,280
The judge for this round...

1274
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,120
will be the sound mixer
in front of you.

1275
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,490
He will single out...

1276
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:38,720
the voices that sound pleasant.

1277
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,870
- The voices that sound pleasant?
- Got it.

1278
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,870
I love you, Mr. Lee.

1279
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,810
I know you're listening.

1280
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,660
Shall we start with Vocal Queen?

1281
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,680
Sure, we'll start with Min Young.
Go!

1282
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,870
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng

1283
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,100
- Ting, taeng, frying pan
- Ting, taeng, frying pan

1284
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,910
- Gum King, four.
- What?

1285
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,050
- It's you.
- Out!

1286
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,720
- It's you.
- You're Gum King.

1287
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,010
Must "King" be added at the end?

1288
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,410
- Gum King, four!
- No breaks are allowed.

1289
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,950
Gum King, Gum King,
Gum King, Gum King.

1290
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,930
- It's tricky.
- Why can't you do this?

1291
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:09,030
Whenever we play this game,
Jae Suk's like,

1292
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,430
"Why can't you do better?"

1293
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,100
- He's the worst at it though.
- Hey.

1294
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,990
- How is this hard?
- Guys, take a look...

1295
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,700
and see how terrible
Jae Suk is at this.

1296
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,600
We'll consider that
as a practice game.

1297
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,870
- Sure.
- Let's do this then.

1298
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,010
- I'll start things off. And go.
- Sure.

1299
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,080
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng

1300
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,280
- Ting, taeng, frying pan
- Ting, taeng, frying pan

1301
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:26,970
Sleep Queen, three.

1302
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,240
Wait, I got it wrong.

1303
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,310
(He got it wrong.)

1304
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,950
(Her nickname is Enough Queen.)

1305
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,180
Seriously?

1306
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,310
- Every day on the bus to school
- Every day on the bus to school

1307
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,030
No, I'm fine

1308
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,390
Who has Sleep Queen for a nickname?

1309
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,390
We're also on the same team.

1310
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,200
- What's your nickname?
- He's terrible at this.

1311
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,470
I'm Enough Queen.

1312
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,220
Unbelievable.

1313
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,600
- I'm sorry.
- Seriously?

1314
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,930
What's up with him?

1315
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,260
There's Nose King, right?

1316
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,870
He's terrible at these games.

1317
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,600
Why does he get nervous
all the time?

1318
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,280
- His palms are sweaty.
- It's because he gets nervous.

1319
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,410
Let me wish myself luck.

1320
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,970
- We'll start with Enough Queen.
- Sure.

1321
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,140
- All right.
- And go.

1322
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,490
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng

1323
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:06,640
- Ting, taeng, frying pan
- Ting, taeng, frying pan

1324
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,180
- No Ball King, four.
- No Ball King, No Ball King...

1325
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,260
No balls?

1326
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,160
(No Ball King?)

1327
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:13,620
No balls?

1328
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,260
(What did you just say to me?)

1329
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,330
Did you seriously just say that?

1330
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,240
Ji Hyo, his nickname is Nose King.

1331
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,800
- It's Nose King.
- Nose King.

1332
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,330
- That's what I said.
- But Suk Jin responded.

1333
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,560
Suk Jin responded,

1334
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,010
- No Ball King, four.
- No Ball King.

1335
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,530
- You're wrong about me!
- No way.

1336
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,740
Nose King is what I said.

1337
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,910
- I said "Nose King."
- No Ball King, four!

1338
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:34,810
I'm really sorry about that.

1339
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,140
It's the nickname
given to him by his fans.

1340
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,410
My children are growing up well.

1341
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,120
- What?
- I have proof.

1342
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,310
I have children, you know.

1343
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,180
- How can you say that?
- No fan would give him...

1344
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,220
the nickname No Ball.

1345
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,760
It's been scientifically proven
in my case.

1346
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,580
- Why did you respond to it?
- Well...

1347
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,620
"How can I have no balls?"

1348
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,990
- This...
- Anyway, you're wrong.

1349
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,370
It'll be another meme of yours.

1350
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,640
It'll have a major resurgence.

1351
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,660
It'll be a popular meme of yours.

1352
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,260
- Anyway, you're wrong.
- Suk Jin, I'm sorry.

1353
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,410
- We'll start with Nose King.
- Sure.

1354
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,080
Nose King, Nose King.

1355
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,280
- Nose King.
- Yes, Nose King.

1356
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,100
- Ji Hyo, it's Nose King.
- Nose!

1357
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,850
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng

1358
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,140
- Ting, taeng, frying pan
- Ting, taeng, frying pan

1359
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,810
- Muscle King, four.
- Muscle King, Muscle King,

1360
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,810
Muscle King, Muscle King.

1361
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,080
Nose King, four.

1362
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,620
Nose King, Nose King,
Nose King, Nose King.

1363
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,080
(The techno warrior)

1364
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,800
Did you see him just now?

1365
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,760
What about your shoulders?

1366
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:24,990
What on earth was that?

1367
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,300
- It's up to me, isn't it?
- Why were you dancing the techno?

1368
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,330
I can do what I want.

1369
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,030
Why are we even playing this game
if there are no rules?

1370
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,810
Why were you dancing the techno?

1371
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:32,870
Because I wanted to.

1372
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,140
I'm excited
to be here with Brave Girls.

1373
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,530
- Like this.
- But...

1374
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:39,010
- I...
- You're out.

1375
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,810
- I didn't get it wrong.
- You didn't.

1376
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,680
Call Bobbed-hair Queen too
during the game.

1377
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,550
No way. She's on our team.

1378
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,780
(Se Chan's urgent words.)

1379
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:49,120
She's on our team,
so don't listen to Jae Suk!

1380
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,850
She's on our team.

1381
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,330
- Seriously, Jae Suk?
- I got it.

1382
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,160
No Gum King or Big Eyes Queen.

1383
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,300
- No Bobbed-hair Queen.
- He doesn't even know...

1384
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,450
who's on his team.

1385
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,260
Don't call out for those
on our team.

1386
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,370
Bobbed-hair Queen...

1387
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,530
- And...
- Giant Eyes Queen.

1388
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,800
Yes, Giant Eyes Queen.

1389
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,140
Her nickname is Big Eyes Queen.

1390
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,060
- Big Eyes Queen?
- It's Big Eyes.

1391
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,370
- Giant Eyes Queen?
- Giant Eyes Queen, my gosh.

1392
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,870
- How about we omit the gestures?
- Without them?

1393
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,240
- Yes.
- The gestures aren't easy.

1394
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,810
Let's try it without the gestures.

1395
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,970
- Without them?
- Just clap instead.

1396
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,010
- How about this?
- Just clap?

1397
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,470
- This?
- Okay, good.

1398
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,240
- Yes, just clap.
- Ting, ting, ting, ting

1399
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,490
- Taeng, taeng, taeng, taeng
- Taeng, taeng, taeng, taeng

1400
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:21,950
- Ting, taeng, frying pan
- Check out the beautiful scenery.

1401
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:23,950
(Taeng, taeng, taeng, taeng)

1402
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,390
(Ting, ting, taeng, taeng)

1403
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,220
(Frying pan)

1404
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,450
Why aren't you playing the game?

1405
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,370
- But it's beautiful out there.
- Why are you enjoying the scenery?

1406
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,300
- We have fine weather today.
- It's spring!

1407
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,830
Check out the forsythia.

1408
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,490
Look at you all on the same page.

1409
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,330
He was chanting all on his own,

1410
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,600
and no one cared to join in.

1411
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,910
- Shall we enjoy the scenery first?
- Take a look.

1412
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,310
Okay, it'll be a moment to enjoy.

1413
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,870
- We'll purify our eyes first.
- Check that out.

1414
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,550
- It's Yangwha Bridge!
- I can understand.

1415
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,850
- Look at that.
- It's plausible...

1416
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,140
since the sky is clear.

1417
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,140
- I can fully understand.
- Spring is here.

1418
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,510
Look at the forsythia.

1419
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,580
- Okay, shall we?
- Look at the flowers.

1420
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,010
- Go for it.
- 1 and 2.

1421
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,390
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng

1422
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:00,620
- Ting, taeng, frying pan
- Ting, taeng, frying pan

1423
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,850
- Squirtle Queen, three.
- Squirtle Queen, Squirtle Queen,

1424
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,390
- Squirtle Queen. Gum King, one.
- Nicely done.

1425
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,100
Gum King. Long King, one.

1426
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:08,830
- Long King.
- Nice!

1427
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:10,530
- Vocal Queen, three.
- Vocal, Vocal Queen, Vocal Queen.

1428
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:11,970
- Nicely done.
- Gum King, four.

1429
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,410
Gum King, Gum King, Gum King,
Gum King. Citron King, two.

1430
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,700
Citron King, Citron King,
Citron King.

1431
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,010
(The sneak attack...)

1432
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,700
(made him crumble.)

1433
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,470
- Out!
- Why are you so bad at this?

1434
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,140
Can we leave him out
when playing games?

1435
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,450
- Se Chan...
- We were on a roll.

1436
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:25,640
Jae Suk...

1437
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,580
was trembling by my side.

1438
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,720
It's why I tossed it over to him.

1439
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,780
He couldn't see straight.

1440
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:31,950
Why are you this nervous?

1441
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,160
He wasn't like this
during his "X-Man" days.

1442
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,450
That's because
I always hosted the games.

1443
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,890
Oh, that's right.

1444
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,430
Anyway, we all did well.

1445
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,370
Someone, please give Jae Suk
a calming pill.

1446
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,890
Okay, let's do this. Go ahead.

1447
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:44,970
And go.

1448
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,060
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng

1449
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,280
- Ting, taeng, frying pan
- Ting, taeng, frying pan

1450
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,680
- Citron King, three.
- Citron, Citron King, Citron King.

1451
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:53,740
(He did it this time!)

1452
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,740
Big Eyes Queen, three.

1453
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,950
Big Eyes Queen,
Big Eyes Queen, Big Eyes Queen.

1454
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,280
- Citron King, four.
- Citron King, Citron King,

1455
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,390
Citron King, Citron King.
Long King, three.

1456
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,950
Long King, Long King, Long King.

1457
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,620
Long King, three.

1458
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,120
(Long King went off beat.)

1459
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,490
- That's wrong.
- He wasn't on the beat.

1460
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:06,490
No, he was on the beat.

1461
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,260
- That's not it.
- It was a fake.

1462
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,120
- Why would you attack me?
- He's on your team!

1463
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,560
Why were you looking at me then?

1464
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,870
I was only looking at you...

1465
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,600
- because it was your turn!
- I know!

1466
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,100
- Hey.
- Why would you attack me?

1467
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,530
He can't even tell...

1468
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,140
whether Kwang Soo
is on our team or not.

1469
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,180
- For him...
- I looked at him because...

1470
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,870
- Hey.
- He attacked me for looking at him.

1471
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,240
So why did you look at me?

1472
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,470
(Citron King was doing well until
he attacked his own team member.)

1473
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,850
- Let's start with Long King again.
- Okay.

1474
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,810
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng
- Ting, ting, taeng, taeng

1475
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:33,910
- Ting, taeng, frying pan
- Ting, taeng, frying pan

1476
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,410
- Vocal Queen, two.
- Vocal Queen, Vocal Queen.

1477
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,810
Enough Queen, one.

1478
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,530
Enough Queen.

1479
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:40,530
No ball, three.

1480
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,760
- No ball, no ball, no ball.
- Hey!

1481
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,830
(She attacks again
with the same method.)

1482
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,200
He's not "no balls!"

1483
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,700
What's wrong with you?

1484
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,300
Stop it, Ji Hyo!

1485
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,560
- I called for Nose King!
- Hey!

1486
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,200
Ji Hyo, you did that on purpose.

1487
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,240
It seems like you really
said that on purpose.

1488
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,510
- I clearly said Nose King!
- No, it was clearly no ball.

1489
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,350
- Ji Hyo.
- It means he's really "no balls."

1490
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,850
- She meant it.
- You can't attack him.

1491
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:03,220
- What was she supposed to say?
- She called him "no balls."

1492
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,050
But you responded to what she said.

1493
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,740
- What?
- Why would you respond to that?

1494
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,760
- I didn't mean to...
- But that's how it's supposed to...

1495
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,060
You made it sound so natural.

1496
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,310
- I heard it as Nose King.
- It's because you responded to it.

1497
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,330
No, no. That's not true.

1498
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:13,990
- You need to smile, Suk Jin.
- That's not true.

1499
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,990
(Laughing)

1500
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,990
(He maintains his character
by forcing his laughter.)

1501
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,830
- There you go!
- Okay!

1502
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,060
- It's your turn.
- Okay?

1503
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,220
(The mission ended with Ji Hyo
calling Suk Jin offensively.)

1504
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,330
- Her small remark...
- Everyone got caught on that.

1505
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,430
Here's the result.

1506
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:29,310
The result is the score based on
the scores you missed.

1507
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,080
Team Squirtle
got the most wrong answers.

1508
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,200
Oh, it's our team?

1509
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,120
- Oh, no.
- That's not possible.

1510
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:36,870
Jae Suk missed it a lot.

1511
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,780
- No, but I got only two wrong.
- If you think about it,

1512
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,120
he got a lot of them wrong.

1513
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,350
And Team Big Eyes
is in second place.

1514
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:43,490
Oh, we're in second place?

1515
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,680
Team Main Vocalist is
in first place.

1516
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,120
(The first place goes to
Team Main Vocalist.)

1517
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,780
- But this is...
- But...

1518
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,850
But we haven't included
the audio engineer's score.

1519
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,560
- That could be a game changer.
- While playing the game,

1520
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,800
he could've found
your voice annoying.

1521
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,100
He scored based on that?

1522
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,430
We asked how it was,

1523
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,910
and he said he knows
who's going last.

1524
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:59,930
- Really?
- Which team is it?

1525
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:04,030
The team with a high pitch
that couldn't be controlled...

1526
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,280
(The team that tortured
the audio engineer was...)

1527
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,780
Team Squirtle.

1528
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,220
(Team Squirtle is confirmed
to be in last place.)

1529
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,640
(Oh, no.)

1530
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,620
- She didn't realize it.
- No, I didn't.

1531
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,620
- The last team is Team Squirtle.
- But why us?

1532
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,580
We need to talk to
the audio engineer.

1533
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,430
- He's one funny guy.
- He was annoyed by our voices?

1534
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,160
- Come on.
- We tried really hard.

1535
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,530
You can't say that to someone
who's working hard.

1536
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,600
- But we are working hard too.
- He's working hard.

1537
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,890
He's annoyed by our voices.

1538
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,700
How could he say that? We've been
working together for so long.

1539
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,330
- I know.
- I'm a little disappointed.

1540
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,470
How could you say that?

1541
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,910
You shouldn't have said that.

1542
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,280
The audio engineer knows
what's right.

1543
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,370
- He really does.
- He knows what's right.

1544
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,640
- I mean...
- He's done this for a long time.

1545
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,200
- It's making me uncomfortable.
- You're being too harsh.

1546
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,910
There's a team the audio engineer...

1547
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,240
- gave a lot of scores to.
- Oh, really?

1548
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,720
The first place...

1549
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:47,910
goes to Team Big Eyes.

1550
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:48,910
(Team Big Eyes wins first place.)

1551
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,010
Thank you, Director.

1552
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,830
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1553
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,890
- Thank you for choosing us.
- Thank you.

1554
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,300
He picked your team because
he's a big fan of Yoo Na's.

1555
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,330
- What was that?
- You must love Yoo Na!

1556
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,930
This is how you score our teams?

1557
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,240
I like the audio engineer better.

1558
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,700
The winner of total scores
is Team Big Eyes.

1559
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,080
(The winner of total scores
is Team Big Eyes.)

1560
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,470
Team Main Vocalist
is in second place.

1561
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,740
Oh, no.

1562
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:14,280
- We're doing well.
- Okay.

1563
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:15,740
We'll cut for now.

1564
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,310
Please clap once.

1565
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:18,350
(Flinching)

1566
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,510
I'll clap. 1, 2...

1567
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,760
- You should let Min Young do it.
- Let Min Young do it.

1568
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,660
Come on. Don't act up.

1569
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,330
- It's not that.
- Stop acting up.

1570
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:27,120
Why do you think Min Young
is seated in the middle?

1571
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,660
- You said that to me!
- He only thinks of himself.

1572
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,890
You've been doing this for a decade.

1573
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,490
Min Young, please clap for us.

1574
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,930
- Stop it already.
- Stop it.

1575
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,030
I'll clap now.

1576
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:36,560
1, 2, 3.

1577
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,660
Doesn't this look so nice?

1578
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,410
- My goodness.
- It's all nice.

1579
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:42,600
Know when to budge in.

1580
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,470
Seriously, he just wants to
take all the roles.

1581
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:48,240
- Seriously.
- He acts up so much.

1582
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,410
Each team will pick a member
to go out first.

1583
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,810
Please leave out some.

1584
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,180
- You're in first place, right?
- Eun Ji.

1585
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,890
Yes, I'll leave some for you.

1586
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,390
Why did you put me in fourth place?

1587
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:59,390
I'm sorry, I'll put you
in first place next time.

1588
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,030
- Eun Ji, we have five left.
- Yes?

1589
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:02,100
Okay, we have five.

1590
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,700
I'll just take one.

1591
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,490
Shall I take everything?

1592
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,030
- Take as much as you want.
- I mean...

1593
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,200
(Team Main Vocalist has 5,
Team Big Eyes has 3.)

1594
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:12,410
(Big Eyes Queen took 3.)

1595
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:15,640
(She runs away after taking
3 out of 5.)

1596
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,370
I should take this.
I have no other choice.

1597
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,740
I'll just take one.

1598
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,470
(Each team earns 1 at least.)

1599
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:21,680
So Min, just take one.

1600
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,680
(She can't take off as it's been
long since she's done a good deed.)

1601
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,620
(They come inside after
taking the trophies.)

1602
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,680
What's this? It's our meal.

1603
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,120
(These are the ingredients
of gimbap.)

1604
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,180
It's our meal.

1605
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:34,930
What are all these?
These are for gimbap.

1606
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:36,100
- But...
- These are for gimbap.

1607
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,350
Take a look at them.

1608
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,300
"Today's lunch is gimbap."

1609
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,530
"Pick two ingredients
out of the ingredients available."

1610
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,030
"If your teammate brings
the same ingredient,"

1611
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,830
"you need to return it."

1612
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,370
We need to return it
if we have overlapping ingredients?

1613
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:47,430
(The team that leaves the most
side dishes will lose.)

1614
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:50,180
You can now pick the ingredient
you'd want in your gimbap.

1615
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,100
So we can pick two?

1616
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,700
You can pick two.

1617
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,810
I can pick two?

1618
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:58,280
I've been wanting to have gimbap
since yesterday.

1619
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,910
(The teams with the most ingredients
will be given more points.)

1620
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,280
Jong Kook will pick the eggs,

1621
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,890
and Haha will pick
the rice and hams.

1622
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:06,120
But I'm not sure what
Vocal Queen would pick.

1623
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,160
I'll pick two.

1624
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,390
(So Min picks rice and tuna
after some thought.)

1625
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,530
These are the two most
important ingredients.

1626
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,800
I'll pick ham.

1627
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,430
(Eun Ji picks rice and ham.)

1628
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,430
- Tuna!
- Okay.

1629
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,640
(Ji Hyo picks rice and tuna.)

1630
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,160
(Will they avoid
picking the same menu?)

1631
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,370
What's this? Is it rice?

1632
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:23,100
Oh, gosh. It's well-cooked.

1633
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,180
(The next to go are Jong Kook,
Jae Suk, and Yoo Na.)

1634
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,240
(They're done picking
their ingredients.)

1635
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,240
All right.

1636
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,700
- What's this?
- This is ours.

1637
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,140
Please go ahead.

1638
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,180
(The last members
pick their ingredients.)

1639
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,120
What did you pick?

1640
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:34,580
Min Young...

1641
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,780
- Oh, gosh...
- Yoo Jeong...

1642
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,220
Yoo Jeong, did you bring rice?

1643
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,120
- Oh, no!
- You couldn't have.

1644
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:40,850
You did well by bringing the tuna.

1645
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,600
- Really?
- We can have tuna as is.

1646
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,100
If the last member brings rice,
we can have it with these.

1647
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,800
It'd be perfect if she brings
rice and tuna.

1648
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,300
I'd be happy with
rice and pickled radish.

1649
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,470
Rice and tuna.

1650
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,240
It'd be delicious if we had tuna.

1651
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,560
- I know.
- Of course.

1652
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,330
- Of course.
- Like rice balls.

1653
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,810
- That'd be perfect.
- I know. You're right.

1654
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:59,100
We have the most important roles.

1655
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,450
- We're the most important ones.
- We're the core members.

1656
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,640
It's an important choice.

1657
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,970
It'd be possible to make gimbap
with just one more ingredient.

1658
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,490
I'll pick this.

1659
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,580
I'll pick this.

1660
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,680
I'm sure they have it.

1661
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,890
You can go inside now.

1662
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:14,720
For our points.

1663
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:17,930
Please...

1664
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,200
(They're here.)

1665
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,200
No, no.

1666
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,470
(Please bring us the rice.)

1667
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,060
I feel somewhat insecure.

1668
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,240
(Kwang Soo brought rice.)

1669
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,810
Kwang Soo brought it!

1670
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:30,580
- He brought rice!
- He really did!

1671
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,410
- Well done, Kwang Soo.
- You didn't get any?

1672
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,850
Okay!

1673
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:35,620
Well done!

1674
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,370
Well done in picking rice.

1675
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,490
I thought they'd overlap.

1676
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,140
- Please.
- Well done, Kwang Soo.

1677
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,680
No, no!

1678
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,310
(Haha picked rice as well.)

1679
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,350
Oh, gosh.

1680
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:48,490
I told you he'd bring rice next.

1681
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:51,490
I told you he'd bring rice
as though he used his brains.

1682
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:52,700
(They got a new kind of gimbap
that doesn't have any rice.)

1683
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,470
- We can't have it.
- Why did you...

1684
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,740
- My gosh.
- Why did you bring rice?

1685
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,800
I mean...

1686
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,930
Bear with that.

1687
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:01,530
(Suk Jin chooses the egg garnish
and clam meat.)

1688
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:02,780
You're lacking rice.

1689
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,530
- Why would you have this?
- Why are you eating alone?

1690
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,700
- In case they steal yours.
- I changed my mind.

1691
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,240
You both brought rice, so...

1692
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,120
Please remember this.

1693
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,950
- Please remember this, okay?
- Sure.

1694
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,910
- All right.
- I'm keeping it with you first.

1695
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,580
- Stop it. You're being ugly.
- That's not it.

1696
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:20,330
We'll evaluate the cleanliness,
attitude, and eating habits.

1697
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:21,890
Then the last place goes to
Team Squirtle Queen.

1698
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:22,890
The last place?

1699
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:24,030
My goodness.

1700
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,600
We have a chance of
winning first place!

1701
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,830
The rest of you...

1702
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,160
are tied for first place.

1703
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,060
We got first prize.

1704
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:31,430
I'm full.

1705
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,640
It's so fun.

1706
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,970
(The idols gathered
at the last mission place.)

1707
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,640
Oh, it's here.

1708
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,100
Oh, so we're going to be
covered in paint.

1709
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,410
Okay, I got this.

1710
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:41,910
(They distribute
the trophies beforehand.)

1711
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,220
- Here comes...
- I need to get these.

1712
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,120
Yoo Jeong.

1713
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,780
I'm the only one with no trophies.
You know that, right?

1714
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,680
(Pressured)

1715
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,680
You don't need to be pressured.

1716
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,600
Don't ever pick Kwang Soo.

1717
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,850
If I don't, I'll get the punishment.

1718
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,120
- Keep that in mind.
- Okay.

1719
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,700
Don't you think it'd be fun
for him to get the punishment?

1720
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,330
Hey, I'll take first place.

1721
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,600
- No, that's...
- We'll play rock-paper-scissors.

1722
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,910
You want to play
rock-paper-scissors?

1723
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:08,830
(Suk Jin has no trophies
has he's second-last to go.)

1724
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,910
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1725
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,680
Rock-paper-scissors!

1726
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,580
The winner decides it.

1727
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,780
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1728
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,280
Okay.

1729
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,550
The winner decides the order.

1730
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:19,680
Let's not do that.

1731
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,140
- Why did you...
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1732
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,720
- Okay.
- Yoo Na...

1733
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:25,430
You don't have to go first.

1734
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:26,890
- Okay, since we have five.
- That's right.

1735
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,120
I don't have any.

1736
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,300
- Be honest.
- I have nothing.

1737
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:34,100
Then we'll get in this order.
1, 2, 3, 4.

1738
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,160
I'm sorry.

1739
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,760
(He naturally got last place.)

1740
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:40,640
- I'm sorry.
- You aren't mistaken, are you?

1741
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,740
- We have decided.
- You aren't mistaken, are you?

1742
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,910
You didn't think wrong, did you?

1743
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,680
Tell me again. How shall we decide?

1744
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,850
Suk Jin got last place again?

1745
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,850
Let's not do that.
Let's not get greedy.

1746
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,580
Just because I don't get any,
it's not going to be funny.

1747
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,160
- I know.
- So let's make it heartwarming.

1748
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,720
- Sure.
- So I'll cry after finding four.

1749
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,030
Let's go in this direction.

1750
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,120
- Okay?
- Okay.

1751
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,830
We should...

1752
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,160
- Okay?
- Okay.

1753
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,120
(Listening to Suk Jin's directions
made him fall asleep.)

1754
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,200
Jae Suk! Don't do this!

1755
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,930
He seriously needs to see a doctor!

1756
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:14,030
- Why does he always fall asleep?
- You just came in!

1757
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:16,010
What's wrong with me?

1758
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,080
- What's wrong with you?
- You just came in.

1759
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,640
"What's wrong with me?"

1760
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,550
I just got so bored.

1761
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,720
(Everyone falls asleep as soon as
Big Nose starts to talk.)

1762
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,990
It's so funny how you faint.

1763
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,720
(I just dozed off.)

1764
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,330
Please tell us the order
your team decided.

1765
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:33,780
- We're deciding now?
- That's right.

1766
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,830
What shall we do, Yoo Jeong?

1767
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:37,330
- I'll take first place this time.
- Okay, you should do that.

1768
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:38,760
- You can take second place.
- Okay, I will.

1769
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,760
- That's right.
- Okay.

1770
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,660
Right.

1771
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,760
(But there's only 1 trophy.)

1772
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,530
Then let Kwang Soo take third place.

1773
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:48,310
It doesn't matter
whether I go 3rd or 4th!

1774
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,080
You can go ahead.

1775
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,640
The one who won first place
can go ahead.

1776
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,180
The rest of you, please stay behind.

1777
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,910
Hey, Yoo Na. Yoo Na.

1778
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,890
- I mean, but we...
- Yoo Na.

1779
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,350
Just leave two.

1780
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:03,410
- You can take two.
- That's right.

1781
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,160
I know what Yoo Na is like.

1782
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,330
I'm sure Yoo Na will take everything.

1783
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:08,430
(I'm sure Yoo Na
will take everything.)

1784
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,660
- She doesn't care about others.
- Yoo Na, are you the greedy one?

1785
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,260
- Come on.
- Yoo Na.

1786
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,530
You stuck your head in there.

1787
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,370
Hey. You just...

1788
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:18,700
Next.

1789
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,060
I'll just take one.

1790
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,260
- Don't fool us.
- I'm serious.

1791
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,140
All right. Go ahead.

1792
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,310
Okay.

1793
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,950
(The members of Brave Girls
took everything they could.)

1794
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,510
- All right, next.
- It's our turn.

1795
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,220
Why is he going second?

1796
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,490
You should just take one.

1797
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:35,240
There's nothing in here.

1798
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,950
- Why would you...
- She's using the bag.

1799
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,760
- Why is she...
- Are you ripping the whole thing?

1800
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:44,450
Are you all set? My goodness.

1801
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,430
I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

1802
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,200
I'm so sorry.

1803
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,100
You didn't have to go this far.

1804
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,830
(Current Number of Trophies)

1805
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,810
Here's the last mission.

1806
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,700
It's the last mission where you can
complete idol makeup.

1807
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,700
This is...

1808
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,970
It's called
Nice Makeup Running Salon.

1809
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,240
I see.

1810
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,410
The team playing offense will pick
two players to play dibidibidip.

1811
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:06,350
And two players to get the makeup.

1812
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,810
The 2 teams playing defense
will decide on 3 players to play.

1813
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,260
So when one team plays offense,

1814
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,490
the two defense teams
play against the other team.

1815
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,350
- You need to win to go on.
- I'm good at this.

1816
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:16,330
Each team will get to play twice.

1817
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:17,720
So every team will play six times.

1818
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,260
The team that beats everyone
the fastest...

1819
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,720
will get higher scores.

1820
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,830
The referees for this mission
are the four assistant directors.

1821
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:29,510
They'll give you points
based on how fun you make this.

1822
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:31,330
- We need a strategy.
- So we need to make it fun.

1823
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:33,970
- The four assistant directors?
- Yes, you know them, right?

1824
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,950
We'll make the actions
for dibidibidip...

1825
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:39,220
using the highlight dance moves
of "Rollin'."

1826
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,240
- Really?
- How?

1827
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,620
- The stingray dance.
- Oh, the stingray dance?

1828
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,220
(The stingray dance)

1829
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,830
The scarecrow dance.

1830
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,660
(The scarecrow dance)

1831
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,870
(The scarecrow dance)

1832
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,830
- And the floral cup dance.
- The floral cup dance?

1833
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:55,970
That's dibidibidip?

1834
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,970
(The floral cup dance)

1835
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:02,430
Dibidibidip, dibidibidip,
dibidibidip.

1836
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:03,810
That's correct.

1837
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:05,580
- She's good.
- Do you have to do it that way?

1838
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,870
- She's good.
- Do you have to?

1839
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:07,970
- Dibidibidip
- Do you have to?

1840
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,510
- You have to shake your hip.
- Why do you shake it so much?

1841
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:13,310
- That's how the dance is like.
- Why do you shake it so much?

1842
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:15,240
So Min is good with those moves.

1843
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:17,080
- So Min, show us how it's done.
- This is driving me crazy.

1844
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,950
Dibidibidip, dibidibidip,
dibidibidip.

1845
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:20,950
- Dibidibidip.
- She's good.

1846
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:23,450
- She's good.
- Why do you dance like that?

1847
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:27,260
That's what earns her
entertainment points.

1848
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,560
(Are you watching?)

1849
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,470
Who will play offense first?

1850
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:33,160
Are you good at this, Kwang Soo?

1851
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,330
I play this every day.

1852
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,310
- Every day?
- I'm serious.

1853
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:39,740
- Then let's try it. Ready, go.
- I'm an expert.

1854
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:41,180
Dibidibidip.

1855
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,080
(Wriggling)

1856
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,640
You should pose correctly.

1857
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,850
That was cool though.

1858
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:48,240
- Okay.
- Ready, go.

1859
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,310
Dibidibidip, dibidibidip,
dibidibidip.

1860
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:54,530
(This guy who loves cheating
is only thinking of cheating.)

1861
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,430
- Dibidibidip.
- Kwang Soo should play defense.

1862
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,720
I can't stop.

1863
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,100
You should remember
the entertainment points.

1864
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,060
Then Kwang Soo and Yoo Jeong
should play defense.

1865
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,800
Ji Hyo and I should play offense.

1866
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,100
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

1867
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,640
- You should win as fast as you can.
- Okay, I got it.

1868
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,640
Good luck!

1869
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,700
(Good luck!)

1870
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,080
All right.

1871
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:14,470
When I blow the whistle,
the conveyor belt will start moving.

1872
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,970
- We'll start in this direction.
- Okay.

1873
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,450
- He won't go past Se Chan.
- We need to win against them.

1874
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:21,620
- Okay.
- Since our points are at stake.

1875
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,680
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes.

1876
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,830
Guys, you need to keep the rhythm
of the original game though.

1877
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,160
You need to go like this.
Dibidibidip, dibidibidip.

1878
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,660
(The winner will be decided on
mission and entertainment points.)

1879
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,760
- We got this!
- Get ready.

1880
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,530
- Ready.
- I'll play this seriously.

1881
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,560
Dibidibidip!

1882
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:50,310
(The conveyor belt starts to move.)

1883
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,790
Dibidibidip!

1884
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:58,430
- Dibidibidip!
- Okay!

1885
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:59,460
(He succeeds in attacking 4 people
at a fast pace.)

1886
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:02,540
(Squirtle Queen is going past
the first phase.)

1887
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,960
- Dibidibidip!
- Okay!

1888
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,770
Dibidibidip! Dibidibidip!

1889
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:08,080
- Okay!
- Okay!

1890
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,210
Good job. Good work.

1891
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,600
(The conveyor belt stopped
at phase 2.)

1892
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,710
- What is that?
- Good work.

1893
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:15,980
(What is that?)

1894
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,180
- Seriously?
- Good work!

1895
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,080
He took ten seconds.

1896
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,020
(He only took 10 seconds!)

1897
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,080
Hey, good job.

1898
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:24,020
Good job, guys.

1899
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:26,160
(It's a big achievement they earned
without trying to make it fun.)

1900
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,680
- Now...
- I have no idea how I did that.

1901
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,700
- But this is...
- It wasn't fun because of him, no?

1902
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,330
- It wasn't fun at all.
- How did I pull that off?

1903
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,460
You made it so boring.

1904
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,770
It wasn't fun at all.
What's wrong with you?

1905
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:35,500
- That's not it.
- You did well.

1906
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,160
You didn't do your part.

1907
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:38,500
- Yoo Jeong, well done.
- What was that?

1908
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,910
- Hey.
- But everyone lost at least once.

1909
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,730
Kwang Soo, you got zero
entertainment points.

1910
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,910
- You got zero points.
- Then what was I supposed to do?

1911
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:47,370
What was I supposed to do?
They lost at once.

1912
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:48,520
You should've taken it easy.

1913
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,180
You should've gone like,
dibidibidip, Dibidibidip.

1914
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,310
- Don't pay him for today.
- You guys are being harsh.

1915
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:54,750
- You did well.
- What was I supposed to do?

1916
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,390
You lost in one cue.

1917
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,660
Don't you know how it goes?

1918
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,850
- I know. It was too fast.
- What do you mean?

1919
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:02,230
- Right. I couldn't enjoy it.
- You should've done it like this.

1920
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:03,460
You were too fast.

1921
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,120
What was I supposed to do
when everyone lost at once?

1922
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,430
You scared everyone off.

1923
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:07,430
All right.

1924
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,460
- Let's do it again.
- I'm not good at it though.

1925
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:10,770
- I believe in you!
- Do what you're good at.

1926
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:12,430
- Min Young...
- Just make it fun.

1927
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:13,600
You can do it, So Min!

1928
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:17,080
All right. Don't go too fast.

1929
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,500
- Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.
- This is...

1930
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,520
- Dibidibidip.
- Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip...

1931
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,680
- No, no. That's not it.
- Dibidibidip...

1932
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,350
- Dibidibidip...
- No, no.

1933
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:25,790
- Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip...
- You can't do that.

1934
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,640
- Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.
- Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

1935
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,750
- Dibidibidip.
- All right. 1, 2.

1936
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:34,580
- Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.
- Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

1937
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,390
(The trainee doesn't quite follow.)

1938
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,370
(The culture center lesson
earns her an entertainment point.)

1939
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,160
- Let's do this.
- Let's start.

1940
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,430
Ready.

1941
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:42,500
(It's Team Main Vocalist's turn!)

1942
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,600
Set.

1943
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:47,960
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

1944
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,230
- Dibidibidip.
- Good job!

1945
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:53,710
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

1946
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:55,250
Didn't I get you? Dibidibidip.

1947
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,640
Dibidibidip. Didn't I get you?

1948
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,210
(The trainee shows off special moves
he created.)

1949
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:03,960
(He tries to earn his entertainment
points although it's too late.)

1950
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,250
- Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.
- You're doing so well, Kwang Soo!

1951
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,660
So Min!

1952
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:09,560
Oh, no, So Min.

1953
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,560
(While So Min is handling
the special moves,)

1954
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,430
- So Min!
- Dibidibidip.

1955
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,460
(Vocal Queen is going through
the color makeup phase.)

1956
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,140
(I'm passing by.)

1957
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:18,870
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.
Dibidibidip.

1958
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:19,870
(Confused)

1959
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:22,910
(Bang!)

1960
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:23,980
What was that?

1961
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,540
- It popped.
- A feather gun went off.

1962
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,870
- My goodness.
- My gosh.

1963
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:31,040
- A feather gun went off.
- Oh, no!

1964
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,140
- Well done.
- It looks great.

1965
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:34,850
- You look good.
- That's so cool.

1966
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:36,210
You earned entertainment points.

1967
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:38,060
- She earned entertainment points.
- Oh, right.

1968
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,520
- It's actually pretty.
- It looks really good.

1969
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:40,890
- You look pretty.
- It's like a musical.

1970
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:43,230
- She earned entertainment points.
- It's looking really good.

1971
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,250
You look so cool.

1972
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,500
Here, look at this camera.

1973
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,430
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

1974
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:49,430
- Dibidibidip.
- Dibidibidip.

1975
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:50,700
Darn it!

1976
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,160
My goodness.

1977
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,430
Our team is a total mess.

1978
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:56,410
- It's Ji Hyo?
- It's been so long though.

1979
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,410
I don't think Ji Hyo can
pass through everyone here.

1980
01:05:58,410 --> 01:05:59,980
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

1981
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,980
Let's stand over there.

1982
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,620
- I should stand here.
- Dibidibidip.

1983
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:05,140
It should go like this.
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

1984
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:06,350
(They slowly come up with moves
to earn entertainment points.)

1985
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,160
There you go. You're doing great.

1986
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,060
- You got this, Ji Hyo!
- You're doing great!

1987
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,160
(Earning 1 entertainment point)

1988
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,480
(Make a fuss and exaggerate
to earn entertainment points.)

1989
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,480
There you go!

1990
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,790
It's been so long since
I saw the Macarena dance!

1991
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,890
Isn't that the Macarena?

1992
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:20,460
(She's ecstatic.)

1993
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:23,960
I can imitate Squirtle Queen
while I dance, right?

1994
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,000
- Squirtle Queen?
- What do you mean?

1995
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:29,730
When did I make that face?

1996
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:31,480
- He looks like you.
- Hey.

1997
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,640
- She doesn't look like this.
- What do you mean?

1998
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,710
Squirtle Queen
doesn't look like this.

1999
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:37,980
Isn't this what she does?

2000
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,020
(He's the reason the soldiers'
fighting power declined.)

2001
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:40,950
Get ready.

2002
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:41,960
(The fake Squirtle Queen
is ready too.)

2003
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,310
- Let's do this!
- You can do this!

2004
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,230
Se Chan, I'll keep repeating
the floral cup dance.

2005
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:49,120
(Ji Hyo makes a deal.)

2006
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,230
Set.

2007
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:52,520
(She will earn entertainment points
at Kwang Soo's expense.)

2008
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,160
- Dibidibidip.
- Let's go.

2009
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,290
- Dibidibidip.
- Dibidibidip.

2010
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:56,430
- Dibidibidip.
- That's good.

2011
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:57,600
(She promised to do
only the floral cup dance!)

2012
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:59,830
(He is clueless.)

2013
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,730
- Dibidibidip.
- Dibidibidip.

2014
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:03,930
Gosh, you got me.

2015
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:05,080
- Move on.
- Come here.

2016
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:08,100
(She goes slowly.)

2017
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,270
Dibidibidip.

2018
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:11,540
Dibidibidip. Why isn't it working?

2019
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:12,540
- Dibidibidip.
- What?

2020
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:13,910
Why are you going after a beat?

2021
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:15,250
- You are done. Move on.
- Dibidibidip.

2022
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,680
Dibidibidip.

2023
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:17,750
- You are done. Move on.
- Ji Hyo!

2024
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:19,750
- You are done.
- Ji Hyo, hang in there!

2025
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:20,850
Dibidibidip.

2026
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:21,960
Ji Hyo, hang in there!

2027
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,330
(Kwang Soo is getting
a face full of makeup.)

2028
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:26,520
- You are done. Move on.
- Ji Hyo!

2029
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,370
(Colorful)

2030
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:29,560
Ji Hyo, hang in there!

2031
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,700
- Ji Hyo, hang in there!
- Dibidibidip.

2032
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,140
- Dibidibidip.
- Let's go!

2033
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,270
(She takes her time
in front of the Squirtle King.)

2034
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:34,910
Let's go!

2035
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:37,140
(The feather gun goes off!)

2036
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:39,600
(As Ji Hyo planned,
the attack fails!)

2037
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,710
That was great.

2038
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:41,910
- Yes!
- That was great.

2039
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,450
- That was perfect.
- Too bad.

2040
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,020
- Listen.
- Ji Hyo.

2041
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,950
- Even when she succeeded...
- That was perfect.

2042
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,850
Someone... Hold on.

2043
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,660
Someone reached out and slapped me.

2044
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,480
- That was perfect.
- I got slapped.

2045
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,290
- That was perfect.
- You look so ugly.

2046
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:58,370
- The makeup has been applied well.
- Do you know what's scary?

2047
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,290
I think I met eyes with someone.

2048
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,830
- No.
- This is...

2049
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:03,160
(I definitely met eyes
with someone.)

2050
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,460
- I met eyes with someone.
- No.

2051
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,660
- You are an animal, right?
- What?

2052
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:08,370
- You aren't a human being.
- An ostrich.

2053
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:09,600
You are an animal.

2054
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,430
- Why does my cheek hurt?
- You look cool.

2055
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,870
You look pretty.

2056
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:14,500
There is no way
you met eyes with someone.

2057
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,620
It's like "Cats."

2058
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,980
Your eyes became bigger.

2059
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,210
- There are feathers too.
- The next team.

2060
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,140
- Okay.
- I can see the feathers.

2061
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,560
I will stand next to Squirtle Queen.

2062
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,660
Why? If you stand
next to Squirtle Queen...

2063
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:26,750
(Squirtle King approaches
Squirtle Queen.)

2064
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,660
Hey. Is that supposed to be
her facial expression?

2065
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,670
When did she make
that facial expression?

2066
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,060
He is good.

2067
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,630
(The middle-aged Squirtle gets
all the entertainment points.)

2068
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:38,760
He looks cute.

2069
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,430
Okay.

2070
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,010
Get ready.

2071
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:44,540
(Suk Jin and Yoo Na go next!)

2072
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:46,340
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

2073
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,910
- Okay. Dibidibidip.
- He is advancing.

2074
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,950
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

2075
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,220
(Squirtle Queen defends herself
pretty well.)

2076
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,250
- She is good.
- Dibidibidip.

2077
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,510
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

2078
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,550
(Standing still)

2079
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,590
Why won't you do it?

2080
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,380
(He has no intention to play
the game.)

2081
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,760
What are you doing?

2082
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,520
- What is that?
- Why aren't you playing the game?

2083
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,330
- Why aren't you playing the game?
- Dibidibidip.

2084
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:09,630
(The game ends!)

2085
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:12,010
- Jae Suk, why didn't you play?
- Seriously.

2086
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:14,970
- You should have played.
- I forgot.

2087
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:16,470
- Did you forget?
- I forgot.

2088
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:17,840
- I see.
- I forgot the dance moves.

2089
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,670
- It's understandable.
- Jae Suk, you get a warning.

2090
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:20,880
Where did her face go?

2091
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:23,050
Where did Yoo Na go?

2092
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,770
Where did Yoo Na go?

2093
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:26,090
How did this happen?

2094
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:27,310
- Here comes a member of "Cats."
- Hey.

2095
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,180
- Can you see?
- It's like a masquerade.

2096
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,660
- It's like "Cats."
- Can you see?

2097
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,380
- No.
- Midnight

2098
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,130
Seriously.

2099
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,830
- The feathers landed on her face.
- This is unbelievable.

2100
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,630
The feathers landed on her face.

2101
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:40,560
The two of you are like
the members of "Cats."

2102
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:41,970
Suk Jin, come over here.

2103
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,090
- Where?
- You need to play the game.

2104
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:45,210
Okay.

2105
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:47,510
Why does Suk Jin keep trying
to get out of it?

2106
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:48,670
Suk Jin.

2107
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:50,910
- I played the game so much.
- Why did you become exhausted?

2108
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:51,910
I played the game so much.

2109
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:53,170
- Should there be six people?
- Yes.

2110
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:54,970
You have to play the game.

2111
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:56,120
Okay. We have to play the game.

2112
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,220
Dibidibidip.

2113
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,790
- That's cheating!
- Okay, okay.

2114
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:01,090
(They fail in the end
because of Foul King!)

2115
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:03,260
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.
Dibidibidip.

2116
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:06,180
(Ji Hyo and Yoo Jeong
of Team Squirtle fail as well!)

2117
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:08,260
Team Squirtle is done.

2118
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:09,660
- Really?
- The other two teams should go.

2119
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:11,830
- Okay.
- It's our turn, right?

2120
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,500
The leader will decide
which members will go.

2121
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,970
As for our team,
the leader will decide.

2122
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,700
I will go,

2123
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,730
- so give me a few trophies.
- What?

2124
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:21,670
- It's up to the leader.
- No, no.

2125
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:22,730
It's up to the leader.

2126
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:24,270
- It's up to the leader.
- I think she will pick me.

2127
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,300
She keeps looking at me.

2128
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,670
Just accept your fate.

2129
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,310
Don't do it. Don't pick me.

2130
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:31,080
Don't pick me.

2131
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,590
It's up to the leader, right?

2132
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,420
- Yes.
- Let me take a trophy.

2133
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,290
Overcome it!

2134
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:37,380
Good luck!

2135
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,420
I don't have a single trophy.

2136
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:42,160
Suk Jin's turtleneck top
will be dyed prettily.

2137
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:44,160
That's good. He still has it.

2138
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,760
- Mr. Turtleneck Top.
- He still has it.

2139
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,020
(Mr. Turtleneck Top
shows off his energy.)

2140
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,540
- He still has it.
- Let's go.

2141
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:49,840
Live a long life! Live a long life!

2142
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,590
Who will do this?
Will you be my partner?

2143
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:52,970
- I will be your partner.
- Make sure you succeed.

2144
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:54,710
- He still has it.
- What is this?

2145
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,910
- Suk Jin.
- You imitated Song Chang Sik.

2146
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,510
Suk Jin, I will go really fast.

2147
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:00,450
- Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.
- He still has it.

2148
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,840
Suk Jin still has it.

2149
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,920
Let's get ready to laugh.

2150
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,250
Hey!

2151
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,810
Hey! Why are you adding paint?

2152
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:10,120
Gosh, they are adding more paint.

2153
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,260
Hey!

2154
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:12,680
There is enough. Listen.

2155
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,180
- This is incredible.
- There is enough.

2156
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,350
- What is up with you?
- I am surprised to see them...

2157
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:19,670
- move in unison.
- Stop it.

2158
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:21,390
- They are passionate.
- Hey.

2159
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:23,040
You don't need to work so hard.

2160
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,970
You won't get paid more!

2161
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,010
- Hey.
- My goodness.

2162
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:28,100
It's fine.

2163
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,910
They added so much paint.

2164
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,230
- Everyone knows...
- They added so much paint.

2165
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:32,410
- that it will be funny.
- Seriously.

2166
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,100
- It might not even open.
- It will be funny.

2167
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,270
(It's closed shut with paint.)

2168
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,810
- Will it open?
- It might not even open.

2169
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:39,840
Gosh.

2170
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,590
- Hold on. I will take off my socks.
- Good luck.

2171
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,590
- He is taking off his socks.
- Let me be first place this time.

2172
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,120
- Let me be first place this time.
- Seriously.

2173
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,630
All right.

2174
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,350
Let me be first place this time.

2175
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,630
I am doing this much.

2176
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:51,630
- I will think about it.
- Come on!

2177
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:53,020
- Good luck!
- You never know.

2178
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:54,870
Suk Jin, I will do this speedily...

2179
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,560
- for real.
- This is nerve-wracking.

2180
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:57,870
- Suk Jin.
- How else...

2181
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:59,730
- were you going to do it?
- I am getting so many thoughts.

2182
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,300
All right.

2183
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,580
(It's Team Big Eyes' last chance.
How will the round go?)

2184
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:03,710
All right.

2185
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:05,270
Get ready.

2186
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:07,340
Get ready.

2187
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:08,750
I will keep doing this.

2188
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:12,620
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.
Dibidibidip.

2189
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:13,880
- Hey!
- Dibidibidip.

2190
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,350
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.
Dibidibidip.

2191
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:18,160
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

2192
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,260
- Hey! Do it properly.
- Dibidibidip.

2193
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:21,090
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

2194
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:23,850
(He recreates the dance.)

2195
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,830
(From Tae Kwon Do...)

2196
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:29,340
(to breakdancing)

2197
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:32,670
(It's a match
between a spear and a shield.)

2198
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:34,970
Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.

2199
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:36,880
(Meanwhile,
Suk Jin gets painted prettily.)

2200
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,080
Oh, no.

2201
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,950
(Thick)

2202
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,770
(When the dancers run out of ideas,)

2203
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:46,840
(the game ends!)

2204
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,140
Suk Jin, that's too bad.

2205
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,850
What is he going to do?

2206
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,960
I could see his moves.

2207
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,220
I couldn't win.

2208
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,160
You guys shouldn't have done that.

2209
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,330
- I couldn't win.
- That's no way to treat a senior.

2210
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,630
Seriously.

2211
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,060
(Here comes the senior.)

2212
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,890
Hey, you. Come here.

2213
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,470
Hey.

2214
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:04,930
I will scold them.

2215
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:06,430
Kwang Soo, come here.

2216
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,840
They made everyone uncomfortable.

2217
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,910
- Come here.
- Guys.

2218
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:12,010
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Hey.

2219
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:14,080
- Why did you play around...
- I am sorry.

2220
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,050
- while this was happening to him?
- I am sorry.

2221
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:18,420
I know it was for a show,
but it's still unforgivable.

2222
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:19,790
I was trying to make it funny.

2223
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:21,880
Let go of me. Hey!

2224
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,120
(He probably has
an angry facial expression.)

2225
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,550
I was trying to make it funny.

2226
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:27,550
Let go of me. Hey.

2227
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:28,700
Let go of me.

2228
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,460
That's no way to treat a senior.

2229
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:31,720
- Hey.
- You can treat me that way.

2230
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,500
But Suk Jin is a different matter.
Come to your senses.

2231
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,670
- Hey.
- He was born in 1966.

2232
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:38,730
- Hey.
- He is 56 years old.

2233
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:40,430
- But you guys...
- I am the one who is angry.

2234
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:41,540
Let go of me.

2235
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:45,080
- That's no way to treat a senior.
- I understand.

2236
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:46,640
Suk Jin, I will tell them.

2237
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,910
I... Hey!

2238
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,550
I won't do it again.

2239
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:52,840
- Don't do it again.
- Okay.

2240
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,120
Suk Jin, I talked to them.

2241
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,290
Let's go!

2242
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:56,660
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2243
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:57,850
Let's laugh about it!

2244
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,980
Let's laugh about it!

2245
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

2246
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,300
This is... Hey.

2247
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,960
- Okay.
- Jae Suk.

2248
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,370
- You scolded them, right?
- That's right.

2249
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,000
I scolded them until they teared up.

2250
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,670
- I won't do it again!
- I am sorry.

2251
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,060
- I won't do it again.
- They teared up.

2252
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,630
It's so nice
to see Jae Suk step up.

2253
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:17,770
- Jae Suk thinks dearly of him.
- It's heartwarming.

2254
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,950
- Despite the camera, I had to.
- It's heartwarming.

2255
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:22,640
The way they treated Suk Jin
made me so angry.

2256
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,080
- I know.
- I talked to them.

2257
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,120
Good job.

2258
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,950
I almost turned things upside down.

2259
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,220
- I did it for you.
- Jae Suk.

2260
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,480
Get your acts straight!

2261
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:31,880
I am sorry.

2262
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,880
- I am sorry.
- He is so funny.

2263
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,330
- For goodness' sake.
- I am sorry.

2264
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:36,630
The last round remains.

2265
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:38,520
- Dibidibidip. Dibidibidip.
- Okay!

2266
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,870
- Dibidibidip.
- Okay!

2267
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:40,890
(Team Main Vocalist fails!)

2268
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:42,700
Okay.

2269
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:45,600
After I announce the final results,

2270
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,930
the trophies will be distributed
one last time.

2271
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,910
Firstly, the mission points
follow the records.

2272
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:52,140
- That's good.
- Okay.

2273
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:53,510
- 20 points.
- We placed 1st, right?

2274
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:56,080
Then there are
the entertainment points.

2275
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,140
- I bet our score is high.
- Our score would be high too.

2276
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,620
- Our score would be high too.
- Look at my face.

2277
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,750
We were on another level.

2278
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:02,090
(Team Big Eyes, Team Squirtle,
Team Main Vocalist)

2279
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:03,090
Suk Jin made everyone laugh.

2280
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:04,290
There we go.

2281
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,350
- There we go.
- Thank you.

2282
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:08,590
It's a high score.

2283
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:09,920
(What will be
Team Squirtle's total?)

2284
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:11,350
It's a high score.

2285
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:13,330
(Team Squirtle)

2286
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:14,870
- Okay.
- That's good.

2287
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:16,890
- We are currently first place.
- We did well too.

2288
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,100
- We are currently first place.
- We did well too.

2289
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,540
Let's see.

2290
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,100
(Team Main Vocalist)

2291
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,130
(Team Squirtle places 1st
and wins 5 trophies.)

2292
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:25,270
Yes!

2293
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,910
(Team Squirtle places 1st
and wins 5 trophies.)

2294
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:28,100
Yes!

2295
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,580
It's okay.

2296
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,140
We placed third.

2297
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:32,420
(It's time to take the trophies.)

2298
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:33,680
Please decide on the order
within the team.

2299
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,380
The leader will decide
through rock-paper-scissors.

2300
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,050
That's the leader's decision.

2301
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:39,220
Suk Jin keeps saying
that they will be criticized.

2302
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,180
- You guys will be criticized.
- What are you talking about?

2303
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:42,420
This is a variety show.

2304
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,200
- Why would they be criticized?
- I don't mind.

2305
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,590
- Let people criticize us.
- Why would they be criticized?

2306
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:46,720
She doesn't mind. Let's just play...

2307
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,590
- rock-paper-scissors.
- I am just worried about them.

2308
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:50,000
Just win in rock-paper-scissors.

2309
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,130
Just win.

2310
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:52,210
Rock-paper-scissors.

2311
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:54,230
(They play rock-paper-scissors
and Suk Jin actually wins.)

2312
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:56,010
Okay! I won.

2313
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,930
- Really?
- That's no fun.

2314
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:01,080
(After winning,
he suddenly slaps the ostrich.)

2315
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,250
What was that?

2316
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:04,770
- Hey.
- Why...

2317
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:06,790
- Why did you slap him?
- Why did you slap him?

2318
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,420
- Why...
- I just wanted to slap him.

2319
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,290
- Why did you slap him?
- Did you slap him?

2320
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:13,720
You were ridiculing me
with your face.

2321
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,920
I was just standing here
with a blank face.

2322
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,390
I was feeling bad for you.

2323
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:18,920
You were ridiculing me.

2324
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,170
Why did you slap him?

2325
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,420
You looked at me
as if you were ridiculing me.

2326
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,890
I was just looking.

2327
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:24,130
For goodness' sake.

2328
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,060
The next team.

2329
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:27,170
As for us,

2330
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:29,410
- I will go first this time as well.
- Do what you want.

2331
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:31,170
- Again?
- Yes.

2332
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,010
- Hold on. Don't you have a trophy?
- I do.

2333
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,600
Then what is your problem?

2334
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,750
Your words are too rough.

2335
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,080
How could you talk to her like that?

2336
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,620
She is simply doing her best.

2337
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,010
Isn't this our last chance?

2338
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:42,380
- Isn't this our last chance?
- Yes, it is.

2339
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:46,550
- The first members will begin.
- Okay.

2340
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:47,630
(They take the trophies
according to the order.)

2341
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:49,590
- Go over there.
- The first members.

2342
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:52,700
(The current prize candidates
and penalty candidates)

2343
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:56,560
(But the last distribution
could change the final rankings!)

2344
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,170
It's time to count the trophies.

2345
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:00,430
- Okay.
- I don't have many.

2346
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:01,560
So Min.

2347
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,210
I have three.

2348
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:04,840
(So Min of Team Main Vocalist)

2349
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,300
You took one each.

2350
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:07,470
Jong Kook, you are next.

2351
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:09,450
- I have 2.
- You have 2.

2352
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,970
I might not get a penalty.

2353
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,380
- Haha.
- I have two.

2354
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:14,480
- Really?
- Two.

2355
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:18,050
How many does Min Young have?

2356
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,590
- Min Young.
- It's hard for her to count them.

2357
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:20,590
(She has so many trophies.)

2358
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,660
- Min Young was relaxed.
- Did you give one?

2359
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:23,850
(How does she have so many?)

2360
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:24,850
She has so many.

2361
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:28,870
You should be the winner today.

2362
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:31,300
- 4... 7.
- 7.

2363
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:32,760
Seven?

2364
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,430
I have seven.

2365
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,930
Min Young, that's incredible.

2366
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,080
Ji Hyo.

2367
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,130
I have three.

2368
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,380
Jae Suk.

2369
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:40,640
- I have two.
- What?

2370
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,170
- Two?
- Kwang Soo.

2371
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:43,450
- One?
- I don't have any.

2372
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,050
You don't have any?

2373
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:46,420
- Oh, no.
- He will get the penalty.

2374
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:47,550
He will get the penalty.

2375
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,180
- Yoo Jeong.
- I have six.

2376
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:50,460
Six.

2377
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:51,680
Min Young will win.

2378
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:53,380
- Go ahead.
- Five.

2379
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,960
She has a lot.

2380
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,090
Eun Ji.

2381
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:57,200
Four.

2382
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,500
Eun Ji has four.

2383
01:17:58,660 --> 01:17:59,970
- Se Chan.
- I have three.

2384
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,890
- Suk Jin.
- I have three too.

2385
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,500
- 3?
- Having 2 puts you at risk.

2386
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,370
- Having 2 puts you at risk.
- You lose if you have 2.

2387
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:06,560
1 or 2.

2388
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,300
First place is Min Young.

2389
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,100
(1st place is Min Young,
Vocal Queen.)

2390
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,170
2nd place is Yoo Jeong
with 6 trophies.

2391
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:15,470
3rd place is Yoo Na with 5 trophies.

2392
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:17,420
Brave Girls took all the trophies.

2393
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:21,010
The prize is
a variety of supplements...

2394
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:23,960
that are good
for idol singers' fatigue.

2395
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,380
Thank you.

2396
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2397
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,850
(They take the supplements
for fatigue.)

2398
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:30,500
The bottom three members
will get the penalty.

2399
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,330
Kwang Soo will get the penalty
for sure.

2400
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,890
Since 3 people have 2 trophies,
they will play rock-paper-scissors.

2401
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:36,130
Jong Kook, Jae Suk, and Haha.

2402
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:37,170
Rock-paper-scissors?

2403
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,410
Only one person will be spared.

2404
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,540
There is only one opening.

2405
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:42,910
Is it to go
through the conveyor belt?

2406
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:44,100
- I will tell you afterward.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2407
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,010
- What could it be?
- I want to avoid the penalty.

2408
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:48,050
- All right.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2409
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:51,050
(Who will be the one person
to be spared from the penalty?)

2410
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,810
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2411
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,960
(Jae Suk wins.)

2412
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,680
(He keeps his face clean
and avoids the penalty.)

2413
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,180
- Jae Suk.
- Did you win?

2414
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:01,350
Did you win?

2415
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,700
No way. Why is it my teammates?

2416
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,920
Okay!

2417
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,090
I won.

2418
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:07,090
I accept the result.

2419
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:08,260
Here is the penalty of the day.

2420
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,260
- There are three buckets.
- I feel bad.

2421
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:13,670
One bucket has black paint.

2422
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:14,970
Oh, no.

2423
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:16,170
One bucket has water.

2424
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:18,100
One bucket has confetti.

2425
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:19,770
You need to get the one
with confetti.

2426
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:21,950
I will get that one.

2427
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:24,310
- Confetti.
- Water wouldn't be so bad.

2428
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:25,310
(Who will have the worst ending?)

2429
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:27,420
Kwang Soo, we need to survive this.

2430
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:28,640
- Okay.
- This is incredible.

2431
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,290
1, 2, 3. This seat is for number 1.

2432
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:33,460
Pick a seat and sit down.

2433
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:35,020
- We need to choose.
- Number three.

2434
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,260
(They sit in front of the bucket
of their choice.)

2435
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,460
Did you pick a seat?

2436
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:39,520
(The result)

2437
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,670
(Jong Kook is 3, Haha is 2,
and Kwang Soo is 1.)

2438
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:42,020
You made your choice.

2439
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:45,910
I sat here from the start.

2440
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,840
I am dirty anyway.

2441
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,630
We will open the buckets.

2442
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,880
Open them.

2443
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,380
(They open the buckets.)

2444
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:56,510
(Startled)

2445
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:00,010
On the count of three,
pour the contents over their heads.

2446
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,480
One.

2447
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,480
(Jong Kook wants to go home
in a dry state.)

2448
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,520
Two.

2449
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,680
(The other two want to avoid
the black paint.)

2450
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,830
Two.

2451
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,830
(Which bucket contains
black paint?)

2452
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:11,890
Three.

2453
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:17,560
(The ones who got water and confetti
are relieved.)

2454
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,060
- Thank goodness!
- That was fascinating.

2455
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,410
(As usual,
Kwang Soo had the worst luck.)

2456
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:25,010
My goodness.

2457
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:26,840
(They get to see
Kwang Soo's bad luck in person.)

2458
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,910
That was fascinating.

2459
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:29,750
That was fascinating.

2460
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,450
- Thank goodness.
- Thank goodness.

2461
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:32,550
(Jong Kook and Haha are happy
that they avoided the worst.)

2462
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:33,640
Thank goodness.

2463
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,920
(This crow got his makeup done
until the very end.)

2464
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,260
Thank goodness.

2465
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,920
(Confetti service)

2466
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,630
I got so lucky.

2467
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,090
Let's hear a few words
from Brave Girls.

2468
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:45,350
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

2469
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:48,130
The situation is a bit messy
to hear their words.

2470
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,130
I am sure they had fun.

2471
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,710
We made them a mess.

2472
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:54,260
Kwang Soo, I am sorry.
Would you move out of the way?

2473
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:57,540
(Kwang Soo is a crow
that needs to be removed.)

2474
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:00,140
How was it today? Go ahead, Yoo Na.

2475
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,270
It was really nice to have
a great experience today.

2476
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:04,920
- So...
- Who are you?

2477
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,950
Hello, I am Yoo Na of Brave Girls.

2478
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:08,310
You are Yoo Na.

2479
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:12,160
- Bobbed-hair Queen.
- Bobbed-hair Queen.

2480
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,680
I had so much fun.

2481
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,630
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2482
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:18,720
Thank you.

2483
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,020
(We thank Min Young, Yoo Jeong,
Eun Ji, and Yoo Na.)

2484
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,890
(When a warlike day ends,)

2485
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:25,000
(another war starts in the form
of the evening rush hour.)

2486
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:30,880
(What if you could decide
the fate...)

2487
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,670
(on the road?)

2488
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:33,770
(Mapo)

2489
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:36,950
(People who live near Mapo
including Cho Sae Ho)

2490
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:38,220
(Gangnam)

2491
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,810
(People who live near Gangnam
including Choa)

2492
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:45,090
(If you mess up, going home
will take an hour and a half.)

2493
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:47,090
(A war for a faster route home
began.)

2494
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:51,260
(Read the following abbreviation.)

2495
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:53,500
(Ha Dream, turn off the TV!)

2496
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,090
(Let's go to Gangnam.)

2497
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,200
(Read the following abbreviation.)

2498
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,040
(Ji Ho, turn off the TV!)

2499
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,760
(This is how hard I work!)

2500
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:05,470
(When they fail the mission,
they go to the other team's area.)

2501
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:07,580
(10 minutes...)

2502
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,970
(or 1 and half hours?)

2503
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:12,380
(Which team will get to avoid
the evening rush hour?)

2504
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:15,340
(The Sweet and Scary Way Home)
