1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,820
Shall we?
I wish I were heading home instead.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,950
(It's somewhere in Yongsan
on a spring day.)

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,390
- Hello.
- Why is this so short?

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,820
- It's good to see you again.
- What did you say?

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,850
- Good morning.
- Did you hear what Hyo Im said?

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,500
- What?
- "Why is this so short?"

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,370
Hey, what did you say?

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,530
- As soon as you saw him...
- You look cool.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,030
Let us do things like that.

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,030
I'm sure he heard her,
but he pretended he didn't hear it.

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,940
- Come here.
- Why would you meddle in?

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,870
Let her say what she wants to say.

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,080
Hyo Im, you should also
say things like...

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,870
"Why is he so old?"

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,620
- "His mouth sticks out."
- "He's too tall."

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,910
"His gums are sticking out."

20
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,910
- "He has a protruding mouth."
- "He's too short."

21
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,050
- Say that yourself.
- Hello.

22
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,120
Jong Kook is not wearing
leggings today!

23
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,220
He took them off.

24
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,330
Summer is finally coming.

25
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,380
- Summer is here.
- Hello.

26
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,260
- Yesterday, we went...
- You're a sportsman.

27
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,370
We met at a wedding ceremony.
I hosted the wedding,

28
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,040
- And he sang?
- and he sang there.

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,540
- Yes, we did.
- You're like a duo.

30
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,060
You should wear a jacket
to a wedding ceremony.

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,680
I went to the wedding
wearing a turtleneck sweater.

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,740
It was like...

33
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,350
I asked Jong Kook to sing,
and he came out like this.

34
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,540
(Swaggering)

35
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,120
Like Terminator.

36
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,990
(He showed up
with his bulging muscles.)

37
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,050
He wasn't even wearing a jacket.

38
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,460
He was just wearing
a black turtleneck sweater.

39
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,230
"I hope you will be happy."

40
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,050
And he left like this.

41
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,230
- My gosh. So I was...
- People in the hall...

42
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,930
- I was embarrassed. So I told him.
- It's hilarious.

43
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,840
"You should wear a jacket
next time you attend a wedding."

44
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,870
(All right.)

45
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,600
I knew what you meant.

46
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,270
You agreed.

47
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,880
He admitted his mistake quickly.

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,540
- Jong Kook is getting tougher.
- My gosh.

49
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,440
- Oh dear.
- Suk Jin.

50
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,540
I heard you called Bo Pil
after the shoot last week.

51
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,820
Did I? I actually call him often.

52
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
- Why?
- We solved quizzes the other day.

53
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,430
The episode of Yoo Grand Award
and Kim Grand Award.

54
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,760
What about it?

55
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,400
(They solved various quizzes
in episode 547.)

56
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,900
What about it?

57
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,690
- This is a true story.
- What happened?

58
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,900
- He called Bo Pil.
- And?

59
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,170
Suk Jin thought he answered
most of the quizzes,

60
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,580
so he asked Bo Pil
to make him look smart.

61
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,180
He said it would be funny that way.
I'm serious.

62
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,150
He's right. That's true.

63
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,340
- It's true.
- You...

64
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,050
You just stole some of our answers.

65
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,280
- That's what I thought.
- I know. He took our answers.

66
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,550
- He thinks he answered them all.
- And he wouldn't even let us talk.

67
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,750
We gave our ideas.

68
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,890
He stopped us every time
we tried to answer the quiz.

69
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,430
Stop showing off.

70
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,390
(So it finally happened.)

71
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,620
(Suk Jin completed the equation
moving only one match.)

72
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,330
If we stack two coins...

73
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,330
(They played the soundtrack of
"Sherlock" at Suk Jin's request.)

74
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,590
(This is the onscreen subtitle
in episode 547.)

75
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,740
(And the director wrote onscreen
subtitles that weren't true.)

76
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,800
(The man who went to Ajou University
did well.)

77
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,530
(When you get this kind
of question correct, you look sexy.)

78
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,550
(Suk Jin won
the Empty Heads' envy.)

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,050
What Kwang Soo just said is true.

80
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,420
"Make me look like a smart guy."

81
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,280
- "Make me a star."
- "And viewers will find it funny."

82
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,520
I'm sorry,
but that's not what you do here.

83
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,120
- What do I do then?
- You have no ability to do so.

84
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,220
- I just tried...
- There you go again.

85
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,050
The three of them are coming at him.

86
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,930
Let's attack him.

87
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,300
Suk Jin doesn't know what to do
when the three of them attack him.

88
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,400
What? Did Kwang Soo win an award?

89
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,640
Korea Gold Awards Festival?

90
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,870
- He won an award?
- Did you film something?

91
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,340
- What did you film?
- Are you a cameraman?

92
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,950
- No, that's not it.
- What did you film?

93
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,770
It's not like that. I didn't win
an award as a cameraman.

94
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,770
- Do you work as a cameraman?
- They gave me the award.

95
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,120
What's wrong with the photo?

96
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,810
He did that again.

97
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,550
- They asked me to dance.
- He did it...

98
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,810
to ask for an award.

99
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,180
The headline was...

100
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,360
"Dance moves that make
Yoo Jae Suk call him."

101
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,220
That's the headline.

102
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,020
How could you be my son-in-law?

103
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,330
No. That's not what it said.

104
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,240
- How dare you...
- That's not what it said.

105
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,030
(Na Eun's dad becomes sensitive
when it comes to his daughter.)

106
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,340
- It was a different word.
- Are you out of your mind?

107
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,930
- Are you crazy?
- That's not what it says.

108
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,530
They were totally different words.

109
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,000
He meant dance moves.

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,650
- That's horrible, you punk.
- It's not like that.

111
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,450
That's not what I meant.

112
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,270
- I just imagined it.
- Jae Suk is really mad.

113
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,520
- I'm going to...
- No wonder he's upset.

114
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Call him Father.

115
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,120
King Kong by Starship is
manipulating the media.

116
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,280
What does King Kong by Starship
have to do with this?

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
He's your father-in-law.

118
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
(Na Eun's dad would come
to Kwang Soo's agency.)

119
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,650
Today's race is about
what all office workers would want.

120
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,990
It's about how quickly
you can get off work.

121
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,120
It's called the Sweet
and Scary Way Home Race.

122
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,590
- What?
- I guess we go home early.

123
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,640
Based on your residential areas,

124
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,840
we divided you into two teams,
Team Mapo and Team Gangnam.

125
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,100
(Team Mapo, Team Gangnam)

126
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,880
- Mapo!
- Mapo!

127
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,950
- Gangnam!
- Mapo!

128
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,320
(Se Chan and So Min are Team Mapo.)

129
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,980
- Gangnam!
- Gangnam!

130
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,020
(Kwang Soo who lives in Seongdong-gu
is Team Gangnam.)

131
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,590
- Gangnam.
- And we have two guests...

132
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,780
who will fight the war
for your way home.

133
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,280
I know one of them.

134
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
- Me too.
- I ran into him earlier.

135
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,060
One of them kept chatting away
in the parking lot.

136
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,130
The thing is...

137
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,790
He brought six people.

138
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,830
- Really?
- He had six staff members, right?

139
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,860
And I said...

140
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,360
hello to him, but he pretended
he didn't see me.

141
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,230
- He ignored you?
- He said he shouldn't talk to me.

142
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,100
(Who's the guest coming under fire
from the members already?)

143
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,140
(What? They're coming.)

144
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,900
- That's Choa.
- Hey, Choa.

145
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,380
Choa is here.

146
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,710
- Hello.
- It's been a long time, Choa.

147
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,170
- It's been so long.
- It's Choa.

148
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,840
Choa.

149
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,820
- Hello.
- Hello.

150
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,950
It's so good to see you.

151
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,590
Choa, it's been a really long time.

152
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,890
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes. I've been fine.

153
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,060
Come here.

154
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,420
- It's so good to see you.
- Choa.

155
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,960
It's been a while.

156
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,420
- And there's a candle dripping.
- Hello.

157
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,520
He's a candle dripping.

158
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,420
Who said a candle dripping?

159
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,720
Choa and a candle dripping.

160
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,730
Who said "candle dripping?"

161
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,570
- Isn't he Gi Yeong?
- He's a candle dripping.

162
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,360
- Hello.
- There's a candle dripping.

163
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,660
- Isn't he Gi Yeong?
- Hello.

164
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,210
Where should I stand?

165
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,140
First...

166
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,810
He will get to you. Just stay quiet.

167
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,670
- We have a guest here.
- Come here.

168
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,950
- Stand here?
- Yes.

169
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,040
So we have...

170
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,540
My gosh. This is great.

171
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,890
We have Cho Sae Ho
and Choa here today.

172
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,150
Hello.

173
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,910
- Hello.
- Choa and a candle dripping.

174
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,460
- What?
- A candle dripping.

175
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,760
- Choa and a candle dripping.
- Candle?

176
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,220
Choa, you're back...

177
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,700
after 7 or 8 years.

178
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,360
- Has it been nine years?
- It's been a long time.

179
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,570
- 6 years?
- 6 years.

180
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,630
- It's been almost seven years.
- Right.

181
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,200
- It's been six years?
- That's great, Choa.

182
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,400
You look great.

183
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
I'm so glad that I'm back.

184
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,570
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

185
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,530
- I've been seeing you though.
- You have?

186
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,510
I've seen you on TV
lying down at home.

187
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,210
So this feels so familiar.

188
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,210
That's good.

189
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,690
I've mostly stayed alone at home.

190
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,520
- And I run my YouTube channel.
- Right.

191
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,760
But I don't get to see
many people there.

192
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,020
So I came here to have fun today.

193
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,190
And we have...

194
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,850
veter-ran entertainers here.

195
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,720
(Veter-ran?)

196
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,660
- Veter-ran?
- She hasn't been on TV for long.

197
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,030
She has a lot to say.

198
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,140
- You know what I mean, right?
- Sure.

199
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,290
I totally understand her.

200
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,770
Jae Suk, who will you spit out?

201
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,340
She has a lot of things
she wants to say.

202
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,580
The viewers will understand her too.

203
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,730
You get to talk after a long time.

204
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,540
I didn't get to talk like this
for a long time.

205
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,710
Choa gets to talk to many people
after a long time,

206
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,080
- so she has a lot to say.
- We understand.

207
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,280
So I think I will have
a lot of fun today.

208
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,750
Okay. That was Choa.

209
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,890
- Choa.
- Choa.

210
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,460
(Thinking)

211
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,220
And we also have Sae Ho here.

212
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,290
- He's just...
- Isn't he a candle dripping?

213
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,460
I was hoping you could
welcome me just a little.

214
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,840
People like me
who enjoy working out think...

215
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,900
- Sae Ho defeated Jung Jun Ha.
- I did?

216
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,510
- In a bad way.
- A bad way?

217
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,840
- Seriously?
- In a bad way?

218
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,470
- That's not true.
- He defeated Jung Jun Ha.

219
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,650
Jo Young Gu, Jung Jun Ha,
and Cho Sae Ho.

220
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,250
Don't say that.

221
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,820
He won a complete victory.

222
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,450
A doctor of Korean medicine
recently took his pulse...

223
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,840
and said he has the pulse of a baby.

224
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,350
- He could barely feel the pulse.
- It was weak.

225
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,020
He said I had a toddling pulse.

226
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,630
You should exercise for your health.

227
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,920
- Your real name is Cho Sae Ho.
- Nice to meet you.

228
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,500
- Do you have a stage name?
- It's my real name.

229
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,770
Is your stage name
Cho Sae Ho as well?

230
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,840
I have many different alter egos.

231
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,440
What alter egos?
We don't know any of them.

232
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,770
I used to use the name Yangbaechu.

233
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,860
That's right. He was Yangbaechu.

234
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,400
It's not your alter ego.
It was just a failure.

235
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,380
Was Yangbaechu your alter ego?

236
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,340
I used to work under
the stage name, Yangbaechu.

237
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,510
Isn't Yangbaechu your real name?

238
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,670
- Isn't it your real name?
- Is that your real name?

239
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,410
And your Japanese name is Cabagin.

240
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,190
- Who?
- Your Japanese name is Cabagin.

241
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,340
Stop it.

242
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,590
Se Chan.

243
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,780
- That's enough.
- Okay.

244
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,980
- He's feeling very nervous now.
- All right.

245
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,060
Who would...

246
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,700
- Who would name his son Yangbaechu?
- I know.

247
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,630
- There might be a misunderstanding.
- That's enough.

248
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,860
They call me Coleslaw in the States.

249
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,000
(He still wants
to make people laugh.)

250
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,340
- Sure.
- I understand.

251
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,710
I used to be a big fan of Sae Ho.

252
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,210
You used to be? What about now?

253
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,580
There he goes again.

254
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,170
But now...

255
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,730
Jong Kook says that again.

256
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,270
- He says you used to look cute.
- I really liked him.

257
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,770
I used to be a big fan.

258
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,210
He liked you
when you were Yangbaechu.

259
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,670
I also liked Yangbaechu.

260
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,910
A lot of people want me
to put the weight back on.

261
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,350
But I'm maintaining my weight well.

262
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,060
It will be more fun
if you put the weight back on.

263
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,480
(Touching)

264
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,460
- I see.
- What are you doing, So Min?

265
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,930
His head looks like a chestnut.

266
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,300
- A chestnut.
- Really?

267
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,700
A freshly shelled chestnut.

268
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,930
- I...
- A freshly shelled chestnut?

269
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,090
A freshly shelled chestnut?

270
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,200
- We shell chestnuts like this.
- I know what it is.

271
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,410
- I know. This is what we do.
- We do this with our feet.

272
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,540
Sae Ho's nickname is
a shelled chestnut.

273
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,550
Jae Suk called me yesterday...

274
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,600
and asked, "Are you going
to be on Running Man tomorrow?"

275
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,110
So I said yes. And he said,
"Don't come."

276
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,180
How can I not come?

277
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,780
I have no choice.

278
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,010
So I was like, "I don't think
I have a choice."

279
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,820
And he said, "Just don't come.
I'll take care of it."

280
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,960
How can I not come?

281
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,090
"Then you should come..."

282
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,120
"and stay still
like a stuffed doll."

283
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,220
What is he talking about?

284
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
Why would he tell me not to come?

285
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,830
I just told him to stay quiet.

286
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,430
He used to be funny
when he said things like that.

287
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,590
What?

288
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,990
A Grand Award winner is
not supposed to say that.

289
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,130
Kim Grand Award.

290
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,040
That's it. Just let it go.

291
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,170
You have to overcome this.

292
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,000
- When he said the same thing...
- Okay.

293
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,410
I'll come back again
after putting on some weight.

294
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,780
- When he said the same thing,
- Seriously...

295
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,550
- it was hilarious.
- Sae Ho...

296
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,550
This is what Sae Ho
does the most in Running Man.

297
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,290
- It sounds boring now.
- I'm serious.

298
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,050
I thought of a lot of things
that might happen today.

299
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,060
But this isn't what I expected.

300
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,660
Look at that.

301
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,430
He used to look cute
when he did things like this.

302
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,460
Stop that.

303
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,800
- He looks cute.
- Oh no.

304
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,250
He is cute.

305
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,700
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

306
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,300
So...

307
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,070
Sae Ho will support Team Mapo.

308
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,570
Okay. I'm Team Mapo.

309
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,810
Team Mapo.

310
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,780
Choa doesn't live in Gangnam,

311
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,470
but she's going
to Gangnam after this show.

312
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,080
So she's Team Gangnam.

313
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,910
Do you see the opening venue
on the map?

314
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,640
If Team Mapo wins a mission,

315
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,290
they will move one space
toward Mapo.

316
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,550
Good.

317
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,610
It will be fun.

318
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,480
So we have to win the missions
to go this way.

319
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,750
Gosh, this is...

320
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,790
If we finish the race at Dosan Park,
I can get home quickly.

321
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,490
- It's near my house.
- It will be great.

322
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,560
Like I said you can
move one space...

323
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,890
toward Mapo or Gangnam.

324
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,200
If both teams win
the missions in turn,

325
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,070
they might have to go
to the places they already visited.

326
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,310
The team who wins a mission...

327
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,470
can put a sticker of their team
on the roulette.

328
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,600
(The winning team can put
their sticker on the roulette.)

329
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,370
During the mission,

330
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,320
when the clock strikes five
and people start to get off work,

331
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,580
you will stop the mission.

332
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,380
You will spin the roulette
and decide the ending venue.

333
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,190
Then you will shoot
the ending there...

334
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,720
and finish today's episode.

335
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,090
(They will shoot the ending for
about 5 minutes and get off work.)

336
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,690
So even if you were losing,

337
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,460
if you spin the roulette well,

338
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,860
- you can go to your neighborhood.
- Okay.

339
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,300
- The last one is important.
- If we spin it well,

340
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,530
- we can still win.
- That's right.

341
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,670
But you will be more likely to win
the race if you win the missions.

342
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,440
It will be over in the rush hour.

343
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,370
It's more upsetting
that the ending will be short.

344
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,600
It will take more than an hour
to get here from Gangnam.

345
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,710
We have to go all the way there
to shoot the short ending.

346
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,210
To shoot a short scene.

347
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,420
It will be really annoying.

348
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,780
- It's annoying.
- So it's like a penalty.

349
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,710
You will have the first mission...

350
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,710
at restaurants with dishes
that will stimulate your appetites.

351
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,820
- We are going to eat.
- That's great.

352
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,790
- Let's eat.
- This is exciting.

353
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,460
How nice.

354
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,530
(We rented the places and filmed
according to safety regulations.)

355
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,530
So this is...

356
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,220
- This is the place.
- Right.

357
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,890
This is my favorite
tteokbokki place.

358
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,760
- What's that? Tteokbokki?
- Oh, that one.

359
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,540
You can start with number two.

360
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,810
(Which restaurants will they be
visiting today?)

361
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,710
- It must be delicious.
- It's arugula.

362
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,780
This place is crazy.

363
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,100
Pimpinella pasta.

364
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,280
- That sounds great.
- Wonton soup.

365
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,140
- Rice with seafood.
- Right.

366
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,580
This restaurant has...

367
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,290
- great seasoned dumplings.
- Really?

368
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,950
Strawberry croffle.

369
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,290
That must be delicious.

370
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,660
I want to go there.

371
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,830
- Where do you want to go, So Min?
- I want rice with seafood.

372
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,160
Rice with seafood.

373
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,160
What about you, Ji Hyo?

374
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,070
Actually, I like tteokbokki.

375
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,460
- Ji Hyo, that's great.
- Gosh, Ji Hyo.

376
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,460
We should go to Mapo.

377
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,300
You can eat tteokbokki in Mapo.

378
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,360
That's just what I like.

379
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,630
- This isn't about your taste.
- Ji Hyo.

380
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,580
Help us go to the tteokbokki place.

381
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,710
- Okay.
- All right.

382
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,840
You can count on me.

383
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,870
This is what I like about Ji Hyo.

384
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,550
Ji Hyo has no strategies.

385
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,510
She just says what she wants to eat.

386
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,740
- She just goes there.
- She follows her instincts.

387
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,820
But she doesn't get a penalty.

388
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,710
- Right. She always avoids it.
- Then you will have...

389
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,830
the first mission
to decide the first destination.

390
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,960
- Okay. Let's do this.
- We have to win this.

391
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,030
- Good.
- We have to win.

392
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,300
- Mapo!
- Mapo!

393
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,200
- Gangnam!
- Gangnam!

394
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,670
- Gangnam!
- Mapo.

395
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,440
- You should say Mapo.
- Why do you say Gangnam?

396
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,100
Go over there.
Why do you say Gangnam?

397
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,230
She says Gangnam.

398
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,840
This is the first mission...

399
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,950
for the first destination
on your way home.

400
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,840
It's called Furious Race.

401
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,920
I guess we will run.

402
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,680
You will pick a marble you want.

403
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,610
And on the track you see over there,

404
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,980
you will place the marble
at the starting line.

405
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,690
With the signal, we will remove
the board blocking the marbles.

406
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,330
And we will go to the restaurant
in the winning team's district.

407
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,890
(They will go to the restaurant
in the winning team's district.)

408
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,460
Then go there and pick your color.

409
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,890
- I pick red.
- We don't know it yet.

410
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,030
This is me.

411
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,200
I'm orange.

412
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,860
- Place it here.
- All right.

413
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,940
How should I put this?

414
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,730
Orange!

415
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,810
Red, red, red

416
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,870
- Orange, orange, orange
- Let's go.

417
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,840
- Let's go.
- Let's do this!

418
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,870
- Let's do this.
- My marble will win

419
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,980
Mapo!

420
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,920
Mapo, mapo, mapo

421
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,350
Move over.

422
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,750
Why do you push me away?
I need to be on TV.

423
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,830
- Okay.
- Let's go!

424
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,530
Let's go!

425
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,990
- All right.
- Let's do this.

426
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,530
- This is...
- The first game is important.

427
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,300
- Ready.
- 1, 2, 3.

428
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,300
- Go.
- They're moving.

429
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,760
- Orange!
- Red!

430
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,570
They're moving.

431
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,630
Red!

432
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,810
There it is.

433
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,070
Why isn't it moving?

434
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,870
- Whose marble is that?
- Red.

435
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,580
Good, Ji Hyo.

436
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,310
- It's going well.
- It's not over yet.

437
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,450
- This is great, Ji Hyo.
- Go!

438
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,380
- It's almost there.
- Stop.

439
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,450
- Go!
- Ji Hyo.

440
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,290
Good. Hurry.

441
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,590
- Let's go!
- Hurry!

442
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,030
(The marbles are nearing
the end of the course.)

443
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,330
Go!

444
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,590
There it is.

445
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,160
- It's almost there.
- No.

446
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,260
Ji Hyo's isn't moving.

447
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,670
What?

448
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,440
(Who is going to win?)

449
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,840
- Let's go.
- Hurry!

450
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,630
- Okay! Come on!
- Go!

451
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,970
(Kim Jong Kook wins!)

452
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,040
(Jong Kook, Haha, Ji Hyo, Se Chan)

453
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,640
Let's go!

454
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,210
- Come on!
- Go!

455
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,080
(He beat the top 3 from Team Mapo
and came in 1st!)

456
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,840
(1st, Jong Kook, 2nd, Haha,
3rd, Ji Hyo, 4th, Sae Ho)

457
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,820
(From 5th, Se Chan, Suk Jin,
So Min, Jae Suk, Choa, Kwang Soo)

458
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,840
(Screaming with joy)

459
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,880
- We won!
- My gosh.

460
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,110
We won!

461
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,830
- I can't believe he won.
- This is ridiculous.

462
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,490
- Jong Kook, good job!
- My gosh. How did it happen?

463
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,990
- No way.
- How did this happen?

464
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,200
It hit the wall.

465
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,360
It makes no sense.

466
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,960
(Disappointed)

467
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,390
How did it happen?

468
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,860
I can't believe it happened
at the last moment.

469
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,910
How did you do that?

470
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,810
I was in fourth place
up to this point.

471
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,180
- But I came in first at the end.
- How did that happen?

472
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,710
- Exactly.
- It's hard to believe.

473
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,280
- How did it happen?
- Unbelievable.

474
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,640
- That was so unexpected.
- It's hard to believe.

475
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,870
That marble is just like Jong Kook.

476
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,820
- It pushed its way at the end.
- Exactly.

477
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,210
It pushed its way.

478
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,190
- The light blue one, right?
- I didn't even expect it to win.

479
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,610
Wasn't the pink one
in the first place?

480
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,980
- She and we were in the top three.
- Really?

481
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,560
- This is so hard to believe.
- Indeed.

482
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,890
- That was so cool.
- Is it over now?

483
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,200
- Yes.
- Of course.

484
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,360
Then we'll move
to the tteokbokki place at Gangnam.

485
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,340
- Okay!
- Okay!

486
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,570
- Choa, you seem so excited.
- Choa, come on in.

487
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,630
- Choa, come on in.
- Okay.

488
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,130
- Where... Should I sit at the back?
- Come and sit down.

489
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,710
Choa, what did you do
during your break?

490
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,100
- Pardon me?
- What did you do during your break?

491
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,600
I just watched TV lying down.

492
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,810
- It sounds very comfortable.
- All I did was sleep.

493
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,370
- It's so relaxing, right?
- Indeed. Hello.

494
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,710
Hey, you and your sister look
so much alike.

495
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,820
- Did you watch the show?
- I was so surprised.

496
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,920
- Thank you.
- Her sister?

497
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,250
- They look so much alike.
- Hey.

498
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,930
You look just like your mother too.

499
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,490
The same goes for you.

500
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
When I went to his wedding,

501
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,300
I thought he was wearing
a women's hanbok.

502
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,860
(He found the groom
dressed as a woman.)

503
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,460
- You look just like your mother.
- I was...

504
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,470
- I was so surprised.
- I was surprised too.

505
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,580
- I was so surprised.
- You look just like your mother.

506
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,050
They really are entertainers.

507
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,240
- I look just like my mom, right?
- Yes, totally.

508
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,840
- Right.
- I was so surprised.

509
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,820
- Wait. Where's Sae Ho?
- I'm here.

510
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,320
- I'm right here.
- We don't have many guests today.

511
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,030
Jae Suk, why do you look
so disappointed?

512
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,460
I thought it would be funny
if he had been left out.

513
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,490
(He put on a long face
unintentionally.)

514
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,360
There are the tall and short men
that I like sitting in the front.

515
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,960
- They are my favorites.
- Hens are in the chicken coop

516
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,040
(Kwang Soo, the tall man,
Sae Ho, the short man)

517
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,440
They're like
Seo Su Nam and Ha Cheong Il.

518
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,000
- They can be a perfect duo.
- You know I like them, right?

519
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,210
That's great.

520
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,080
- A tall and short men duo.
- Exactly.

521
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,610
- He's just amazing.
- Indeed.

522
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,090
This is how Sae Ho looks like
since he lost weight.

523
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,350
Imagine Kwang Soo is
only 178cm tall.

524
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,160
- Is that how he looks?
- I see.

525
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,190
- That's how he looks.
- Sae Ho.

526
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,850
- They'll tease you all day long.
- I know.

527
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,160
- So you should...
- But it's okay.

528
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,030
That was the only thing
he said to Sae Ho.

529
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,830
I should overcome it as well.

530
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,240
- Don't be ridiculous, you punk.
- It's just a phase.

531
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,840
- I know.
- Suk Jin, why would you swear?

532
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,810
- It's not like that. The fact...
- What's wrong with you?

533
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,840
The fact that you said
you should overcome it...

534
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,370
means that you haven't been able to
overcome it yet.

535
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,780
So don't even say such a thing.

536
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,700
He hasn't overcome it
in the past 11 years.

537
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,170
- Ouch!
- I'm sorry.

538
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,440
He hasn't overcome it
in the past 11 years.

539
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,610
(He pretends he got hurt.)

540
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,290
- Are you okay?
- You must overcome it.

541
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,550
- What was that?
- You must overcome that.

542
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,260
- It wasn't intentional.
- Overcome it!

543
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,120
- Overcome it!
- Overcome it!

544
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,330
That was good.

545
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,560
- Like this?
- Yes.

546
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,590
- You saw that, right?
- I get it.

547
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,650
- You have to smile.
- I see.

548
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,660
You know, Suk Jin calls me
at least 3 times in 1 year.

549
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,800
- Really?
- Yes.

550
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,590
He calls me 3 times in 1 year.

551
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,200
As soon as I picked up,
I said, "Jiseokjin World."

552
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
He asked, "How did you know?"

553
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,510
(He called Sae Ho to ask him
to be in videos on his channel.)

554
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,780
- "Can you join our shoot?"
- Of course.

555
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,510
- He doesn't call without a reason.
- Exactly.

556
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,640
- The same goes for Haha.
- Yes.

557
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,320
- Why?
- You have such skinny ankles.

558
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,820
This is one of the criteria
for a handsome man.

559
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,320
- They look so skinny.
- Are you serious?

560
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,820
- Yes. A man with slim ankles...
- You need a handsome face.

561
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,320
What does it have to do
with being handsome?

562
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,410
A man with slim ankles is considered
attractive.

563
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,330
- He's arguing with so many of us.
- Here goes...

564
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,790
"Ji Suk Jin Show" began again.

565
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,590
- The thought of overcoming...
- It's "Punching Bag Show."

566
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,650
Or "Punching Bag Ji Show."

567
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,300
- It's him against everyone else.
- That means you haven't succeeded.

568
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,860
About seven people.

569
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,930
- Don't even think of overcoming it.
- Isn't he amazing, Choa?

570
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,240
- He's amazing, right?
- Yes.

571
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,660
(Choa is surprised to see
everyone attacking him.)

572
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,810
Choa seems more cheerful
than before.

573
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,810
- Really?
- He looks more cheerful now.

574
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,170
- She looks more cheerful now.
- Indeed.

575
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,050
How do you feel
about being a solo artist?

576
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,110
- One of the good things is...
- Yes?

577
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,550
- that I can save time...
- You can save time?

578
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,990
- at a beauty parlor.
- I see.

579
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,880
You had to wait
until your team members were done.

580
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,530
- Yes. We're divided into two teams.
- That's right.

581
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,120
I've never been to a beauty parlor.

582
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,230
- Really?
- Yes.

583
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,030
- You're not wearing makeup now?
- Of course not.

584
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,690
- You have such smooth skin.
- I style my own hair too.

585
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,660
- Really?
- I never have it done by an expert.

586
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,300
He doesn't work
with a stylist either.

587
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,470
- Really?
- I just wear my own clothes.

588
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,900
Based on his behaviors like that,

589
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,430
he shouldn't be called
a TV celebrity.

590
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,040
- He's more like...
- An athlete.

591
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,100
- Yes. He's more like a sportsman.
- A sportsman.

592
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,750
- We should call him a sportsman.
- A sportsman.

593
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,870
- Like a man in the neighborhood.
- Exactly.

594
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,140
Sae Ho, you go
to a famous beauty parlor, right?

595
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,790
- Of course.
- Me?

596
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,020
Don't you go to a barbershop?

597
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,060
Did you say "babo"
as in "fool" in Korean?

598
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,690
- Isn't it called a barbershop?
- I thought he said, "fool shop."

599
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,060
- It's not "babo."
- Kwang Soo goes to a fool sho."

600
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,390
- Oh, right.
- He goes to a fool shop.

601
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,360
- It's "barber," not "babo."
- I go to this hair salon...

602
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,240
that a friend of mine runs.
I've been a regular there...

603
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,090
- for almost 10 years.
- You can get the same haircut...

604
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,810
at any barbershop
near the boot camp in Nonsan.

605
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,340
- You have a point.
- Yes.

606
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,540
What do you think
about what he just said?

607
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,740
I really don't like it.

608
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,600
- To the point...
- You must overcome it.

609
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,810
To the point that my nose ran.

610
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,340
He took me by surprise.

611
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,880
Suk Jin is not very good
at improvising jokes.

612
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,260
- He's better at defending.
- That's true.

613
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,180
- That's not true.
- He's not good at attacking.

614
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,620
Anyway, listen.

615
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,350
- Stop buying designer goods.
- Here he goes again.

616
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,120
You should buy your own house first.

617
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,260
What is this?

618
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,530
- What is your intention?
- What do you mean?

619
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,120
- Do you mean well?
- That was a piece of advice.

620
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,860
- An honest piece of advice.
- Why would you...

621
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,470
Why would you advise him
like a bossy man?

622
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,400
- I just...
- Jong Kook caught him off guard.

623
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,040
- Gosh, that punk. Listen.
- It has begun now.

624
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,240
It's not like that.

625
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,430
- That was so...
- I mean, why...

626
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,140
- That was suffocating.
- Why would you advise him?

627
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,810
It was beyond pressure.
It was suffocating.

628
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,870
That's not true.

629
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,490
When I'm ready to hit him hard,

630
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,790
I'll call you.

631
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,880
It seems to me
that Suk Jin is in a good mood...

632
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,680
whenever I come on this show.

633
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,490
- Sae Ho.
- He wants to show off.

634
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,030
He takes it all out on me.

635
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,850
It's because they get distracted
by you a little.

636
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,330
- That's true.
- They target you as well.

637
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,090
- We're here!
- We're here!

638
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,840
Suk Jin, smile!

639
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,130
Are we really getting off like this?

640
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,570
- Let's go, everybody.
- Give Suk Jin a drink!

641
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,980
Shall we go and eat
some delicious tteokbokki?

642
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,240
(Let's go and eat tteokbokki
with the best defender!)

643
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,640
How nice. I can tell
how old this place is.

644
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,700
(Banpo A Tteokbokki
with a 30-year history)

645
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,980
All of those bring back
old memories.

646
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,170
Indeed.

647
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,820
(One-pot tteokbokki
with an addictive flavor)

648
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,490
- This is how it looks. It's nice.
- I remember this.

649
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,060
- Just like those old places.
- Those good old days

650
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,620
(And seasoned dumplings
with their own special sauce)

651
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,500
I haven't been here
in such a long time.

652
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,800
We came to Banpo A Tteokbokki,
1 of the top 10 tteokbokki places...

653
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,730
in Seoul.

654
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,970
It's been a while.

655
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,090
I love this place.

656
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,740
- It looks really nice.
- I came here after a long time.

657
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,900
Of course, you didn't think
that all of you would get to eat.

658
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,980
- What?
- I knew it.

659
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,110
Only three members
of the winning team will get to eat.

660
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,780
- From the winning team?
- Only three members?

661
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,820
Even from the winning team?

662
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,750
- That's too harsh.
- The restaurant owner will...

663
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,790
- choose the three people to eat.
- Really?

664
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,850
Yes. The restaurant owner will
choose 3 out of the 5 members.

665
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,420
- Really?
- We need to make a good impression.

666
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,090
- We need a likable face.
- On our team...

667
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,770
- I'm confident.
- I bet Suk Jin won't be picked.

668
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,470
You're wrong. I'm sure
that I'll get to eat.

669
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,570
He's around the owner's age.

670
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,200
- Where is the owner?
- The owner might like him.

671
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,360
The owner might have gone
to the same school as him.

672
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,580
The winning team will not only eat
the food,

673
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,440
but also, you all will move
toward the winning team's area,

674
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,580
and you'll get another slot...

675
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,610
- in the roulette.
- We should win the game.

676
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,490
The losing team will be tempted
to taste the food.

677
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,290
We'll give food
to every member of the losing team.

678
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,330
If anyone eats it,
the winning team will get two slots.

679
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,380
- If anyone can't hold back?
- That's right.

680
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,390
- So Min will definitely eat.
- Of course, we will...

681
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,390
No, I won't eat it.
I'm not an animal. I can hold back.

682
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,270
Also, if any of the two members
of the winning team who can't eat...

683
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,470
fail to hold back and eat,
the team will lose one slot.

684
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,430
Let's begin the first mission.

685
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,870
It requires good teamwork.
It's Quiz Hour.

686
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,900
Quiz Hour.

687
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,340
Okay, okay, okay!

688
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,100
- Great. Okay!
- But...

689
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,640
- He seems confident.
- Yes!

690
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,750
- You...
- It's disadvantageous for us.

691
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,320
- Hey, this is...
- The smartest person here is...

692
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,790
- This is unfair.
- You put all of us on this team.

693
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,790
- We're done for.
- Why is it a quiz?

694
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,880
I bet it was intentional.

695
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,490
They're all Empty Heads.

696
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,830
Suk Jin will call the director
and ask him to make him look smart.

697
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,120
- He drives me crazy.
- Seriously...

698
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,830
- I think I'll do that too.
- How could you ask him to do that?

699
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,300
You're not allowed to call him
anymore.

700
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,070
That's not why I called him.

701
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,660
I just made a suggestion
while we were having a chat.

702
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,740
- Bo Pil got stressed out a lot.
- Bo Pil,

703
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,130
please make me look smart again.

704
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,600
It's rare to see anyone like him.

705
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,100
(This professional entertainer wants
to use the power of editing.)

706
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,940
The first round is about units.

707
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,080
- Units?
- Oh, units?

708
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,170
So it's a math quiz.

709
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,670
The two teams will take turns.

710
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,720
Like inches, right?

711
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,650
Each member has to read
the unit symbol...

712
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,410
written on the sketchbook correctly.

713
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,490
- You have only three seconds.
- Oh, no. I'm worried.

714
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,590
- I don't know many unit symbols.
- Me neither.

715
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,350
- We just have to read it?
- I'm not good at math.

716
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,850
- What should we read?
- A unit symbol.

717
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,920
Is it written in Korean?

718
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,970
- For example, if it's 11km...
- Kilometer?

719
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,470
- And centimeter for cm?
- Correct.

720
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,970
Let's let Ji Hyo go first.

721
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,240
- Those are all I know.
- Why won't you let me finish?

722
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,310
If you say an incorrect answer,
the other team will have a chance.

723
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,840
So you should decide
the order wisely.

724
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
- Really?
- Yes.

725
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,490
The first one will be
the easiest question.

726
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,320
- Really?
- And it gets more difficult.

727
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,680
- You should go last.
- Right.

728
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,850
You and Suk Jin go to the back.

729
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,350
- I'll be the second.
- Okay. This will be better.

730
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,880
- In this direction, right?
- Yes. Let's do that.

731
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,990
- Sae Ho...
- Right.

732
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,920
- Ji Hyo or Se Chan should be there.
- Wait.

733
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,000
- Am I in the same spot as him?
- He's the first one to go too.

734
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,190
(Both of them will answer
the easiest question.)

735
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,070
- Am I in the same spot as him?
- He's the first one to go too.

736
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,160
Gosh. I don't like this.

737
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,690
- Gosh.
- Why?

738
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,360
Se Chan is the first one to go too.

739
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,740
We're sitting in the order
of the levels of intelligence.

740
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,630
- And Sae Ho is at that end?
- He's the brain of our team.

741
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,980
He's the brain of our team.

742
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,440
(Sae Ho is treated as the brain
on Team Mapo.)

743
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,020
- It won't be so difficult.
- So Min is the fourth?

744
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,020
(She'll get a difficult question.)

745
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,320
- So Min is the fourth.
- She graduated from college.

746
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,450
I graduated from college.

747
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,060
- That's true.
- Let's do this.

748
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
- That's true.
- They have their own reasons.

749
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,590
I graduated from college too.
I majored in comedic acting.

750
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,060
That's so funny.

751
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,230
Choa can't seem to laugh loudly.

752
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,190
- She's embarrassed.
- She's good with numbers.

753
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,570
- She invests in stocks.
- I just...

754
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,690
- That's right.
- We don't know yet.

755
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,840
- Exactly.
- We don't know yet.

756
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,930
You should answer in three seconds
after I show you the question.

757
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,930
Answer right away. Or you're out.

758
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,310
Of course. Right away.

759
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,050
- We can do it!
- I'll go first.

760
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,810
- You can do it!
- The first one will be easy.

761
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,610
Okay. Ready. Go. 1, 2, 3.

762
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,820
- Kilometer.
- Okay. Good job.

763
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,290
Se Chan, what has gotten into you?

764
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,790
- I know that much.
- Of course.

765
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,720
Ready, go. 1, 2, 3.

766
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,590
- Inch, inch.
- Inch.

767
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,760
- "Inch, inch."
- Don't say the answer.

768
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,000
("Inch?")

769
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,530
- My gosh. You don't even know this?
- Don't say the answer.

770
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,390
Let's switch seats.

771
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,770
- I was just a little late.
- Let's switch our seats.

772
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,400
- I knew the answer.
- I'm sure she knows kilometer.

773
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,010
- I was just late. That's all.
- You knew the answer, right?

774
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,130
Does that mean inch?

775
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,310
- You knew it, right?
- Of course, she knows that much.

776
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,840
Here's your question. Ready, go.

777
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,170
- 1, 2, 3.
- Milligram.

778
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,410
- Good.
- Good job.

779
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,940
We all know that.

780
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,840
- He knows it.
- Impressive.

781
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,840
I'm surprised that he knows it.

782
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,410
- I thought he'd say "magnesium."
- Is it my turn?

783
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,950
That's what I thought.

784
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,450
1, 2, 3.

785
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,990
(Frozen)

786
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,350
- You don't know that?
- Do you know this?

787
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,760
- What's this?
- Why don't you know this?

788
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,090
(It's ton.)

789
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,920
- It's ton.
- Ton?

790
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,740
- Ton?
- Ton.

791
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,840
None of you knew?

792
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,890
- What does that mean?
- Okay. Good.

793
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,840
- Ton.
- Ton. You ignorant punk.

794
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,540
- Oh, right. It's ton.
- I can't believe you.

795
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,600
I forgot.

796
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,630
Stop lying. You didn't know.

797
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,010
Right. Ton and on...
I mean, ton and off. Ton.

798
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,600
- Choa...
- I'm so sorry.

799
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,220
- It's okay.
- Don't worry.

800
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,110
- Choa, it's okay.
- I'll go first.

801
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,820
Hey, why did you switch
seats with her?

802
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,180
We have to win.

803
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,320
- Hey!
- We have no choice.

804
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,820
- We have no choice.
- Why did you do that?

805
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,650
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo came here too.

806
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,380
I just missed the timing.
I knew the answer. That's all.

807
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,760
- Okay.
- No. I just missed the timing.

808
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,890
- Choa, don't be nervous.
- Okay.

809
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,620
If you get a question wrong,
you move to the next seat.

810
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,470
- Ji Hyo goes first.
- Yes.

811
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,690
- Go, Ji Hyo!
- I'm nervous.

812
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,160
- Ready, go. 1, 2, 3.
- You can do this.

813
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,770
(Milliliter!)

814
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,170
1, 2, 3.

815
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,200
- Milliliter!
- That's milliliter!

816
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,550
- My gosh. Really?
- Everyone knows that!

817
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,980
You really don't know this?

818
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,910
I bet she thought
it stood for medium and large.

819
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,490
- Hey.
- You see it on a milk carton.

820
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,020
It's because I've never seen
the letter L written like that.

821
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,790
Ji Hyo, be more confident.

822
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,490
I just haven't seen
the letter L written like that.

823
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,590
(She has never seen an L like that.)

824
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,920
- Let's go. The first one is easy.
- Gosh. I'm so nervous.

825
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,650
- This is fun.
- I'm so surprised.

826
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,530
Ready, go. 1, 2, 3.

827
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,530
- Millimeter.
- Okay!

828
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,270
- Good job.
- I thought it was Mighty Mouse.

829
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,590
Kwang Soo, you can do this.

830
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,010
I'll succeed.
I'll make sure to get it right.

831
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,630
I'm relieved that she didn't say
M and M chocolates.

832
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,630
Ready, go. 1, 2, 3.

833
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,100
Deci-gla-liter.

834
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,400
(Deci-gla-liter)

835
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,170
(He created a new unit.)

836
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,370
- "Deci-gla-liter?"
- Hey.

837
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,680
- That's so funny.
- What was that?

838
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,020
What's a "deciliter?"

839
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,320
- Did you say "deciliter?"
- What does that mean?

840
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,110
- It's deciliter.
- He got it right.

841
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,850
- Why didn't you say it clearly?
- He got it right.

842
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,950
Is it really deciliter?

843
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,760
Didn't he get it right?
He said "deciliter."

844
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,500
No, he said "deci-gla-liter."

845
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,350
- What was that?
- Hey, you imitated him well.

846
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,730
You heard it clearly?

847
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,830
- Okay.
- You did well.

848
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,390
- That was good.
- Kwang Soo seems...

849
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,690
- to know quite a bit.
- Indeed.

850
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,130
Let's start with Ji Hyo.

851
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,470
- You can do this.
- Ready, go.

852
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,870
1, 2, 3.

853
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,630
- Square meter.
- It's cubic meter.

854
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,200
- Right. Cubic meter.
- I didn't expect to see that one.

855
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,310
- It's cubic meter.
- You can call it triple meter too.

856
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,610
No, it's cubic meter.

857
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,170
- Can't triple meter be accepted?
- No.

858
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,910
Hey, Sae Ho, you go first.

859
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,940
You sit here.

860
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,020
Ji Hyo, a number on top
of a symbol is an exponent.

861
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,060
Hey!

862
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,290
(Empty Head's philosophy on units)

863
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,760
The number on top is an exponent.
The letter at the end is liter.

864
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,830
And the first letter is
an abbreviation.

865
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,500
I'd better sit at the end
so I won't look ignorant.

866
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,190
- Let's switch our seats.
- Just sit down.

867
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,800
- Choa, it's your turn.
- Okay.

868
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,160
- Go, Choa!
- You have to do well this time.

869
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,360
Ready, go. 1, 2, 3.

870
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,810
- Featuring.
- Feet.

871
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,010
- Feet!
- Feet.

872
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,200
(Featuring!)

873
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,670
(Haha just said any word he knew.)

874
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,170
- That's feet.
- Listen.

875
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,410
Math is all about abbreviations.

876
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,610
The symbol of feet is ft.

877
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,020
Hey! Listen!

878
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,610
- I think this is the best.
- They're all abbreviations.

879
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,650
Those who were class presidents,
sit in the front.

880
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,680
- So Min, sit here.
- Okay. Go and sit there.

881
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,090
Those who participated
in a math contest, move forward.

882
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,390
Sit down.
Why are you trying to avoid it?

883
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,800
- You go first this time.
- Right. Give it a try.

884
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,390
- Haha will go first.
- No.

885
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,890
- No, no.
- Just this once.

886
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,040
- You go first. You do it.
- Come here.

887
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,630
- Haha, you go first this time.
- No.

888
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,660
Let go of me. Let us decide.
You're not on our team.

889
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,040
- Let go. Dream.
- Haha.

890
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,170
Ha Dream, turn off the TV.

891
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,480
Ha Dream, I said, turn it off.

892
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,280
Come on. Sit down.

893
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,820
- Come here.
- Just give it a try.

894
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,050
Let Haha go first.

895
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,550
Why can't you do this?

896
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,410
- Dream, listen.
- You can do it.

897
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,150
Go and do your homework
or write in your diary.

898
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,450
Haha will do well.

899
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,760
It's too early to write a diary.

900
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,380
Ready, go.

901
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,760
- You can do this.
- 1, 2, 3.

902
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,000
- YD? Yang Dong Geun.
- Yard!

903
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,660
- Yard!
- My gosh.

904
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,800
- Yard!
- Yard!

905
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,390
- It's yard!
- Even he knew it.

906
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,000
- It's yard!
- Even I knew that one.

907
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,660
(Yard! It's yard!)

908
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,040
- Yard!
- My gosh.

909
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,310
- How did you not know that?
- I knew it. I'm not lying.

910
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,780
How did you not know that?

911
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,400
My gosh. He didn't know
the symbol of yard.

912
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,750
- I knew the answer.
- You know it, right?

913
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,320
- You know it, right?
- I know this one.

914
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,640
- It's yd.
- Yard.

915
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,840
He said he knew every question
that others were given.

916
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,680
- Yard.
- It's not confusing at all.

917
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,790
Yard.

918
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,850
- Dream shouldn't watch this.
- He should never watch this.

919
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,790
The questions will be more difficult
since we don't have many left.

920
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,560
- Okay. Good.
- Gosh. I'm worried.

921
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,650
- It was already difficult.
- We're at an advantage...

922
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,420
if the questions are more difficult.

923
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,090
Let's go.

924
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,890
- Ready, go.
- Go, Jae Suk!

925
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,770
- 1, 2, 3.
- What is this?

926
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,700
- Ounce!
- It's ounce.

927
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,540
(He has never seen it before.)

928
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,170
(The answer is ounce.)

929
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,170
(Ounce!)

930
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,820
- Hey, go to another seat.
- Ounce.

931
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,940
(They all got up
and pretended they knew the answer.)

932
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,020
- Ounce.
- It's oz.

933
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,290
- It's oz!
- It's ounce.

934
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,410
- It's oz.
- That's not the symbol of ounce.

935
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,610
- It's ounce.
- It's oz.

936
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,830
(Kwang Soo is
even pronouncing it incorrectly.)

937
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,090
- It's oz.
- That's not the symbol of ounce.

938
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,260
- It's ounce.
- Is it?

939
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,390
- Ji Ho, turn the TV off.
- It's oz.

940
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,860
Ji Ho, turn it off now.

941
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,930
Watch me. Watch carefully.

942
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,810
You should know how hard I work.

943
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,100
You should study hard, okay?

944
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,740
I thought it was Oz
from "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."

945
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,170
I knew that we would get
that question.

946
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,810
- Was it the symbol of ounce?
- I was right about it.

947
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,310
- It's okay.
- Let's see how well Sae Ho does.

948
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,440
- It's boring, right?
- Let's see.

949
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,180
- Can I take it seriously?
- Of course.

950
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,290
You should get it right.

951
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,520
Wait. Did you say,
"It's boring, right?"

952
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,220
- That's not what I meant.
- How dare you look down on us?

953
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,230
- Hey, come here.
- Our show is really popular.

954
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,730
- You called our show "boring."
- It wasn't like that.

955
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,760
- Boring?
- How could you say such a thing?

956
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,500
- "Is it okay to be boring?"
- "It'd be boring..."

957
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,270
- "if I get it right."
- That's what you meant, right?

958
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,590
Yes. I was asking
if it'd be okay if I got it right.

959
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,300
- Okay. It can be upsetting.
- I'll start now.

960
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,860
- I'm sorry about that.
- Ready.

961
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,160
Set. Go. 1, 2, 3.

962
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,310
- Machi.
- What was that?

963
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,480
(He basically just read it.)

964
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,900
You can't just read it.

965
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,370
(He looked very confident.)

966
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,320
(But he said "machi" confidently.)

967
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,020
(Machi as in "anesthesia?")

968
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,950
- Gosh, seriously.
- Machi as in "anesthesia?"

969
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,230
- Mach.
- Oh, it's mach!

970
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,590
- Mach!
- Machi as in "anesthesia?"

971
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,680
- Exactly.
- Mach!

972
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,190
- Oh, it was mach.
- Mach!

973
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,450
- I didn't know that one.
- Mach!

974
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,770
- It's a unit of speed, you know.
- Gosh.

975
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,040
So "ch" is pronounced like a "k."

976
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,590
What's "machi?"

977
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,100
Hey, listen to me.

978
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,270
I learned all these in college
majoring in business administration.

979
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,040
- I learned all these.
- You did?

980
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,600
Yes. I knew all the answers.

981
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,900
- Suk Jin.
- I'm ready.

982
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,010
Let's do this. Let us all succeed.

983
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,050
- Let us all succeed.
- Okay.

984
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,670
- At least up to Jong Kook.
- We can do it.

985
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,290
Ready, go. 1, 2, 3.

986
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,680
- K bank!
- Bank.

987
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
(K bank!)

988
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,760
1, 2, 3.

989
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,680
(- K bank!
- Bank.)

990
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,560
- K bank.
- It's kilobyte.

991
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,760
(Jae Suk thought of K bank
when he saw the symbol.)

992
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,890
Right.

993
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,590
- Kilobyte.
- Oh, right.

994
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,590
- K bank.
- What is wrong with you?

995
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,300
K bank suddenly popped into my head.

996
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,000
It's kilobyte, you know.

997
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,540
- I knew he'd fail.
- I use that bank.

998
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,100
Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

999
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,200
I use K bank.

1000
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,600
- That was so funny.
- Kilobyte.

1001
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,740
- All right.
- Move.

1002
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,370
"K" always stands for "kilo."

1003
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,200
- Kilo?
- "M" stands for "milligram..."

1004
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,820
- I mean, "milli."
- "M" stands for...

1005
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,020
"M" stands for "milli?"

1006
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,880
Like millibyte.

1007
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,910
Millibyte?

1008
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,720
It's So Min's turn.

1009
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,060
Ready, go.

1010
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,030
- 1, 2, 3.
- Gal.

1011
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,890
- Gallon.
- Gallon.

1012
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,000
- It's the symbol of gallon.
- She doesn't know.

1013
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,260
- I don't know that.
- She said, "gal."

1014
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,660
- "Gal."
- That was funny.

1015
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,530
Se Chan told me to read it as "gal."

1016
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,130
He told me to say that.

1017
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,930
- It was difficult.
- Let's move on.

1018
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,600
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Gangnam!

1019
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,630
- Gangnam!
- Gangnam!

1020
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,310
If we could continue to your turn,

1021
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,310
- we'll win.
- We can do it.

1022
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,780
- I have to succeed.
- You can do it.

1023
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,480
- Jae Suk.
- Just two more questions.

1024
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,820
- We can win this.
- Then we'll win.

1025
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,590
- No reason to be nervous.
- Ready, go.

1026
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,590
- Go, go.
- 1, 2, 3.

1027
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,940
- Terabyte.
- Oh, wow.

1028
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,110
- You're so smart.
- Terabyte. Good job.

1029
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,180
- It's going to get more difficult.
- Let's do this.

1030
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,790
It's going to get more difficult.
I've seen everything I know.

1031
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,260
- I learned all of them.
- Ready, go.

1032
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,920
- 1, 2, 3.
- Helpagram.

1033
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,800
- Gosh. I can't believe you.
- What's that?

1034
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,470
Do you know what it is?

1035
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,000
(What is that?)

1036
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,190
Hectopascal.

1037
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,890
- He's so smart.
- Hectopascal.

1038
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,630
Gosh. You don't know hectopascal?

1039
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,360
He didn't get it right?

1040
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,170
- It's hectopascal.
- Suk Jin.

1041
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,840
That's the most basic unit
used in mathematics.

1042
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,340
Hey, this is the easiest question.
Hecto...

1043
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,750
- Exactly.
- Hectopascal!

1044
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,940
- Hectopascal.
- What is it?

1045
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,940
- What is it?
- What is it?

1046
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,910
Hectopascal is the unit of this.

1047
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,610
- What?
- The unit of this.

1048
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,850
The air... In mathematics...
You know, in the air...

1049
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,990
- Continue.
- Kwang Soo, this is 1hPa, right?

1050
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,450
- Yes, just this much.
- That's right.

1051
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,030
(He defined 1hPa as he wanted
since no one knew.)

1052
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,890
Gosh. What a shame.

1053
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,930
- Let's get three questions right.
- I don't know any math symbols.

1054
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,500
Each team has only one chance left.

1055
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,200
- Yes. You did well.
- These questions...

1056
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,770
I don't think you can get them right
even as teams.

1057
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,810
- Really?
- Let's give it a try.

1058
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,370
- Let us answer as a team.
- Let's make it a team game.

1059
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,670
- Let's do that.
- Anyone can answer.

1060
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,280
- Okay.
- Gangnam!

1061
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,750
- Gangnam!
- Gangnam!

1062
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,170
- Gangnam!
- Mapo!

1063
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,110
The team that gets
this question right will win.

1064
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,290
- Can we all answer?
- Yes

1065
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,290
- The last one.
- It's a team game.

1066
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,410
(The team that gets it right first
will get the final score!)

1067
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,290
- The last one.
- It's a team game, So Min.

1068
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,530
Ready, go.

1069
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,880
- That's...
- Omega.

1070
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,090
(- Omega!
- Isn't that Leo?)

1071
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,090
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1072
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,570
- Isn't that Leo?
- One...

1073
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,920
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1074
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,160
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

1075
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Sigma.

1076
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,360
- That must be...
- Anyone else?

1077
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,860
- Magma.
- Let me answer.

1078
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,040
- What?
- What did she say?

1079
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,600
- Anyone else?
- Magma.

1080
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,780
- Ohm?
- Let me answer.

1081
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,900
(Choa got the correct answer.)

1082
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,200
- What?
- What did she say?

1083
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,820
- Ohm.
- She got it right.

1084
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,110
- I'm so excited.
- What's an ohm?

1085
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,220
- Is there a unit called ohm?
- Yes, in science.

1086
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,220
My goodness. I got it right.

1087
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,520
- The unit of electrical resistance.
- I've heard of it somewhere.

1088
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,820
- Really?
- Awesome.

1089
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,320
- How do you know that?
- I've heard of it somewhere.

1090
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,910
- Choa did a great job.
- Gangnam!

1091
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,260
- Gangnam!
- Gangnam!

1092
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,490
I thought it was a pimple.

1093
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,890
(They look like
they've never heard of an ohm.)

1094
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,370
- Ohm?
- What is an ohm?

1095
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,370
(They look like
they've never heard of an ohm.)

1096
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,370
- Ohm?
- I got it right.

1097
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,370
The unit of electrical resistance.

1098
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,240
- We won an overwhelming victory.
- Let's move on to the second round.

1099
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,410
- Did we lose again?
- Again?

1100
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,410
We lost the first round?

1101
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,600
- It'll be the Initial Game.
- I'm good at this.

1102
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,870
Look at the initials...

1103
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,910
and guess the name
of the variety show.

1104
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,470
- Nice.
- I know a lot of them.

1105
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,240
- Don't worry about me.
- Sure.

1106
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,910
- Two from each team will compete.
- Really?

1107
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,550
- You two.
- You two can compete.

1108
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,910
All right.

1109
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,180
- Let's go.
- We've got this.

1110
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,030
- Then Choa...
- Go ahead.

1111
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,100
- She watched TV a lot.
- That's right.

1112
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,820
- Let's do this.
- Jong Kook's a good choice.

1113
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,820
- All right.
- Go ahead.

1114
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,660
Only the four can answer.

1115
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,660
- The rest must stay silent.
- Okay.

1116
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Ready, get set,

1117
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,260
go.

1118
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,840
(SMTM)

1119
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,100
Let me answer.

1120
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,740
- I don't know.
- Sada...

1121
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,680
- What is this?
- What can it be?

1122
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,050
- Is it a variety show?
- Yes, it is.

1123
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,240
I know what it is.

1124
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,820
- I know.
- It's a popular show.

1125
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,590
- What...
- Let me answer.

1126
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,680
"Popular Restaurant."

1127
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,160
There's a word that starts with T.

1128
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,050
It ends with "meeting."

1129
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,930
- No, that's not it.
- No clues are allowed.

1130
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,350
- That's not it.
- Don't help them.

1131
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,720
Why can't I?

1132
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,890
- That's not allowed.
- Why not?

1133
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,990
- What's that?
- Does she know?

1134
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,700
- She's giving you a clue.
- Gosh.

1135
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,070
Both teams could see,
so I'll allow it.

1136
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,070
- Why don't they know this?
- What is it?

1137
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,200
Let me answer!

1138
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,660
- What is it?
- Let me answer!

1139
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,840
"Show Me the Money."

1140
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,350
Boom, boom.

1141
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,220
(Se Chan receives the necklace that
advances him to the next round.)

1142
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,590
- What was this though?
- That was a tricky one.

1143
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,410
- The necklace.
- Oh, the necklace.

1144
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,590
It was a hard one.

1145
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,260
- So Min should compete.
- Go ahead.

1146
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,660
We'll swap players.

1147
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,530
- Go, So Min.
- Ready, set, go.

1148
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,260
Ready, set, go.

1149
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,930
(SH)

1150
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,030
- Let me answer.
- Sure.

1151
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,390
- "The Lee Kyung Sil Show."
- Wrong.

1152
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:06,490
- "The Lee Gyeong Gyu Show." No.
- I know what it is.

1153
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,800
It's the only thing
that comes to mind.

1154
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,240
- No...
- No?

1155
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,050
Suk Jin says the weirdest things...

1156
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,370
and then calls the staff
to have it edited out.

1157
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,870
It doesn't fit at all.

1158
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,640
What is it then?

1159
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,820
- Could it be that?
- It isn't.

1160
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,240
So that's what it is.

1161
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,160
(He talks brazenly
so that the film is easily edited.)

1162
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,680
That's what happens
when you're smart.

1163
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,950
I think I know what it is.

1164
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,450
- What is it?
- It's something like...

1165
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,620
"Baby's World."

1166
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,450
- "Baby's World?"
- I mean...

1167
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,370
- I mean it.
- Sae Ho!

1168
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,300
- There was a show by that name.
- As if.

1169
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,840
- "Baby's World?"
- "Baby's World?"

1170
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
- How about a clue?
- Sounds good.

1171
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,140
It aired on KBS
and one of you was on it.

1172
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,800
- Wouldn't it be Jae Suk?
- Who here...

1173
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,180
- was on KBS?
- It's either Jae Suk or me.

1174
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,510
Why?

1175
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,470
- You can't answer.
- You can't.

1176
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,220
(Kwang Soo figured it out,
but he can't say it out loud.)

1177
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,280
Is this it?

1178
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,410
What is it?

1179
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,910
(You were on this show!)

1180
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,260
Which show is it?
Is it one that you were on?

1181
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,890
- No!
- I know!

1182
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,350
Are you the one
associated with the show?

1183
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,620
Let me answer. It's "Six Heroines."

1184
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,700
Okay!

1185
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,220
(Team Gangnam answers correctly.)

1186
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,870
- Nicely done!
- "Six Heroines."

1187
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,600
Wow, "Six Heroines."

1188
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,370
So that was the answer.

1189
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,760
Let's take the lead from them.

1190
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,930
(Both teams scored once
in the second round.)

1191
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,930
Okay.

1192
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,200
I have a feeling
this will quickly be answered.

1193
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,600
- Let's do this.
- Here you go.

1194
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,870
"Infinite Challenge!"

1195
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,200
Nicely done.

1196
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,680
You didn't know
it was "Infinite Challenge?"

1197
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,910
It's been a while
since that was chanted.

1198
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,620
- It's too much of an advantage...
- It's been a while.

1199
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,350
for those who were on the show.

1200
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,260
They'd know immediately.

1201
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,030
They'd know immediately.

1202
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,550
- I was on the show too.
- It was their main show.

1203
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,260
Did you hear Sae Ho just now?

1204
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,430
He said he was on the show
in its last moments.

1205
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,490
Of course.

1206
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,300
(He chokes up for some reason.)

1207
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,990
- In the last few months...
- We celebrated your 100th day.

1208
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,490
(Sae Ho celebrated
his 100th day on the show.)

1209
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,530
We're sorry.

1210
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,100
He was on the show briefly
before it ended.

1211
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,870
We're sorry.

1212
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,680
- I was on it for 100 days.
- That's right.

1213
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,740
- And it ended a month later.
- 100 days?

1214
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,410
- Sae Ho...
- I now feel bad for him.

1215
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,910
I choked up for some reason.

1216
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,410
- Okay, let's keep going.
- Get ready.

1217
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,410
(EENO)

1218
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,490
- Yigatan...
- What's this?

1219
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,510
Yigatan?

1220
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,090
- Yigatan...
- Yigatan?

1221
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,260
I just threw it out there.

1222
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,260
(The smartest one
of the Empty Head Club knows.)

1223
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,350
Give them a hint.

1224
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,470
- In the direction of our team.
- Give them a hint.

1225
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,160
(He gives them a clue.)

1226
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,970
I don't think that's it.

1227
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,660
I know! Let me answer.
It's "Emergency Escape Number 1."

1228
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,300
(Jong Kook gets it right.)

1229
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,410
You were on that show.

1230
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,910
- I was the host.
- I was right.

1231
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,070
I hosted the show!

1232
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,180
(In 2012, 9 years ago,)

1233
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,620
(Jong Kook served
as Korea's keeper of safety.)

1234
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,620
We're lucky to have had
Jong Kook on our team.

1235
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,390
Ready, set, go.

1236
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,590
(AS)

1237
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,990
Darn it!

1238
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,160
(AS)

1239
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,530
- How do you know this?
- What's up with him?

1240
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,120
You were clueless
when you had to play.

1241
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,300
My gosh. This...

1242
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,820
It's easier to see
when you're a spectator.

1243
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,930
- I know.
- Not when you're playing though.

1244
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,970
(It only seems difficult
for those who are playing the game.)

1245
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,300
Let me answer.

1246
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,470
It's "Abnormal Summit."

1247
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,430
("Abnormal Summit")

1248
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,870
It suddenly came to me.

1249
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,450
This isn't easy.

1250
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,700
"Abnormal Summit."

1251
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,470
- Let's tie the score.
- Nice.

1252
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,640
- Go, Team Mapo.
- Go!

1253
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,570
- What?
- This is a tricky one.

1254
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,140
What's with the Ss?

1255
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,890
Let me answer.
"Laughing..." No, that's not it.

1256
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,390
- What can it be?
- What is it?

1257
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,030
Let me answer.
"Sunday to Sunday Night."

1258
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,620
("Sunday to Sunday Night")

1259
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,720
Nicely done.

1260
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,950
- Nice.
- You're on a roll.

1261
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,200
- Good job.
- I'm on a roll!

1262
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,370
Nicely done!

1263
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,100
- Go, Team Mapo.
- Go, Team Mapo.

1264
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,660
- Why don't you switch players?
- You guys are doing great.

1265
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,840
- Suk Jin...
- Those on the side...

1266
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,470
- But us two...
- We're...

1267
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,240
- How can you be so clueless?
- Well...

1268
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,680
Only Jong Kook
has been able to answer.

1269
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,410
- I'm completely clueless.
- Kwang Soo, why were you up there?

1270
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,510
What were you up to?

1271
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,180
- I displayed reactions.
- What were you doing up here?

1272
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,390
- Jong Kook...
- I couldn't figure them out.

1273
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,950
This is an oldie.

1274
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,680
(Which question will break the tie?)

1275
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,180
- And go.
- We need to score this time.

1276
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,320
- To...
- Let me answer.

1277
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,680
- "Our Joyful..."
- He's right.

1278
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,930
(OHS)

1279
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,100
- "Our Happy Saturday."
- "Our Happy Saturday."

1280
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,120
- "Our Happy Saturday!"
- That's the one.

1281
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,320
(Sae Ho managed
to pick up the answer.)

1282
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,490
- What?
- We were faster.

1283
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,890
- What did you say?
- "Our Happy Saturday."

1284
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,740
You thought of
"Our Joyful Young Days," didn't you?

1285
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,200
I was the fastest, but...

1286
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,740
It was "Our Happy Saturday."

1287
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,740
I should've quickly
said the other one.

1288
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,030
(The Initial Game is over.)

1289
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,200
No way.

1290
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,510
- I got confused.
- It's the total score that matters.

1291
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,070
- The total score?
- Is it the total score?

1292
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,570
- Yes, the total score.
- Right.

1293
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,780
- We all did a good job.
- Good job, guys.

1294
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,990
The winning team
after the two rounds of games...

1295
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,220
is Team Mapo.

1296
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,260
- Yes!
- Nice!

1297
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:25,200
- Mapo, Mapo, Mapo, Mapo
- Mapo, Mapo, Mapo, Mapo

1298
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,870
Mapo will get another slot
on the roulette.

1299
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,030
(Team Mapo wins another slot
on the roulette.)

1300
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,490
The next game will take place...

1301
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,600
at the Korean restaurant
in Dongbinggo-dong.

1302
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,800
Let's go!

1303
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,640
The other team won,
so we're headed in that direction.

1304
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,870
- Do we get to eat then?
- Bring us the tteokbokki!

1305
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,510
Let's head to the Korean restaurant.

1306
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,640
Ma'am, out of those five,

1307
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,010
please choose the three...

1308
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,640
who you think will enjoy
tteokbokki the most.

1309
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,160
Back when I used to
live around here,

1310
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,990
- I ate it a lot.
- I bought a lot of takeouts.

1311
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,280
I love you

1312
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,530
- I love you, ma'am
- Love you!

1313
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,490
Cho Sae Ho.

1314
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,720
Really? Why?

1315
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,320
- Because I sang?
- You seemed eager.

1316
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,570
Love, love, who said it was love?

1317
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,410
Who said it was love?

1318
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,600
- And Haha.
- Nice!

1319
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,100
And Ji Hyo. I'm sorry.

1320
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,950
- I'm a fan, you know.
- Thank you.

1321
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,680
Ji Hyo!

1322
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,680
She didn't even look at me once.

1323
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,320
You should've chosen another song.

1324
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,090
Winning isn't all that good.

1325
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,910
We all get some to taste,

1326
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,890
although I won't eat it.

1327
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,780
We shouldn't give in.

1328
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,430
- Exactly.
- Of course.

1329
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,990
- We're human beings for a reason.
- Right.

1330
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,390
- That's right.
- Think, people.

1331
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,120
Only animals
give in to their instincts.

1332
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,430
- Why don't I sit back?
- Sure.

1333
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,490
That makes us animals.

1334
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,160
Didn't you think of yourself
as an animal just now?

1335
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,760
(Barking)

1336
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,510
(Growling)

1337
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,930
Goodness.

1338
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,100
- That's how it's served?
- As a proper dish?

1339
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,370
(One-pot tteokbokki
is served to the winning team.)

1340
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,410
Ramyeon was added too.

1341
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,320
The seasoned dumplings
are to die for.

1342
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,970
That must be the seasoned dumplings.

1343
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,970
This we must have.

1344
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:57,140
There are ramyeon
and glass noodles. No way.

1345
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,010
Darn, this is so good.

1346
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,320
I haven't eaten here before, but...

1347
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,990
Smash a boiled egg in the sauce.

1348
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,890
Choa, you're not eating, are you?

1349
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,430
No way.

1350
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,870
This isn't what I like anyway.

1351
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,490
(While trying to convince himself,
he glances at the food.)

1352
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,700
Keep talking, guys.

1353
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,200
But this...

1354
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,470
- Choa.
- Yes?

1355
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,740
Why are you leaning forward?

1356
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,840
Think about how it'll be
at the end of the day.

1357
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,280
Guys, let's keep talking.

1358
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,720
Keep talking.

1359
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,510
Only an animal would give in.

1360
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,950
(I'm a human being.)

1361
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,140
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

1362
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,550
You're holding some of
the ramyeon, right?

1363
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,890
What...

1364
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,120
- It's obvious.
- No way.

1365
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,660
Someone's going to give in,

1366
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,160
so just eat and give up two slots.

1367
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,120
The dumplings and pickled radish
are to die for.

1368
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,200
Jae Suk!

1369
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,320
What?

1370
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,890
(He called Jae Suk just in case.)

1371
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,990
(He was already
in the middle of eating.)

1372
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,700
See? It's over now.

1373
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,030
Just eat!

1374
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,870
Unbelievable.

1375
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,430
(The restraints are off,
and now they start eating.)

1376
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,600
Are you all eating?

1377
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,700
Of course not.

1378
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,870
(They're having their fill.)

1379
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,510
Their mouths are already full.

1380
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,220
Jong Kook, endure this round...

1381
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,010
and enjoy the Korean cuisine
at the next restaurant.

1382
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,950
- Haha, look to your side.
- Why?

1383
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,350
(Jong Kook joins
the party of carbs.)

1384
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,550
The dumplings are amazing.

1385
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,620
We're the only ones
who aren't eating.

1386
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,260
How is this fair when we won?

1387
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,640
- We're on the winning team.
- This is unfair.

1388
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,490
- More dumplings, please.
- How can one not eat this?

1389
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,760
Team Mapo!

1390
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,930
I knew that Jae Suk would cave.

1391
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,680
Jae Suk and Kwang Soo.

1392
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,240
- I wasn't sure about Kwang Soo.
- His response was hilarious.

1393
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,350
- Anyway, I'm feeling great.
- Choa, you can sit here.

1394
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,550
- Sit over here.
- Sure.

1395
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,070
- I had just about enough.
- Put on your seat belt.

1396
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,780
- Put on your seat belt.
- Sure.

1397
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,350
It's been a year since I had that.

1398
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,550
(Is she in my seat?)

1399
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,320
- Suk Jin...
- Didn't you know?

1400
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,620
He saw Choa in his seat and...

1401
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,620
- Really?
- He gave her the stink-eye.

1402
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,120
- Should I...
- It's all right.

1403
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,070
- You can stay.
- This is hilarious.

1404
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,870
Suk Jin...

1405
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,930
- Why did you glare at Choa?
- I didn't.

1406
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,570
- I'm good.
- You glared at her.

1407
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,350
- You wanted her to move.
- Hardly.

1408
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,740
- I didn't glare at her.
- Choa.

1409
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,740
- He glared at her from outside.
- Tell me about it.

1410
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,070
- He was shooting lasers.
- That wasn't the case.

1411
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,220
Choa, don't let it get to you.

1412
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,220
Anyway, that was delicious.

1413
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,260
Nicely done.

1414
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,350
(They head to the next destination
that's closer to Mapo.)

1415
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,320
We'll cross Dongjak Bridge
to the north of the Han River.

1416
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,530
- Okay.
- Let's go!

1417
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,600
- Mapo, Mapo, Mapo, Mapo
- Mapo, Mapo, Mapo, Mapo

1418
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,100
(Okay, let's head toward Mapo!)

1419
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,990
- What's important though...
- It's meaningless.

1420
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:25,970
is that we end today's episode
in Gangnam.

1421
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,600
- At Dosan Park.
- Yes, that's more important.

1422
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,530
So we should come back to
Gangnam afterward...

1423
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,340
- and finish there.
- We should finish there.

1424
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,800
Sae Ho, you should talk.

1425
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,970
- Sorry?
- Me too.

1426
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:36,970
How can you just sit still?

1427
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:38,220
- That's not it.
- You ate the tteokbokki.

1428
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,550
- No, no. I...
- You're at work, you should talk.

1429
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:43,220
I'm a pro, so I should only
talk when it's needed.

1430
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,050
- This is the time for you to talk.
- Oh, really?

1431
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,780
My specialty is talking.

1432
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,620
I'm known as Talk Bomber.

1433
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,530
- "Bomber?"
- So when will you start talking?

1434
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,160
I can if you want me to,
but nobody wants me to talk.

1435
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,660
He became less witty
after he lost weight, right?

1436
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,160
Yes, he's way too boring now.

1437
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,890
Sae Ho, Jong Kook said you became
too boring after losing weight.

1438
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,370
He said you lost
your sensibility too.

1439
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,160
You became boring
after losing weight.

1440
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,030
Is Jong Kook really a good fighter?

1441
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,550
- I'm just curious. Is he that good?
- Yes, he is.

1442
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,050
He once fought against seven men.

1443
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,180
Against seven men?

1444
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,950
Before, even his back was funny
when he was sitting still.

1445
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,410
Jong Kook, it's because...

1446
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,680
Especially his fat neck.

1447
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,220
I shouldn't have lost that fat.

1448
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,090
- It's gone now.
- I miss it.

1449
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,220
I could've asked something like,
"Are there crumbs in between?"

1450
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,850
Now there's no fat on my neck.

1451
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,390
"Are there crumbs in between?"

1452
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,720
Between his neck rolls?

1453
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,030
Yes, between the rolls.

1454
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,120
- It's cute.
- I just can't have it all.

1455
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,470
So I chose to be healthy instead.

1456
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,470
I got a medical check-up recently.

1457
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:36,740
- Are you much healthier now?
- My cholesterol level...

1458
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,930
- got much lower.
- Sae Ho.

1459
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,010
Try to talk less.

1460
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,600
But you wanted me
to talk more earlier.

1461
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,140
- But you need to be quiet now.
- Oh, should I?

1462
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,180
We're driving past
a residential area,

1463
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,180
so we need to be quiet.

1464
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,350
I don't see any houses though.

1465
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,010
- Stay quiet.
- This is really hard.

1466
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,390
- We're in a residential area.
- Oh, okay.

1467
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,160
- But we're on a bus.
- People who work late...

1468
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,490
- might still be sleeping.
- Okay.

1469
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,930
Sae Ho always says this when I
run into him at a fitness center.

1470
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,160
"What's wrong with Jae Suk?"

1471
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,120
I always say,
"What's with Jae Suk?"

1472
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,470
- Hey, Sae Ho.
- Yes, Jae Suk?

1473
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:04,840
Can you show us how Kwang Soo
works out?

1474
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,490
- I think Kwang Soo...
- Let's see what he does.

1475
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,760
lifts weights that he can't handle.

1476
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,140
- That's kind of true.
- So...

1477
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,530
- Normally, people do it like this.
- This one's funny.

1478
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,370
- But he goes like this.
- Come on!

1479
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,780
(His whole body shakes to
lift the weights he can't handle.)

1480
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,850
I don't do that!

1481
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,490
- I'd ask, "Why are you doing this?"
- I don't lift like that.

1482
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,090
- That's so true.
- What are you talking about?

1483
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,140
Yes, you do that.

1484
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,050
- He lifts weights like this.
- Kwang Soo does it like that.

1485
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,320
Kwang Soo always does this.

1486
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,490
- Come on.
- When he works on his biceps,

1487
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,300
he goes like this.

1488
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,070
(He makes so much noise as if he
bears all the weight of the world.)

1489
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,370
- So I thought he was about to die.
- I know.

1490
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,760
So why do you always do this?

1491
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,800
- Why would you do this?
- I do it unconsciously.

1492
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,140
You need to stick your tongue out
to use your strength.

1493
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,340
Yes, that helps me
get more strength.

1494
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,300
- So why would you...
- He only does it to show off.

1495
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,470
When Jae Suk sees me
or Sae Ho at the fitness center,

1496
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,970
he always points out our postures.

1497
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,780
But when someone like
Gong Yoo comes,

1498
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,510
his lips go dry right away.

1499
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,820
(When Jae Suk meets a top celeb,
his lips go dry.)

1500
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,120
- Because they're top stars.
- Hey, hey!

1501
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,780
- Because they're top stars.
- Hey, hey!

1502
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,930
- Hey!
- "Hi, Gong Yoo."

1503
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,680
He gets nervous in front of
top stars.

1504
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,620
- He'd bow as he waves.
- Hey, hey!

1505
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,620
- He'd also walk humbly.
- That's total nonsense.

1506
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,260
He's been nervous in front
of top stars all his life.

1507
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:12,140
- Gong Yoo is younger than me.
- He's always nervous.

1508
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,890
Gong Yoo is younger than me,
you see.

1509
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,160
(They are all boastful
at the fitness center.)

1510
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,430
It's so funny.

1511
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,280
Anyway, it's really fun to have
Sae Ho here after a long time.

1512
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,780
You can get off at the bus stop.

1513
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,280
- He can go home now?
- He should leave quietly?

1514
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,780
You're lucky.
The ending is the hard part.

1515
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,070
You can go home now.

1516
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,550
- But he actually...
- You did enough.

1517
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:32,010
- talked a lot today.
- Thank you for today.

1518
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,090
- It was so fun today.
- Thank you so much for coming.

1519
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,180
Can you show how Kwang Soo
lifts weights before you leave?

1520
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,100
(Doing an encore
of making much fuss)

1521
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,890
(Fully using his facial muscles)

1522
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,490
We're crossing the bridge now.
This is nice.

1523
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:46,340
- We're now...
- This is what makes it so fun!

1524
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,370
- We're going to Mapo now!
- Mapo is indeed great.

1525
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,470
(They move to their next spot
by crossing Dongjak Bridge.)

1526
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,570
- What is this place?
- It's so nice!

1527
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,010
- It's pretty!
- This place is so pretty!

1528
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,700
This place is nice.

1529
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,070
The atmosphere is a little...

1530
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,200
What is this place?
How come it's so pretty?

1531
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,370
I love this place.

1532
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,240
It's pretty.

1533
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,590
The weather is so nice.

1534
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,120
It's spring now.

1535
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,660
But there's so much fine dust.

1536
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,160
- What are you talking about?
- Today's weather is the worst.

1537
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,320
- I know too.
- There's so much fine dust.

1538
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,030
- I'm just saying it's warm.
- The sky is covered with dust.

1539
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,490
Look how the flowers bloomed.

1540
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,220
It's magnolia. Magnolias are
the prettiest in March.

1541
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,840
Out of 12, Team Mapo filled up 8.

1542
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,340
And Team Gangnam filled up four.

1543
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,510
- We only filled up four?
- This is annoying.

1544
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,840
- Yes.
- That's it.

1545
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,930
This is the current status.

1546
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,140
We need to win this mission.

1547
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,340
But we won twice.

1548
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,470
- We just need to win.
- But this is...

1549
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,470
This game is advantageous
to Jong Kook.

1550
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,510
This game is made for Jong Kook.

1551
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:33,910
All right, let's do this!

1552
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,590
It looks like a pillow fight.

1553
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,490
It's obviously a pillow fight.

1554
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,620
This mission will increase your will
to go home from the designated spot.

1555
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,120
It's called The Outlaw on the Road.

1556
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,950
The game will begin with everyone
on the balance beam.

1557
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,070
- We'll all be seated.
- We'll be seated.

1558
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,600
The one who wins rock-paper-scissors
will start first...

1559
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,640
and attack the other team.

1560
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,700
You can get back up on the beam.

1561
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,570
- Oh, we can get back up on it.
- It's over once everyone's out.

1562
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,840
- I see.
- Okay, I got it.

1563
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,840
It's simple, right?

1564
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,930
- This is...
- We'll win for sure.

1565
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,470
- Jong Kook is on our team, so...
- Do you want to go last, Jong Kook?

1566
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,700
But the game is...

1567
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,740
- I can go last.
- It's meant for Jong Kook.

1568
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,470
- The outlaw is Jong Kook.
- The last one remaining wins.

1569
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,450
The last one to remain wins, right?

1570
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,950
We'll have Jong Kook go last.

1571
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,450
That's a relief. Thank you.

1572
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,030
- You'll go last?
- No.

1573
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,320
I'm not good at this.

1574
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,680
You should hit Jong Kook.

1575
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,890
- Think about it.
- That's right. You should show us.

1576
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:20,890
- You should hit him.
- Show us what you can do.

1577
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,490
You've been slain by him
all this time.

1578
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,160
He's been attacking you.
That's enough reason to hit him.

1579
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,660
You should go up against him.
Show us what you can do.

1580
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,100
- Here, Sae Ho. You're the tail.
- Really? I'm going last?

1581
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,240
I'm going last?

1582
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,600
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1583
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,530
You can't attack them.

1584
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:34,780
- Yes, he can!
- Why can't I? I can.

1585
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,410
- Can you really?
- He can attack them right away.

1586
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,510
Besides, Kwang Soo will be
sitting before him.

1587
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,240
I'll do my best so he doesn't
have to hurt the women.

1588
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,370
- You're so reliable.
- Of course.

1589
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:43,220
- I'll do my best so that...
- He's so reliable.

1590
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,390
Kwang Soo will get rid of them.

1591
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,410
- Get up here, Choa.
- Okay!

1592
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:46,820
- This is hard though.
- We crouch down here?

1593
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,090
All right, let's go now.

1594
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,350
Choa, sit here.

1595
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:51,660
- My nemesis. We finally meet.
- I'm finally meeting you.

1596
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,490
I think I'll lose to her though.

1597
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:55,620
Everyone should sit on it.

1598
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,870
If they fall by themselves,

1599
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,100
- they're out, right?
- Yes.

1600
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,030
All right. Play rock-paper-scissors.

1601
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,140
(The match between the weakest,
Suk Jin versus So Min))

1602
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,760
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1603
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,280
You can hit each other in turn.

1604
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,200
You should kill her at once!

1605
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,870
You should kill her at once.

1606
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,300
(Gathering his strength)

1607
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:11,950
(Hitting)

1608
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,740
- All right! I stood it.
- Kill her at once.

1609
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,820
It's your turn, So Min.

1610
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:17,390
- You need to hit him, So Min.
- If you hit...

1611
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,780
(Hitting)

1612
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,220
(Oh, gosh! That darn...)

1613
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,660
- All right!
- All right!

1614
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,260
Did he just curse at her?

1615
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,720
- What did he say?
- I mean...

1616
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,120
Please edit that part out.

1617
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,700
I accidentally blurted it out.

1618
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,470
- Choa!
- Yes.

1619
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,200
I apologize, dear viewers.

1620
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,470
Please move one seat forward.

1621
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,570
You just need to keep your balance.

1622
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,010
- But this is...
- It's hard to keep my balance.

1623
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,950
- It's hard.
- It's hard even for me.

1624
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,050
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1625
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,050
- All right!
- No!

1626
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,070
(So Min gets to attack first.)

1627
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,070
- Hit her hard.
- Bear with it.

1628
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,510
- You need to bear with it.
- Bear with it.

1629
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,010
- Hit her hard.
- Go.

1630
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,280
- You need to bear with it.
- Bear with it.

1631
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,450
- That was good! Good job!
- She withstood it!

1632
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,930
(She faltered a little,
but she got back up.)

1633
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,660
- That was good! Good job!
- She withstood it!

1634
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,100
- Good job, Choa.
- Choa is really strong.

1635
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,720
- Hit her.
- Do not go easy on her.

1636
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,160
Don't you go easy on her.

1637
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,140
You saw it, right? Hey, hey.

1638
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,740
What was that?

1639
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,700
You saw it, right? Hey, hey.

1640
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,870
(What?)

1641
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:12,800
(She hung on so well,)

1642
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,300
(but she falls on her own
as though she's drunk.)

1643
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,300
- What was that?
- All right!

1644
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,200
- This is driving me crazy.
- She's so weak.

1645
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,820
- Everyone is so weak.
- Choa. This is driving me crazy.

1646
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,820
Gosh, this is difficult.

1647
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,180
(So Min wins 2 times in a row.)

1648
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,490
You can fall on your own.

1649
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,120
So Min, the nation's favorite man
is here.

1650
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,950
- This isn't as easy as it looks.
- All right.

1651
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,050
- I'm not sure.
- Let's play this.

1652
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:30,760
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1653
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,490
(So Min gets to attack first.)

1654
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,600
Gosh, this is crazy.

1655
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,820
- You won, So Min?
- Yes.

1656
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:36,720
Don't be flustered, Jae Suk.

1657
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,490
- Hang on at least once.
- This is...

1658
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,260
- Aim for his temple.
- This is...

1659
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,700
(Aim for his temple!)

1660
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,140
- His temple?
- Yes, that's the most...

1661
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,510
- Like this?
- Don't be flustered.

1662
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,800
Look at that ugly... That's it.

1663
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,070
(Hitting hard)

1664
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,280
That's it.

1665
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,070
All right!

1666
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,050
(She hit him right on the temple,)

1667
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,570
(but she fell on her own.)

1668
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,990
- What was that?
- That's it.

1669
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,320
- That's it! I got this.
- I got greedy.

1670
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,510
I'm out if I fall
while moving up, right?

1671
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:01,590
Of course.

1672
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,030
- But this is...
- It's really difficult though.

1673
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:04,550
Be careful not to fall
while moving up.

1674
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,620
Ji Hyo looks so indifferent.

1675
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,950
Look at her uninterested face.

1676
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,300
While moving...

1677
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,430
Show us, Ji Hyo.

1678
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,390
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1679
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,430
- All right. Hit her hard.
- Ji Hyo.

1680
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,700
- Jae Suk.
- Put strength in your legs, Ji Hyo.

1681
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,030
Don't go easy on her.

1682
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,740
- Ji Hyo!
- What's with Ji Hyo's expression?

1683
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,910
She looks sleepy.

1684
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,600
- All right.
- I hit her hard though.

1685
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,870
I hit her hard though.

1686
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:24,870
That was a fake shot.

1687
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:26,570
It didn't hurt her,
but it made her feel bad.

1688
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,850
That was a fake shot.

1689
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:28,890
- All right.
- It didn't hurt her,

1690
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,320
but it made her feel bad.

1691
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,090
- Hey, how could you...
- That was...

1692
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:33,950
(Hey...)

1693
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,720
That's just hitting him in the face.

1694
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,320
She didn't hit him to make him fall!

1695
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,220
That wasn't meant for me to fall.

1696
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,300
She just hit him.

1697
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,320
Ji Hyo.

1698
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,390
(It's Jae Suk's turn
to attack back.)

1699
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,470
(He only made a fuss.)

1700
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,300
Hey, hey.
Why did you hit her so lightly?

1701
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,840
(Ji Hyo attacks back right away.)

1702
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,140
(Laughing)

1703
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,470
Come on!

1704
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,430
(He trembles and falls on his own.)

1705
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,180
Ji Hyo fell as well.

1706
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,410
(After Jae Suk fell,)

1707
00:52:58,410 --> 00:52:59,510
Come on!

1708
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,350
(Ji Hyo's foot touched the ground.)

1709
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,820
Ji Hyo fell as well.

1710
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,510
Ji Hyo fell as well!

1711
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,320
- You're out.
- I'm out?

1712
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,450
- You're out.
- You're out, Ji Hyo.

1713
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,450
You two fell at the same time.

1714
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,490
It's hard to keep my balance
on the beam.

1715
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,620
- Kwang Soo!
- Yes.

1716
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,820
- It's hard to keep my balance.
- Don't fall. It'll be for nothing.

1717
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,490
Haha, show us what you can do.

1718
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,640
That's right.
You should grab it like that.

1719
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,100
- Look how he's grabbing it.
- This is...

1720
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,100
(He comes up with a lethal move
he used to use when he was young.)

1721
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,600
Kwang Soo... Look at Haha.

1722
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,240
- Kwang Soo, we must win.
- Okay.

1723
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,370
Ready or not

1724
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,430
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1725
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,800
(Kwang Soo gets to attack first.)

1726
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,350
- Okay. Kill him with one blow.
- Kill him with one blow.

1727
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:33,910
(Hitting hard)

1728
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,010
All right!

1729
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,620
(Darn it!)

1730
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,760
- All right.
- Well done.

1731
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,260
- Well done!
- Kwang Soo.

1732
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,180
- Well done, Kwang Soo.
- That was great.

1733
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,680
I think he put something
in his pillow.

1734
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,850
No, I didn't.

1735
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:46,600
- I didn't put anything in.
- You must win rock-paper-scissors.

1736
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,300
Let's go, let's go.

1737
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,320
Wait a minute. I hit Haha,
but I got tteokbokki on my pillow.

1738
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,030
- Isn't it his blood?
- It's tteokbokki.

1739
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,990
(The stain from the tteokbokki
Haha had earlier)

1740
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:56,300
Hey, Kwang Soo!

1741
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,780
- Kwang Soo, you need to win.
- You need to win.

1742
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,180
- You must win rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's do this!

1743
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,950
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors

1744
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,570
- Rock-paper-scissors
- All right.

1745
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,870
- Darn you.
- Show us, Se Chan.

1746
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,620
Are you at home or something?

1747
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,550
- What are you doing?
- It feels like I'm watching TV.

1748
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,890
I'm just watching TV.

1749
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,180
Ji Hyo.

1750
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,530
Hey, Kwang Soo!

1751
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,430
- Kwang Soo, you need to win.
- You need to win.

1752
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,200
- You must win rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's do this!

1753
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:22,220
I should hit you here.

1754
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,700
Or should I hit him like this
to hurt him?

1755
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,490
Kwang Soo, he might hit you
from the back.

1756
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,370
- You need to be careful.
- You should watch out.

1757
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:30,140
- You need to grab it like this.
- Don't hit me, okay?

1758
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,840
(Hitting right in the face)

1759
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,050
(Kwang Soo fell weakly
after getting slapped on the side.)

1760
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,570
- That worked.
- It's hard not to fall!

1761
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,490
It's hard not to fall
after getting hit like that.

1762
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,640
- That's the way!
- Well done!

1763
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,220
- We still have a chance.
- It hurt.

1764
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:48,680
It was impossible to bear with it.

1765
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,680
- We still have a chance.
- Jong Kook.

1766
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,890
Jong Kook.
You should win rock-paper-scissors.

1767
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,220
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- It was impossible to bear with it.

1768
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,660
- Jong Kook, we believe in you.
- Where do I sit? Here?

1769
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,990
Jong Kook, it all
depends on you now.

1770
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,470
- This is...
- I might have a chance...

1771
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:57,570
to get back at him.

1772
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,030
- It's a golden opportunity.
- You must win.

1773
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,390
It's a golden opportunity
to hit Jong Kook.

1774
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:01,840
No, I'll lose, so you can hit him.

1775
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,260
- Okay.
- Just kill them all right away.

1776
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,260
(Team Gangnam cannot
back away anymore.)

1777
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,470
You need to win against him first.

1778
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,510
(Team Mapo
must hit Jong Kook first.)

1779
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,970
- This is hard.
- Please.

1780
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,370
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1781
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,740
- All right. We got this.
- This is good.

1782
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,240
- We can win this round!
- You can bear with it, Jong Kook.

1783
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,510
(You can bear with it, Jong Kook!)

1784
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,090
Se Chan, you're so cool too.

1785
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:17,910
Let me finish you at once.

1786
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,120
I'm going to hit his thick thighs...

1787
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,280
and finish him at once.

1788
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,780
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- This isn't a pillow.

1789
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,160
- It's a bag of rice.
- You must win.

1790
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,950
- I'm going to make him fall.
- You need to...

1791
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,390
You should make him fall even if
you fall with him.

1792
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,390
- Okay.
- Yes, you should do that.

1793
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,160
Just imagine that you're
on the top of a mountain.

1794
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,240
- You must win.
- One...

1795
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,300
(Faltering)

1796
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,910
He withstood it!

1797
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,930
(Se Chan failed to finish him.)

1798
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:43,180
(He withstood it!)

1799
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,680
- I'm dead now.
- We got this.

1800
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,410
- We got this!
- We got this!

1801
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,550
You brats. You're over now.

1802
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,590
You're all over.

1803
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:54,320
- You're over.
- I'm dead. I'm dead now.

1804
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,050
- I'm dead now.
- Se Chan!

1805
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,030
(Burning with anger)

1806
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,300
(The muscular monster
is gathering his energy.)

1807
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,370
The way Se Chan hit Jong Kook
must've offended him.

1808
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,070
(You're dead now.)

1809
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,470
(The boatman to the afterlife
is slowly rowing his pillow.)

1810
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:08,570
- Bear it. You can do this.
- It's been a while.

1811
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:09,740
- Clench your teeth.
- All right.

1812
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,470
Look at Sae Ho. He's going next.

1813
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,570
(Pale)

1814
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,570
(Will Se Chan be able to
bear with it?)

1815
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,850
- All right!
- No!

1816
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:22,410
(No!)

1817
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,950
(Will Jong Kook fall with Se Chan?)

1818
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,160
He made it, he made it.

1819
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,950
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Kim Jong Kook!

1820
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,720
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Kim Jong Kook! Well done!

1821
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,070
(It will never work.)

1822
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,570
(It looks like he's already
been dead 3 times over.)

1823
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:40,570
- Sae Ho, you can't bear it.
- Show us, Sae Ho.

1824
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:41,990
You only need to win
in rock-paper-scissors!

1825
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,030
(It's the last match
on the guillotine.)

1826
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,760
- You need to finish him at once.
- Seriously...

1827
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,470
The winning team
will be able to eat...

1828
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,640
and stick their sticker
on the roulette.

1829
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,070
- Hey, hey.
- We must win this.

1830
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,470
- Finish him at once.
- It's over if we lose in this game.

1831
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,570
- Finish him.
- Cho Sae Ho!

1832
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,620
I'll get revenge on him
for all the humiliation I got.

1833
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,620
That's right!

1834
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,950
You'll get a chance
if you win in rock-paper-scissors.

1835
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,490
- Here we go, Sae Ho.
- Rock...

1836
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:00,890
Rock-paper-scissors

1837
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,850
You just need to win.

1838
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,120
Men always go for paper.

1839
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,180
Rock-paper-scissors

1840
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,260
- Oh, no!
- All right, we got this.

1841
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,570
- All right.
- Jong Kook, let's make this fun.

1842
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:10,570
(He begs for mercy, saying
they should make the show fun.)

1843
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,820
Let's make this fun.

1844
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,990
It's over.

1845
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,840
No, he can bear with it.

1846
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,910
It'll be hard for him
to keep his balance.

1847
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:18,840
I think he'll just fall on his own
if Jong Kook stalls for time.

1848
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,240
- His legs will go numb.
- You can't do that with your hand.

1849
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,780
- It's really scary.
- First...

1850
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,240
Should I hit you from the bottom?

1851
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,010
- Or from the side?
- I should've won.

1852
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,180
How do you want me to hit?

1853
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,780
- Give me a chance, seriously.
- Come work out at my center.

1854
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,780
Okay, I will.

1855
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,780
(Will there be a twist?)

1856
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,780
Look at his face.

1857
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:48,690
Please give me a chance.

1858
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,260
(There was no twist.)

1859
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,030
(Please give me a chance.)

1860
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,170
(He neatly got rid of Sae Ho.)

1861
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,460
- All right!
- Yes!

1862
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,480
- Yes!
- Yes!

1863
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,380
- All right!
- Well done!

1864
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,280
- All right!
- It's impossible to beat him.

1865
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,320
I should've hit Jong Kook
and fell with him.

1866
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,090
I should've won
in rock-paper-scissors.

1867
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:12,050
We'll now move back to
the tteokbokki place in Gangnam.

1868
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,530
- What?
- What?

1869
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,320
(Going back
to the same tteokbooki place)

1870
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,760
- What?
- We're going back to Gangnam?

1871
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,360
- We're going there again?
- Yes, we are.

1872
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,920
But if we win the mission there,

1873
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,360
we need to come back
to this place again.

1874
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,760
We won't be skipping it?

1875
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,400
- Let us have some dessert.
- We're not skipping it?

1876
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,860
- We won't be skipping it?
- We're going back.

1877
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,360
And we will...

1878
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,480
add Team Gangnam's sticker.

1879
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,130
- So then... All right.
- All right, we got it.

1880
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:32,670
- We're eating here though, right?
- Yes, you will.

1881
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,880
- Nice!
- Let's move inside.

1882
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,280
I thought you were jumping.

1883
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,710
But it's better for us
to end the shoot in Mapo.

1884
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,780
(Spring vegetable seafood jeon
filled with the scent of spring)

1885
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,980
That looks so good.

1886
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,150
What's this?

1887
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,780
That seafood wonton looks so good.

1888
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,090
It looks so good!

1889
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,650
I like this type of food.

1890
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:50,960
(An appetite booster meal
for spring)

1891
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,500
(The losing team will get
only 3 pieces of jeon.)

1892
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,230
- They're wontons.
- Wontons.

1893
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,300
We need to eat healthy food.

1894
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,360
This looks really good.

1895
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,670
As you know, only three people
that the owner picks...

1896
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,110
from the winning team...

1897
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,480
- can have the meal.
- This is so...

1898
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,380
I really want to eat this.

1899
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,050
It smells great though.

1900
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:11,670
This type of meal will keep you full
the whole day.

1901
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,480
We don't need to eat, do we?

1902
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,650
I won't eat.

1903
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:15,780
We don't need to eat.

1904
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,420
I'm still full.

1905
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,460
Tell me how it tastes later.

1906
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:21,880
This is...

1907
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,050
- Hello, sir!
- My gosh, sir.

1908
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

1909
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,090
(Ha Myung Soo, the manager
of the Korean restaurant)

1910
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,300
(They butter him up
and give him a shout.)

1911
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,760
- He's handsome.
- Sir.

1912
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,260
- It tastes so good.
- It's such high-quality food.

1913
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,730
So you're the one
who made these dishes!

1914
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,570
- They're going overboard.
- No matter...

1915
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,340
No matter how desperate you are,
you can't say it tastes good...

1916
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,170
- when you haven't even tasted it.
- I really want to eat it.

1917
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,550
I feel alive after eating this.

1918
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,880
Among five of them,

1919
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,280
you can pick three of whom
you'd like to taste your food.

1920
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,480
I can eat very well.

1921
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,590
- When it comes to healthy food...
- You look so good in your uniform.

1922
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,690
- I can eat it really well.
- I eat very well too.

1923
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,380
My name is Myung Soo,

1924
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,690
- Myung Soo?
- so I'll pick Jae Suk.

1925
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,690
(Nice choice.)

1926
00:59:57,690 --> 00:59:59,190
Thank you so much, Captain Ha.

1927
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:00,360
How is that related?

1928
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,400
- But what does that have to do...
- So what if his name is Myung Soo?

1929
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,030
I was a big fan
of "Infinite Challenge."

1930
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,400
I need to be wherever Myung Soo is.

1931
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,760
But Myung Soo is...

1932
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,860
Please pick the rest.

1933
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,210
I'll pick Jong Kook
as I'm his huge fan.

1934
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,280
- My goodness.
- He's healthy.

1935
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,480
(Heartfelt double thumbs up)

1936
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:18,710
He needs to pick Choa next.

1937
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,320
- Of course.
- Sir.

1938
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,980
- First of all...
- Are you going to pick Choa?

1939
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,260
- Mr. Ha Myung Soo.
- No...

1940
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,260
- Then I will...
- Among all the restaurants,

1941
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:29,280
- I think your food is the best.
- pick Choa.

1942
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,590
(He picks Choa without hesitation.)

1943
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,630
Move over. Move, move.

1944
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,820
- Go away.
- Move.

1945
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,630
- He's good. My gosh.
- Move.

1946
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,260
- It's no joke.
- Tteokbokki is the best.

1947
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,670
I've never had this before.

1948
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,360
Jong Kook, you can stand here.
I'll go over there.

1949
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,380
Suk Jin, can you move?

1950
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,880
But... Hey.

1951
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:46,170
I can stay seated, can't I?

1952
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,980
But it's a seat for us to eat.

1953
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,670
Hey, Team Mapo!

1954
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,780
- I'm so jealous of them.
- You can't eat!

1955
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,010
I won't eat.

1956
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,380
- Seriously.
- I ate a lot earlier.

1957
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,210
Don't you dare eat it.

1958
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,780
(He conducts a random check
when he's eaten it already.)

1959
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,960
So Min, you finished
the whole thing.

1960
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,230
I see that you cleared your dish.

1961
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,090
What are you saying?

1962
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:10,000
You ate all the jeon
except the vegetable jeon.

1963
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
What?

1964
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,400
What does it taste like?

1965
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,210
My gosh, Haha.

1966
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:16,630
You just had a bite
of the vegetable jeon.

1967
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,170
Are you serious?

1968
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:20,510
- What's going on?
- I can't believe this.

1969
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,380
You're nasty, you dirty mustache!

1970
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,210
- What's wrong?
- Haha just told us...

1971
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:27,010
not to eat, but he's enjoying it
like a course meal.

1972
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:29,050
What kind of team are we?

1973
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,280
(Team Mapo's teamwork is the worst.)

1974
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,420
I'm going to have it.
I'll just eat it.

1975
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,420
I'm going to eat it now.

1976
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,320
I'm going to eat it now.

1977
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,900
(Empty dish)

1978
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,920
Do you have a death wish?

1979
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,940
(He smiles widely
out of embarrassment.)

1980
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:44,960
You were eating...

1981
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,960
(How dare you?)

1982
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,730
How can you do this?

1983
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:48,760
(Team Mapo could not overcome
the temptation.)

1984
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,380
How is the octopus rice?

1985
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,780
- The octopus rice...
- Is it good?

1986
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:52,780
It's aromatic.

1987
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,880
The octopus rice is aromatic?

1988
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,210
- This is...
- The octopus rice...

1989
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:57,440
- It's savory.
- is really savory.

1990
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,010
Wow, this is really soft.

1991
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,880
The beef jeon was made out
of Korean beef.

1992
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,050
- No, you can't.
- Oh, really?

1993
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:03,420
Se Chan, help me out.

1994
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,590
- Force me to eat.
- What?

1995
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:06,380
But this is really good.

1996
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,260
No, no! Don't do this!

1997
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,000
Don't! Stop it!

1998
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,960
(He heads to the table as if
someone forced him to.)

1999
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,460
(Shoving his head to the dish)

2000
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,190
(Devouring the whole thing)

2001
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,230
- Hey!
- He forced Kwang Soo to eat.

2002
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:22,440
- This is...
- He wanted me to force him.

2003
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,670
- Hey!
- He had a bite.

2004
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,130
He asked me to push him
to the table.

2005
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,440
What was that?

2006
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:28,780
Did you have a bite?

2007
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,010
- For goodness' sake.
- Suk Jin said...

2008
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,210
My goodness.

2009
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,980
He asked me to push him
to the table.

2010
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,690
Let's move to the next location.

2011
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,380
- Are we really going back?
- Tteokbokki?

2012
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,550
- I even took photos with the owner.
- I will stay here.

2013
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,300
Go ahead.

2014
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,630
We are crossing Dongjak Bridge
for the third time.

2015
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,420
- We came back to this place
- For goodness' sake.

2016
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,960
We took photos with the owner
and said our farewells.

2017
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:53,760
This is...

2018
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,460
a famous tteokbokki place in Banpo.

2019
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,780
- Really?
- Their tteokbokki is delicious.

2020
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,880
Their tteokbokki is delicious.

2021
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,130
They serve incredible tteokbokki.

2022
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:00,340
- Listen.
- It's the best.

2023
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,750
- Top 10 tteokbokki places in Korea.
- That's right.

2024
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,570
I said goodbye to the owner
not too long ago.

2025
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,420
We even took a group photo.

2026
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,780
Seasoned dumplings are amazing.

2027
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,460
I said, "I will visit again."

2028
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,690
- You visited again.
- Seriously.

2029
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:13,820
You kept your promise.

2030
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,730
I bet the owner didn't know
we would come back so soon.

2031
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,130
We came back after an hour.

2032
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,320
This mission will give you...

2033
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,400
the patience to endure
the heavy traffic on your way home.

2034
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,920
It's Open Your Mouth.

2035
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,360
Pick two shellfish of your choice...

2036
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,170
- and grill them on your brazier.
- Okay.

2037
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:31,130
The team with the shellfish
that opens the latest will lose.

2038
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,510
Okay, okay.

2039
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:35,010
- It's time to pick the shellfish.
- Okay.

2040
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:37,840
Some open faster than others.

2041
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,980
Some don't open at all.

2042
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,280
- Really?
- Some don't open at all.

2043
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,820
It all depends on luck.

2044
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,860
Kwang Soo, pick two
and put them on the table.

2045
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,230
Let's take turns.

2046
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,820
I will pick the big ones.

2047
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,000
The big ones. Okay.

2048
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,630
The bigger ones?

2049
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,070
What was the name of the game?
Shut the Mouth?

2050
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,500
- Open Your Mouth.
- Open Your Mouth.

2051
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,530
Hey.

2052
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,440
- "Shut the Mouth?"
- "Shut the Mouth?"

2053
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,710
Why would that be the name?

2054
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,130
(Why would the name be
"Shut the Mouth?")

2055
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,570
Get ready.

2056
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,010
(They are ready
for Open Your Mouth.)

2057
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,210
Let's do this, Team Mapo!

2058
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,250
Let's go, Team Mapo!

2059
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,300
Let's go, Team Gangnam!

2060
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:10,380
1, 2, 3.

2061
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:11,880
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2062
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,210
(They carefully put the shellfish
on the brazier.)

2063
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:17,010
Don't hit them.

2064
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:18,980
The fire is becoming stronger.

2065
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,650
It might be best
to leave it as it is.

2066
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:22,380
Let's go. Let's go.

2067
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,420
(Se Chan focuses on
the big scallop.)

2068
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,500
It opened. It opened its mouth.

2069
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,460
(Se Chan's scallop opens up
like his protruding mouth.)

2070
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,570
Did it open already?

2071
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,130
- Se Chan's shellfish opened.
- Already?

2072
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,010
It opened.

2073
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,780
- It opened.
- Scallops open faster.

2074
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,070
- It opened.
- It opened.

2075
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,480
What's wrong with my shellfish?

2076
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,300
- It opened.
- Scallops open faster.

2077
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,750
- My shellfish opened.
- Did it open?

2078
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:44,840
It opened. It opened.

2079
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,590
- This one opened, right?
- It needs to open further.

2080
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:49,920
- Both of my shellfish opened. Yes!
- Both of my shellfish opened.

2081
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,210
- Se Chan succeeded.
- Okay!

2082
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:52,690
- How about Choa?
- One at a time.

2083
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:53,980
- Grill one at a time.
- What?

2084
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:55,050
What's wrong with my shellfish?

2085
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,590
Two shellfish.

2086
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:57,760
Okay. I succeeded.

2087
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:00,500
- So Min's shellfish opened.
- Both of them opened.

2088
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,900
My shellfish opened.

2089
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,440
- Your shellfish opened.
- They opened. I am done.

2090
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,070
Okay. My shellfish opened.

2091
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,400
Haha, your shellfish will open.

2092
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,070
- Kwang Soo.
- My shellfish opened.

2093
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:11,110
Kwang Soo.

2094
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:13,400
Now, Kwang Soo, Sae Ho,
and Haha remain.

2095
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,170
- They opened.
- They opened.

2096
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,750
(Kwang Soo's scallops
finally begin to open.)

2097
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:18,750
- One more.
- Push it aside.

2098
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,590
Push it aside.
Focus on one at a time.

2099
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,880
- Wait.
- They opened.

2100
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,980
They opened.

2101
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,980
- They opened.
- Haha succeeded.

2102
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,010
Okay!

2103
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:27,980
Sae Ho, move the shellfish
so that it's above the fire.

2104
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,480
- Really?
- Put it in the middle.

2105
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,500
- Come on.
- Can I move it?

2106
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,800
- Move it.
- Can I move it?

2107
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,920
Move the scallop to the middle.

2108
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,070
(The teams' fates depends on
Kwang Soo and Sae Ho.)

2109
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:35,630
- Move it a bit.
- Open!

2110
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:38,530
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo.
Watch the fire.

2111
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,610
Why won't it open?

2112
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:44,730
(The way home depends on
the shellfish.)

2113
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,610
(The winning team will get a slot
on the ending roulette.)

2114
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,920
- It will open. It's moving.
- It's moving.

2115
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,010
- It's moving.
- Open!

2116
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,280
- Open!
- Come on!

2117
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,510
(What will be the result
of the match?)

2118
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,690
- What's wrong with it?
- It opened!

2119
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,090
- It opened!
- It opened!

2120
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,380
- Haha succeeded.
- Okay!

2121
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,690
Please! It opened!

2122
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:01,880
- It opened!
- It opened!

2123
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:03,190
- What's wrong with it?
- It opened!

2124
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:05,150
(Sae Ho's scallop didn't open
in the end.)

2125
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:06,230
What's wrong with it?

2126
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,820
- Gangnam!
- Gangnam!

2127
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:09,900
- What's wrong with it?
- Gangnam!

2128
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,690
- One of Sae Ho's didn't open.
- Why won't it open?

2129
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:12,940
Why won't it open?

2130
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,360
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong with it?

2131
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,570
You want to go to Gangnam, right?

2132
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:16,610
That's not true.

2133
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:19,530
We will end up going to Gangnam.
This is bad.

2134
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:20,980
Going home will take
an hour and a half.

2135
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,440
Going home will take
an hour and a half.

2136
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,590
If we get Mapo
when we spin the roulette,

2137
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,610
- we will go to Mapo.
- That's right.

2138
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,510
- Let's invite the owner inside.
- Okay.

2139
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,860
Jae Suk,
I think she will listen to you.

2140
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,960
- Once she comes in,
- Seriously.

2141
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,230
I will recommend the two of you.

2142
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:39,320
I will tell her that Kwang Soo
and Suk Jin haven't eaten.

2143
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,570
(Jae Suk is full,
so he would rather have them eat.)

2144
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:41,590
It's the owner's daughter.

2145
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:43,590
- Hello.
- The owner's eldest daughter.

2146
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,670
We came back after saying goodbye.
We are sorry.

2147
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,230
It's okay.

2148
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:49,900
- Hello.
- You will take over the business.

2149
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,840
There are five members on the team,

2150
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:54,050
but the two of them haven't eaten.

2151
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,780
- Kwang Soo and Suk Jin.
- We haven't eaten.

2152
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,210
It doesn't matter, right?

2153
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,710
- Do I need to choose?
- Among the five of us,

2154
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:02,440
- please choose 3.
- Please choose 3.

2155
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,110
Three people will eat.

2156
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:07,980
- Okay.
- Kwang Soo.

2157
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,650
(Kwang Soo will finally have
his first meal.)

2158
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,730
(I will get to eat too.)

2159
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,820
- Jae Suk.
- Me?

2160
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,960
(She skips over Suk Jin
and chooses Jae Suk.)

2161
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,230
Thank you. I like this place.

2162
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:21,900
- She skipped over me.
- Thank you. I like this place.

2163
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,010
She skipped over me.

2164
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:24,940
He is pretty full.

2165
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,480
Jae Suk's stomach will burst.

2166
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,710
Be quiet.

2167
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,570
Please pick one more person.

2168
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,250
The last person is...

2169
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,510
(She chooses the last person
after much deliberation.)

2170
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:36,480
(What will be Suk Jin's fate?)

2171
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,820
(The last person is...)

2172
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:38,880
- Jong Kook.
- My goodness.

2173
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:41,960
(He is forced to go on a diet.)

2174
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,630
- You know,
- Hold on.

2175
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,900
the restaurants just don't pick
Suk Jin.

2176
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,300
- What?
- You heard, right?

2177
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,670
- You heard that I haven't eaten.
- Yes.

2178
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:50,730
You heard, right?

2179
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,190
I just wanted to check.

2180
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,860
- She heard.
- You heard, right?

2181
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,110
- Yes.
- My goodness.

2182
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,730
My wife and I ate tteokbokki
at that table.

2183
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,340
I am sorry.

2184
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,340
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2185
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:04,880
That's so funny.

2186
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,570
- I just can't eat.
- Suk Jin told her...

2187
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:08,380
that he hasn't eaten.

2188
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,710
He told her that he hasn't eaten.

2189
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:12,190
- All right.
- My goodness.

2190
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:15,480
(Suk Jin can't eat tteokbokki
and seasoned dumplings.)

2191
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,650
Gosh.

2192
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,860
Let's eat a boiled egg.

2193
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:21,230
- Kwang Soo, eat a boiled egg.
- Thank you.

2194
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,440
- Don't eat.
- There are dumplings too.

2195
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,670
Your stomach will burst.

2196
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:25,960
I can still eat this.

2197
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,360
- Your stomach will burst.
- I can still eat this.

2198
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,400
- This is different.
- Tteokbokki is different.

2199
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:32,110
It's a snack, not a meal.

2200
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,440
Sae Ho, don't eat it.

2201
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,710
- I won't eat it.
- I dropped my chopsticks.

2202
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:37,310
Don't eat it.

2203
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:40,310
Are you eating again?
You had the octopus rice.

2204
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:41,310
(Slurping)

2205
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:45,150
Hold on. Come to think of it,

2206
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:47,680
I only had a small bite of food
behind the screen.

2207
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:50,500
Ma'am, I am disappointed.

2208
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:53,150
My wife loves this restaurant.

2209
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:55,670
- That's your wife, not you.
- Still,

2210
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,500
I live in the neighborhood.

2211
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:59,530
My house is near here.

2212
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,530
I paid the five-dollar parking fee
in order to come here.

2213
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,310
- Stop it.
- I parked my car...

2214
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:06,640
in the parking lot.

2215
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,880
- What is your problem?
- Come to think of it,

2216
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,050
- I only had a small bite of food.
- Suk Jin, get out.

2217
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,640
- I haven't eaten anything else.
- Overcome.

2218
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,020
- Overcome.
- Overcome.

2219
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,680
- I can't overcome it.
- Stop it.

2220
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,060
I can overcome hunger,

2221
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,520
but I can't overcome disappointment.

2222
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,720
- I overcame hunger.
- Stop it.

2223
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,720
But I am so disappointed.

2224
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,520
She heard...

2225
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,470
- that I haven't eaten.
- Stop it.

2226
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:29,360
- Stop it.
- Seriously.

2227
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,030
I haven't been this hungry
during a shoot about eating.

2228
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,730
I have been starving all day long.

2229
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,060
We will move to the last place,

2230
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,140
- a dessert cafe in Yeoksam.
- Okay.

2231
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,340
Let's go.

2232
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,680
I haven't eaten.

2233
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,880
- I really haven't eaten.
- That was tasty.

2234
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,050
I am so full.

2235
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,550
We have to win.

2236
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,020
- We have to win.
- Let's win.

2237
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,750
We have to win.

2238
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,460
- Choa.
- Yes?

2239
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:55,180
You run a YouTube channel.
After this episode airs,

2240
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:57,220
you should share
behind-the-scenes stories.

2241
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,430
- You should do that.
- A review.

2242
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:02,190
- What is your channel about?
- I am curious.

2243
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:03,670
I do song covers.

2244
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:06,810
- You sing.
- Yes.

2245
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:09,210
- Choa is an incredible singer.
- You are too kind.

2246
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,140
It has been so long
since I heard her sing.

2247
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,380
Would you sing a song
you recently covered?

2248
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,750
Which songs did I recently cover?

2249
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:17,570
- That's rude.
- I know. Don't ask her to sing.

2250
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,350
- Is it rude?
- Don't put her on the spot.

2251
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,310
- Is it rude?
- It's old-fashioned.

2252
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,650
- Suk Jin!
- What?

2253
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,280
Please do a voice impression
of Baek Seol Hee.

2254
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,930
(This isn't rude.)

2255
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,460
(He suddenly gets asked to do
a voice impression.)

2256
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,060
(Singing)

2257
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:37,190
(He sings
the background music of the past.)

2258
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:40,670
I feel bad for Suk Jin.
It has been over 30 years.

2259
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:42,270
He can do it right away.

2260
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,900
He can do it right away.

2261
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,530
(The old people
burst out laughing...)

2262
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:49,350
(and the young people fall asleep.)

2263
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:51,850
(The addictive voice)

2264
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:54,640
Suk Jin. Jong Kook...

2265
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,280
Jong Kook burst out laughing.

2266
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,850
I love it.

2267
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,390
It has been over 30 years.

2268
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,520
It's nice to hear
Baek Seol Hee's voice again.

2269
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,560
Thanks to that, Suk Jin passed
the comedian exam.

2270
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,000
- Really?
- Really?

2271
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,500
I love you

2272
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,770
Me too

2273
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:15,360
- I like you
- That's funny.

2274
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:19,030
Everything in the world

2275
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,310
There you go.

2276
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,940
- He passed the exam with that.
- That's right.

2277
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:24,380
You are cool.

2278
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,720
- You are good.
- The competition wasn't bad, right?

2279
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,750
It's like a song...

2280
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,980
- from a gramophone.
- I shocked everyone.

2281
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,310
(They arrive at P Cafe
in Yeoksam-dong.)

2282
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:33,820
It smells good in here.

2283
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:36,220
- It smells good.
- It smells insane.

2284
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,930
- This is the last place.
- Yes.

2285
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:42,000
This time, you will feel
the sweetness of spring.

2286
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:44,890
There are strawberry croffles
and strawberry lattes.

2287
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:45,930
It smells good.

2288
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:48,100
- It smells good.
- The timing is perfect.

2289
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:49,530
- That sounds incredible.
- The timing is perfect.

2290
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,210
Choa is happy.

2291
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:52,810
They sound delicious.
I really want them.

2292
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:53,900
For the last mission,

2293
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:57,310
you need the hawk's eyes for finding
the route with less traffic.

2294
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:59,020
It's the One Arms and Legs.

2295
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,140
- One Arms and Legs?
- What is that?

2296
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,640
In the sleeves of a hoodie,

2297
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,590
you will put in your arms and legs
at the same time.

2298
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:07,060
You win if you read the word
on your opponent's back first.

2299
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:08,650
- My goodness.
- It's simple, right?

2300
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,020
(You win if you read the word
on your opponent's back first.)

2301
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,060
We decided on the list of matches
by drawing spoons.

2302
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,670
The first match is
between Choa and Se Chan.

2303
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,130
(Choa versus Se Chan)

2304
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,560
Gosh, this is...

2305
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:19,300
It will be fierce.

2306
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,600
Why do you think it will be fierce?

2307
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:23,530
- Se Chan, let's go!
- Of course.

2308
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:25,100
I need to win.

2309
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,180
You should put on your shoes first.

2310
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:28,710
I am going to do this without shoes.

2311
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:29,710
I see.

2312
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,310
Please put the words on their backs.

2313
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,070
- Se Chan, let's go.
- Okay.

2314
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:34,110
Let's go.

2315
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,780
Choa will win.

2316
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,180
- Se Chan.
- Okay.

2317
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,350
- Okay. Let's do this.
- Let's go.

2318
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,480
What will happen?

2319
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,560
- He has athletic skills.
- Really?

2320
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,850
Even if a match is ongoing,
the mission will end at 5 p.m.

2321
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,100
Get ready.

2322
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,770
(Not much time remains,
so this match is important.)

2323
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:52,060
Get ready.

2324
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,300
- Set, go.
- Let's go.

2325
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:55,530
He is fast.

2326
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:56,640
Se Chan.

2327
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:59,140
(Se Chan intimidates her
with big jumps.)

2328
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,380
He looks like a frog.

2329
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,470
Choa looks so comfortable.

2330
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:03,570
She is fast.

2331
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:05,310
- Seriously.
- Choa really is...

2332
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:07,220
Hey, watch your back.

2333
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,390
(Se Chan tries
the short-legged jump.)

2334
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:11,650
- Choa.
- It's almond something.

2335
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,560
There you go.

2336
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,720
- Se Chan.
- Push him to the side.

2337
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,350
- Be careful.
- There you go.

2338
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:19,760
(Choa gets pushed to a corner.)

2339
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,890
We need to go to Mapo.

2340
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:22,220
Let's go to Mapo.

2341
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,800
Be careful. Be careful!

2342
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:25,970
- No.
- Don't show your back.

2343
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:28,060
Push Se Chan's cheek with your foot.

2344
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:29,140
(Kicking)

2345
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,710
Push Se Chan's cheek with your foot.

2346
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:32,680
(Falling)

2347
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,770
You did it.

2348
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,100
(Se Chan got pushed away.)

2349
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,380
Go, go.

2350
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,680
He can't get up. He can't.

2351
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,090
It's so shameful.
My pose is so shameful.

2352
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:44,180
- I am so ashamed. I need to get up.
- He can't get up.

2353
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:45,650
He can't get up.

2354
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:48,060
- I need to get up.
- He looks like a chicken.

2355
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,320
- He can't get up.
- He can't get up.

2356
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:51,460
He can't get up.

2357
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,150
(Choa nearly flips over Se Chan
in the end.)

2358
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:54,800
- You won.
- He can't get up.

2359
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,930
Flip him over.

2360
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:59,140
(Se Chan tries to get out
of the embarrassing pose.)

2361
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,710
(Choa aspires to turn the tables.)

2362
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:03,880
- I am so ashamed.
- The word is visible.

2363
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:06,070
It's "Beetle."

2364
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,640
It's "Beetle."

2365
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,880
(Choa won.)

2366
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:12,680
Good job, Choa.

2367
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:15,850
(They trusted Se Chan,
but he loses in a shameful way.)

2368
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,560
- No.
- Good job, Choa.

2369
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,310
(Sae Ho punishes him.)

2370
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,780
Okay, Choa.

2371
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:23,180
She did well.

2372
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:24,430
Okay, Choa.

2373
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,150
Good job, Choa.

2374
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,500
Good job.

2375
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:29,360
The second match is...

2376
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:31,640
between Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.

2377
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,270
We haven't seen that in a while.

2378
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,860
Kwang Soo will easily see her back.

2379
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,730
- He has an advantage.
- Okay, okay.

2380
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:40,510
- He has an advantage.
- Wait a minute.

2381
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:42,940
It's currently 5 p.m.

2382
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,280
(They heard the rule
during the opening in the morning.)

2383
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,680
(All missions stop at 5 p.m.)

2384
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:56,220
(Then they spin the roulette
to decide on the ending venue.)

2385
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:59,000
(The current time is 5 p.m.)

2386
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,600
Since it's 5 p.m.,

2387
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,500
the result we have now will decide
the winning team.

2388
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,730
Choa won, so Team Gangnam won.

2389
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:06,930
- Okay!
- Yes!

2390
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,840
(Did we lose again?)

2391
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,930
We won.

2392
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,900
Now comes the food.

2393
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,310
Jae Suk,
please tell the owner of the cafe...

2394
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:18,970
- that I haven't eaten yet.
- Okay.

2395
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:20,050
I will do that.

2396
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:21,220
Please do that.

2397
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,480
I am really hungry right now.

2398
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,480
(He pleads
after starving all day long.)

2399
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:25,780
How many slots do we have?

2400
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,820
Team Gangnam has 7
and Team Mapo has 5.

2401
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:28,850
Okay.

2402
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,500
There isn't a big difference.

2403
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,220
If Mapo ends up being
the ending venue...

2404
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:35,690
(That would be the worst.)

2405
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:37,000
- That's right.
- Coming back here...

2406
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,230
- will take two hours.
- Seriously.

2407
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,270
- It's the evening rush hour.
- I know.

2408
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:43,310
(The strawberry desserts enter.)

2409
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,430
Strawberry.

2410
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:46,770
(Their eyes go wide.)

2411
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:48,900
Croissant.

2412
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:50,550
Look at them.

2413
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,810
- Look at them.
- They look delicious.

2414
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:54,250
Anyone would want them.

2415
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,680
(It's time to soothe the mouth
with a sweet drink.)

2416
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,090
We got the latte.

2417
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:58,350
(The losing team got a latte each.)

2418
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,220
The strawberries look good.

2419
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,130
Don't say anything.

2420
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,850
Here comes the employee of the cafe.

2421
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,930
- Hello.
- Hello.

2422
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:07,360
- You know,
- My goodness.

2423
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,800
I love strawberries.

2424
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,770
This is a famous cafe.

2425
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:12,430
I am obsessed with croffles.

2426
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:17,900
Please pick the three members
who will eat the desserts.

2427
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:22,140
(Which 3 members will she choose
for the strawberry desserts?)

2428
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:23,710
Choa.

2429
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:25,920
- Thank you.
- From the start...

2430
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,310
I knew Choa would get chosen.

2431
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:30,050
From the start,
Choa and I wanted the dessert.

2432
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:31,060
(The second member is...)

2433
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,090
Seriously.

2434
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:34,590
- Jong Kook.
- Thank you.

2435
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,090
Does Jong Kook suit strawberries?

2436
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,000
- I love strawberries.
- Really?

2437
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,670
I love strawberries,
I love strawberries

2438
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:42,500
- Jae Suk.
- Thank you.

2439
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:45,840
(She picks Jae Suk
instead of Suk Jin.)

2440
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:48,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2441
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:50,730
Suk Jin will starve today.

2442
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:52,530
(The top 2 celebrities
shunned by the food industry)

2443
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:54,770
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

2444
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:56,850
Thank you. We will enjoy the food.

2445
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,550
I will take photos
and post them later.

2446
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:00,350
- They look delicious.
- I am having a reality check.

2447
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,720
They look so delicious.

2448
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,920
Everyone else got chosen once
except for me.

2449
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:06,390
(I must take photos!)

2450
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:07,980
Why are you taking photos?

2451
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,060
(She drinks the strawberry latte.)

2452
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,360
- It's so tasty.
- It's so good.

2453
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,360
(They keep exclaiming.)

2454
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,970
It's a shame that I have to cut it.

2455
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,300
Isn't your stomach about to burst?

2456
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,060
No. There is a separate stomach...

2457
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:21,530
for dessert.

2458
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:23,640
I love strawberries.

2459
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,730
(They made the strawberry croffle
for Running Man.)

2460
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:28,140
(If you enjoy it, it's protein.)

2461
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:31,810
(It's tasty
because it's freshly made.)

2462
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:34,940
(They have no luck
when it comes to food.)

2463
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:35,940
It looks tasty.

2464
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:36,980
It's so tasty.

2465
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,590
I love strawberry milk.

2466
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:40,980
You mix it, right?

2467
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,560
(Their war of nerves begins
once more.)

2468
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,720
What?

2469
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:46,130
It looks so delicious.

2470
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,150
I know.

2471
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:48,860
(He takes a peek like a mouse.)

2472
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:51,530
Se Chan, why are you mixing
the drink?

2473
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:52,840
I was just looking.

2474
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,510
(Se Chan drinks it in the end.)

2475
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,270
(Satisfied)

2476
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:58,640
Let's clink our cups.

2477
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:03,710
(Team Mapo fails to resist
the strawberry latte.)

2478
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:06,220
Keep your friendship high,
keep your love deep,

2479
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,110
and keep your glasses level.

2480
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:09,750
- All right.
- Let's go.

2481
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:12,020
It's so good.

2482
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,650
- It's so good.
- Our youth starts now.

2483
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:15,930
(They give a toast
because they are embarrassed.)

2484
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:19,690
- It's so good.
- Our youth starts now.

2485
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,560
We need to do this right.

2486
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,970
- Seriously.
- I am nervous.

2487
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:25,970
If we fail,
our effort will be meaningless.

2488
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:28,730
- The mission is over.
- Okay.

2489
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:30,900
The evening rush hour has begun.

2490
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,070
(The evening rush hour has begun.)

2491
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:33,140
(The current location)

2492
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,180
(Mapo, Gangnam,
the ending venue candidates)

2493
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:38,720
(It takes 1 hour and 30 minutes
to reach the ending venue in Mapo.)

2494
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,550
(If Gangnam becomes
the ending venue,)

2495
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,050
(it will take Team Mapo 2 hours
to go home.)

2496
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:43,250
(8 slots for Gangnam
versus 4 slots for Mapo)

2497
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,460
Let's go to Mapo.

2498
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:46,520
There are only four slots for Mapo.

2499
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,020
- Should I do it slowly?
- 8 slots versus 4 slots.

2500
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,430
Spin it any way you want.
Which way shall we go?

2501
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:51,000
You have one chance.

2502
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,650
- Let's go to Mapo.
- Go, go.

2503
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,170
It will be really funny
if we get Mapo.

2504
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,130
You only have one chance.

2505
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:58,690
- I will spin it hard.
- Okay.

2506
01:18:58,690 --> 01:18:59,970
You only have one chance.

2507
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:01,170
(I will spin it hard.)

2508
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:03,140
Done.

2509
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:04,770
I have a bad feeling.

2510
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:06,680
(The roulette will decide
who will go home quickly.)

2511
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,050
- Mapo.
- I have a bad feeling.

2512
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,770
(Half of them will be free
in the evening.)

2513
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:14,550
(The other half will be stuck
in traffic in the evening.)

2514
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,720
Really?

2515
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,560
(Will they film the ending scene
in Gangnam or Mapo?)

2516
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,630
(What will be the result?)

2517
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:23,850
- I have a bad feeling.
- She didn't spin it right.

2518
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,320
- Really?
- Gangnam!

2519
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,820
(Gangnam is the ending venue.)

2520
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:27,930
We did it.

2521
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,430
(The people
who live near Gangnam rejoice.)

2522
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:32,840
(For goodness' sake.)

2523
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,340
(The result disappoints Team Mapo
and the production crew.)

2524
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,670
We did it.

2525
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:38,640
It almost became Mapo.

2526
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,680
A slot for Mapo was
right next to it.

2527
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,710
(Had it moved one more slot,
they would have gotten Mapo.)

2528
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:44,770
We barely managed.

2529
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,140
- Let's move to the ending venue.
- Let's go.

2530
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:50,280
(They move to the ending venue
that is 15 minutes away by car.)

2531
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,460
(Yeoksam P Dessert Cafe)

2532
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:55,350
(Ending venue)

2533
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:58,630
Come to think of it,
so many funny things happened.

2534
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:00,350
Suk Jin was in the winning team,

2535
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:02,320
- but he didn't get to eat anything.
- He didn't get to eat anything.

2536
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,360
He starved.

2537
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,300
Choa wants to tell you
that you are really cool.

2538
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,360
- Who? Choa?
- Yes.

2539
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,170
You are so funny.

2540
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:12,400
Why doesn't it show on TV?

2541
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:16,050
- Hey!
- Choa.

2542
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,920
We are prohibited from saying that.

2543
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,680
- Don't say that.
- Choa.

2544
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:22,680
- Choa.
- You were so funny today.

2545
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,280
It's a shame
that it doesn't show on TV.

2546
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,760
Suk Jin just wiped off his tears.

2547
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:30,280
I just need five viewers
who acknowledge me.

2548
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,190
Five viewers. Are you one of them?

2549
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:33,890
- Yes.
- I just need four more.

2550
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:35,800
Four more?

2551
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,130
Didn't you have anyone so far?

2552
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,300
- Didn't you have anyone so far?
- No.

2553
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,340
(He got acknowledged
for the first time ever.)

2554
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:42,010
He has been that way for 30 years.

2555
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:43,840
We are here.

2556
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:46,530
It would have been bad
had the ending venue been Mapo.

2557
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:48,640
- Everyone.
- Yes?

2558
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,970
Today, we had
the Sweet and Scary Way Home Race.

2559
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:52,570
Team Gangnam won.

2560
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,980
(Team Gangnam had
the perfect victory.)

2561
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,780
Good job.

2562
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:58,150
(Meanwhile,
Team Mapo has a long way home.)

2563
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:00,280
It's too bad that we lost.

2564
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,220
Team Gangnam
will have a short way home...

2565
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:06,100
as well as the famous snack
as the prize.

2566
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,270
- It's rice cake.
- All right.

2567
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:09,800
- It looks delicious.
- It looks delicious.

2568
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,800
- Seriously.
- It looks delicious.

2569
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,190
It's really delicious.

2570
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:15,360
Team Gangnam will have
the rice cake...

2571
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,310
and Team Mapo will have
a long way home.

2572
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,430
(We thank Cho Sae Ho and Choa
for visiting.)

2573
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:20,710
It's too bad!

2574
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,770
(Perfect Partner Signal)

2575
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:28,850
(8 entertainers entered
Variety Show Village!)

2576
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,720
(3 female guests appear.)

2577
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,980
(Seol In Ah)

2578
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,590
(Lee Cho Hee)

2579
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:35,260
(Jeong He In)

2580
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:41,000
(They must show off their charms
amidst their rivals.)

2581
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:44,970
(My charms will seep
into your heart.)

2582
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:51,210
(A desperate competition
for a variety partner begins.)

2583
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,680
May I enter?

2584
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,970
(They follow their hearts.)

2585
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:58,220
(The ones without a partner
become anxious.)

2586
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:00,440
(They keep making
the wrong choices.)

2587
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:02,850
(I am becoming greedy.)

2588
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,110
(The drama that shook up
Variety Show Village.)

2589
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:06,480
(The men compete for Woman Five.)

2590
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,590
(A liar and a hypocrite.)

2591
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,650
(I am done for.)

2592
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:12,650
(Amidst the confusion,
things become a mess.)

2593
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,060
(Who will find
the perfect partner in this jungle?)

2594
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,560
(I Want to Find
the Variety Show Partner)
