1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,090
"Don't be friends with someone
who is not better than you."

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,890
Confucius said.

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,960
Today, the silly members are...

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,040
gathered together in Variety Village
to meet someone better than them.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,600
(Perfect Partner Signal)

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,670
Man 1 and Man 2 are
the first ones to arrive.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,850
(Sweet)

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,850
Hello.

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,080
What?

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,390
They have the rules
for Variety Village.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,290
"The purpose
of Variety Village is to find..."

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,720
"a perfect partner to appear on
screen for a longer period of time."

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,220
"You may win your partner's heart
by any means necessary."

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,760
Three. A member
who fails to find a partner...

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,230
will get a harsh penalty.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,900
Four. Whatever you do
in Variety Village will be aired...

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,110
without any omissions
or adjustments.

19
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,580
And all members are supposed
to keep trying...

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,620
to win the hearts of other members
even after finding a partner...

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,690
until the end in order to secure
the airtime and gold.

22
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,810
What is this? Perfect Partner?

23
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,010
(What is this? Perfect Partner?)

24
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,650
Perfect Partner?

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,030
- A partner who's right for you.
- A partner who's right for you.

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,620
I see.

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,970
You mean someone
of the same mind as me.

28
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,360
Man Two is a little slow
of understanding.

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Yes.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,560
What's with your tone?
Do I know you?

31
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,110
You don't know me?

32
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,500
That's today's concept, right?

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,700
Why are you so tall
when we've just met?

34
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,010
- My gosh.
- I have to look up at your face.

35
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,010
Oh, dear.

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,280
(Chuckling)

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,690
- You should lower it a little.
- I haven't heard that in a while.

38
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,250
"Why are you so tall?"
I haven't heard it in a long time.

39
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,090
My gosh.

40
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,060
There's someone dawdling along.

41
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,200
Look.

42
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,970
Who on earth is he?

43
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,360
Why is he swaggering like that?

44
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,900
It says "Perfect Partner."

45
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,400
All right. Perfect Partner Signal.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Hey.

47
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,170
Nice to meet you.

48
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,870
(Man 4 Kim Jong Kook,
Man 3 Yang Se Chan)

49
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,880
- He's wearing shorts.
- Nice to meet you.

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,110
- He must be cold.
- I know. It's a little early.

51
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,160
- It's chilly today.
- Nice to meet you.

52
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,790
Hello.

53
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,130
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

54
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,050
- Hello.
- Hello.

55
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,630
How are you all?

56
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,330
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

57
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,890
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

58
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,600
- All right.
- Gosh.

59
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,930
What do you think you're doing?

60
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,930
- Hello.
- Hello. Gosh.

61
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,960
- Hello.
- Why is he...

62
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,460
We've just met.

63
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,010
He's very vigorous.

64
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,410
The thing is...

65
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,610
We've just met here.

66
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,510
We're here together man to man.

67
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,820
What are you talking about?

68
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,010
So we're all men. But why are you...

69
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,420
Why are you swaggering?

70
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,110
Why are you swinging
your arms like this?

71
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,610
Why are you doing this?

72
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,920
I just want you to feel my energy.

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
You're right.

74
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,950
There's only one way
you can feel it.

75
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,800
(There's only one way
you can feel it.)

76
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,460
- Hey!
- What?

77
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,890
- Okay.
- Oh, dear.

78
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,570
(He shows off his strong grip
all of a sudden.)

79
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,490
- Come here.
- My goodness.

80
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,170
All right.

81
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,040
- Good.
- I can't believe this.

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,980
Man Four is rather violent.

83
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,010
He approaches the other members
the way he makes friends at a gym.

84
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,880
I made my palms callused on purpose.

85
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,890
- I see.
- Can you feel it?

86
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,480
Sure. I can totally feel it.

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,860
By the way, I guess he's
the owner of this place.

88
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,890
- What?
- There's a grandpa.

89
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,760
- He's the owner of this place.
- I see. He's the owner.

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,630
- He owns this place.
- Hello, sir.

91
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,670
(Man 5 Ji Suk Jin,
Man 6 Haha)

92
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,460
- He owns this place.
- Hello, sir.

93
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,490
- What?
- Is he wearing a crop top?

94
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,860
Please don't do this.

95
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,910
- What's with his pants?
- What's wrong with him?

96
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,770
- Who is that guy?
- This is crazy.

97
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,300
Is he in the fashion business?

98
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,610
- I got goosebumps.
- Hello.

99
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,770
- What's this?
- You're a man.

100
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,010
Why are you wearing women's clothes
when you're a man?

101
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,510
What's that thing on the sleeves?

102
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,110
Excessively rolled up cuffs
and lacy sleeves.

103
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,080
And a knitted crop top.

104
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,050
His fashion that reminds you
of a servant in medieval Europe...

105
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,920
throws Variety Village
into confusion.

106
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,420
I do like his outfit.

107
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,730
But I thought a woman
was walking in at first.

108
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,890
What's with the lacy sleeves?

109
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,330
I guess he's trying to draw
people's attention.

110
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,140
But he's totally mistaken.

111
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,710
Then what does Man Five
think of his fashion?

112
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,520
I think my outfit is outstanding
when it comes to fashion.

113
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,290
But it's also great
in terms of variety shows.

114
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,720
This is Variety Village.

115
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,880
The others should've cared
about their outfits too.

116
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,290
- Hello.
- Why are you wearing...

117
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,360
women's clothes when you're a man?

118
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,590
What's that thing on the sleeves?

119
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,660
I know there's
no boundary in fashion, but...

120
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,320
I'm very interested in fashion.

121
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,690
- Right.
- Hello.

122
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,840
- Hello.
- I'm serious.

123
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,670
Okay. Is it bad that
I'm interested in fashion?

124
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,000
- But the lace...
- What? This is...

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
- my tablecloth.
- Hello.

126
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,570
(Man 6 is being ostracized
because of Man 5's unique fashion.)

127
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,300
Man Six must be embarrassed.

128
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,650
- We can't see him because of Man 5.
- I know.

129
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,800
He's unnoticeable.

130
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,310
- My fashion...
- I just met him today.

131
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,370
But I was really embarrassed
on my way here.

132
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,090
I understand how you feel.

133
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,880
It's hard to set a new trend.

134
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,110
But, Man Five, on your way here,

135
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,290
you kept checking
your outfit like this.

136
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,420
(Man 5, you kept checking
your outfit like this.)

137
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,690
Like this.

138
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,050
- He wasn't sure.
- Did I do that?

139
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,120
- Yes.
- I didn't check how I looked.

140
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,300
I didn't get to check my outfit
before coming here.

141
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,690
At this rate,

142
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,410
you'll soon show up in a dress.

143
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,800
That's not true.

144
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,500
With no shame.

145
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,710
- That's enough.
- This is what you told me...

146
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,110
before coming in here.

147
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,210
When we just met.

148
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,780
"This is a little embarrassing."

149
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,940
You said that, didn't you?

150
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,520
Did you guys see me before?

151
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,850
- Do I know you?
- No.

152
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,660
As soon as you get here,

153
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,960
you're fighting against four people.

154
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,730
That's not true.
I'm just having a conversation.

155
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,160
As soon as you came in...

156
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,860
Since we've just met,
we will stop here.

157
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,770
- If we were friends...
- It would've been serious.

158
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,900
- You would've been doomed.
- I would've thrown this at him.

159
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,560
I had a lot of things to say.

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,730
You guys are mischievous.
I'm fine with that.

161
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,730
Man Five who seems
to take blows well...

162
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,870
has become the fashionista
of Variety Village.

163
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,410
Woman 1 and Woman 2
have just arrived.

164
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,870
- Really?
- Please greet them warmly.

165
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,290
I think I know who's coming.

166
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,810
They seem somewhat familiar.

167
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,980
Perfect Partner Signal?

168
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
(Woman 1 Song Ji Hyo,
Woman 2 Jeon So Min)

169
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,030
Perfect Partner Signal.

170
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,900
Men would usually go to them
and carry their bags.

171
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
Right.

172
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,100
We should skip that part.

173
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,900
- Well...
- We will skip it.

174
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,860
I can see them over there.
They are just good friends.

175
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
- Right.
- We know them.

176
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,130
Woman 1 and Woman 2
come to Variety Village every week.

177
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,740
There's no tension around them.

178
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,410
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

179
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,280
- Hello.
- Welcome.

180
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,740
Hello.

181
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,920
- Hello.
- They look good.

182
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,420
- Hello.
- You look great.

183
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,860
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

184
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,530
- Man 1.
- Hello, Woman 2.

185
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,530
Hello.

186
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,230
Man One, why are you
flirting with them already?

187
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,420
No, I was just saying hello.

188
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,690
Why are you flirting with them?

189
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,620
- What's wrong with you?
- Why are you doing this?

190
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,100
- What did I do?
- You just said you'd skip them.

191
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,470
I can't believe this.

192
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,500
Man One tries to impress the women
with his over-the-top kindness.

193
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,130
That draws unwelcome attention
from the other members.

194
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,280
(The silly members are
quarreling over nothing.)

195
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,780
(Staring)

196
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,520
- Come here.
- You want them to pick you.

197
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,570
Is that because of his outfit?

198
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,020
Why would you tell them
to stand next to you?

199
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,850
- Come over here.
- Why?

200
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,850
(Staring)

201
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,290
(Since they've just met,
she can't say anything mean.)

202
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,860
- Now...
- Look at them.

203
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,880
(Woman 1 and Woman 2 try to
hold back their laughter.)

204
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,790
- You both...
- What's wrong?

205
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,800
(What's wrong?)

206
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,050
He's Woman Five.

207
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,060
I thought you were Kim Jang Hoon.

208
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,120
(I thought you were Kim Jang Hoon.)

209
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,100
He's a great guy.

210
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,630
Where did your bag go?

211
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,840
- You should keep your bag with you.
- He was...

212
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,930
He was so flustered...

213
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,930
- With all the criticism...
- Man Five...

214
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,000
- He's out of his mind.
- doesn't know what to do now.

215
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,500
- That's not true.
- He forgot about his bag.

216
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,650
He put it here
as soon as he arrived.

217
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,810
And he said, "What? Why?"

218
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,720
He just walked
right into a battlefield like that.

219
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,750
That's not it. Usually...

220
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,680
Man Five is being quite bold today.

221
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,820
Would the women
appreciate his effort?

222
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,030
- Would they think he's trying?
- It's pretty...

223
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,320
They might feel that way.

224
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,800
- He's trying.
- I like that.

225
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,820
That's good.

226
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,930
- Someone's coming.
- What?

227
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,300
(Woman 3 shows up
right at that moment.)

228
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,300
(Woman 3 Seol In Ah)

229
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,790
(The actress with pure
and refreshing charm, Seol In Ah)

230
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,380
- Oh, hello.
- Who's coming?

231
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,120
- Who's she?
- Woman Three.

232
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,750
- My gosh.
- Hey.

233
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,750
(They seem a lot more excited than
when Woman 1 and Woman 2 showed up.)

234
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

235
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,860
- In Ah.
- Seol In Ah.

236
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,170
She's carrying her bag
instead of pulling it.

237
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,190
- She's strong.
- She's really strong.

238
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,240
She's strong.

239
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,060
In Ah, why are you carrying it?

240
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,410
I bet she's strong.

241
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,700
- Because it makes loud noises.
- In Ah, come here.

242
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

243
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,280
- Hello.
- She picked it up and carried it.

244
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,750
Like the one-arm dumbbell row.

245
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,340
- The one-arm dumbbell row?
- Yes.

246
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,120
Woman Three is really...

247
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,580
- Woman Three looks sophisticated.
- She's sophisticated.

248
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,120
She's wearing a jacket.

249
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,660
I know.

250
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,920
You guys look
a lot more excited now.

251
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,220
- Are we excited?
- That's because of his outfit.

252
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,320
- Right.
- Look at his outfit.

253
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,530
(The servant-style outfit
makes her clap like a seal.)

254
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,270
Woman Three, this isn't a penalty.

255
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,900
- Do you like this kind of fashion?
- It's not a penalty.

256
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,460
- Do you like my clothes?
- I like that.

257
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,370
- I knew it.
- He's in the fashion business.

258
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,370
I'm in the fashion business.

259
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,370
Even these three women are...

260
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,910
wearing simple outfits.

261
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,010
While everyone is frowning...

262
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,050
at Man Five's outfit,

263
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,880
Woman Four is coming in quietly.

264
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,250
(Woman 4 Jeong He In)

265
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,290
You're in danger now. You know that?

266
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,160
(Jeong He In,
a charismatic actress,)

267
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,680
(known for her short hair
and exotic charm)

268
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,000
- What?
- My gosh.

269
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,660
- Woman Four.
- Oh, dear.

270
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,900
- She's handsome...
- You look like someone.

271
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,300
You're really handsome.

272
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,000
- Thank you.
- Please come over here.

273
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,300
Woman Four, please come here.

274
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,010
She's wearing shorts like Jong Kook.

275
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,270
You're the most handsome one here.

276
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

277
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,300
- Hello.
- She looks like Terrius.

278
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,750
He In looks like...

279
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,070
- You're really tall.
- Right.

280
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,200
- I'm tall.
- By the way,

281
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,070
- you look like Hwang Shin Hye.
- That's right.

282
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,020
- I hear that a lot.
- I bet you do.

283
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,440
- You're right.
- She's like Hwang Shin Hye.

284
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,520
- She looks just like her.
- Thank you.

285
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,580
Right.

286
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,260
- Thank you.
- You look great.

287
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,580
- Why are you laughing?
- Why?

288
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,990
- Who made you laugh?
- You look amazing.

289
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,900
- Is that because of his outfit?
- Is it his outfit?

290
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,950
You can laugh out loud.
We already did.

291
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,420
It's okay.

292
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,960
- It's hilarious.
- I don't mind.

293
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,240
- She bursts into laughter.
- The perfect outfit.

294
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,510
Woman Four is really...

295
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,960
She looks amazing.

296
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,740
- Gosh, Kwang Soo was here.
- What?

297
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,910
I just saw you now.

298
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,050
Did you not see him?

299
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,280
How could you not see
such a tall guy before?

300
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,420
- I couldn't see him...
- I kept talking to you.

301
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,710
because he was too tall.

302
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,290
What do you mean you didn't
see me because I'm too tall?

303
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,120
That's because of Man Five's outfit.

304
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,760
You can't cause me harm like that.

305
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,790
I didn't cause you harm.

306
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,680
Man Five is causing us
a lot of trouble.

307
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,320
I would've come naked then.

308
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,950
Why would you pick on me
for my outfit?

309
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,320
Woman Six is here.

310
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,030
- She's Woman 5.
- Woman 5.

311
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,170
What? Cho Hee?

312
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,770
It's Cho Hee.

313
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,170
(Woman 5 Lee Cho Hee)

314
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,300
Hello.

315
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,040
(Woman 5 Lee Cho Hee)

316
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,070
(Lee Cho Hee,
the romance fairy who won...)

317
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,750
(the Rookie of the Year Award
at the KBS Drama Awards in 2020)

318
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

319
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,810
- Cho Hee.
- Nice to meet you. This way.

320
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,210
- Please come this way.
- Welcome.

321
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,490
- Hello.
- Hello, Cho Hee.

322
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,680
Nice to meet you. Hello.

323
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,490
She says hello to everyone
with her eyes.

324
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,130
Hello.

325
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,350
(All the members are gathered
in Variety Village.)

326
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,820
Including Woman Five,

327
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,000
all the members have arrived
for Perfect Partner Signal.

328
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,330
Now they need some time
to get to know each other better.

329
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,560
Me?

330
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,300
All right. Hello.

331
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,600
Nice to meet you.
I'm working in the IT industry.

332
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,780
(Man 1 works in the IT industry,
which might be a video arcade.)

333
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,300
That's what I do.

334
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,510
And...

335
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,710
I have some stock options.

336
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,520
- What?
- What are stock options?

337
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,120
- Stock options?
- None of us understands that.

338
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,290
Say it in easy terms.

339
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,580
Do you not know about stock options?

340
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,950
You don't seem popular at all.

341
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,130
And I care a lot about my hobbies.

342
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,850
I think work and life balance...

343
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,820
is very important.

344
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,170
- Work and life balance.
- On weekends...

345
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,920
Are you saying
difficult words on purpose?

346
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,500
- I don't understand anything.
- What's work and life balance?

347
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,930
- I mean...
- You don't seem so smart.

348
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,330
Man One, why...

349
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,460
You're being weird.

350
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,280
- But...
- Don't say such difficult words.

351
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,330
I'm sorry,
but I'm not talking to you.

352
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,880
- What do you do in the IT industry?
- I guess he runs a video arcade.

353
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,780
I'm not sure if you knew this,

354
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,780
but I go water-skiing on weekends.

355
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,940
I just started
the one ski last week.

356
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,450
I just started the one ski.

357
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,660
I used only one ski last week.

358
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,580
- You guys...
- If you water-ski like that,

359
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,790
you will die.

360
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,660
You'll drown right away.

361
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,690
- You know the one ski, right?
- He will die.

362
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,530
Man One never listens to us.

363
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,590
Hey!

364
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,870
What? "Hey?"

365
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,870
Gosh, Man One.

366
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,170
- Why are you being like this?
- That's enough.

367
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,300
How could he do that to me?

368
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,510
By the way, I wasn't talking to you.

369
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,570
But I heard it too.

370
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,410
- He was talking to me.
- I wasn't talking to you.

371
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,780
You are short-tempered.

372
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,940
It's not that I'm short-tempered.

373
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,520
He's ridiculous.

374
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,940
- You're being rude.
- I wasn't talking to you.

375
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,050
Anyway, what's important is...

376
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,550
that we need
to find a perfect partner.

377
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,180
So you don't need to feel pressured.

378
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,680
- Of course not.
- All right?

379
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,350
Who's next?

380
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,630
Hello. I'm...

381
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,400
Hang on.

382
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,090
I'm sorry, but are you
making an announcement?

383
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,500
- Why do you sound so kind?
- That's what we do...

384
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,010
- But it was just too much.
- Just be natural.

385
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,560
- That's how I talk.
- It sounded awkward.

386
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,670
- You're making us uncomfortable.
- That's how I usually talk.

387
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,010
- Usually?
- Yes.

388
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,340
Hello.

389
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,700
(Hello.)

390
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,250
I'm inheriting my father's business.

391
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,840
It's just a small business.

392
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,080
Hey. Are you inheriting
your father's business?

393
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,250
I thought your father
was an office worker.

394
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,420
What I'm saying
doesn't have to be true.

395
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,490
All right.

396
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,390
They know so much about each other.

397
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,630
All I care about...

398
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,900
is honesty here.

399
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,670
Actually,

400
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,740
I'm inheriting my father's business,

401
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,090
but I don't care about that.

402
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,600
I'm inheriting my father's
small business now.

403
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
- What does he do?
- What?

404
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,330
It's a really small business.

405
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,840
(Maybe it's a mom-and-pop store.)

406
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,070
- It's really small.
- About this big.

407
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,570
- It's small.
- It's really tiny.

408
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,070
And I recently came back
after studying abroad.

409
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,310
- You studied abroad?
- Are you the son...

410
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,680
of S company?

411
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,210
S company? Really?

412
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,350
Samsung Dried Fish Store?

413
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,920
(Samsung Dried Fish Store?)

414
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,180
Samsung Dried Fish Store?

415
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,320
- No.
- He's a squid.

416
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,680
- You're a squid.
- It's you.

417
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,800
Mr. Squid.

418
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,720
Hello. I'm Man Two, Squid.

419
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,920
The dried fish store.

420
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,500
He's the son of the owner.

421
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,590
Samsung fish-shaped buns.

422
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,170
Gosh, it's so annoying.

423
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,830
(This isn't what I intended.)

424
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,010
All right. I'm Man Two.

425
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,540
Was the tall guy Man Two?

426
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,200
His face looked...

427
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,410
a little sly.

428
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,810
That's how I felt
when I saw his face.

429
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,490
I'm not that interested in him.

430
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,660
Hello. Nice to meet you.

431
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,990
I've recently become
a nouveau riche.

432
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,590
I made a big fortune...

433
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,720
- on the stock market.
- He's rich.

434
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,590
Right. All I have is money.

435
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,560
If you want my money,
you should pick me.

436
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,500
- That's pathetic.
- What's wrong with being rich?

437
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,430
Man Five, why do you...

438
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,510
- keep meddling in?
- I know. He's jealous.

439
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,800
Why would you brag about your money?

440
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,050
Because I have to.

441
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,800
If I talk about my money,
you'll be in trouble.

442
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,420
- You should talk about your age.
- What?

443
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,840
You can talk about your age.

444
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,840
You're 56.

445
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,290
Tell them you're 56.

446
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,920
- Weren't you born in 1966?
- He'll turn 60 soon.

447
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,680
Weren't you born in 1966?

448
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,580
I was born in 1991.

449
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,500
- That's ridiculous.
- 1991.

450
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,590
- You're lying.
- I was born in 1991.

451
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,190
- In 1991?
- In the Year of the Sheep.

452
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,960
Anyway, all I have is money.

453
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,500
- Please pick me.
- You're young and rich.

454
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,670
Let's have fun.

455
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,010
I kind of...

456
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,430
liked Man Three.

457
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,910
I guess he has
an unpredictable charm.

458
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,840
That's the impression I got.

459
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,290
Hello. I'm a fitness trainer.

460
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,050
(I'm a fitness trainer.)

461
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,810
- I knew it.
- That sounds about right.

462
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,450
- I could tell.
- My gosh.

463
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,630
- A trainer.
- I'm running...

464
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,190
a small gym now.

465
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,690
I care a lot about health.

466
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,770
As soon as I saw him,
I thought he would be one of two.

467
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,960
And you're a trainer.

468
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,400
- A trainer or...
- What was the other thing?

469
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,740
Something in the dark world...

470
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,670
- A businessman.
- But you're a trainer.

471
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,140
- I'm a trainer.
- Okay.

472
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,800
That's what you should do.

473
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,650
Did you not hit the jing
in "Comedy Big League?"

474
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,570
- Are you that guy?
- I think I saw you.

475
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,390
- Was that you?
- You're him.

476
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,520
- I thought you looked familiar.
- You're the Jing Man.

477
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,710
I don't hit the jing.

478
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,890
I hit people.

479
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,580
You hit people?

480
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,050
You don't hit your friends, do you?

481
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,490
I don't hit my friends.

482
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,500
I guess it's my turn now.

483
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,720
Hello. I'm...

484
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,170
working in the fashion industry.

485
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,690
I run a small business.

486
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,400
He looks serious.

487
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,910
The focus of my business is export.

488
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,060
All right. Thank you.

489
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,140
(All right. Thank you.)

490
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,430
Hey.

491
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,340
Thank you.

492
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,970
You're rude.

493
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,380
I'm not rude.

494
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,810
- We all heard you.
- You should understand him.

495
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,020
This is just the beginning.

496
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,390
We all heard you.

497
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,850
- You didn't hear anything.
- They all heard you.

498
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,950
- You heard him, right?
- Yes.

499
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,130
In the fashion industry...

500
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,890
They're not interested.

501
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,820
Anyway, I'm Man Five.

502
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,950
All right. Man Five.

503
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,220
- I'm sorry, but are you single?
- Yes, I am.

504
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,670
- Are you sure?
- I'm single.

505
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,270
I wanted to get married, but...

506
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,270
That's not what we're here for.

507
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,870
What's your relationship
with Ms. Ryu Su Jung?

508
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,910
(What's your relationship
with Ms. Ryu Su Jung?)

509
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,380
What about Ms. Ryu Su Jung?

510
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,880
Why would he
talk about his real wife?

511
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,140
Ryu Su Jung?

512
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,210
She's a friend.

513
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,070
- She's just a friend.
- What about Ji Hyun Woo?

514
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,110
- Ji Hyun Woo.
- Who's Ji Hyun Woo?

515
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,790
He's my friend's son.

516
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,520
Your friend's son.

517
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,080
- Your friend's son.
- My friend's son.

518
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,410
- MFS.
- MFS?

519
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,550
Yes.

520
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,990
- That's right.
- Okay.

521
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,030
(Who's your least favorite?)

522
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,390
Well... Man number...

523
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,120
(Man number...)

524
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,200
Five.

525
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,890
(Man 5)

526
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,740
It's not that I don't like him.

527
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,090
I just feel a little
uncomfortable around him.

528
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,510
(I just feel a little
uncomfortable around him.)

529
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,800
The guy who runs
a fashion business...

530
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,630
(The guy who runs
a fashion business...)

531
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,680
Where is his fashion style from?

532
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,010
Where is he from?

533
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,750
I don't think...

534
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,020
I'll get along with him.

535
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,260
It's not that I hate him.
We're just not right for each other.

536
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,460
- Is it my turn?
- Man Six.

537
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,490
Hi.

538
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,650
What?

539
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,820
I don't like your character.

540
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,550
- I guess he studied abroad.
- He did?

541
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,590
I guess he's from abroad.

542
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,000
Speak in English.

543
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,590
I'm sorry I'm not using honorifics.

544
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,940
I just thought you guys
looked younger than me.

545
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,210
You guys can talk to me
in a casual way.

546
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,570
- Are you from abroad?
- Me?

547
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,300
Yes. I'm from abroad.

548
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,100
- Which country?
- Which part?

549
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,050
I just wandered from place to place.

550
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,520
I'll tell you
once we become friends.

551
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,050
Right. My dad failed his business.

552
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,050
- I...
- Is that why you came back?

553
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,190
I'm a self-made man.

554
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,190
- And...
- Do you even know what it means?

555
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,960
Doesn't that mean
I'm a successful man?

556
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,300
- Did you turn yourself in?
- I'm not sure.

557
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,270
Right. I don't speak Korean
very well.

558
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,030
Anyway, I'm not so good,

559
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,360
but I'd like you to be nice to me.

560
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,800
- And...
- You sound fluent though.

561
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,160
I like you.

562
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,900
I like you.

563
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,800
(He just points
at the woman he likes.)

564
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,010
He's from abroad.

565
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,100
- My gosh.
- So he's straightforward.

566
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,310
I'm...

567
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,750
in between jobs right now.

568
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,520
- He has his charms.
- I know.

569
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,580
Who are you talking to?

570
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,260
- I want us to be friends.
- I can't see his eyes.

571
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,380
It was somewhere in the middle.

572
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,850
Not the ones on the sides.

573
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,090
- Not the ones on the sides.
- I agree.

574
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,120
- That's it.
- He sounds cool.

575
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,620
All right. Woman One,
please introduce yourself.

576
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,890
Hello.

577
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,800
My dream is to become
a good wife and mother.

578
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,440
- I thought I misheard you.
- What?

579
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,900
- Why?
- Let's get into our characters.

580
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,210
It's my dream.

581
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,980
I always laugh at others' jokes
and play along with them.

582
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,070
That's one of my strengths.
I want you all to know it.

583
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,070
- Really?
- Yes.

584
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,220
But I saw you earlier.

585
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,810
You didn't laugh at all
when he made jokes.

586
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,880
That's not true.

587
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,410
I laughed as hard as I could.

588
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,640
Oh, I see.

589
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
(Sniffling)

590
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,080
You have a runny nose.

591
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,030
- It's a bit chilly.
- I know.

592
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,080
May I ask what you do for a living?

593
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,590
- My occupation?
- Yes.

594
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,820
It's kind of a secret.

595
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
A secret?

596
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,890
- It's a secret?
- Why do you all use English words?

597
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,060
- She used an English word.
- I thought...

598
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,540
- That was sexy.
- Did she study abroad?

599
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,560
- I bet she studied abroad.
- Do you work at a national agency?

600
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,830
- Do you?
- I'll tell you when we get close.

601
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,440
Okay then.
Woman Two, it's your turn.

602
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,780
Hello, everyone. I run...

603
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,800
a small coffee shop.

604
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,570
Why?

605
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,410
- It suits you though.
- I know.

606
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,550
- It suits you.
- It does suit her.

607
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,550
Indeed. A small coffee shop owner.

608
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,380
- I'm a small coffee shop owner...
- Are you a certified barista?

609
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,790
- Pardon?
- Are you a certified barista?

610
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,460
Yes, I brew coffee by myself.

611
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,000
- Where is your coffee shop?
- In which area?

612
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,090
- Where is it located?
- Well...

613
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,700
- Isn't it in Yongsan?
- It's in Goyang.

614
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,770
- Oh, Goyang?
- Yes.

615
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,730
- Oh, I see.
- We have our own parking spots.

616
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,470
And we also provide
a valet parking service if you want.

617
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,540
- A valet parking service too?
- Yes.

618
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,830
She has a lot of jobs.

619
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,360
I have to do everything on my own.

620
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,210
- It's a really small coffee shop.
- I see.

621
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,180
If I visit your coffee shop,

622
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,550
you won't be bothered
because I don't have a car.

623
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,720
(He suddenly confessed
that he doesn't own a car.)

624
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,840
But I have a bicycle.

625
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,880
- How thoughtful.
- Yes.

626
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,410
He's being very honest.

627
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,110
- Of course.
- I find it very attractive.

628
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,490
I know. I don't have a car.

629
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,530
How about you work
at my coffee shop?

630
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,990
- Pardon?
- At my coffee shop.

631
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,430
I told you earlier...

632
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,390
- that I work in the IT industry.
- Right.

633
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,200
- Yet you don't own a car.
- Pardon me?

634
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,470
- You don't own a car.
- Shut it.

635
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,740
- What's wrong with this man?
- What was that?

636
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,470
- That's rude. We just met.
- What's wrong with you?

637
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,600
- I'm sorry.
- How could he?

638
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,940
He and I had a little confrontation
in the beginning.

639
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,400
- With Man Two?
- Yes.

640
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,480
I'm here to find a variety partner
who can make people laugh.

641
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,550
That's great.

642
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,640
- Thank you.
- She looks like a good entertainer.

643
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,790
- I think she'll do well.
- She looks cheerful.

644
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,410
- Woman Three.
- Oh, okay.

645
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,720
- Did you call her "Ma'am?"
- "Ma'am?"

646
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,810
- I was surprised.
- "Ma'am?"

647
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,220
- I'm sorry. I was mistaken.
- "Ma'am?"

648
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,310
It sounded like "ma'am."
I was so surprised.

649
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,120
- Woman Three sounds similar to it.
- I'm sorry about that.

650
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,230
- Woman Three.
- Right.

651
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,590
I run a shop-in-shop.

652
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,460
(Woman Three runs a shop-in-shop.)

653
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,360
- What's a shop-in-shop?
- A small store within another.

654
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,470
Actually, I run a tanning salon
within your gym.

655
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,890
- But you didn't recognize me.
- A tanning salon?

656
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,970
(Woman Three opened her shop
in Man Four's gym.)

657
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,130
I think I know you.

658
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,970
- We know each other.
- Yes.

659
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,010
You're right.

660
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,100
Do you run a tanning salon
in his gym?

661
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,180
- Yes.
- It must be a very large gym.

662
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,400
I recommended her shop
to the members of my gym.

663
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,680
(It turns out that they are
quite closely acquainted.)

664
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,750
- You two know each other.
- Yes.

665
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,380
It made me realize
that we live in a small world.

666
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,020
We meet again here.

667
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,790
You're trying to win him over.

668
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,910
(He saw right through her.)

669
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,960
Woman Four, what about you?

670
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,620
I run a flower shop.

671
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,620
(Woman Four is running
a flower shop!)

672
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,930
- Do you actually run it?
- Yes.

673
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,230
- It sounds so realistic.
- They all thought hard.

674
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,500
- They all came up with ideas.
- She sounded so condescending.

675
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,730
That suits her well.

676
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,700
- She must've thought so hard.
- It suits her really well.

677
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,000
- They all run their own businesses.
- That's impressive.

678
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,800
- That's right.
- I may seem a little tough,

679
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,300
but I actually like
pretty, cute things.

680
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,980
- Oh, I see.
- It sounds real.

681
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,900
And my hobby is also water skiing.

682
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,220
- You water ski too?
- Yes.

683
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,980
- She water skis.
- I didn't know that.

684
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,790
I've been practicing
one-handed water skiing.

685
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,640
- That's amazing.
- One-handed water skiing?

686
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,690
One-handed? Really?

687
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,290
Do you even know what it means?
I don't think you do.

688
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,460
To water ski with one hand.

689
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,430
- Show us how to do it.
- Show us.

690
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,050
Show us. Demonstrate it.

691
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,700
- Come on. Show us.
- Show us.

692
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,050
- Mr. Bicycle, show us.
- Show us.

693
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,200
It means you water ski
with one hand.

694
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,000
- Correct.
- Like this.

695
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,700
- You'll die if you do it like this.
- You'll fall into the water.

696
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,740
Just shut it, will you?

697
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,360
- She has a lot of hobbies.
- Indeed.

698
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,600
Woman Five just said...

699
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,210
that she wanted to look rich.

700
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,900
She asked me for an idea.

701
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,570
Next up is Woman Five.

702
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,280
(Everyone else told
their dream jobs.)

703
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,110
I run a real estate agency.

704
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,380
- That suits you. I see.
- That suits you.

705
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
She must be rich.

706
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,790
(She carefully picked an occupation
that could make her look rich.)

707
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,490
Actually, this land is...

708
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,550
Do you own this property?

709
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,820
Yes.

710
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,120
- Really?
- Right here?

711
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,460
- This land?
- She's the owner of this property.

712
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,730
Why did you come on this show?

713
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,700
I just wanted to make people laugh.

714
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,590
- She wants to be funny.
- I already have a lot of money.

715
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,130
- Oh, she has a lot of money.
- Just for fun?

716
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,630
- Yes.
- She's charming.

717
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,370
It seems like we all caused
big trouble in the past...

718
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,680
and recently started a new life.

719
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,950
Right.

720
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,370
If this was a movie,
we all are con artists.

721
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,410
Exactly.

722
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,720
(Today, they will be legally lying
in the Variety Village.)

723
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,220
Today, it's Perfect Partner Signal,
Variety Village Race.

724
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,490
You are the male and female members
who came to the Variety Village...

725
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,820
to find a partner...

726
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,350
who would make a great duo
with you on a variety show.

727
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,770
You have a very simple mission
today.

728
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,270
Your goal is to promote yourselves
as much as you can...

729
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,940
and pair up with the opposite gender
at the end of the show.

730
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,040
At the end, you'll vote for the one
you want to pair up with.

731
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,980
The partners who chose each other...

732
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,130
will not get any penalty.

733
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,210
(The ones who choose each other
won't get a penalty.)

734
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,780
Those who failed to pair up
with anyone...

735
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,020
will receive a penalty
regardless of the number of them.

736
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,980
If we fail to pair up with anyone?

737
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,080
However, if you get
more than one vote,

738
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,850
you will receive gold as a prize...

739
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,460
regardless of whether you paired up
with someone or not.

740
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,380
(If you get more than one vote,
you will receive gold.)

741
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,930
We'll be at an advantage
if we're popular.

742
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,300
- That's unbelievable.
- Each one of you will receive...

743
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,090
points as a result of the mission
and the voting at the halfway point.

744
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,060
These points will be helpful...

745
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,470
at the final voting.

746
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,900
So try to get
as many points as you can.

747
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,160
- Oh, I get it.
- Rather than winning one over,

748
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,130
- We should win many over.
- you need to get many votes...

749
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,900
- to receive the prize.
- We should win over all of them.

750
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,250
It's not just us.

751
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,750
- The same goes for you five.
- Yes.

752
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,180
- You should win us over.
- Exactly.

753
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,050
Let's begin
the First Impression Poll...

754
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,910
where you can get some points.

755
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,350
- Right now?
- Based on what you've seen so far,

756
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,580
choose one person who you think
would be the best partner for you.

757
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,120
Then raise the penal all at once.

758
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,820
The number of votes you get is
the number of points you get.

759
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
The votes... I get it.
I need to get many votes.

760
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,230
Oh, boy.

761
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,860
- If I choose him...
- Which one should I pick?

762
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,270
Whom you will choose now
will affect how things go for you...

763
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,440
during the race.

764
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,510
- Is that so?
- Yes.

765
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,800
I don't know whom I should choose.

766
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,070
Have you all made your decisions?

767
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,140
- I made up my mind.
- I chose one.

768
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,450
You can't change your vote.

769
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,780
Raise it at once
when I count to three.

770
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,910
- Okay.
- Got it.

771
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,410
- This is a hard choice.
- Ready?

772
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,520
One.

773
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,190
(This is an important first step
that will decide what happens next.)

774
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,430
- Two.
- The first voting has begun.

775
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,000
I wonder how their first impressions
of one another were.

776
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,030
Three.

777
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,660
(Who could be the most popular ones
to be a variety partner?)

778
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,700
- Now...
- What?

779
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,700
(Here's the result
of the male members' voting.)

780
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,440
(The Result
of the First Impression Poll)

781
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,100
Woman Four got 3 votes.

782
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,010
Woman Five got 2 votes,
and Woman Three got 1 vote.

783
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,900
Three.

784
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,950
(The most desirable variety partner
chosen by the female members is...)

785
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:38,410
(The Result
of the First Impression Poll)

786
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,490
- Now...
- What?

787
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,550
Man Five got 2 votes.

788
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:46,460
(With Ji Hyo and In Ah's votes,
Suk Jin gained two points.)

789
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,260
Man One, Man Two,
and Man Three got 1 vote.

790
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,620
Yes!

791
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,230
- Woman Four got 3 votes.
- Yes.

792
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,940
Woman Five got 2 votes,
and Woman Three got 1 vote.

793
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,890
- We checked your first impressions.
- Yes.

794
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,770
- Okay.
- We'll give you the points you got.

795
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,800
- All right.
- Okay.

796
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,330
You will change your clothes now
and then move to the first location.

797
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,250
- All right.
- Let's go.

798
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,980
Most of all, I prefer a tall guy...

799
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,290
because I'm very tall for a woman.

800
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,910
That's why he caught my eye
when I first met everyone.

801
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,990
(Why did you choose Man Two?)

802
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,350
Also, while we were talking,

803
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,430
he seemed to have
a good sense of humor.

804
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,470
I thought that strength of his could
offset my weakness,

805
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,590
and he'd be a great variety partner
for me.

806
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,000
That's why I chose him.

807
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,300
I didn't expect much on my way here.

808
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,010
I just told myself to be myself...

809
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,180
and to have a good time.

810
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,100
(You got a vote from Woman Four.
What do you think about it?)

811
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,300
I don't know if you saw it,

812
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,070
but Woman Four and I chose
each other.

813
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,950
That made me think...

814
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,990
that I might win this race.

815
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,020
(It made him think
he might win the race.)

816
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,290
What do you think about the future
of the dried seafood industry?

817
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,460
How would I know that?

818
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,890
I know nothing about that field.

819
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,800
I heard you started a business
related to it.

820
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,090
- I just inherited the business.
- I see.

821
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,090
I'm still a rookie in the industry.

822
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,100
(Man Two is still a rookie
in the dried seafood industry.)

823
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,100
(A word to Man Three
whom you voted for?)

824
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,240
Man Three.

825
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,110
I think we'll make a great team.

826
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,050
I hope we'll get along well.

827
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,460
(Woman Five feels...)

828
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,620
I'm embarrassed.

829
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,820
Well, I'm not sure
if I should reveal this now,

830
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
(How do you feel
now that you've met everyone?)

831
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,560
but there's someone
I'm interested in.

832
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,700
I'm sure we'll get along well.

833
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,710
The exploration for finding
a variety partner is over.

834
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,980
Some smiled and the other cried
at the First Impression Poll.

835
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,220
Finding the perfect partner will
officially begin now.

836
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,750
Hey, So Min.

837
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,750
If you and I keep pairing up,

838
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,450
we both will receive gold, right?

839
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,610
- Absolutely.
- Right?

840
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,460
I don't need anything else.
I just want to find...

841
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,080
someone who shares
a similar sense of humor with me.

842
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,930
- If that's what you want...
- Yes.

843
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,890
- I think you found the right man.
- I know.

844
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,860
You know... So Min.

845
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,090
- You like dancing like this.
- Yes, I love it.

846
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,740
I love it.

847
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,130
I know you like it.

848
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,510
- Absolutely.
- We'd be a perfect duo.

849
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,160
- I like it.
- Right.

850
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,800
- I really like it.
- We hit it off well.

851
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,630
- I like it so much.
- Here they go again.

852
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,550
Oh, right. Jae Suk,

853
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,070
- you dropped something back there.
- What is it?

854
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,750
- What is this?
- What is it?

855
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,250
- He dropped it earlier.
- What is it?

856
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,250
What is it?

857
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,520
What is it?

858
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,580
It's a coffee shop coupon.

859
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,960
It has all ten stamps on it.

860
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,380
I can get a free cup of coffee.

861
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,050
- Is it free?
- Yes.

862
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,000
- I see. Thank you for this.
- You dropped it.

863
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,160
- Thank you.
- You're funny.

864
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,890
- I'll just keep doing this.
- Am I funny?

865
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,300
Man Six, you look like Lee Duk Hwa.

866
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,900
(He's dressed like
the fishing master.)

867
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,210
I knew he would say that.

868
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,740
Is it an homage
to "The Fishermen and the City?"

869
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,940
You're right.

870
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,400
(The unexpected comment made
the man from abroad feel dizzy.)

871
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,800
Show us how you catch a black porgy.

872
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,110
You must be a fan of the show.

873
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,610
Do you know the show? You might not
know it since you're from overseas.

874
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,990
Have you watched
"The Fishermen and the City?"

875
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,990
- "The Fashion and the City?"
- "The Fishermen and the City."

876
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,050
- "Fishermen."
- "The Fishermen and the City."

877
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,460
- I don't know.
- "The Fishermen and the City."

878
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,790
In the first mission,

879
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,700
you will be divided
into three teams.

880
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,800
Woman Three, Woman Four,
and Woman Five...

881
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,090
will play a game
and choose their team members.

882
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,700
- We'll be divided into three teams.
- Sounds great.

883
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,240
- The three of them?
- Okay!

884
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Woman 3, Woman 4, and Woman 5.

885
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,280
The game they will play is
Pulling Sideburns.

886
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,630
(They will play Pulling Sideburns.)

887
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,640
- Oh, boy.
- It hurts.

888
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,750
- It hurts so much.
- I hate that game.

889
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,910
I actually lost some sideburn hair
while playing this game.

890
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,340
The three of them will pull up
one another's sideburns.

891
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,020
The one who screams first will lose.

892
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,760
- The toughest one will win.
- Yes.

893
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,990
The winner will...

894
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,150
get to choose all three members
at once.

895
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,030
That's a great benefit.

896
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,030
Three of you, please come forward.

897
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,000
- In Ah, come forward.
- Go for it!

898
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
- It's not as easy as it seems.
- Just endure it.

899
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,630
- Right.
- Whom will I fight with?

900
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,630
- The three of you will compete.
- All together.

901
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,940
- Like this?
- You pull... Exactly.

902
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,400
Woman Three is already thinking of
fighting with the others.

903
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,480
Hold the others' sideburns
with both of your hands.

904
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,750
Are we pulling
one another's sideburns?

905
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,140
(They should do it even though
they met for the first time.)

906
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,220
But we met for the first time.

907
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,910
- Please sit on the floor.
- Okay.

908
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,050
- Grab one another's hair.
- Grab it.

909
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,810
If one of you makes a noise,
you can let her hair go.

910
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,990
Then the remaining two will
continue the game.

911
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,260
You can win this
if you don't make any noise.

912
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,960
Now, please grab each other's hair.

913
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,260
- I'm sorry.
- I'm really sorry.

914
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,230
I'm sorry in advance. I'm sorry.

915
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,890
You don't have to be sorry.

916
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,530
- It's just a game. Don't be sorry.
- It's just a game.

917
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,390
I'm not doing this
because I want to. You know, right?

918
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,130
- I'll wind it once.
- I don't want to do this.

919
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,330
(She's winding the hair
around her finger.)

920
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,130
Her hair is too thin.

921
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,630
You shouldn't pull it out.

922
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,040
Make sure not to pull it out.

923
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,900
- You just have to pull it up.
- Just pull it up lightly.

924
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,600
- You shouldn't pull it out.
- If you're ready...

925
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,050
- Ready.
- Please be quiet.

926
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,110
Set.

927
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,810
(They have to win this
to choose the ones they want.)

928
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,050
Go.

929
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,050
(They started pulling the hair
at the same time.)

930
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,960
They're just...
She pulled it up higher.

931
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,880
(The silent war for victory)

932
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,000
- She's moving upward.
- She's feeling it.

933
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,530
- She's moving upward. Right.
- She's moving upward.

934
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,860
- Cho Hee started to feel the pain.
- She's going up.

935
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,230
- She's going up.
- I'm being pulled up too.

936
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,660
- In Ah... Oh, right.
- Pulling up higher.

937
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,890
(Once you make a noise, you're out.)

938
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,540
(Time is passing
as they endure the pain.)

939
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,330
(Groaning)

940
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,010
(She groaned unintentionally
as they pulled her hair harder.)

941
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,280
He In is out.

942
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,610
(The remaining two...)

943
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,550
Hey, if you pull only one side...

944
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,990
Her skin is being pulled up.

945
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,580
- Hey, In Ah.
- She's shaking.

946
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,910
Look at her skin.

947
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,910
- Your hair might get pulled out.
- The skin is being pulled up.

948
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,960
My gosh. They're pulling it so hard.

949
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,730
One of you should just give up.

950
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,200
I said your skin is being pulled up.

951
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,890
- Stop it.
- Throw in the towel.

952
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,120
Play rock-paper-scissors instead.

953
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,000
Your skin is being pulled up.

954
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,940
- Play rock-paper-scissors instead.
- Stop it.

955
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,160
- Play rock-paper-scissors instead.
- Call it a draw.

956
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,830
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

957
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,010
- Let's call it a draw.
- It's a draw.

958
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,180
Play rock-paper-scissors instead.

959
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,840
(They sacrificed their hair
for a variety show.)

960
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,070
- It hurts.
- Her skin was being pulled so hard.

961
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,640
It was scary.

962
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,520
- Wasn't it a friendly match?
- I heard something being torn off.

963
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,550
I know.

964
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,260
- They'll play rock-paper-scissors.
- That's a good idea.

965
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,430
I thought their faces would come off
like in "Mission Impossible."

966
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,000
- I'd be so upset if I lose...
- I thought it was happening.

967
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,760
- after enduring the pain.
- Exactly.

968
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,430
- They pulled it hard.
- He In pulled their hair up high.

969
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,440
All of your eyes looked like this.

970
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,800
(All three of them passed
the funny face test.)

971
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,010
That was so funny.

972
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,160
- That's how attractive we are.
- Good job.

973
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,370
That's how attractive we are.

974
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,630
The two of you will play
rock-paper-scissors.

975
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,050
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

976
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,070
- Yes, I'm fine.
- That's ridiculous.

977
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,140
(In Variety Village, you must
be polite but do your best to win.)

978
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,640
They're pretending to be nice.

979
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,450
Rock-paper-scissors

980
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,880
Rock-paper-scissors

981
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,820
Rock-paper-scissors

982
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,530
(In Ah wins, and Cho Hee loses.)

983
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,030
They were neck and neck once again.

984
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,820
In Ah, you're incredible.

985
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,770
- I'm sorry.
- She's amazing.

986
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,860
In Ah

987
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,090
- In Ah is here, baby
- In Ah is here, baby

988
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,300
- Do you know what this is?
- In Ah, you're amazing.

989
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,740
- "Do you know what this is?"
- Do you?

990
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,400
- How does she know it?
- Okay.

991
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,250
In Ah, please choose three people
you want on your team.

992
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,010
- Go ahead.
- Three members at once?

993
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,050
It's only for this mission.

994
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
(Sending a signal)

995
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,290
(Chuckling)

996
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,580
(Choosing team members can also be
a Perfect Partner Signal.)

997
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,930
- Man Four.
- Okay.

998
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,530
Woman Two.

999
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,590
(Who could be the last one?)

1000
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,500
And Man One.

1001
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,330
(She chose Man One
who was staying still.)

1002
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,800
You mean, Man One? Him?

1003
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,240
- Yes.
- Man One?

1004
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,740
- That's great.
- All right. Good.

1005
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,040
- You chose great ones.
- This is good.

1006
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,050
- But...
- That's a good choice.

1007
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,550
- I gave her a signal.
- Can you make some room?

1008
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,140
- Come and sit down.
- Okay.

1009
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,550
- She wants to win.
- Good choice.

1010
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,310
Next, Cho Hee, please choose
three members you want on your team.

1011
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,460
(Snapping)

1012
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,760
- I haven't done this in a while.
- It's been a long time.

1013
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,530
- He hasn't done it in a while.
- Indeed.

1014
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,150
Gosh. What was that?

1015
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,030
- You looked like a lowlife.
- That brings back old memories.

1016
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,890
- I choose Man Six.
- Okay!

1017
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,160
She chose Man Six.

1018
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,590
And Man Three.

1019
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,240
- Man Three.
- And I choose...

1020
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,370
Choose one more person.

1021
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,630
I choose...

1022
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,710
Woman One.

1023
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,250
- Woman One.
- Nice.

1024
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,410
Hold on. This could be...

1025
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,250
- She chose the wrong ones.
- I'm sorry.

1026
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,020
- I'm glad we're on the same team.
- It seems that we're going to...

1027
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,640
- play a game while sitting.
- What?

1028
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,260
- You're right. Hang on.
- Oh, right.

1029
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,190
Jong Kook is right.

1030
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,120
- I see a sketchbook...
- Okay.

1031
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,530
- and a xylophone.
- It's a quiz.

1032
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,930
- Hang on.
- You know, the three of them...

1033
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,320
I'm worried.

1034
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,800
The first mission will give you...

1035
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,200
a chance to show off your teamwork.

1036
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,330
It's Crazy Speed Quiz.

1037
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,740
- Crazy Speed Quiz.
- What could that be?

1038
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,280
- I'm fully confident.
- All members of the team will play.

1039
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,970
The team with the highest score
will win.

1040
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,410
Is it a quiz?

1041
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,810
- But...
- We're done for.

1042
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,140
- A quiz...
- Don't worry.

1043
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,240
She said, "We're done for."

1044
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,410
They're the three empty heads.

1045
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,240
- I bet she didn't know.
- Woman Five...

1046
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,850
- I feel bad for her.
- Woman Five.

1047
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,060
Why did she choose them?

1048
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,490
It's rare to see all three of us
on the same team, but today,

1049
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,160
there might be four empty heads
on the same team.

1050
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,260
It's a perfect team
for a variety show.

1051
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,490
They'll be like
Running Man Avengers.

1052
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,120
- A team of empty heads.
- Don't worry.

1053
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
We're good at this.

1054
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,740
The team members will take turns
answering questions.

1055
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,140
You gain one point if you say a word
included in the given category...

1056
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,560
in three seconds.

1057
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,870
If you say the same answer
that someone else always said,

1058
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,780
- you lose one point.
- I'm not good at things like this.

1059
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,180
If you say a wrong answer
or can't say anything,

1060
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,640
- you lose five points.
- It requires wit.

1061
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,810
It's better to say the same answer
than saying nothing.

1062
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,620
- Even if we lose one point.
- That's better.

1063
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,850
- Okay. Let's do this!
- Yes.

1064
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,660
I'm confident.

1065
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,760
- It will continue without a break.
- Got it.

1066
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,200
Don't be nervous.

1067
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,120
Why are you getting so nervous?

1068
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,700
I'm not good at things like this.

1069
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,530
- He's shaking again.
- Look.

1070
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,240
- He's fidgeting with his toes.
- He's shaking.

1071
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,030
- This is my specialty.
- He's the first one to go.

1072
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,510
Man One, your lips turned purple.

1073
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,700
- What?
- You must be really nervous.

1074
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,140
- This is my specialty.
- Why?

1075
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,280
It's normal to get nervous...

1076
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,550
- when it requires speed.
- It's my specialty.

1077
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,740
Games that require speed.

1078
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,370
- We'll begin with this team.
- Me?

1079
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,740
The first round will be easy.

1080
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,910
- Okay.
- That's great.

1081
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,390
Countries in Europe. 1, 2, 3.

1082
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,850
- France.
- 1, 2, 3.

1083
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,330
- Italy.
- 1, 2, 3.

1084
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,720
- Denmark.
- 1, 2, 3.

1085
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,260
- The UK.
- 1, 2, 3.

1086
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,850
- Denmark.
- 1, 2, 3.

1087
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,160
- Switzerland.
- 1, 2, 3.

1088
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,760
- Turkey.
- 1, 2, 3.

1089
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,970
- 1, 2, 3.
- The Netherlands.

1090
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,330
- 1, 2, 3.
- Sweden.

1091
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,890
- 1, 2, 3.
- Finland again.

1092
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,160
- 1, 2, 3.
- Prague.

1093
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,700
- 1, 2, 3.
- Greece.

1094
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,430
- Prague was incorrect.
- Prague was incorrect.

1095
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,430
- But...
- Come on.

1096
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,870
So Min, please.

1097
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,180
(The team lost a few points
as So Min said the same answers.)

1098
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,280
There's a lot of countries
in Europe.

1099
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,550
One of them couldn't even say
anything.

1100
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,740
- I know.
- That's right.

1101
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,760
- Excuse me. Our team is playing.
- Yes?

1102
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,990
- Why do you keep interrupting?
- I'm sorry, but why did you do it?

1103
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,620
- We must be accurate.
- Mister.

1104
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,330
- Don't call me that.
- But you're a man.

1105
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,390
That's true. But don't call me that.

1106
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,490
- What else should I call you?
- Gosh, seriously.

1107
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,220
- Call me "Man 5."
- Oh, "Man 5?"

1108
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,030
- Yes. Don't call me "Mister."
- Okay.

1109
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,830
- Man Five, why did you do that?
- You're so weird, mister.

1110
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,430
Why did you call me that
when you asked me not to?

1111
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,370
- That's it. He got caught.
- He got caught.

1112
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,010
- Why are you speaking casually?
- You did the same thing earlier.

1113
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,280
- So I tried it.
- Why are you speaking casually?

1114
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,100
- I mean...
- Why did he sit there?

1115
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Don't forget to click "Like"
and subscribe to our channel.

1116
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,140
- Are you going to punch me?
- What?

1117
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,550
Are you going to punch me
in front of the camera?

1118
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,990
Why would you speak casually to me?

1119
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,810
- Stop arguing and sit here.
- Did you hear what he said?

1120
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,510
- No. Stay here.
- Come over here.

1121
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,450
He annoys me even more than you do.

1122
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,450
- He's even worse.
- Stop it.

1123
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,620
- He's even more annoying.
- Don't do that to my team member.

1124
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,030
- My gosh.
- Stay there for now.

1125
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,330
- Okay.
- Okay.

1126
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,990
By the way, I think I know
the purpose of this game.

1127
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,970
You're trying to make us
hate each other, right?

1128
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,510
Do you see what I mean? Right?

1129
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,280
- We see the worst in each other.
- I mean...

1130
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,330
- The worst in us.
- It will only make us...

1131
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,740
- We need to impress each other.
- This is not helping.

1132
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,350
- No one will pick me.
- Exactly.

1133
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,450
- Next up is this team.
- The Czech Republic.

1134
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,910
- It'll be a disaster. Watch.
- Ready.

1135
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,140
- Are you ready to laugh?
- Yes.

1136
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,180
It'll be a mess.

1137
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,260
Here's the category.

1138
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,680
Capital cities
except for those of Asian countries.

1139
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,220
(What does that mean?)

1140
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,530
- What does that mean?
- One.

1141
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,930
- We should...
- Luxemburg.

1142
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,220
- 1, 2, 3.
- Jamaica... No.

1143
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,390
- I mean, Kingston.
- 1, 2, 3.

1144
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,260
- Kingston?
- 1, 2, 3.

1145
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,200
- What did he say? I didn't hear...
- I said the correct answer!

1146
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,010
(The team of empty heads lost
many points from the beginning.)

1147
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,280
- I said Kingston.
- 1, 2, 3.

1148
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,330
- Well...
- 1, 2,

1149
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,810
- Hungary.
- Three.

1150
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,140
(He confidently said Hungary.)

1151
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,240
(The first empty head thinks
Hungary is a city.)

1152
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,780
- 1, 2, 3.
- London.

1153
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,240
- Well...
- 1, 2, 3.

1154
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,220
- London.
- 1, 2, 3.

1155
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,120
- Paris.
- Too late.

1156
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,490
1, 2, 3.

1157
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,060
(The spaced out one
next to the dumb one)

1158
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,330
- Wait.
- 1, 2, 3.

1159
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,660
- This is so great. Nice.
- You're doing great.

1160
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,160
You said two correct answers.

1161
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,330
(They said
only two correct answers.)

1162
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,620
My gosh.

1163
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,870
(The empty heads didn't let us down
as always.)

1164
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,930
- Asian countries...
- Capital cities...

1165
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,910
except for those of Asian countries.

1166
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,010
- That team is unbelievable.
- Awesome.

1167
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,330
- My goodness.
- We'll win.

1168
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,850
- This is so nice.
- I'm having so much fun.

1169
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,350
That was a disaster.

1170
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,050
- Woman Five was an empty head too.
- That was so funny.

1171
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,950
Woman Five is an empty head too.

1172
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,620
I studied before the shoot.

1173
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,910
I studied... Is it over?

1174
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,910
- It's over.
- Your score is minus 63.

1175
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,030
- What did you say?
- We did well.

1176
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,390
Is it even possible
to get that score?

1177
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,390
(Is getting that score possible?)

1178
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,030
You got a higher score
than I thought it would be.

1179
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,760
- You guys did well.
- Minus 63?

1180
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,200
- He didn't understand the question.
- I didn't.

1181
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,910
I know capital cities. Paris...

1182
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,330
- and Washington, DC.
- Good.

1183
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,830
I know all of them.
I could've said at least these two.

1184
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,140
It would be minus 13
if they had said Prague 13 times.

1185
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,640
Why did they confuse me
by saying something about Asia?

1186
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,280
- That's why I missed the timing.
- There's Stockholm too.

1187
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,350
You learned the capital city
of Argentina not long ago.

1188
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,890
- Buenos Saires.
- He...

1189
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,450
It's Buenos Aires.

1190
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,180
Quiet down. Don't say anything.

1191
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,560
I see that he already gave up.

1192
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,850
I'm supposed to look charming
when I speak.

1193
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,600
But whenever I speak,
I look less and less charming.

1194
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,720
- He's a complete empty head.
- It's funny.

1195
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,100
- You have great chemistry.
- I know.

1196
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,890
- The answers were close enough.
- Saires?

1197
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,160
- Brasilia.
- Buenos Saires?

1198
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,600
Okay, good.

1199
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,180
It seems like
they're all put off by us,

1200
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,010
so let's team up within the group.

1201
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,200
You can both pick me.

1202
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,120
The others won't
be fond of us anyway.

1203
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,720
- Within the group.
- Okay?

1204
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,510
- Okay, got it.
- It's over for us.

1205
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,810
We're done for.

1206
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,510
- Yes, you're done.
- Okay.

1207
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,720
(The round ends with them
putting the others off.)

1208
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,060
Just saying the same answer
13 times...

1209
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,060
will put us ahead of them.

1210
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,060
- If you draw a blank...
- If you don't know the answer,

1211
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,760
- just say what someone else said.
- Got it.

1212
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,990
- It'll still put us in second.
- That's a good strategy.

1213
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,560
Don't guess if you don't know.

1214
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,830
Okay, here we go.

1215
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,060
English words that start with an A.

1216
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,140
In 1, 2, 3.

1217
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,530
- Apple.
- 1, 2, 3.

1218
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,870
- Apple.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1219
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,330
- Apple.
- 1, 2, 3.

1220
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,810
- Apple.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1221
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,240
- Apple.
- 1, 2, 3.

1222
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,370
Apple. Hold on a second.

1223
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,010
- 2, 3.
- Are you kidding me?

1224
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,280
(They had to use their strategy
a bit early in the game.)

1225
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,350
- Again.
- 1, 2, 3.

1226
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,810
- Again.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1227
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,890
- April.
- 1, 2, 3.

1228
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,620
(They're no better
than the empty heads.)

1229
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,930
- A...
- 1, 2, 3.

1230
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,180
- Well...
- 1, 2, 3.

1231
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,330
Arab!

1232
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,660
We'll count Arab.

1233
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,200
- I mean...
- Is that the best you can do?

1234
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,600
There are thousands of words
that start with A.

1235
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,740
- You're better than this.
- It's...

1236
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,030
There's AlphaGo.

1237
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,700
- You're better than this.
- Armani.

1238
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,740
- Hold on.
- You could've done better.

1239
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,100
You went from countries
to capital cities to...

1240
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,350
There are thousands of words
that start with an A.

1241
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,740
- Are you kidding me?
- So Min...

1242
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,970
- Do you know what she said?
- What?

1243
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,810
"Jae Suk, there are thousands of
words starting with an A."

1244
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,140
"Like Umbrella."

1245
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,220
"Umbrella."

1246
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,560
(Woman Two thought that
Umbrella began with an A.)

1247
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,060
Seriously?

1248
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,220
Jae Suk,
there are thousands of answers.

1249
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,930
- Umbrella.
- That's enough.

1250
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,030
Umbrella.

1251
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,490
Umbrella begins with a U.

1252
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,600
(She really didn't know
since she said it twice.)

1253
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,200
(You're part of
the Empty Head Club!)

1254
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,530
(Whoa!)

1255
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,430
We're completely put off by you.

1256
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,810
Get out of here.

1257
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,370
A coffee shop owner
is not wanted either.

1258
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,180
It begins with a U.

1259
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,180
- Unbelievable.
- It begins with a U.

1260
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,850
She...

1261
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,720
Umbrella made me laugh so hard.

1262
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,120
That was the best.

1263
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,350
- Next...
- There's "ant" along with others.

1264
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,780
- We're back to you guys.
- Can you...

1265
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,850
have them name English words...

1266
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:15,950
so that they can implode?

1267
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,010
We're back to you guys.

1268
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,560
- No more English words.
- Why not?

1269
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,030
No more English words.

1270
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,430
(His voice squeaks.)

1271
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,600
(His voice squeaks
out of fear for English words.)

1272
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,870
Did you hear that?

1273
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,120
His voice squeaked.

1274
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,990
- You must be feeling the pressure.
- Well...

1275
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,370
- "No more English words."
- It had me worried.

1276
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,930
You know what?

1277
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,330
I found that quite charming.

1278
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,510
- I won't go for English words.
- Okay.

1279
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,640
It's doable then.

1280
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,280
- Listen up for the question.
- That was hilarious.

1281
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,510
Here we go.

1282
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,910
Foreign painters.

1283
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,550
- In 1, 2, 3.
- What?

1284
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,740
- Vincent van Gogh.
- 1, 2, 3.

1285
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:47,890
- 1, 2...
- Paul Gauguin.

1286
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,390
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Leonardo da Vinci.

1287
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,450
1, 2, 3.

1288
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,850
- Mr. Chelly?
- 1, 2, 3.

1289
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,450
- Vincent van Gogh.
- Picasso.

1290
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,120
- 1, 2, 3.
- Vincent van Gogh.

1291
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,390
Leonardo DiCaprio.

1292
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,430
Hold on.

1293
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,300
- Leonardo DiCaprio?
- 1, 2, 3.

1294
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,620
- Go...
- 1, 2, 3.

1295
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,970
- Go...
- Vincent van Gogh.

1296
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,430
Vance Breck.

1297
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,240
(Vance Breck, since 2021)

1298
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,780
(Known for his piece
"The Empty Head")

1299
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
Dance break, was it?

1300
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,470
- Dance break?
- Dance break.

1301
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,100
Even as a guy, I'm put off by him.

1302
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,870
It's your turn now.

1303
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,080
- We should switch seats.
- Why?

1304
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,450
- There's really no difference.
- But Woman Four...

1305
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,350
- It's making me dizzy.
- Is it?

1306
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,910
- Then let me...
- Really?

1307
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,560
- I'll take the middle seat.
- Thank you.

1308
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,580
It's understandable.

1309
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,990
Woman Four, you don't seem...

1310
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,430
- to be that knowledgeable.
- I also...

1311
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,560
don't think...

1312
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,830
she's a fast thinker.

1313
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,060
- Empty Head.
- All right.

1314
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,990
Name the series and movies
Kwang Soo's been in.

1315
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,330
- What?
- This isn't an easy one.

1316
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,430
"Collective Invention."

1317
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,700
(The filmography of
an actor of 14 years)

1318
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,180
- "Collective Invention."
- 1, 2, 3.

1319
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,600
- "Collective Invention."
- In 1, 2, 3.

1320
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,740
- "Collective Invention."
- 1, 2, 3.

1321
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,780
1, 2, 3.

1322
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,350
- "Tazza One-Eyed Jacks."
- 1, 2, 3.

1323
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,780
- "Tazza One-Eyed Jacks."
- In 1, 2, 3.

1324
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,810
"Tazza One-Eyed Jacks."

1325
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:51,910
- Darn it!
- "Collective Invention."

1326
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,410
(Darn it!)

1327
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,390
(Whatever Kwang Soo says
comes back to him like an echo.)

1328
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,850
- 1, 2, 3.
- "Live."

1329
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,060
- In 1, 2, 3.
- "Live."

1330
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,390
- 1, 2, 3.
- "Live."

1331
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,030
- 1, 2, 3.
- "Collective Invention."

1332
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,530
- 1, 2, 3.
- I'm done.

1333
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,970
(Kwang Soo announces
that he's quitting.)

1334
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,220
- Hold on a second.
- Seriously?

1335
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,640
(The Baeksang award winner
is more than just upset.)

1336
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,310
Seriously?

1337
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,510
It's...

1338
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,830
- Do you even know who I am?
- I do.

1339
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,910
Have you watched
at least one of them?

1340
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,280
- I went to a premier,
- He was in many shows.

1341
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,740
- but I don't remember which one.
- Right?

1342
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,620
- Just pick one from the list!
- But...

1343
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,640
Atka mackerel, halibut,

1344
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,350
and frozen pollack.

1345
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,510
I didn't mean
you should name fishes.

1346
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,010
Anyway, here are the results.

1347
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,120
In first place...

1348
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,760
is Team Woman Three.

1349
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,030
- Okay!
- Nice!

1350
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,030
- Nice.
- Good one.

1351
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,060
(They all receive 3 points each.)

1352
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,300
In second place...

1353
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,030
is Team Woman Four.

1354
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,240
(They all get a point each.)

1355
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,160
You have a total of minus 78 points.

1356
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,510
(No one even comes close.)

1357
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,410
Nicely done, guys.
It's all or nothing.

1358
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,830
We can stick together though.

1359
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,970
- Right.
- We'll partner up within the group.

1360
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,580
- I have a feeling that'll happen.
- Exactly.

1361
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,010
- They'll fall for each other.
- Right.

1362
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,180
(The empty heads get absorbed
in each other's charms.)

1363
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,450
- You must all be hungry.
- We are.

1364
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,720
You'll take a step closer
to one another by partnering up...

1365
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,450
in this round of Loving Lunch Box.

1366
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,120
- A lunch box?
- Will we be sharing?

1367
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,560
We're already choosing our partners?

1368
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,760
The ladies will wait
in their designated spots.

1369
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:15,060
The men will seek out
the woman they'd like...

1370
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,970
to share their lunch with.

1371
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,330
The points the women will receive...

1372
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,930
depend on the number of men
that come looking for them.

1373
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,410
(The ladies will receive points
every time someone comes to them.)

1374
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,410
This...

1375
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,550
- Hold on.
- After lunch,

1376
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:29,640
the ladies...

1377
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,580
will each choose one of the men.

1378
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:37,120
That man will receive
the same number of points.

1379
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,390
You can choose
whoever comes looking for you.

1380
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,100
But if you don't like any of them...

1381
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,850
and would rather show off your charm
to another man,

1382
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:43,990
you can choose
to give them the points.

1383
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,060
(They can choose anyone they want.)

1384
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,100
- I wonder what'll happen.
- I'll receive a lot of points.

1385
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,990
- This is a hard one.
- What will happen?

1386
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:50,640
This is a little worrying.

1387
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,030
It seems as though...

1388
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,530
we should manage within this group.

1389
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,740
We'll partner up within the group.

1390
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,950
Be smart about this.

1391
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,410
(We'll look forward
to their loyalty.)

1392
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,910
There's something you should know.

1393
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,370
We have the most points.

1394
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,620
- Of course.
- Right.

1395
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,310
- In Ah and I...
- She's right.

1396
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,410
- We're aware of that.
- The ladies...

1397
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,620
will head to their spots
with their packed lunches.

1398
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,830
Go ahead.

1399
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,080
Cho Hee, go ahead.
There's no need to worry.

1400
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,700
But I don't have any points.

1401
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,990
Opportunity will find
whoever takes a chance.

1402
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,530
Who should I go to?

1403
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,260
- Shall we?
- Sure.

1404
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,370
Do we just take these?

1405
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,310
- Do we take our lunch boxes?
- Sure.

1406
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,430
(They take their designated seats.)

1407
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:29,100
What if no one comes to me?

1408
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,180
I'd like at least one
to come and find me.

1409
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:34,100
To be honest,
I'm quite fond of Man Three.

1410
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,120
He looks like
he'll be good at everything,

1411
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,780
but he's a master of none.

1412
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,680
It's why...

1413
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,120
I feel like I should
care for him in some way.

1414
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,950
I have a feeling that
Man Three will seek me out.

1415
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,830
He showed how charming he is,

1416
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,530
which has probably made him
popular with the ladies.

1417
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,560
But when it comes
to who's funnier...

1418
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,330
(You seem confident.)

1419
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,910
I'm sure I have the advantage.

1420
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:08,850
Man Three and Man Six
should be here for sure.

1421
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:09,950
(Who do you think will come to you?)

1422
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,490
That's what I believe.

1423
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,680
My teammates are of
the Empty Head Club.

1424
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,280
(They're all stupid.)

1425
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,160
We were all just as stupid, right?

1426
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,830
I mean...

1427
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,450
Who else would they go to?

1428
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,830
I'm their only option.

1429
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,120
Who would accept them?

1430
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,970
Surprisingly enough, Man Three
is popular with the ladies.

1431
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,010
- Can I meet him outside?
- Sure.

1432
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,780
Are Woman Four and Woman Five...

1433
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,530
waiting for Man Three as well?

1434
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,370
(Where will Man Three's heart
take him?)

1435
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,620
Where will Man Three's heart...

1436
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,810
take him?

1437
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,950
- You eat with someone comfortable.
- Right.

1438
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,720
I find So Min comfortable.

1439
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,060
I agree,

1440
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,830
but she has been buttering up
to just about anyone.

1441
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:55,930
Exactly.

1442
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,030
- She only means half her words.
- I know.

1443
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,330
This is something I personally hate.

1444
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,330
It's cheesy, isn't it?

1445
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,640
Her choice of words
is always so cheesy.

1446
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,830
(The IT expert hates paper coupons.)

1447
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,200
It's why I made up my mind.

1448
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,600
- Have you?
- Yes.

1449
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,640
- Someone comfortable?
- Yes.

1450
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,810
- I'd rather have lunch at ease.
- Hold on.

1451
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:15,810
I'm not shy around strangers though.

1452
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:18,740
I can eat just about anything too.

1453
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,720
Even street food?

1454
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,720
- You're not shy around strangers?
- Not at all.

1455
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,390
I can be friendly with people
who I see for the first time.

1456
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:26,720
Is that so?

1457
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,620
I know you to be quite sensitive.

1458
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,990
- That's hardly the case.
- Is that so?

1459
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,060
You're one to eat food
in the most unappealing way.

1460
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:33,600
- I know, but...
- Who should I choose?

1461
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,700
Since I've been on He In's team,

1462
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,100
maybe I should go
and talk to Cho Hee this time.

1463
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,160
Cho Hee...

1464
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,240
is the silliest.

1465
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,830
- Is she?
- Yes.

1466
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,700
- Really?
- She's the new Empty Head.

1467
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,200
- She's...
- From what I could tell,

1468
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,970
- she seemed fun to be around.
- Right.

1469
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,220
She's funny.

1470
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,220
- She's like sunshine too.
- I agree.

1471
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,510
What if someone else
chooses the same partner?

1472
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,060
- Do I eat with him?
- You'll all eat together.

1473
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,220
You'll dine together.

1474
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,680
But I don't want
to eat with Kwang Soo.

1475
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,330
- Do you think that's a possibility?
- I do.

1476
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:06,200
Who will you go to?
Tell us who your first choice is.

1477
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,260
I'd like to know more about He In.

1478
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,560
- He In?
- Yes.

1479
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,700
She intrigues me.

1480
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,810
- The way you put it is hilarious.
- You know,

1481
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,370
Se Chan could really
be interested in her.

1482
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,280
- It could be for real.
- Right.

1483
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,350
- He's not like us.
- Of course not.

1484
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,780
- This isn't serious for us.
- Right.

1485
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,720
- But me...
- He could actually mean it.

1486
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,220
I mean, Se Chan...

1487
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,580
- Only me though.
- Right.

1488
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,910
Only I can show interest
in Cho Hee and He In.

1489
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,720
I really want to know them better.

1490
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,990
- Then...
- Could it be too embarrassing?

1491
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,350
Then let's allow Se Chan...

1492
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,030
to have some alone time with He In.

1493
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,300
- Just the two of them.
- Right.

1494
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,430
- I'll go to her.
- You should.

1495
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:39,490
So no one will join us? Okay.

1496
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,530
Just the two of them.

1497
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,530
Good.

1498
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:43,390
After the meal,

1499
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,700
she might be
put off by you completely.

1500
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,140
That's the worst-case scenario.

1501
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,640
He makes noises when he eats.

1502
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,180
- You make noises?
- And he spills.

1503
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,640
Some women hate that.

1504
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,550
- It's all good.
- Women hate that, you know.

1505
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,310
You're actually serious, aren't you?

1506
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,550
Could you guys help me
just this once?

1507
00:48:58,550 --> 00:48:59,890
- Sure.
- I'm asking you.

1508
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,910
- Sure.
- You know...

1509
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,160
- We'll keep the possibilities open.
- You...

1510
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,510
- can go to He In.
- Thanks.

1511
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,950
- We'll make it happen for you.
- Right.

1512
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,450
Just know this though.

1513
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:09,620
You aren't compatible at all.

1514
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,120
(You aren't compatible at all.)

1515
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,200
I mean it.

1516
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,830
Completely incompatible.

1517
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,560
- You don't suit her.
- You're the worst.

1518
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,370
- I like you, but...
- You look like her manager.

1519
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,200
- It feels like...
- I'll see how compatible we are.

1520
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,600
- "The Manager."
- Yes, let's see.

1521
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,140
- Man One, you can set off now.
- I can?

1522
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,200
- Man One, go ahead.
- Gosh.

1523
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,970
- Oh, there's a map?
- We need to move strategically.

1524
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,510
My goodness.

1525
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:30,870
(Man 1 sets off first.)

1526
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:32,810
Who's sitting there?

1527
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,950
Oh, it's Cho Hee!

1528
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,510
- Hi! Are you coming to me?
- You're sitting outside.

1529
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,060
- Are you coming to me?
- Actually...

1530
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,060
I didn't know you were here.
It's very close.

1531
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,450
Yes. It's very close, isn't it?

1532
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,870
Don't go somewhere far,

1533
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,530
- and just come to me.
- Okay, okay. Hang on.

1534
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,560
(Walking away)

1535
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,060
- He's testing the waters.
- They're all waving at me.

1536
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,060
Hey, So Min!

1537
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,700
What do you mean? I'm not So Min!

1538
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,240
Oh, you're In Ah. I'm sorry.

1539
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,350
Do you have plenty of side dishes?

1540
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,180
- Sorry?
- I have some meat for a side dish.

1541
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,050
Oh, okay.
You came out this far to meet me?

1542
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,640
Yes. You're going to look around
and come back, right?

1543
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,450
Of course I will.

1544
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,350
- Where are you going?
- Just hang in there.

1545
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,450
- Man One!
- This is where you are. It's close.

1546
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:20,330
(Woman 2 who has many petty talents
uses an echo to attract Man 1.)

1547
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,560
Man One!

1548
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,600
(Man 1 already burst into laughter.)

1549
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,640
- You are...
- Over here!

1550
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,810
She's indeed funny.

1551
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,240
I missed you.

1552
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,080
She's really funny.

1553
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,310
Let's eat together!

1554
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,490
I can dance for you...

1555
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,120
the whole time while you're
having your lunch.

1556
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,660
I can dance twice as fast.
I can do all types of dances.

1557
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,120
What do you think?

1558
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,490
- Really?
- There's a dance you like.

1559
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,430
There's a dance you like.

1560
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,260
There is.
Yes, I like that kind of dance.

1561
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,330
(Woman 2 inspires
the dancer in Man 1.)

1562
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,740
- She's such a good dancer.
- She's really funny.

1563
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,010
Woman Two is funny.

1564
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,100
Wait a minute. Where should I eat?

1565
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,370
How are you?

1566
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,910
(She asks how he is,
using the line from "Love Letter.")

1567
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,550
Man One is flustered by all the love
he's getting for the first time.

1568
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,560
Man One.

1569
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,180
(She dances nonstop.)

1570
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,450
She's incredible.

1571
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:20,680
- So Min.
- She's funny.

1572
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,100
- I give up.
- She's indeed funny.

1573
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,330
- You got this.
- Woman Two is funny.

1574
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,120
Wait a minute. I'll just...

1575
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,200
(Will Man 1 have his lunch
with Woman 2?)

1576
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,800
I'll have my lunch with Woman One.

1577
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,240
I'll have my lunch with Woman One.

1578
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,510
(Shocked)

1579
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,240
(The one who's chosen
is shocked too.)

1580
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,350
- Really?
- Yes.

1581
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,950
- It's because...
- Thank you.

1582
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,310
I want to eat...

1583
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,640
- You're not talkative, right?
- Of course not.

1584
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,910
You need to eat comfortably.

1585
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,180
- I love it.
- Man One!

1586
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,510
I want to eat with...

1587
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,580
Woman One who is
not the talkative type.

1588
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,390
- You need to eat comfortably.
- Yes.

1589
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:52,620
I want to eat comfortably.

1590
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,390
- Good luck, Man Two.
- Thank you.

1591
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,600
I'm not sure who I should pick.

1592
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,660
(Man 2 sets off right after.)

1593
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,060
Actually, at first,

1594
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,160
He In picked me.

1595
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,300
(Man 2 still hasn't decided.)

1596
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,600
Nevertheless,

1597
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,740
to win as many points as I can...

1598
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:08,830
My gosh.

1599
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,080
Young Master.

1600
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,550
- My gosh, hello.
- Come this way.

1601
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,080
(Woman 3 came to meet
the young master.)

1602
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,680
But you didn't pick me
when we were picking team members.

1603
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,850
Also, I just heard from somewhere...

1604
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,910
that you said I look sly.

1605
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,120
That wasn't me.

1606
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,580
I heard the person who interviewed
before me said that.

1607
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,120
- Oh, there was another interviewee?
- Yes.

1608
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,390
Well, for me...

1609
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,700
Oh, you chose your partner already?

1610
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,030
Yes, I already picked mine.

1611
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,030
(It's not you.)

1612
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,740
Woman Three was rejected again.

1613
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,780
I guess no one is coming this way.

1614
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:44,810
(Smirking)

1615
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:45,870
- May I come in?
- Hi.

1616
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,310
Please come in, Man Two.

1617
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,350
(You came to me!)

1618
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,120
- Hello.
- My goodness.

1619
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,850
What? You were there?

1620
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,350
Yes, I'm stationed here.

1621
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:56,760
(An unexpected love triangle)

1622
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,760
- Oh, you were here, Woman Four.
- Yes.

1623
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,930
There's lots of yellow dust today.

1624
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,030
You should come inside.

1625
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,260
- Wait, I need to...
- Come inside.

1626
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,160
No, don't go.
Who are you looking at?

1627
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,330
Didn't you come to see me, Man Two?

1628
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:08,930
- Didn't you come to see me?
- No, I was...

1629
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,390
This is driving me crazy.

1630
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:12,760
This is so uncomfortable.

1631
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,810
(He finds this sudden popularity
very uncomfortable.)

1632
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,310
You should get back inside.

1633
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:18,580
- No, I won't.
- Go back inside.

1634
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,640
The weather is nice today, so...

1635
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,200
Go back inside.

1636
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,720
The weather is nice, I know.

1637
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:27,080
Someone else is coming
for you, Woman Four.

1638
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,490
I'll eat with Woman Five.

1639
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:31,120
- Okay. Enjoy your lunch.
- Man Two, who was torn...

1640
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,350
between the two, decided to
let Man Three take care of the rest.

1641
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:35,800
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

1642
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,950
Hello.

1643
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,490
I won't end up eating alone, will I?

1644
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,990
I'm sure I won't.

1645
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,700
- Okay, I'll set off now.
- Man Three, it's your turn.

1646
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,030
- Please be considerate.
- Okay.

1647
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,200
- It's been a while.
- Man Three set off to...

1648
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,010
find his love just in time.

1649
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,950
It's been a while
since I've had such an experience.

1650
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:53,950
- Sure.
- My goodness.

1651
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:55,350
- It's exciting.
- I think he's serious.

1652
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:56,370
- He's serious.
- He must not know...

1653
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,580
they don't look good together.

1654
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,950
(He can't help but smile
even when the others sneer at him.)

1655
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,010
Where could she be?

1656
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,780
My goodness. Ms. Song.

1657
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,950
Our team has zero points, right?

1658
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,120
That's true.

1659
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,600
Please eat with me.

1660
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,930
There's someone else coming.

1661
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,060
I don't like it when people
act unnaturally.

1662
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,030
(Reading a book under a tree)

1663
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,310
Oh, you're here.

1664
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,140
(Ms. Ambrella tries to appeal
with her intelligence.)

1665
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,510
I'll go and look around.

1666
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,530
- Your legs will hurt, Se Chan.
- I'll go and look around.

1667
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:26,970
They said they'll support me,

1668
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,620
so I'm going to meet
the woman of my life.

1669
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,950
My gosh.

1670
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,890
Gosh, I might as well
just sprinkle some salt.

1671
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,720
- Are you done for today?
- Yes, I'm done.

1672
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,780
I should just go home.
I'm losing money.

1673
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,600
We should follow our strategy.
We have no other choice.

1674
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,700
I have my own strategy too.

1675
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:46,030
Gosh, Se Chan...

1676
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,100
Why don't you go
and compete with him?

1677
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,300
Why don't you go where Se Chan is...

1678
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,470
You have to remember this.

1679
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,010
Se Chan could be really shy
in front of her.

1680
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,080
I could go and make things
easy for him.

1681
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,810
(Se Chan could be shy, so I could go
and make things easy for him.)

1682
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,240
But I want to see him being shy.

1683
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,780
Man 5 is just envious of Man 3's...

1684
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,780
infinite possibilities.

1685
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,950
I can go and talk badly
about Se Chan.

1686
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,010
"Do you still stay overnight
at someone else's place?"

1687
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,220
You could do that.

1688
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,450
But it could play against you.

1689
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,430
- You think so?
- Because you never go home.

1690
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,390
Se Chan will say this.

1691
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,530
"You don't go home either."

1692
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,220
- That's fine.
- He could say that.

1693
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,930
- It's fine with you?
- My wife knows the truth.

1694
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,740
- She might not know.
- You have a wife?

1695
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,830
You have a wife?

1696
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,810
- If you do, you can't be here.
- I'm sorry.

1697
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,600
- I just...
- It's the rule of this place.

1698
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,200
Please keep it a secret.

1699
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:31,640
Please keep it a secret.

1700
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,050
- You'll be in big trouble.
- The others won't find out.

1701
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:34,640
It's okay as long as
the women don't know.

1702
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,680
Our show will be ruined.

1703
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,310
I'm sorry about that.

1704
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,220
- Do you have kids also?
- You don't have a kid, do you?

1705
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,680
I have a kid,
but I can't lie about it.

1706
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,260
I feel so bad for my kid.

1707
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,430
I feel bad if I say
that I don't have a kid.

1708
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,160
- I feel bad for the kid.
- You have a kid too?

1709
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,160
I do.

1710
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,300
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

1711
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,720
If you two keep it a secret,

1712
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,800
I'll edit the rest of the parts.

1713
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,740
Many people have watched it already.

1714
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,990
(Man 3 heads to the open door
without a doubt.)

1715
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,010
All right.

1716
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

1717
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,700
- Hi.
- My gosh.

1718
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,050
I came straight to you.

1719
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:07,600
My, thank you for coming.

1720
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,870
It's as though I'm attracted to you
like a magnet.

1721
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,140
- Come, come.
- I came to you.

1722
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,950
(Laughing awkwardly)

1723
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,990
- How shall we sit?
- You can sit there.

1724
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:17,120
- Sure.
- The left side of my face...

1725
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,310
- is more handsome.
- Is that so?

1726
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,120
- Yes, so I'll sit here.
- Okay.

1727
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,850
My goodness. Thank you for coming.

1728
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:22,950
Not at all.

1729
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,620
(Laughing awkwardly)

1730
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,560
My gosh. Were you perhaps
hoping for someone specific to come?

1731
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,370
- Sorry? I wanted you to come.
- Did you want anyone...

1732
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,390
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1733
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,240
I actually did an interview earlier.

1734
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,830
They asked me if I wanted
anyone specific to come.

1735
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:35,930
What did you say to that?

1736
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,810
(In the interview earlier)

1737
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,280
I want Man Five to come.

1738
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,970
(Woman 4 hoped for Man 5 to come.)

1739
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,870
At first, he seemed like too much,

1740
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,890
but as we played games together
on the same team,

1741
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:49,850
he took good care of me.

1742
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:52,220
(She didn't even mention Man 3.
She's lying with an innocent face.)

1743
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,560
- Sorry?
- What did you say to that?

1744
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,620
- You said you wanted me to come?
- Yes.

1745
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,850
So I said I want Man Three
to come to me.

1746
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,660
You had me in mind
from the beginning?

1747
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,430
(Coming up with an excuse
as Man Three is taking it seriously)

1748
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,800
- When we were playing the quiz.
- Really?

1749
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,660
Oh, when we played the quiz earlier?

1750
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,700
Yes, I liked how humorous you are.

1751
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,830
You seemed very pure.

1752
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,030
(He's smiling widely
after hearing her compliment.)

1753
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,280
- I thought you were very pure.
- My gosh.

1754
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,050
I'm watching your drama,
"Sisyphus," these days.

1755
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,600
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1756
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,240
- I really like it.
- Thank you.

1757
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,310
- Sure.
- Yes.

1758
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,550
(He can't hide his excitement.)

1759
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,140
(Has Man 3
finally found his other half?)

1760
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,560
- See you later.
- Okay.

1761
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,810
I can see them on my way.

1762
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:25,990
I can see them.

1763
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,720
Let me be honest with you, Man Five.

1764
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:29,990
Yes. What is it?

1765
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,350
I have something to tell you.

1766
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,100
- I have kids too.
- Is that so?

1767
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,240
I knew we had something in common.

1768
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,240
(The father who lived abroad
plucked up his courage to confess.)

1769
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,640
So the two of us have kids.

1770
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,870
- I knew you had kids.
- I felt really uncomfortable.

1771
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,740
I felt bad for my family.

1772
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,350
- I have 3 kids.
- 3?

1773
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:47,870
- I feel...
- You can't say you don't have kids.

1774
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:48,950
I feel so much better now.

1775
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:50,240
- You feel better, right?
- Yes.

1776
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,310
I know. We can't lie.

1777
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,220
It looks like you're having fun.

1778
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,010
(Man 4 is patrolling the village
and checking on the others.)

1779
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,260
Hang on.

1780
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:00,950
What are you doing here?

1781
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,430
I think no one will come to me.

1782
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,560
Why... Why are you here?

1783
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,620
(Woman 3 came to meet Man 4
with his name tag on her forehead.)

1784
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,740
(Woman 3 who kept
getting rejected...)

1785
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,200
- Woman 3 kept getting rejected,
- Seriously, I feel like...

1786
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,430
so she decided to go after Man 4

1787
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:17,830
who loves hearing compliments.

1788
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,010
It's Man Four's turn, right?

1789
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:22,740
Are you going to come this way
like a man?

1790
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,120
But where are you supposed to be?

1791
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,280
Over here.

1792
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,050
I was going to go to you.

1793
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,890
- Really?
- Why did you come all the way out?

1794
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,490
- I was going to go to you. Sure.
- Really?

1795
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,780
Of course.

1796
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:36,530
With their effort to win affection
and some kind of deal,

1797
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:39,600
Woman 2 and 3 got partners
to eat with.

1798
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,600
I mean...

1799
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,160
You two look very awkward.

1800
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:45,910
First, if you...

1801
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,370
- If you come,
- I will...

1802
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:49,410
(The woman that Man 6 picks
takes 1st place and earns 2 points.)

1803
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:51,810
I'll give a point
to Cho Hee for sure.

1804
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:53,870
(The man Cho Hee picks
earns 2 points as well.)

1805
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,220
You're trying to make me sit here.

1806
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:58,580
I guess you're thinking
I'm an easy match to beat.

1807
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,640
Not at all.

1808
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,780
- What did you say?
- That's not true at all.

1809
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:04,720
So Min seems to be
in good condition today.

1810
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,890
But you've seen her a lot.

1811
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,450
You're used to her ways.

1812
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,350
That was nice. I like how you just
dropped the honorifics.

1813
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,280
I really like it
when women do that too.

1814
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,450
- Honestly, Haha can...
- Okay!

1815
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,450
- Great!
- Okay.

1816
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,490
Okay! Bring it on!

1817
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,290
Yes!

1818
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:52,950
(Woman 5 won 2 points. Which man
will win 2 points with her?)

1819
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,220
- You're in first place.
- Yes, I am!

1820
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,560
- That's true.
- Yes!

1821
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,850
(Man 2 and Man 6 are with Woman 5.)

1822
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,060
The female members need to pick
the male members...

1823
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,870
they'll give points to
before they finish their meal.

1824
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,760
- You made the right choice.
- Thank you.

1825
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,240
Excuse me for asking,
but how old are you?

1826
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,410
- Me? I'm 32.
- Yes.

1827
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,140
Oh, really? I see.

1828
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:14,810
I look older than that, don't I?

1829
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,600
- No, no!
- Really?

1830
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,850
I'm 36.

1831
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:20,470
(Man 3 reacted awkwardly
after hearing her age.)

1832
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:21,740
- You look younger than your age.
- Man Three.

1833
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,080
- Sorry?
- Did you bring your apron?

1834
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,140
What do you mean?

1835
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,450
You usually spill food all the time
when you eat, so...

1836
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,450
Excuse me, this is not the place
to say such things.

1837
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:31,620
But don't you usually wear aprons
when you eat?

1838
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:34,200
You should scram.
What on earth are you talking about?

1839
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:36,200
We're having a nice talk,

1840
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,470
- and you ruined...
- You usually spill food a lot.

1841
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:38,470
- What do you mean?
- That's why you put on an apron.

1842
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,040
I'll take small bites today.

1843
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,510
What do you mean by an apron?

1844
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,200
I just wanted to make sure
you had it.

1845
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,540
(He became way more careful
in case he spills food.)

1846
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,600
It's good.

1847
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,600
(He became way more careful
in case he spills food.)

1848
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,450
I love eating.

1849
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:53,540
Really? But you're so skinny.

1850
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,740
I love working out, that's why.

1851
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,040
Do you work out a lot?

1852
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,580
I'm doing a modern dance
called Tanzplay.

1853
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,760
You're doing a modern dance?

1854
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,680
Yes, I do it for fun,
but I'm quite good at it too.

1855
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,260
- Oh, really?
- But I didn't major in it.

1856
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,830
I do horseback riding too.

1857
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,950
You do horseback riding?

1858
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:08,990
(You do horseback riding?)

1859
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:09,990
Where?

1860
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:13,430
The riding ground I go to
is in Uijeongbu.

1861
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,660
Oh, Uijeongbu? Really?

1862
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,760
(He finally hears a word
he's familiar with.)

1863
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,910
I live in Dongducheon.

1864
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,330
I'm from Uijeongbu.

1865
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,640
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1866
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,970
(Man 3 finally gets to
smile broadly.)

1867
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:25,910
- Oh, this regionalism...
- I finally found...

1868
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:27,370
something we have in common.

1869
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:28,790
- You're from Uijeongbu?
- Yes.

1870
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:30,080
I went to elementary, middle,
and high school there.

1871
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,080
Oh, really? I went to school
in Dongducheon.

1872
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,450
- We lived so close by.
- I know.

1873
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:36,620
- It was only 15 minutes away.
- No wonder.

1874
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,950
(They didn't live in the same area,
but Se Chan insists that they did.)

1875
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,560
Do you still live in Uijeongbu?

1876
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,290
No, I live near Cheongdam-dong now.

1877
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,260
- Oh, Cheongdam-dong? I see.
- Yes.

1878
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,470
(Cheongdam-dong? I see.)

1879
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:48,470
(Bursting into laughter)

1880
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,060
That's funny.

1881
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:52,140
I don't think we make a good couple.

1882
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,870
Her life is very different
from mine.

1883
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,140
I think this is as far as I can get
for today.

1884
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,120
I should've said, "I think
jodhpurs will look good on you."

1885
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,010
"Horseback riding sounds like fun."

1886
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,910
But I reacted so poorly.

1887
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:09,560
I don't think she'll write my name.

1888
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:11,030
I'm done for.

1889
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,760
The private lunch with her
was messed up.

1890
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:15,200
(Shaking his head)

1891
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:16,660
(Meanwhile, the three of them
are having lunch together.)

1892
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,120
What are your hobbies, Cho Hee?

1893
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,240
(What are your hobbies, Cho Hee?)

1894
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,890
- Me?
- Shall we take a guess?

1895
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,240
(What are Woman 5's hobbies?)

1896
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:24,870
You're the active type, aren't you?

1897
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,310
Me? Not at all.

1898
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,810
No, she's a homebody.

1899
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:28,950
(No, she's a homebody.)

1900
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:31,540
Don't people call you sly?

1901
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,850
What?

1902
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,540
He doesn't know how to
read the room.

1903
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,140
- They don't call me that.
- You're like a snake.

1904
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,180
Me too.

1905
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,350
- You're a homebody too?
- Totally.

1906
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,120
Look how my arms have no muscles.

1907
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,450
Actually, this is my first outing...

1908
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:44,450
in eight years.

1909
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,990
That's how much I love
staying at home.

1910
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,100
I'm serious.

1911
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:49,390
Oh, really? I can't believe it.

1912
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:52,030
I hear your house is
actually a famous club.

1913
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,490
- What are you talking about?
- Isn't that true?

1914
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:55,040
Why would my house be a club?

1915
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,660
I think I've seen you there.

1916
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,060
Why would my house be a club?

1917
01:02:58,310 --> 01:02:59,910
I think you have a nice personality.

1918
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:00,970
(I think you have
a nice personality.)

1919
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:02,140
That was so random.

1920
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:04,240
I mean it. When I'm with you...

1921
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,410
How shall I put it?
I feel comfortable.

1922
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:08,850
You can talk comfortably with me.

1923
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:11,620
Sure. I just feel like
sharing all my secrets with you.

1924
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,760
(Man 6 starts making a move
by talking nonsense.)

1925
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,410
I think you're the type
who'll understand everything.

1926
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,760
I feel like I'll cry if you just
listen to my stories.

1927
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,490
Right. Having someone listen
to your story...

1928
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,760
- could be really consoling.
- Right. I really mean it.

1929
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:24,390
I'm talking
as if there are no cameras here.

1930
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,660
I mean it. I feel like you'll
listen to my stories really well.

1931
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,930
Wow, I can't believe
he's going this far.

1932
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,260
(Wow, I can't believe
he's going this far.)

1933
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,260
This is driving me crazy.

1934
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,040
I mean it. I'm serious.

1935
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,740
- All this for the points?
- You're serious?

1936
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,680
I don't know.
I'm not used to life in Korea.

1937
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,720
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1938
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:42,010
But...

1939
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,490
By the way, is it okay
if our voices overlap like this?

1940
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:46,620
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1941
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,810
(Woman 5 and Man 2 are busy
playing a game to put on a show.)

1942
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,830
You just moved! You moved!

1943
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,350
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did!

1944
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,260
- And then...
- You're it.

1945
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,560
- I feel like I made a new friend.
- I didn't move!

1946
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,470
It was lonely living in Korea,

1947
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:02,060
but I made a new friend.
I was really grateful for it.

1948
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,410
I wanted to share
my secrets with her...

1949
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:06,310
- What are you doing?
- and share my stories.

1950
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,580
What are you doing?

1951
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,310
That's who Woman Five is.

1952
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,080
I also want to tell her...

1953
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,810
that I have kids.

1954
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:18,390
I think she'll forgive me.

1955
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:22,260
By the way, before you set off,

1956
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,950
you said you grew sick of her
after playing a game with her.

1957
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:26,060
- I said that?
- Yes.

1958
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:27,700
Do you believe such slander?

1959
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,990
- No, that's... Wait.
- Are you that kind of person?

1960
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,120
You can ask her.

1961
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,560
It'd be brazen of me
to be sitting here.

1962
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,660
Man Six's eyes seem sincere.

1963
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,470
- Right?
- But...

1964
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:39,540
Are you saying my eyes are...

1965
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:41,010
Your eyes are a little...

1966
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,540
Everyone is talking about it.

1967
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,200
You're the one who called me sly,
aren't you?

1968
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,540
(You're the one who called me sly,
aren't you?)

1969
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,080
Wait a minute. Hey. I got you.

1970
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,990
I heard that too.

1971
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,180
I heard someone called me sly.
And it was you.

1972
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,720
It's okay. I'll protect you.

1973
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,100
If I pick someone else
besides you...

1974
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,200
Everyone is done having their lunch.

1975
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,530
Now it's time for the female members
to vote.

1976
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,370
Give the points to me if you can.

1977
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:08,390
It's over. I'm done today.

1978
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,470
- There's nothing much to do today.
- This will end it.

1979
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,580
I mean, earlier...

1980
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,100
I wasn't accustomed
to life in Korea,

1981
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,040
but you became a good friend.
Thank you.

1982
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,220
I don't want to pressure you
with such talks.

1983
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,240
I don't know much about Korea,

1984
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,720
but I made a new friend.

1985
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,720
(I don't know much about Korea,
but I made a new friend.)

1986
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,760
And that's Cho Hee.

1987
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,950
(And that's Cho Hee.)

1988
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:31,120
I just want you to know how I feel.

1989
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,290
I don't want to pressure you.

1990
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,790
Choose whoever you want.

1991
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,060
I'm being sincere.

1992
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,100
You need to know who's being fake
and who's being sincere.

1993
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,200
I've made up my mind.

1994
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,660
The female members...

1995
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,930
each gave their points
to only one male member.

1996
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:48,200
- Who did the female members pick?
- What's this?

1997
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,850
What could this be?

1998
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:52,540
I hear that...

1999
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:55,120
- Yes?
- Jong Kook...

2000
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,450
is still chatting with In Ah.

2001
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,260
- Oh, really?
- Even now?

2002
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,350
That's strange.

2003
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,560
- They're having a date.
- I know, right?

2004
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,950
Do you work out every day?

2005
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,930
I do. I don't take breaks.
Not even for a day.

2006
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,450
- Why wouldn't you?
- That was his strategy?

2007
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:09,200
- They're here.
- Why did you plan a strategy?

2008
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,160
- What do you mean?
- Jong Kook,

2009
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,990
everyone is talking about you here.

2010
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:14,870
- What?
- What happened?

2011
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,560
- I hear you two had a date.
- That's not true.

2012
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,010
- You had a date?
- Why would you take so long?

2013
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:20,370
- We talked about working out.
- You seem much happier now.

2014
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:21,470
Not at all.

2015
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:23,450
You look much happier
than before the meal.

2016
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:24,970
- No, no.
- He seems brighter.

2017
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:26,350
- Did something happen?
- That's not it.

2018
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,180
- You guys must've clicked.
- That's not it.

2019
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:30,010
We talked about working out.

2020
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:32,040
Because it was fun,

2021
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:35,620
- They have something in common.
- so that relieved my stress.

2022
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:38,560
Actually, there's someone...

2023
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,830
who went to see a partner
for his life.

2024
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,990
- What do you mean?
- Who?

2025
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,030
- Se Chan.
- Man Three.

2026
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,160
Oh, Se Chan?

2027
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,160
That's not true.

2028
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,040
- Man One.
- What are you? Man Three.

2029
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,010
- Man 3 kept talking about...
- Man 1.

2030
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,080
- You don't have to bring it up.
- How did it go?

2031
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,910
- It's over.
- Why?

2032
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,850
- It failed.
- You two don't get along?

2033
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,350
- Not at all.
- They're not compatible.

2034
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:00,640
I've never met anyone who does
horseback riding as a hobby.

2035
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,010
So I couldn't go on.

2036
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,410
- Is it really your hobby?
- Yes.

2037
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:06,220
We have nothing in common.

2038
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:07,720
- So it's over.
- Horseback riding?

2039
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,330
- It's over.
- Does she enjoy horseback riding?

2040
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:10,350
She enjoys horseback riding.

2041
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,490
We tried to find something
we have in common,

2042
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,100
- but there were none.
- So...

2043
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,120
I gave up.

2044
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,530
- You enjoy horseback riding.
- Yes.

2045
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,600
- Is it your hobby?
- Yes.

2046
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,540
In Ah, why did you have such
a long conversation with Jong Kook?

2047
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,700
- How did you know?
- I guess there was a connection.

2048
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:27,100
- Is it true?
- Look behind her cap.

2049
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,910
- Look behind her cap.
- His tag is attached to her cap.

2050
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:30,370
His tag is attached to her cap.

2051
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,450
(It's the name tag of the man
she had a date with.)

2052
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:34,850
That's too much.

2053
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:36,720
I forgot about it.

2054
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,010
(The name tag discourages
other male members.)

2055
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,350
Hold on.

2056
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:40,850
- In the beginning...
- We will go home.

2057
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,430
- This is ridiculous.
- She is out of her mind.

2058
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:44,330
Gosh. It happened in the beginning.

2059
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,660
It happened in the beginning.

2060
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:48,100
What are we supposed to do
if she makes her choice so obvious?

2061
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,100
In Ah, you are too much.

2062
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,620
What is up with the two of you?

2063
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,890
(She takes out Man 3's name tag
she had in her pocket.)

2064
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:56,910
It's a diversion tactic.

2065
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:58,660
It's a diversion tactic.

2066
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,370
- I feel bad for Man Three.
- Seriously.

2067
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:02,450
- Man Three is being used.
- Is it me again?

2068
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:04,180
I am being used.

2069
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,540
So Min, were you meeting up...

2070
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,450
- with your uncle? Who was it?
- Yes.

2071
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,350
I had lunch with my father.

2072
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:11,540
- So Min.
- Yes?

2073
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:12,790
Everyone was impressed...

2074
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,180
by your filial piety.

2075
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,950
You are such a filial woman.

2076
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:18,620
The word has spread.

2077
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,120
To be honest,

2078
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,120
she called me with desperation.

2079
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,720
You know that I am soft-hearted.

2080
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:26,540
Don't lie. It was for points.

2081
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,790
- Be quiet.
- It was for points.

2082
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:30,470
Did she give him points?

2083
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:32,060
- I will announce the points.
- Okay.

2084
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,430
Among women,

2085
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,470
only Cho Hee received two points.

2086
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,510
The rest received one point each.

2087
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,910
(The rest received 1 point each.)

2088
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:41,540
The men's points...

2089
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,410
will be revealed after the mission.

2090
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:48,660
It's a game that tests your tenacity
for a partner,

2091
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:51,160
Roll Around in Rhythm.

2092
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,700
(Roll Around in Rhythm)

2093
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:53,960
- Roll around?
- What is this game?

2094
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:56,720
It will be a 1-on-1 match
between the members of the same sex.

2095
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:58,170
Two members...

2096
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:00,300
will lie down
at the end of the blanket and start.

2097
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:02,760
They will wrap themselves up
and roll around.

2098
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,040
- While hugging each other?
- As you can see,

2099
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,780
there are yellow sirens...

2100
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,170
- and blue sirens.
- That's right.

2101
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,600
You will pick a color in advance.

2102
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:14,140
The longer your siren goes off,
the more points you will win.

2103
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:18,010
If the section has your siren,
you have to try staying there.

2104
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,380
(If you make your siren
go off longer, you win.)

2105
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,620
If the section has
the opponent's siren,

2106
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,090
- you have to try moving along.
- Isn't the result too obvious?

2107
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,460
- Okay, okay.
- Isn't the result too obvious?

2108
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,660
You know,

2109
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:27,920
if we play this game
against Jong Kook,

2110
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,960
- we won't win any points.
- This is insane.

2111
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,960
This is ridiculous.

2112
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,630
The last sirens...

2113
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,870
are worth twice the time.

2114
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,000
(The last sirens
are worth twice the time.)

2115
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,500
Each round will go on
for two minutes.

2116
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,500
The women will have a draw.

2117
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,840
As for the men, we came up
with the list of matches.

2118
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:43,340
- Good job.
- Did you come up with it?

2119
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,170
A match against Kwang Soo
is bound to turn dirty.

2120
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:46,710
It's unbelievable
from the first round.

2121
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,380
(Roud 1, Man 5 versus Man 6)

2122
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,010
This is embarrassing.

2123
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:52,710
Seriously.

2124
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:53,850
Even though he is a man...

2125
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,030
Isn't it strange
to find it embarrassing?

2126
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:57,630
This is embarrassing.

2127
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:58,680
Come on!

2128
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,030
- Come on!
- What?

2129
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,460
Why is he overreacting?

2130
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,060
- He is overreacting.
- It's just a game.

2131
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,420
Hey.

2132
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,040
All right.

2133
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,410
- Suk Jin, your color is yellow.
- Okay.

2134
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,600
Let's begin.

2135
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,760
- Get ready.
- Okay.

2136
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,040
- Get ready.
- If you start from the top...

2137
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,710
(Suk Jin needs to make
the yellow sirens go off...)

2138
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:19,670
(and Haha needs to make
the blue sirens go off.)

2139
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:20,750
Set, go.

2140
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:22,310
You need to try staying there.

2141
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,010
- Hold on.
- You need to roll over first.

2142
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:25,180
- First...
- Yellow is Suk Jin's color.

2143
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,460
- Suk Jin should stay there.
- He should stay there.

2144
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:30,550
What's my color?

2145
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:31,750
Yellow is Suk Jin's color.

2146
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:34,250
(I see a blue siren!)

2147
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,630
(Haha attempts
to make his siren go off.)

2148
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:39,700
Stay there.

2149
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,260
(Suk Jin 1, Haha 0)

2150
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,740
(He pressed it!)

2151
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,340
Suk Jin, you need to go past
that section.

2152
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:46,880
- You need to go past it.
- Hurry up.

2153
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,410
- It's game over.
- Hurry up.

2154
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:52,250
Suk Jin's head
went inside the blanket.

2155
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:53,670
It's game over.

2156
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:54,920
Hurry up.

2157
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,090
Suk Jin, try to stay
in the next section.

2158
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:59,180
Hey!

2159
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,420
(Haha earns over 10 points.)

2160
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,550
Suk Jin, you need to roll over.

2161
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,090
You need to roll over.

2162
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:06,750
(Everyone roots for Old Man 5.)

2163
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,250
(Their messages reach him.)

2164
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,500
Time passes fast.

2165
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,630
(Old Man 5 begins to use
his energy.)

2166
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,830
They stayed in that section
for a long time.

2167
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,040
Hold on.

2168
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,430
They stayed in that section
for too long.

2169
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:18,930
(It's hard for him
to move past the blue siren.)

2170
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:20,300
(Shouting)

2171
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,280
- Stop.
- Suk Jin is getting up.

2172
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,210
Wake up, Suk Jin!

2173
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:25,780
Suk Jin!

2174
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:28,510
(After drawing ragged breaths,
the old man stops moving.)

2175
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:29,640
Wake up, Suk Jin!

2176
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,380
Suk Jin!

2177
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:32,710
- Suk Jin!
- Wake up!

2178
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:34,710
- Breathe!
- Wake up!

2179
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:37,290
Don't fall asleep!

2180
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:38,990
Bring a stretcher!

2181
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,030
Please save Suk Jin!

2182
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,670
Ambulance!

2183
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,800
Open your eyes!
Suk Jin, open your eyes!

2184
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,060
Please save Suk Jin!

2185
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,170
This match is over.

2186
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,300
(The production crew
hurriedly ends the match!)

2187
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,410
- You never know.
- He fought well.

2188
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,710
- All right.
- He fought well.

2189
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:52,840
Suk Jin still has it.

2190
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,040
Suk Jin.

2191
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:55,670
- All right.
- Suk Jin still has it.

2192
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,750
Here is the result of the match.

2193
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,920
- Haha won.
- Okay.

2194
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:01,140
Still...

2195
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:02,420
It was too bad...

2196
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,090
that I couldn't move my hands
in the blanket.

2197
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:05,750
Kwang Soo's color is yellow...

2198
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,010
and Jae Suk's color is blue.

2199
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:08,710
All right. Set, go.

2200
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:11,160
(The match begins.)

2201
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:13,390
- Hold on.
- Kwang Soo's color is yellow.

2202
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,890
(He attacks Kwang Soo's temple
with his front teeth.)

2203
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,630
(He plays dirty right away
and makes the yellow siren go off.)

2204
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:19,890
(By the way,)

2205
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:20,930
(yellow is Kwang Soo's color.)

2206
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:23,260
That's Kwang Soo's.
That's Kwang Soo's.

2207
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,370
Is that Kwang Soo's?

2208
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,210
Is that Kwang Soo's?

2209
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,100
(Kwang Soo gets over 10 points.)

2210
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,500
That's Kwang Soo's.

2211
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,500
(Jae Suk was so nervous
that he forgot his color.)

2212
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,010
Jae Suk, roll over.

2213
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:35,280
(He realizes it belatedly,
but he is caught.)

2214
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,420
Kwang Soo.

2215
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,010
Don't kiss!

2216
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,750
Kwang Soo's eyes went crazy.

2217
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,880
Kwang Soo's eyes went crazy.

2218
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:43,750
Those are Kwang Soo's eyes.

2219
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,160
Kwang Soo's eyes.

2220
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,530
The variety show eyes.

2221
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:48,530
- The variety show eyes.
- Hey.

2222
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:50,000
Hey.

2223
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:53,960
(Those eyes come out
when Kwang Soo loves the mission!)

2224
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,930
He looks scary.

2225
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,540
(At that moment)

2226
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:02,580
(My goodness.)

2227
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,250
(He makes the siren go off
with his head.)

2228
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:06,120
Jae Suk can't beat that.

2229
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,420
Your tactic isn't working.

2230
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:12,550
(Jae Suk continues to attack
with his protruding front teeth!)

2231
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:15,850
(They thought
the match would end that way.)

2232
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:20,030
(In that case)

2233
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,030
(He loses his charms.)

2234
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:24,920
How are the next players
supposed to use it?

2235
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:26,390
The match is over.

2236
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,560
My goodness.

2237
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,170
That was unbelievable.

2238
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,430
I don't want to play this game.

2239
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,930
- That was hilarious.
- I am dying.

2240
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:35,080
(It will be hard for Man 2
to get chosen by women.)

2241
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,380
My goodness.

2242
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:37,950
(They are in tatters
when Round 2 ends.)

2243
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:40,120
Se Chan, just lie down comfortably.

2244
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:41,470
Se Chan, are you okay?

2245
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:42,550
Already...

2246
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,840
Jong Kook's color is yellow
and Se Chan's color is blue.

2247
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,310
You never know
what will happen, Se Chan.

2248
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:47,710
Set, go.

2249
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,550
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2250
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,830
Let's go.

2251
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,530
- They are rolling over slowly.
- Make it go off.

2252
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:53,960
- This is...
- They are rolling over slowly.

2253
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,500
- Whose siren is it?
- Jong Kook's color is yellow.

2254
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,630
- Yellow.
- That's Jong Kook's siren.

2255
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:57,720
That's his siren.

2256
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:02,130
Isn't it game over?

2257
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:03,300
Hold on.

2258
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:04,630
(What?)

2259
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:05,840
He can't move.

2260
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,170
Jong Kook, go to the siren
that is worth twice the time.

2261
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:08,670
Isn't it game over?

2262
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:11,250
- I can't move.
- Come on.

2263
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,710
Try to roll over.

2264
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,050
1, 2, 3.

2265
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,590
(No matter how hard he tries,
Jong Kook is like a boulder.)

2266
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:17,950
1, 2, 3.

2267
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,990
(The invincible latissimus dorsi)

2268
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:22,460
My goodness.

2269
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,330
Just stay on your back!

2270
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:25,660
(Just stay on your back!)

2271
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:27,960
That's nice of him.

2272
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,760
(His pink gums continue to dry up.)

2273
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,130
1, 2, 3.

2274
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,460
Just end the match.

2275
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:33,540
The match is over.

2276
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:36,870
- Okay.
- That was too pitiful to watch.

2277
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
As for women,

2278
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,410
you will have a draw.

2279
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,800
If you pick number five,

2280
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,470
you can pick a member
from number 1 through 4.

2281
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,580
Cho Hee, pick a member.

2282
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,170
I will pick at the end.

2283
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:51,750
It does feel strange.

2284
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,160
You would think...

2285
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:55,380
that they would play quietly,
but that simply isn't true.

2286
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:56,630
Let's begin.

2287
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:57,660
They have the fighting spirit.

2288
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,180
- They have the fighting spirit.
- You got a glimpse of it earlier.

2289
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,850
In Ah's color is yellow.

2290
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:03,030
- Really?
- In Ah's color is yellow.

2291
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,630
Get ready.

2292
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:05,800
Set, go.

2293
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,460
In Ah's color is yellow.

2294
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:08,800
(In Ah's color is yellow.)

2295
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,600
She is holding out.

2296
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,840
(In Ah grits her teeth
and stays in the section.)

2297
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,210
That's good.

2298
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:18,380
(He In rolls over.)

2299
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,550
She is holding out.

2300
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,880
(In Ah can't beat
the horseback riding enthusiast.)

2301
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,750
- She is good.
- In Ah can't roll over.

2302
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:28,420
In Ah, spread your legs a bit
before you roll over.

2303
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,550
- Okay.
- My goodness.

2304
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:33,460
When Cho Hee picks a member later...

2305
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,460
- I won't pick either one of them.
- Seriously.

2306
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,060
- I won't pick either one of them.
- Don't do that.

2307
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,370
Ten seconds.

2308
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,460
(Woman 3 and Woman 4 are serious
about Variety Village.)

2309
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,840
The match is over.

2310
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,670
I have no idea who won.

2311
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,740
- It was neck-and-neck.
- You need to roll back.

2312
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:47,840
Are you okay?

2313
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,470
He In got 33 seconds.

2314
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,550
In Ah got 64 seconds.

2315
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,670
She is good.

2316
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,450
(In Ah wins and receives 3 points.)

2317
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,450
Ji Hyo versus So Min?

2318
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:59,180
- So Min is like a paper doll.
- A paper doll.

2319
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:00,920
So Min will need...

2320
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,590
to play another game.

2321
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,380
- I am sorry.
- She is most likely to get chosen.

2322
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,220
- I am sorry.
- Seriously.

2323
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,550
I know that So Min is a paper doll.

2324
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,670
I need to preserve my energy...

2325
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,390
since I have two games to play.

2326
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,460
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo)

2327
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:18,560
Ji Hyo is relaxed.

2328
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,880
I will lie down here.

2329
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:21,500
Do you know what she said?
She is sleepy.

2330
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:24,080
She is sleepy.

2331
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:25,300
Ji Hyo is relaxed.

2332
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:27,580
(Hugging)

2333
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,140
Hey, why are you hugging me
so tightly?

2334
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:31,510
Hey!

2335
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,120
Ji Hyo hates being tickled.

2336
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,350
So Min's color is yellow...

2337
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:37,990
and Ji Hyo's color is blue.

2338
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:39,750
Let's begin.

2339
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:41,700
Roll over.

2340
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,800
So Min.

2341
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,420
Stop it.

2342
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:45,760
So Min's color is yellow.

2343
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,000
- Hey.
- So Min.

2344
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,540
(So Min is holding out.)

2345
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,760
She is holding out.

2346
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,300
What?

2347
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,800
Ji Hyo, you need to reach
the blue siren.

2348
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:55,840
(Kissing)

2349
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:58,280
She keeps kissing me!

2350
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,810
Of course,

2351
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:02,210
So Min plays dirty.

2352
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:04,840
So Min plays dirty.

2353
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:06,880
(Kissing)

2354
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:09,750
(It's a big mess.)

2355
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:10,790
Hey!

2356
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:14,330
(Ji Hyo falters
because of So Min's kissing attack.)

2357
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:15,630
Will she win with that tactic?

2358
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,670
(The habitual kisser
rules the game.)

2359
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:22,500
(But Ji Hyo is known to be
a delinquent.)

2360
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,760
(She rolls over.)

2361
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,210
- It's done.
- It's done.

2362
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:27,340
- It's over.
- It's over.

2363
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,670
- Look at me.
- It's over.

2364
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:31,550
(You aren't the only one
who can kiss, okay?)

2365
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:35,050
So Min, I need to play another game.

2366
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,050
(The habitual kisser used up
her strength.)

2367
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:37,450
It's over.

2368
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:38,680
The match is over.

2369
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,880
(Ji Hyo won.)

2370
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:44,130
I wonder if So Min will play dirty
this time as well.

2371
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:45,790
Will I need to kiss Cho Hee as well?

2372
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:48,220
(She feels awkward about
kissing someone she just met.)

2373
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:49,870
- We just met.
- Go ahead.

2374
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,000
- This is a variety show.
- I am embarrassed...

2375
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,260
about hugging her.

2376
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,960
Should I lie down like this?

2377
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,800
How should we do this?

2378
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,370
(What is So Min doing?)

2379
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:00,000
This is a bit awkward.

2380
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,780
- I don't know what to do.
- So Min.

2381
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:02,780
Hey.

2382
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:04,840
- This is a variety show.
- Do it for a partner.

2383
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:05,950
We aren't that close yet.

2384
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:08,640
Get ready. Set, go.

2385
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:09,840
(The first yellow siren
belongs to So Min.)

2386
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,840
Heave-ho.

2387
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:15,880
So Min.

2388
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:17,880
What is this?

2389
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,300
- Where are you? Where are you?
- She preserved her energy.

2390
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,850
Stay still.

2391
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,500
- Stay still.
- She looks really strong right now.

2392
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:25,920
What?

2393
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,870
- So Min.
- What is going on?

2394
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:28,870
(So Min is like Jong Kook
against Cho Hee.)

2395
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,960
So Min is like Jong Kook.

2396
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,880
(The weakest member on the show
is pretending to be strong.)

2397
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,210
- No!
- Stay still!

2398
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,410
(It's payback time.)

2399
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:37,640
Stay still.

2400
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,450
- You did it.
- This is incredible.

2401
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,170
That's funny.

2402
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:43,380
(Kissing)

2403
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:46,310
(Cho Hee suddenly attacks
with kisses.)

2404
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,680
(Cho Hee benchmarked
So Min's tactic.)

2405
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:48,790
No!

2406
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,720
(Thrashing)

2407
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:53,200
I knew that would happen.

2408
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:54,350
(Kissing)

2409
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,590
(The match is embarrassing
to watch.)

2410
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:00,430
(Cho Hee holds So Min down.)

2411
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,560
- Cho Hee.
- She is incredible.

2412
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,630
(Woman 5's wits move
the male members.)

2413
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:06,000
Cho Hee is dominating.

2414
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,600
She is pressing hard.

2415
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,670
(So Min kicks in happiness.)

2416
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:09,710
The match is over.

2417
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,710
(Cho Hee had
an overwhelming victory.)

2418
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:13,880
Okay.

2419
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,080
They became physically affectionate
on the day they met.

2420
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:20,420
Before the last decision,

2421
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,420
you will choose the dessert.

2422
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,160
- The dessert.
- The dessert.

2423
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,090
I will first reveal the points
the male members received...

2424
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:28,630
from the female members.

2425
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:31,590
- Man One, Yoo Jae Suk has...
- Okay.

2426
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:35,040
(Man 1 had lunch with Woman 1.)

2427
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,630
(Man 1)

2428
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,780
(Ji Hyo picked Jae Suk!)

2429
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,780
(That means he has 1 point
at the very least.)

2430
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,170
I should have one point.

2431
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,880
A total of two points.

2432
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,970
Really?

2433
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:49,010
(2 points)

2434
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:50,710
- Really?
- What?

2435
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:52,450
- 2 points?
- 2 points?

2436
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:54,790
(At least one woman didn't give
a point to the man who visited her.)

2437
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,090
- Did Cho Hee give him a point?
- Who did it?

2438
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:57,550
Maybe they are from two women
other than Ji Hyo.

2439
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:58,850
Who gave me a point?

2440
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,300
- Why?
- I gave you a point.

2441
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,890
Why give a point
to someone who didn't visit?

2442
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,890
What charms does Man One have?

2443
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:05,390
Why did someone give me a point?

2444
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:08,130
The next one is Man Two, Kwang Soo.

2445
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,170
- Okay.
- Kwang Soo has...

2446
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,430
(As for Man 2,)

2447
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:16,710
(he went to Cho Hee first
and showed off his charms.)

2448
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:17,950
Kwang Soo has...

2449
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,280
zero points.

2450
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,340
(But he got 0 points.)

2451
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:24,710
(Cho Hee doesn't like
sly-looking eyes.)

2452
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:27,250
- How could you do that?
- She deserted him.

2453
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:28,680
(The squid explodes!)

2454
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,050
- Hey.
- Okay.

2455
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:32,250
- Why did you go to her?
- I got it now.

2456
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:34,530
Now, Jong Kook has...

2457
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,090
One point.

2458
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:38,460
A total of one point.

2459
01:20:38,530 --> 01:20:39,630
Of course.

2460
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:41,670
- It's from In Ah.
- Is it from In Ah?

2461
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,840
(The trainer's 1 point came from...)

2462
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,580
(In Ah, as everyone expected.)

2463
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,300
(Thankful for In Ah's choice,)

2464
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,670
(he shows his snakelike eyes.)

2465
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:54,050
They are exchanging looks.

2466
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,510
- Now,
- I didn't expect that.

2467
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:59,550
the remaining ones are
Se Chan, Suk Jin, and Haha.

2468
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:00,990
- What is it?
- Do we have the same score?

2469
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,010
- They got grouped together.
- Why?

2470
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:03,160
Between the three of you,

2471
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,850
2 got 0 points and 1 got 3 points.

2472
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,290
- What?
- Three points?

2473
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:07,530
- 3 points?
- Did someone get 3 points?

2474
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,960
(3 points from the women
went to 1 man.)

2475
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,630
- 3 points?
- Did someone get 3 points?

2476
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:13,670
Three points?

2477
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,590
Should I get excited about this?

2478
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:17,060
Of course.

2479
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,430
The charming man of Variety Village
who stole three women's hearts.

2480
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:24,500
Among Se Chan, Suk Jin, and Haha,
the one who got three points is...

2481
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,450
- Is it Haha?
- The one who got three points is...

2482
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:27,710
(The surprising winner
will be revealed next week.)

2483
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:31,450
(The women choose the person
they will have dessert with.)

2484
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,420
(The men have to wait...)

2485
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:36,250
(and the women have to choose.)

2486
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:41,050
(The competition for survival turns
even more desperate.)

2487
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:45,960
(As they change their minds,
emotions surge.)

2488
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,890
(The Final Poll comes.)

2489
01:21:47,890 --> 01:21:49,000
I believe in you.

2490
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,710
(What kind of twist
will the Final Poll reveal?)

2491
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,750
(With the romance of the past,)

2492
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,210
(8 free-spirited university students
with unique charms are coming!)

2493
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:06,450
(The Entering Class of 1991
Is Back!)
