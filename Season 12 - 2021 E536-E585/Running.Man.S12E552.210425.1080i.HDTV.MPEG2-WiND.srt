1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,980
Last week, in Variety Village...

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,370
(11 entertainers came
to Variety Village last week.)

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm working in the IT industry.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,620
(Man 1 runs a video arcade.)

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,880
Man six.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,140
(Hi.)

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,630
(Man 6 made everyone have
convulsions from the beginning.)

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,560
(I like you.)

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,830
(The men were like
a pathetic rabble.)

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,170
(Women 1 and 2 bluffed
to get the men's attention.)

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,170
Why?

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,110
(In Ah is the owner
of a tanning ship.)

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,680
(She even hit
on the fitness trainer.)

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,610
(He In said she runs a flower shop
that she's always wanted.)

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,010
(Unusual for rookie entertainers,
they all are good at skits.)

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,460
(Cho Hee said she was a realtor
to look rich.)

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,550
(The guests of Variety Village go
more overboard than the members.)

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,330
(Only funny people can survive
in Variety Village.)

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,830
(Today's race
with the 11 entertainers)

20
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,660
At the end, you'll vote for the one
you want to pair up with.

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,160
The partners who chose each other
will not get any penalty.

22
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,100
Those who failed to pair up
with anyone...

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,240
will receive a penalty
regardless of the number of them.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,330
If you get more than one vote,

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,050
you will receive gold as a prize...

26
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,680
regardless of whether you paired up
with someone or not.

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,740
(If they get more than one vote,
they will receive gold as a prize.)

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:30,350
(The points they get after missions
will be helpful at the voting.)

29
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,900
(That's how the romantic war
in Variety Village began.)

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,820
To be honest,
I'm quite fond of Man Three.

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,100
(Before lunch, Se Chan was
the most popular one.)

32
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,460
(But Se Chan wants to know
more about Woman 4, He In.)

33
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,830
Could you guys help me
just this once?

34
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,800
(The other men promised
that they would support him.)

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Thanks.

36
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,550
(That's how he spent
some alone time with her.)

37
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,710
- I really like it.
- Thank you.

38
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,990
(He tries to continue
the conversation.)

39
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,760
(He In lives in Cheongdam-dong,
enjoys dancing, and rides horses.)

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,430
(I don't think we make
a good couple.)

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,260
(He gave up on her
only 10 minutes after the lunch.)

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,160
(And Woman 3 and Man 4 are
getting more intimate.)

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,460
(And a few men and women had
lunch together just for business.)

44
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,900
(Cho Hee was the only one
to be chosen by two men.)

45
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,080
(Now the women need to decide
whom they'll give their points to.)

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,980
(Cho Hee has
two votes in her hands.)

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,950
(And two men beg her for a vote.)

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,650
And that's Cho Hee.

49
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,250
(And the two men say
obvious lies to her.)

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,550
(What's her choice?)

51
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,870
(The result is announced.)

52
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,870
(The women got...)

53
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,240
(as many points
as the number of their partners.)

54
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,370
(Jae Suk got 2 points.)

55
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,370
Now, Jong Kook has...

56
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,710
(Jong Kook got 1 point.)

57
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,080
(See?)

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,710
(And Man 2 got...)

59
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,840
(They became intimate
during lunchtime.)

60
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,810
(But he got 0 points.)

61
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,490
- Zero points.
- Hey!

62
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,150
(Woman 5 voted
based on her own beliefs.)

63
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,900
(Man 2 finally revealed
her pathetic true colors.)

64
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,870
(He declared war
pointing his finger at her.)

65
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,990
Okay.

66
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,330
(After announcing the points
of Men 1, 2, and 4,)

67
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,110
(what remains is Se Chan,
Suk Jin, and Haha.)

68
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,870
(Why are we grouped together?)

69
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,920
(Among them, only 1 member
got 3 points.)

70
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,150
(One of them swept
all the remaining points.)

71
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,420
(Should I get excited about this?)

72
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,710
(He's feeling excited already.)

73
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,050
(The news about 3 points...)

74
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,590
(shock the women as well.)

75
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,170
The one who got three points is...

76
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,090
(Who got 3 points after
having lunch with the women?)

77
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,270
Yang Se Chan.

78
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,580
(Man 3, Yang Se Chan)

79
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,240
- I knew it.
- What's going on?

80
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,000
(Woman 5's points
were sent to someone else.)

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,710
What happened?

82
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,270
You're a liar.

83
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,370
(You should've given me the points.)

84
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,020
- Get out!
- Why?

85
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
He got all the points.

86
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,840
You said I didn't have
to give you points.

87
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,860
(Man 6 feels disappointed
and furious.)

88
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,860
I was a little surprised.

89
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,680
I guess Cho Hee tried
to play a joke on me.

90
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,730
That's what I think.

91
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,730
(Man 6 is flustered.)

92
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,870
I should've gone
to this innocent woman.

93
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,530
- At the last moment...
- How could you...

94
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,870
- Suk Jin.
- What makes me so attractive?

95
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,540
- What's so great about me?
- You said you'd give me your point.

96
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,340
Cho Hee had two points,
so it's from Cho Hee.

97
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,740
Cho Hee gave you two points.

98
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,280
My heart is pounding.
What should I do?

99
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,110
- Se Chan is popular.
- I'm serious.

100
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,680
It's beating hard.

101
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,240
I feel excited.

102
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,370
What makes me so attractive?

103
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,290
(Laughing)

104
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,490
It feels great.

105
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,310
My gosh. Why is this
happening to me?

106
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,120
They all have their own charms.

107
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,360
Se Chan is popular.

108
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,050
That means So Min gave
her points to Jae Suk.

109
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,430
She didn't give me her point.

110
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,100
Not you. I meant Jae Suk.

111
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,100
(Not you.)

112
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,470
(I meant she gave it to Jae Suk.)

113
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,110
My gosh. I wasn't talking about you.

114
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,410
I meant Jae Suk.

115
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,280
You got zero points.

116
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,980
- Gosh, you're...
- Pull yourself together.

117
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,850
I meant Jae Suk, not you.

118
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,810
So Min, how could you...

119
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,290
I got fooled again. I'm so upset.

120
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,250
I feel really betrayed.

121
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,420
This is frustrating.

122
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,730
- Cho Hee had two points.
- He In gave me her point.

123
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,620
Cho Hee gave you two points.

124
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,250
(A few minutes earlier,
during lunchtime...)

125
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,100
(While Man 2 and 6 were trying
hard to get 2 points...)

126
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,230
(Cho Hee.)

127
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,260
(You know you don't have to
pick one of them, right?)

128
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,870
(I should find my variety partner.)

129
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,980
(She gave 2 points to Man 3
with her sincere heart.)

130
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,240
(Woman 4 who had lunch
with Man 3...)

131
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,280
(gave him 1 point as well.)

132
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,290
(Meanwhile, Woman 2 who had
lunch with Man 5...)

133
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,420
All the women gave...

134
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,720
their points to only one man each.

135
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,990
- Good.
- All right.

136
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,860
Before the final voting,

137
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,950
you will choose the last dessert.

138
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,470
- Dessert?
- Gosh, dessert?

139
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,820
This time, the men will...

140
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,430
take their dessert and scatter.

141
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,540
I see.

142
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,980
Then the women will pick up
the drinks for their partners...

143
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,240
and go to the person they want
with the drinks.

144
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,800
The rules remain the same.

145
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,920
- Okay.
- Good.

146
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,120
All right.

147
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,720
(Now it's the women's turn
to make up their minds.)

148
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,360
Now it's the women's turn
to make up their minds.

149
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,550
Where are you going?

150
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,660
Wait. This is...

151
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,250
If my partner doesn't vote for me,
I can't win the race?

152
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,100
- Right. You'll get a penalty.
- I see.

153
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,060
If you get many votes,
you can get a prize though.

154
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,870
So I have to be a couple.

155
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,560
We should plan this together.

156
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,060
I'll go to Jong Kook then. Man Four.

157
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,680
You just told us
about it to say that, right?

158
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,640
(She beat around the bush
to get to her point.)

159
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,440
I want a partner who is athletic...

160
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,180
and passionate just like me.

161
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,940
So I think In Ah would be
my perfect partner.

162
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,310
What about you?

163
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,050
I'm still thinking.

164
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,450
- Pick Jae Suk.
- Gosh.

165
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,990
We already had lunch together.
I don't want to eat dessert too.

166
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,690
You need another partner
to eat dessert with?

167
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,820
(Woman 1 wants to pick
someone else for her dessert.)

168
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,430
I have only one goal today.

169
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,740
I'll stick to Ji Hyo.
I don't want anyone else.

170
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,840
I'll stick to Ji Hyo.

171
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,840
Why did you give your points
to Se Chan, by the way?

172
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,070
Because I picked Se Chan
for the First Impression Poll.

173
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,570
- I see.
- So I just...

174
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,680
I think you might have to date him
for real after this show.

175
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,090
- He's serious about this.
- Really?

176
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,860
I see. That's not
what I want though.

177
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,660
Se Chan got the wrong idea.

178
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,550
That's not what I want at all.

179
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,050
I don't know why Cho Hee did that.

180
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,690
She also picked me
for the First Impression Poll.

181
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,230
Why did she pick me?

182
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,320
(She also picked me for the First
Impression Poll. Why is that?)

183
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,800
And Haha said silly things to me.

184
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,470
I wonder if she's interested in me.

185
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,930
I feel excited.

186
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,980
(Do you have any advice
for Man 2 who got 0 points?)

187
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,180
This is not advice though.

188
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,980
He tries so hard to give off
his charms when he doesn't have any.

189
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,870
That's the problem.

190
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,120
He should know what he's doing.

191
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,350
Right? I mean... Look.

192
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,010
You're being so condescending.

193
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,160
You're being ridiculous.

194
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,690
Why are you eavesdropping
on my interview?

195
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,430
You were saying stuff
like confidence and charms.

196
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,060
You should think...

197
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,800
about how you'll get drunk
alone at home later tonight.

198
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,840
(He will drink alone and go to sleep
as soon as he leaves the village.)

199
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,570
- This isn't a real situation.
- I guess you're right.

200
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,870
The annex?

201
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,870
(Woman 5 is about
to make her choice.)

202
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,000
(She heads to the building
where Man 2 and Man 3 are in.)

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,350
Cho Hee, hello.

204
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,370
(She heads to the building
where Man 2 and Man 3 are in.)

205
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,420
Cho Hee.

206
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,720
Just remember what I did earlier.

207
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,650
- Right. You came to me earlier.
- I know.

208
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,520
- I didn't even hesitate.
- We had a great time together.

209
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,250
Sure. Like I said earlier,

210
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,970
I'm fine that you didn't
give me your points.

211
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,390
- Really?
- Sure.

212
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,840
- Do you really not care about that?
- No.

213
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,900
- Okay. I got it.
- I'm relieved to hear that.

214
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,660
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes.

215
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,270
- I see.
- I want to take a walk around.

216
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,540
What? Are you on your way
to somewhere else?

217
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,580
It's not that you came here
to see me.

218
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,080
- But you said...
- Yes.

219
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,740
you don't mind
about the points at all.

220
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,360
It's not that
I don't mind it at all.

221
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,190
Gosh.

222
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,830
It's not like
I'm completely fine with it.

223
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,100
Woman Five takes off in a hurry.

224
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,150
(Woman 5 takes off.)

225
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,520
Woman Five chose Man Three.

226
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,990
Aren't you going
to come out and greet me?

227
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,240
Oh, dear. Sure.

228
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,310
- Come on out to greet me.
- Sure.

229
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,270
- Welcome.
- All right.

230
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,710
- I'm here.
- I see.

231
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,740
Have you made up your mind?

232
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,870
- Do you want me to leave?
- Gosh, no. I'm honored.

233
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,240
I hope he will eat his cake alone...

234
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,850
shivering with cold there.

235
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,510
- It's cold outside.
- It's cold.

236
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,820
Come on in.

237
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,410
I have a question.

238
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,830
Why did you give me
your two points? It was you, right?

239
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,330
How should I put it?

240
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,250
I'm a woman with a sincere heart.

241
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,700
It's my single-hearted devotion.

242
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,600
(Single-hearted devotion?)

243
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,130
- Are you serious?
- Yes. That's who I am.

244
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,470
You made a good first impression.

245
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,110
- My first impression?
- Yes.

246
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,240
You gave me a good first impression.

247
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm extremely satisfied.

248
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,900
And now I know...

249
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,210
why Woman Five...

250
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,900
chose me.

251
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,080
So I'll give
my single-hearted devotion...

252
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,350
only to her.

253
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,250
(Who's your least favorite member?)

254
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,280
Woman Five.

255
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,650
She's the worst.

256
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,420
We had lunch together.

257
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,020
That's when I realized it.

258
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,100
Her face...

259
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,020
looks so greedy.

260
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,700
She looks so grumpy.

261
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,630
She has such eyes.

262
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,490
Are you saying that
because she didn't pick you?

263
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,500
No. Not at all.

264
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,630
Like I said, I don't mind
even if she doesn't pick me.

265
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,530
But she keeps...

266
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,080
getting on my nerves.

267
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,580
I don't know.

268
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,870
(Man 2 is pretty upset
after he got rejected.)

269
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,720
Gosh, it's not easy to choose.

270
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,540
(While Man 2 is throwing tantrums,
Woman 4 looks for her partner.)

271
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,780
It's hard.

272
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,490
And it's hard to get picked.

273
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,150
(Laughing)

274
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,860
Gosh, are you here to greet me?

275
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,470
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

276
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,390
(He pretends it is a coincidence
with his contrived pose.)

277
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,630
So have you made up your mind?

278
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,110
- I'm still thinking.
- I see.

279
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,110
It's not...

280
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,500
that I'm trying to convince you,

281
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,270
but during...

282
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,870
the private interview earlier,

283
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,910
I said I would choose Woman Four.

284
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,190
- I see.
- No pressure.

285
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,750
Okay. Let me...

286
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,620
go on my way then.

287
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,560
(Passing by)

288
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
(Laughing)

289
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,290
(The horseback riding lover
passes him by like a horse.)

290
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,460
Hang on. Where am I?

291
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,920
(The horseback riding lover
passes him by like a horse.)

292
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,990
He In.

293
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,740
What's your drink?

294
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,370
- I have Iced Americanos.
- Iced Americanos?

295
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,870
- I have something here.
- You do?

296
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,110
I have carrot cake.

297
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,270
Do you have carrot cake?

298
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,370
I used to...

299
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
- enjoy horseback riding too.
- You did?

300
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,370
(The sound of horse's hooves)

301
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,740
(Man 6 tries to win her over
with some cheap tricks.)

302
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,820
Just kidding.

303
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,910
(Just kidding.)

304
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,010
It's up to you.

305
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,190
(He speaks
all the English words he knows.)

306
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,780
(After watching
Haha's cheap tricks,)

307
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,750
(she approaches Man 2
who still pretends to be gentle.)

308
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,920
I'm not going to act pathetic.

309
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,460
Okay. Do you mind if I sit here?

310
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,790
(Shouting)

311
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,860
Thank you.

312
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,230
It's so cold out here.
Are you all right?

313
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,020
- I'm fine. Please have a seat.
- Okay.

314
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,160
Thank you.

315
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,240
Korean variety shows are strange.

316
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,740
(Korean variety shows are strange.)

317
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,870
I can't get used to them.

318
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,980
Se Chan told me...

319
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,500
- that you like horseback riding.
- I do.

320
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,080
I came here on horseback today.

321
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,270
- Really?
- Yes.

322
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,770
That's how much...

323
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,240
(He makes up some lies about horses
to have a chat with her.)

324
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
I like horseback riding.

325
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,620
- All the way here to Yangpyeong?
- Yes.

326
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,120
I love horseback riding.

327
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,150
But riding a horse on the streets...

328
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,880
is against the law in Korea.

329
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,200
No. I took routes... I mean,

330
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,290
- I crossed mountains.
- Mountains?

331
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,490
You did?

332
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,030
(Man 4 becomes an eccentric guy
who crosses mountains on a horse.)

333
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,100
Next up is Woman Three.

334
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,160
It's here.

335
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,810
Our eyes just met.

336
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,170
(Man 4 found Woman 3
from a distance.)

337
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,400
In Ah.

338
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,370
Artist, baby

339
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,140
Actually, In Ah picked me at first.

340
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,690
If Woman Three picks someone else,

341
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,190
I'll be done for.

342
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,360
I'll...

343
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,920
choose my partner
without hesitation.

344
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,560
I won't even show my face
to the other men.

345
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,730
Here I go.

346
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,020
Mr. Trainer!

347
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,660
- In Ah. Don't hesitate.
- My fitness teacher.

348
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,130
- Yes.
- Thank you.

349
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,740
Good. I didn't even
look at the other women.

350
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,210
Thank you.

351
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,740
She runs toward him.

352
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,370
- She's not funny at all, right?
- Yes.

353
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,400
Woman Three's choice...

354
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,270
disappointed Men 5 and 6.

355
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,040
Can you call this a variety show?

356
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,010
- It's no fun.
- This is so boring.

357
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,780
Actually, I like...

358
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,280
your style and mindset.

359
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,090
(Me?)

360
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,150
Me?

361
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,520
- I like you too.
- I'm serious.

362
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,620
Shall we eat together?

363
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,290
If we end up alone,
shall we eat together?

364
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,200
- Deal.
- Okay.

365
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,440
All right. Let's eat together.

366
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,160
I had a lot of fun
in the blanket earlier.

367
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,740
(They felt warm camaraderie
in the blanket during the mission.)

368
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,710
Next up is Woman Two.

369
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,270
(Next up is Woman 2.)

370
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,350
- Is that So Min?
- The weird one is here.

371
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,640
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

372
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
(Woman 2 with
unpredictable charm shows up.)

373
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,460
- Beautiful day.
- The sky is high.

374
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,620
It's a beautiful day.

375
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,280
So Min, I'll give you
my point no matter what.

376
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,460
Suk Jin.

377
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,100
- Hello.
- I mean...

378
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,570
(She tells him to trust her
with her eyes.)

379
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,260
If you leave now,
I won't believe you.

380
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,940
- Thank you.
- This is...

381
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,490
where I sat earlier.

382
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,610
Okay.

383
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,870
Are you sitting there?

384
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,840
- Are you going to sit there?
- Woman 2 chose Man 6.

385
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,670
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

386
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,450
- Yes!
- Are you sitting down?

387
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,980
Hey!

388
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,450
Lastly, Woman One...

389
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,220
is meeting with Man One.

390
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,350
Ji Hyo.

391
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,010
- Hello.
- I was waiting for you.

392
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,320
- Me?
- Yes.

393
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,780
- Did you see me sitting here?
- Yes.

394
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,990
- I didn't even go out.
- Are you serious?

395
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,750
Man One says
he didn't even go out...

396
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,660
waiting for Woman One.

397
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,200
He In!

398
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,290
In Ah!

399
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,370
I'm right here. Where are you going?

400
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,710
Can I ask you for directions?

401
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,400
Why don't you come in
and have some tea?

402
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,080
I can't.

403
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,950
Just go.

404
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,670
After getting rejected four times,

405
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,820
Man One is feeling anxious.

406
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,350
Where are you going, Ji Hyo?

407
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,990
- I want to take a look around.
- What?

408
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,240
I just came to say hi.

409
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,460
- I wanted to thank you for lunch.
- Ji Hyo.

410
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,490
- You don't have to say hi.
- I'm here to say hi.

411
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,190
My gosh, Ji Hyo.

412
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,890
I really like it.

413
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,600
Oh, hi.

414
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,200
Hi, Miss...

415
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,730
Song.

416
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,990
This is my friend.

417
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,490
Hi.

418
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,530
- All right.
- I'm happy to be with my friend.

419
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,580
- Are you sitting there?
- Well...

420
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,400
Hey. Hey!

421
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,710
Gosh.

422
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,610
I can't believe you guys.

423
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,670
(Outraged)

424
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,620
The women are done
making their choices.

425
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,040
All they have left is
the final points and the poll.

426
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,860
Is Jae Suk alone?

427
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,920
(The men get as many points
as the number of their partners.)

428
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,560
The men can give points...

429
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,890
to the women they like.

430
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,920
Man Two.

431
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,790
You got chosen by one woman,

432
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,970
- so you get one point.
- Okay.

433
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,940
Man Four...

434
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,480
chose Woman Three who came to him.

435
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,630
Gosh, this is...

436
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,850
And the other men...

437
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,010
also chose the women
who came to them.

438
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,590
(Lee Cho Hee)

439
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,040
Then give me your points.

440
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,380
(Haha has 2 partners,
so he can give 2 points.)

441
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,560
- Haha.
- Yes?

442
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,190
I don't have many points.

443
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,490
I know that.

444
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,620
Man Six seems...

445
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,890
to have chosen one
between Women 1 and 2.

446
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,020
Are you announcing the results here?

447
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,240
- Yes. Here.
- Why would you do that?

448
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,840
It makes us uncomfortable.
Why would you do it here?

449
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,170
Woman One...

450
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,370
got two points.

451
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,640
(Woman 1 got 2 points.)

452
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,210
Meanwhile, Woman 2 got 0 points.

453
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,320
(And Woman 2
obviously got 0 points.)

454
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,850
(She finds out where the 2 points
went right on the spot.)

455
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,220
(Haha gave Ji Hyo 2 points
with very small letters.)

456
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,490
Gosh, don't act like a bully.

457
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,090
So Min, calm down.

458
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,590
I'm so upset.

459
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,520
- Relax.
- I'm so mad.

460
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,530
- Calm down.
- Calm down.

461
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,600
Oh my goodness.

462
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,570
(The dessert time is over
with rage and betrayal.)

463
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,040
Why are you acting
like a little kid?

464
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,930
Now this is the final poll
for Perfect Partner Signal.

465
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,200
You can talk to other members
for 20 minutes.

466
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,870
And the final voting will begin
in 20 minutes.

467
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,820
Those who are matched
with their partners...

468
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,440
will be exempt from the penalty.

469
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,320
And you have collected your points.

470
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,620
You can buy an extra vote
with four points,

471
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,790
and give up your right to vote
with five points.

472
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,860
If you have an extra vote,

473
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,890
you can vote for different partners
to increase the chances of a match.

474
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,770
You won't get a penalty,

475
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,190
but you can't win a prize either.

476
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,960
(If they give up the vote,
they don't get a penalty or prize.)

477
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,010
That's not good.

478
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,510
But you will have to...

479
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,230
draw lots.

480
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,630
If you want to buy an extra vote,

481
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,700
you will have to choose
between a vote and a dud.

482
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,350
And it's the same for the right
to give up the vote.

483
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,640
So it's a 50-50 chance.

484
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,250
If you're matched with your partner,

485
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,410
you don't get a penalty.

486
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,720
All those who fail to find a match
will get a penalty.

487
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,120
If you get more than one vote,

488
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,300
you'll get gold.

489
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,860
All right then. You have...

490
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,300
- many points now.
- I have the most points.

491
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,070
So you should buy an extra vote...

492
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,130
and vote for a man
who's likely to get a penalty.

493
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,630
And you should tell him about that.

494
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,610
Suk Jin must be afraid...

495
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,930
that he would get a penalty.

496
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,370
So he'd want to make a deal.

497
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,810
You can go to him
and make a deal with him.

498
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,250
- Pick one.
- I should do that.

499
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,640
Then make a deal with Suk Jin.

500
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,350
Now they get to show off...

501
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,820
their charm for 20 minutes.

502
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,910
- I'm really disappointed today.
- With whom?

503
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,320
- In terms of variety.
- Why?

504
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
In terms of variety?

505
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,620
Because Jong Jook
chose you for lunch.

506
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,360
Then you should've gone
to someone else for dessert.

507
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,300
But you chose Jong Kook.
That's why I'm so disappointed.

508
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,620
That's what I said earlier.

509
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,960
- You don't have to come to me.
- I get it.

510
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,390
No one chose you.

511
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,930
It's not like that.

512
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,070
He's just jealous now.

513
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,400
- No one came to me.
- So he's upset.

514
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,610
Hey.

515
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,870
- Now...
- Yes?

516
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,510
He's upset because no one
went to him for dessert.

517
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,050
- He's throwing a tantrum.
- It's not like that.

518
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,250
- He says he's disappointed.
- He's just sulky.

519
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,680
I got really disappointed
in Variety Village.

520
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,710
- Why are you upset?
- In Ah.

521
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,090
I didn't know you'd be so boring.

522
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,180
You should focus on your drama.

523
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,060
What is he saying?

524
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,150
- I'm so disappointed in you.
- Stop it.

525
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,800
He can't spoil the mood like that...

526
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,420
just because no one chose him.

527
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,070
It wasn't appropriate.

528
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,300
I'm pretty sure that Suk Jin will
receive a penalty.

529
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,430
It's over.

530
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,900
- Really.
- Did you go to the drawing room?

531
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,170
- No. Can we go there now?
- Will you...

532
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,250
Of course, we can.

533
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,580
I can assure you one thing.
Kwang Soo won't choose you.

534
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,020
- He won't...
- Hang on a second.

535
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,080
- I didn't know you were here.
- Hey, mister.

536
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
- He won't...
- Hang on a second.

537
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,440
(I can't believe you.)

538
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,650
- I'm sorry.
- You know...

539
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,180
- I didn't see you there.
- I know you're impatient, but...

540
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,060
- Was he there all along?
- Suk Jin is right about that.

541
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,330
- I'm so disappointed.
- I can assure you...

542
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,690
- I won't pick anyone else.
- I'm telling you how to survive...

543
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,760
in this wild jungle.

544
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,530
- That's all I'm saying.
- I have no reason to do that.

545
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,270
- I understand.
- No one else will pick me either.

546
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,630
I didn't see you there. I'm sorry.

547
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,270
I'm going to approach He In again.

548
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,340
I think I should win her over...

549
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,640
so that I can
at least receive gold...

550
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,820
even if I fail to pair up
with anyone.

551
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,580
(Man 3 is planning to
reconnect with her.)

552
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,980
- This may sound stupid.
- Okay.

553
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,560
I'm going to learn horse riding
starting next week.

554
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,120
- Are you serious?
- Yes. I know it sounds silly,

555
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,950
- but I'll start next week.
- Really?

556
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,950
Yes. I didn't say it to impress you.
I really want to learn it.

557
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,870
Let's ride together some time.

558
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,120
- Sounds great.
- Man Three.

559
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,230
You seem to be wary
and jealous of me.

560
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,570
- This is so funny.
- What's the reason?

561
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,960
- What is this about?
- I mean...

562
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,400
- We were having a nice chat.
- Don't you own a lot of stocks?

563
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,810
Yes, I do. I think she and I have
a lot in common.

564
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,470
It seems to me that you have been...

565
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,710
caught up in an idea
since the beginning of the show.

566
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,680
That you're actually a rich man
who owns a lot of stocks,

567
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,520
that you can do anything you want
like horse riding and everything,

568
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,620
and that you're very popular
with women. You've been into it...

569
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,360
- That's not true.
- since you got three votes.

570
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,300
- The look on his face has changed.
- That's funny.

571
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,390
(The look on his face changed
after he got three votes.)

572
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,890
Listen, Kwang Soo.

573
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,190
I'll choose Woman Four,
and nothing can change my mind.

574
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,430
- But...
- I'll start learning horse riding.

575
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,130
- Will you do the same thing?
- Then... I am...

576
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,570
raising my own horse.

577
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,370
I'm raising one.

578
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,630
- You have a horse?
- Yes.

579
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,700
That's ridiculous.
Don't believe what he says.

580
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,970
I'm a little torn.

581
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,940
I'm afraid he might betray me
when I choose him.

582
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,860
Before I came on the show,
many people advised me...

583
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,620
not to trust him, if anyone else.

584
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,190
I need an extra vote,
so I can be relaxed.

585
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,300
(Meanwhile, Man 4 entered
the drawing room.)

586
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,070
I'll draw for an extra vote.

587
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,800
(He spent four points
to draw for an extra vote.)

588
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,270
(1 of the 2 balls in the box is
a vote and the other is a dud.)

589
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,340
I've made up my mind.

590
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,510
(He needs an extra vote to increase
the chance to pair up with someone.)

591
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,200
(Dud)

592
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,310
Dud.

593
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,470
(He wasted four points.)

594
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,970
Okay. There's a 50 percent chance,
but I'm getting even more nervous.

595
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,140
I have a 50-50 chance, right?

596
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,210
I'll take it out right away.

597
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
(Extra vote)

598
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,910
You got an extra vote.

599
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,260
(He got an extra vote.)

600
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,860
Oh, gosh. Seriously.

601
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,920
If I get to choose one more woman,

602
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,500
I would choose Ji Hyo...

603
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,960
(Meanwhile, Man 1 is leaving
after drawing for something.)

604
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,100
- Did you try that?
- Yes.

605
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,200
- Hey.
- But...

606
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,080
Based on his face, I think
he failed to get what he wanted.

607
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,310
His face turned red.

608
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,640
You picked a dud again?

609
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,050
Gosh. I'm sick of hearing that.

610
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,750
I can tell by his face.

611
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,620
(Jae Suk's lip is rolled up again.)

612
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,620
Man One.

613
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,680
(All he can do is laugh.)

614
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,450
- I know how you feel, Man One.
- My gosh.

615
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,450
- He seems very disappointed.
- I've been so unlucky today.

616
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,790
Ji Hyo...

617
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,360
might choose someone else.

618
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,120
I'll choose her
even though I know that.

619
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,830
You know what I mean, right? Yes.

620
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,570
- If we pair up with each other...
- Who will you choose?

621
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,390
- In Ah and who else?
- I'll pick no one else but you.

622
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,270
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

623
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,840
You're the only one
that I'm thinking of choosing.

624
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,400
Ji Hyo, I'm a little disappointed.

625
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,700
Ji Hyo, I'm disappointed.

626
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,080
Don't be, Jae Suk.
I've already decided to pick you.

627
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,910
I said I will pick you
in the interview too.

628
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,680
- Really? Is that true?
- Yes. It's true.

629
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,850
I promise you...

630
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,910
- I'll pick you.
- It's a promise.

631
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,150
- Yes.
- Ji Hyo.

632
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,380
Man Six also needs Woman One's vote.

633
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,480
I hope you understand that.

634
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,560
If I don't succeed this time,
I'll be finished.

635
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,390
Please remember that I gave you
two points.

636
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,420
(He's trying to get her vote
using the points he gave her.)

637
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,340
- All right.
- You're my variety partner.

638
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,400
Should I choose Haha?

639
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,700
(Which 1 of them will be chosen
by Woman 1?)

640
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,970
Or should I choose Jae Suk
or Jong Kook?

641
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,170
I will choose you.

642
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,870
Whatever I do during the mission,
I always choose you in the end.

643
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,820
If we pair up with each other,
we won't get a penalty.

644
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,080
- That's right.
- Then should I...

645
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,090
- trust you for the last time?
- You should trust me.

646
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,680
In Ah, you have an extra vote now.

647
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,650
You should make a deal
with someone desperate.

648
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,680
Like Suk Jin.

649
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,330
But whenever I talk to him,

650
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,800
he says he doesn't want my vote,

651
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,660
- telling me to go shoot a drama.
- What's wrong with him?

652
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,890
- I'll talk to him.
- See?

653
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,460
- He looks so upset.
- I will...

654
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,800
convince him.

655
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,300
You go and get an extra vote.

656
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

657
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,430
Come over here. Gosh, seriously.

658
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,430
Will you get a penalty?

659
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,580
- I'll just get a penalty today.
- Why?

660
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,140
- I don't think anyone will pick me.
- You're wrong.

661
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,250
Why? Is there something
I don't know?

662
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,580
- Listen to me. In Ah...
- In Ah?

663
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,620
just went into the drawing room.
Listen.

664
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,590
- Really?
- If she gets an extra vote...

665
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,710
- Do I still have a chance?
- If she gets it,

666
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,120
she'll give me one vote...

667
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,150
- and give you the other one.
- I see.

668
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,830
- You won't get a penalty.
- That's true.

669
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,300
And she'll receive gold.
She'll win the race.

670
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,190
So she'll definitely pick you.

671
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,770
- Really?
- Didn't you know?

672
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,100
(That makes sense.)

673
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,300
Hello.

674
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,390
I'll buy two tickets
for drawing for an extra vote.

675
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,400
(In Ah with nine points will draw
for an extra vote twice.)

676
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,570
- Suk Jin.
- Why?

677
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,630
(Woman 2 noticed something's wrong.)

678
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,130
Are you really going to pick me
as you said?

679
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,970
Of course. I promised you earlier.

680
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,370
I'm just worried you might
change your mind.

681
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,850
Woman Two seemed so sincere
when she talked to me.

682
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,290
I don't know
if I should trust her or not.

683
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,020
You're contemplating
between So Min and In Ah, right?

684
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,530
- Yes.
- Why?

685
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,980
- Forget about her.
- I mean...

686
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,330
- If you give me assurance...
- Forget about So Min.

687
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,650
If you give me assurance,
I'll pick you.

688
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,800
Let's go with this plan.

689
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,190
I have two votes.
Of course, I'll pick you two.

690
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,420
- Really?
- Yes.

691
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,100
It's time for everyone
to cast their votes...

692
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,660
for their variety partners.

693
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,040
- Have you made up your mind?
- Yes, clearly.

694
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,040
I asked He In for her vote too.

695
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,280
If both of them choose me...

696
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,210
I don't know. What should I do?

697
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,250
(It's hard to decide
to the last moment.)

698
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,410
It's really hard to decide.

699
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,050
Should I pick Haha?

700
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,790
(So the 11 men and women have
cast their votes.)

701
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,650
Perfect Partner Signal. Finally,

702
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,260
the time for the announcement
of the result has come.

703
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,300
(It's time for the announcement
of the result.)

704
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,300
Is any one of you sure that you'll
pair up with the one you chose?

705
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,100
I should succeed no matter what.

706
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,070
I hope so. Please.

707
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,430
(Man 5 and Woman 2 exchanged
eye contact.)

708
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,270
So Min...
What kind of person is she?

709
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,310
- If Man Five trusted So Min...
- Yes.

710
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,550
- and risked everything...
- Yes.

711
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,080
- Come on.
- There's very little chance.

712
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,940
- You're wrong. You may be wrong.
- It won't happen.

713
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,880
- That's possible too, but...
- You may be wrong.

714
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,640
- I think that So Min...
- Yes.

715
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,790
might have given up
on her voting right.

716
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,290
- That's possible.
- Yes.

717
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,920
- Oh, right. We could do that too.
- She's crazy. She might've done it.

718
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
(She might've done it
to avoid a penalty.)

719
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,950
- She might've done it.
- No.

720
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,800
- Right?
- You'll get no penalty or prize.

721
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,030
(The ones who gave up on their votes
won't get a penalty or a prize.)

722
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,190
There's a chance that she gave up
on her vote.

723
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,460
That makes sense. She thought
she wouldn't get any votes.

724
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,370
- I saw Ji Hyo earlier...
- I trust you.

725
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,730
(The Exciting Love Matching Time)

726
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,960
- It wasn't me.
- Right.

727
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,700
- We decided the order.
- Yes.

728
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,010
We'll check
Woman Two's choice first.

729
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,780
- Me?
- But that's like the main event.

730
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,170
- It's the most interesting event.
- We'll see that first?

731
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,710
- Woman Two really?
- She's the 1st one?

732
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,210
We'll reveal the choice
that Woman Two made.

733
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,320
(Did Woman 2 give up on her vote...)

734
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,480
(or vote for Man 5?)

735
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,620
I'm sure she didn't vote.

736
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,030
- Show us.
- I'm so curious.

737
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,290
I'm sure she didn't vote.

738
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,300
Show us.

739
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,890
- Suk Jin, that hurts.
- What?

740
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,030
(Woman 2 chose Man 5.)

741
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,500
- What is this?
- What's going on?

742
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,130
(Her heart went to Man Five
whom she promised she'd pick.)

743
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,540
(Everyone is surprised
that So Min didn't betray him.)

744
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,310
- Suk Jin.
- It's hard to believe.

745
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,110
- He's finally smiling happily.
- I'm sorry for doubting you.

746
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,010
Gosh, Suk Jin.

747
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,850
Did you not pick me?

748
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,850
Let's find out.

749
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,550
- Let's move on.
- I can't believe he got a vote.

750
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,790
(Man 5 is smiling quietly.
Whom did he choose?)

751
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,520
I can't believe
that Suk Jin got a vote.

752
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,820
Next, we'll reveal the choice
that Woman One made.

753
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,980
- Woman One?
- I'm so curious.

754
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,420
- I wonder whom she voted for too.
- Ji Hyo.

755
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,980
- She probably picked Jae Suk.
- Ji Hyo.

756
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,300
- I'm sure she picked Jae Suk.
- I trust you.

757
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,450
- What do you mean you trust her?
- I guess she talked to Haha too.

758
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,890
We didn't just talk...

759
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,370
I've already decided to pick you.

760
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:18,840
(Did she pick Man 1
whom she ate lunch with?)

761
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,900
- It's a promise.
- Yes.

762
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,580
If I don't succeed this time,
I'll be finished.

763
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,900
(Or did she pick Man 6 who gave
her 2 points at the dessert time?)

764
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,480
(Or did she pick Man 4 who asked
for her vote at the last minute?)

765
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,710
(It's rare to see a love square
in Variety Village.)

766
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,060
(Whom did she choose?)

767
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,620
We didn't just talk...

768
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,180
- That's it!
- My gosh.

769
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,120
(It's Man Six Haha!)

770
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,150
- That's it!
- My gosh.

771
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,270
(She picked her dessert mate.)

772
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,390
Thank you. Wait here.

773
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,070
- I'm sorry. I had only one vote.
- Ji Hyo.

774
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,900
- I can't believe you.
- I had only one vote.

775
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,110
- It's shocking.
- I had only one vote.

776
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,870
- Get ready to get wet.
- Congratulations.

777
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,580
Congratulations.

778
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,910
- Jae Suk, I'm really sorry.
- This is why I offered you a deal.

779
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,440
Next up is Man Six.

780
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,880
(Next, Man 6's choice
will be revealed.)

781
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,550
Please reveal Man Six's choice.

782
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,320
(If he picked Woman 1,
they'll pair up with each other.)

783
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,880
Please reveal Man Six's choice.

784
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,090
- Is it Ji Hyo?
- It's Ji Hyo.

785
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,530
(Woman 1 and Man 6 paired up
with each other.)

786
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,160
(They will not get a penalty.)

787
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,300
You guys won't get a penalty.

788
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,570
- You picked Ji Hyo, didn't you?
- Haha is safe too.

789
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,570
You picked Ji Hyo, didn't you?
He must have...

790
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,460
You should've convinced her
while eating with her.

791
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,110
He didn't even listen to others.

792
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,130
You should've impressed her...

793
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,580
- while eating with her.
- Sorry, Jae Suk.

794
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,440
I trusted you.

795
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,750
- What made you sure she'd pick you?
- I don't understand...

796
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,050
- Let's move on.
- I thought Ji Hyo was...

797
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,050
We'll reveal Man Five's choice.

798
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,850
- Me?
- He'll pair up with So Min.

799
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,650
(Man 5 already received
Woman Two's vote!)

800
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,720
- Please reveal his choice.
- I don't think he picked me.

801
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,830
I'm sure he picked her. Wait.

802
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,120
- What?
- He picked Woman Three?

803
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,100
(Woman 3!)

804
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,620
(Oh, my goodness.)

805
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,630
- Why?
- He picked Woman Three?

806
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,300
- So Min, I'm sorry.
- Suk Jin, why did you do that?

807
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,230
- That's unexpected.
- Why?

808
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,540
(The gullible Man 5 was convinced
by In Ah in the end.)

809
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,130
- Why?
- What happened?

810
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,440
So Min, I'm sorry.

811
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,670
- That's so unexpected.
- So Min.

812
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,120
- I...
- He changed his mind.

813
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,910
- I thought you wouldn't...
- Why did he pick Woman Three?

814
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,290
- Man Five, it's okay.
- Why did he pick In Ah?

815
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,590
- So Min, I'm really sorry.
- Exactly. He got mad at In Ah.

816
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,380
So Min and I promised
to pick each other.

817
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,480
You made a promise to her.

818
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,290
What do you think are the chances
she'll actually pick me?

819
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,560
I think there's
a zero percent chance.

820
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,530
- I should stay alert, right?
- Exactly.

821
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,890
(He said he would stay alert
because of what Jong Kook said.)

822
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,630
(But he was convinced
as he heard In Ah had two votes.)

823
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,730
I've been so loyal to you.

824
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,340
Everyone said that there was no way
you would pick me.

825
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,310
- That's what they thought.
- You made the right decision.

826
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,870
- Woman 1.
- Man 5.

827
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,640
- Come back here.
- I feel so bad.

828
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,470
- It wasn't like that.
- Then So Min will get a penalty.

829
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,670
- That was so mean.
- I mean...

830
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,290
- I can't believe this.
- That was so mean.

831
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,980
- You made the right decision.
- My gosh.

832
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,590
- I'm baffled right now.
- I chose the 100 percent chance.

833
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,590
- You did the right thing.
- Next up is Woman Three.

834
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,060
(In Ah's choice will be revealed!)

835
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,420
- Woman 3.
- Please reveal Woman 3's choice.

836
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,330
- I knew it.
- Exactly.

837
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,530
She had another vote.

838
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,100
(She picked Jong Kook as expected.)

839
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,390
She had another vote.

840
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,630
(She had another vote.)

841
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,700
(She didn't have an extra vote.)

842
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,810
She didn't have an extra vote.

843
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,110
(What?)

844
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,320
In Ah, is that true?

845
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,520
- Really?
- Hey, how could you?

846
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,680
- Then why did he pick her?
- You didn't have an extra vote?

847
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,090
I could have gotten two more votes.

848
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,180
- You got bad ones?
- I got unlucky.

849
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,090
(Earlier on, at the drawing room,)

850
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,150
(she got a dud
at her first attempt.)

851
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,960
(She failed
at her second attempt too.)

852
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,460
(So she had only 1 vote.)

853
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,600
- I had no idea.
- What happened?

854
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,110
She stopped me...

855
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,340
when I was passing by
after promising So Min I'd pick her.

856
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,110
- She said she had an extra vote,
- Suk Jin.

857
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,810
and that I should pick someone
who would actually pick me.

858
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,970
Hey!

859
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,870
- So Min, I'm really sorry.
- Don't yell at her.

860
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,520
- I'm shocked.
- This is so unexpected.

861
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,210
- I asked you to trust me just once.
- What a twist.

862
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,980
I'm so sorry.

863
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,620
In Ah,
you're such a great entertainer.

864
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,950
- Right?
- I was...

865
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,590
- Suk Jin, I'm shocked too.
- Gosh, seriously.

866
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,950
- She fooled us both.
- I thought she was naive,

867
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,300
but she tricked me completely.

868
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,370
- I'm impressed.
- She's a good entertainer.

869
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,800
- You did well today.
- Next up is...

870
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,630
- Man Four.
- Me?

871
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,460
Please reveal Man Four's choice.

872
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,160
- What?
- My gosh.

873
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,110
- You had 2 votes?
- Yes, I had 1 extra vote.

874
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,870
I had an extra vote,
so I gave it to Ji Hyo.

875
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,050
Hey, you'll receive gold.

876
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,810
(Hey, you'll receive gold.)

877
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,940
- Oh, I'll receive gold.
- That's right.

878
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
(Ji Hyo and In Ah will receive gold
with two votes!)

879
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,410
- So will In Ah.
- That's right.

880
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,710
- In Ah will receive gold too.
- In Ah too.

881
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,710
Next up is Man One.

882
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,180
We don't even have to see that.

883
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,260
- Ji Hyo? I'm sure it's Ji Hyo.
- Please reveal his choice.

884
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,450
(Ji Hyo was his only partner
during the mission.)

885
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,390
Please reveal his choice.

886
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,390
(But Woman 1 chose someone else.)

887
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,800
Please reveal his choice.

888
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,420
- Okay!
- You didn't vote?

889
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,460
- He didn't vote?
- My gosh.

890
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,190
(Yoo Jae Suk gave up his vote.)

891
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,810
(He's the first person
to give up his vote.)

892
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,700
- My gosh. He didn't vote.
- Really?

893
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,810
(Man 1 barely saved himself!)

894
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,910
- My gosh. He's unbelievable.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

895
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,170
You got one?
Wasn't there a dud as well?

896
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,210
- Yes.
- But you got one?

897
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,680
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, wow.

898
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,290
- That's unbelievable.
- Okay!

899
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,320
(Man 1 made a decision
standing on the edge of a cliff.)

900
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,380
(I'll draw for abstention.)

901
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,790
(One is abstention right,
and the other is a dud.)

902
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:12,870
(He got the abstention right.)

903
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,500
- That was impressive.
- That's so cool.

904
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,310
- I just can't let others...
- I think he made the right choice.

905
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,730
- change my life.
- You're amazing.

906
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,280
- I feel bad for Suk Jin.
- He's having a meltdown.

907
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,310
- All right. Next up is...
- You did great.

908
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,910
(Next up is Man 2.)

909
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,680
Next up is Man Two.

910
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,210
- Man Two.
- Did he vote?

911
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,620
- That's right. I picked her.
- Oh, he voted.

912
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,680
(Unexpectedly, he chose Woman 4
as he promised!)

913
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,590
- He picked He In.
- He didn't give up?

914
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,420
I said I'd pick her
from the beginning.

915
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,360
Next up is Woman Four.
Please show us.

916
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,530
He didn't change his mind
as he usually does.

917
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,870
(Man 3 Yang Se Chan)

918
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,630
I'm sorry.

919
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,040
What?

920
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,810
(I'm sorry.)

921
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,870
My gosh. What's going on?
How did it happen?

922
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,370
- How did this happen?
- Why...

923
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,910
No one said I should trust you.

924
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,880
- Of course, she didn't pick him.
- But...

925
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,790
(It was a big decision
for a novice entertainer.)

926
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:15,800
(Everyone told her not to choose
Kwang Soo.)

927
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,390
(By the way, He In!)

928
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,390
(It's true about Kwang Soo.)

929
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,890
(He won't pick you.)

930
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,810
(She started to doubt him
because of his reputation.)

931
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,470
(She chose Se Chan who promised
he'll learn horseback riding.)

932
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,750
- This is ridiculous.
- You made the right decision.

933
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,640
She ate that darn dessert with me.

934
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,280
(She ate that darn dessert with me.)

935
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,620
- I thought we made a deal.
- Hey.

936
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,750
I'm sorry.

937
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,980
- She ate lunch with me. That's why.
- Okay.

938
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,590
- We ate lunch together.
- You made the right decision.

939
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,150
- That was so funny.
- Good.

940
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,620
- Just let it go.
- I feel so bad about it.

941
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,450
We'll reveal
Woman Five's choice first.

942
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,530
- What happens to me?
- Please show us.

943
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,950
I almost got into trouble.

944
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,530
(Did she pick Man 3
who showed an interest in her?)

945
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,690
- It's Se Chan.
- My goodness.

946
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,070
- That's impressive.
- He got two votes.

947
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,510
- I got two votes.
- Se Chan will receive gold.

948
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,610
Okay!

949
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,970
If Se Chan picked one of the women
who chose him,

950
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,250
she'll be exempt from the penalty.

951
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,750
So 1 of the 2 of them...

952
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,970
- will get a penalty.
- That's right.

953
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,970
Only one of them will get a penalty.

954
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,140
- Whomever Se Chan picked.
- I'm so curious.

955
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,520
Please reveal the choice
that Man Three made.

956
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,960
(Who did Man 3 Se Chan choose?)

957
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,190
(He had dessert with Woman 5,)

958
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,630
(and promised to ride a horse
with Woman 4.)

959
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,690
We made it.

960
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,540
(Woman 5 and Man 3 picked
each other.)

961
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,000
- I knew it.
- Why did you pick him?

962
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,880
- I knew they'd pick each other.
- Me too.

963
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,380
I knew it.

964
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,900
It was obvious.

965
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,900
(Both Kwang Soo and He In will
get a penalty.)

966
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,920
- He In, why did you pick him?
- What is this?

967
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,880
- Why did you let this happen?
- He In.

968
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,980
Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and In Ah will...

969
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,690
- receive 3.75g of gold.
- Okay!

970
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,420
Kwang Soo, Suk Jin, So Min,
and He In will get a penalty.

971
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,020
- Okay!
- Okay!

972
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,400
I mean, why...

973
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,500
- Thank you.
- Look at that.

974
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,900
Thank you.

975
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,900
We prepared the penalty to help
the ones who couldn't pair up...

976
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,000
with anyone wake up
and face the reality.

977
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,100
It's throwing water
and a towel with paint on it.

978
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,600
Oh, no. Paint?

979
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,080
- That's the worst penalty ever.
- That's the worst.

980
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,100
- This is the worst.
- How could you do that to me?

981
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,750
(The ones who used to be partners
will do it to each other.)

982
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,040
My gosh.

983
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,310
- That's the worst.
- Indeed.

984
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,980
- This is the worst part.
- Exactly.

985
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,310
- I'm sorry, So Min.
- Why would you rub it on her face?

986
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,080
Oh, no.

987
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
(The horse riding partners also
threw water on each other's faces.)

988
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,520
- That must hurt.
- Look at her.

989
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,230
- That's enough.
- That's enough. You can stop it.

990
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
- Okay!
- Thank you, everyone.

991
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,730
- Good job, everyone.
- Thank you.

992
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,870
With that,
Perfect Partner Signal ended.

993
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,810
(But what was waiting for them
outside of the Variety Village...)

994
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,830
(And...)

(The Entering Class of 1991
Is Back!)

(such as the 1988 Seoul Olympics,)

998
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,290
(everyone was elated in 1991.)

999
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,960
(There had been a lot of changes
before the 21st century began.)

1000
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,540
(The biggest change was...)

1001
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,330
(the appearance of Generation X,
the symbol of the time.)

1002
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,230
(We want to be free no matter what.)

1003
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,710
They wear distressed jeans.

1004
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,100
(Generation X refused to follow
the existing social customs,)

1005
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,710
(and didn't worry about
what others thought about them.)

1006
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,670
(Here come eight unique,
freewheeling college students!)

1007
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,580
That's not all. They're not affected
by the fame of a few brands.

1008
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,350
They don't
blindly pursue uniqueness either.

1009
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:33,380
(The four leaders of Generation X
are on Running Man!)

1010

("There's no textbook or examples
for their fashion sense.)

1011
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,500

Hey, you're here.

Hi.

Won't you say hi?

- Of course. Hello.
- Hi.

We were shopping.

1026
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,170
(We were shopping.)

1027
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,270
We were talking
about each other's fashion style.

1028
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,870
Hey, come over here.

1029
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,100
- Me?
- Yes.

1030
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,810
Aren't you going to thank us?

1031
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,810
For what?

1032
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,810
You got to see something cool.
You should be thanking us.

1033
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,770
Hey, aren't you going to thank us?

1034
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,480
- Thank you both.
- Okay.

1035
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:32,790
Give us some money.

1036
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,190
(Give us some money.)

1037
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,710
If you really are grateful,
give us some money.

1038
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,710
(If you really are grateful,
give us some money.)

1039
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,080
You look stylish today.

1040
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
(You look stylish today.)

1041
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,000
It makes me want to use
this umbrella.

1042
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,290
Haha, you may be short, but you're
a giant when it comes to fashion.

1043
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,060
Thank you.

1044
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,170
You parted your hair nicely.
It's parted right in the middle.

1045
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,170
It's disrespectful to fashion
if both of my eyes are visible.

1046
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,770
Are you sure you're doing it right?

1047
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,080
Honestly, I've never seen anyone
who's so tall but cute like you.

1048
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
(Honestly, I've never seen anyone
who's so tall but cute like you.)

1049
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,690
I'm so upset.

1050
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,920
Why can't I find any white belt?

1051
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,630
A belt? Oh, it was a belt.
I thought it was a mic.

1052
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,690
(A belt? Oh, it was a belt.
I thought it was a mic.)

1053
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,000
(The two young men lost track
of time talking about fashion.)

1054
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,170
It was so hard to get this belt.

1055
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,600
(The two young men lost track
of time talking about fashion.)

1056
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,270
I got my hair permed.

1057
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,000
Were you confused about the concept?

1058
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,870
What? What do you mean by that?

1059
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,000
All right. Shall we go now?

1060
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,380
Let's go.

1061
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,270
Let's draw some attention.

1062
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,750
Let's go.

1063
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,080
Wherever we walk becomes
a fashion runway.

1064
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,440
Yes!

1065
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,980
(The two fashion leaders left.)

1066
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,980
This is nice.

1067
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,790
- How nice.
- Indeed.

1068
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,100
Where were you guys doing?

1069
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,790
What? Oh, we...

1070
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,170
You know, we have a dream.

1071
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,500
- We will...
- Yes.

1072
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,330
participate in
a college comedy contest.

1073
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,600
- Right.
- Yesterday, I went home,

1074
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,880
and I joked around with my mom,

1075
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,080
and I got spanked again.

1076
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,710
As I entered, I sang this.

1077
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,120
- Excuse, excuse, excuse me
- Excuse me

1078
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,150
- Are you the famous Fan Guru?
- Are you the famous Fan Guru?

1079
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,250
- Who can exactly tell the future?
- Who can exactly tell the future?

1080
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,620
I got a slap
in the back of my head again.

1081
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,980
You should've danced
this diamond step dance.

1082
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,080
- Exactly. That's essential.
- Like this.

1083
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,790
- You can't miss it.
- Like this.

1084
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,130
This is killing me, you know.

1085
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,560
My mother just doesn't understand...

1086
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,170
- the dream I have.
- Tell me about it.

1087
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,400
- Unbelievable.
- Gosh.

1088
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,100
Who are those guys over there?

1089
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,940
Who are they?

1090
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,440
- Hey, you.
- Who are those guys?

1091
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,100
Check out that guy.

1092
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,650
Is he trying to be Michael Jackson?
I'm impressed.

1093
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,440
They both look great.

1094
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,350
Only a nutjob
would dress like that for no reason.

1095
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,580
- He looks great though.
- Only a true nutter...

1096
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,710
would dress like that for no reason.

1097
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,020
He took the theme too seriously.

1098
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,190
I hear he mistook today's theme.

1099
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,630
How have you been?

1100
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,960
- Jong Kook, have you been well?
- Hold on.

1101
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,350
I'm sorry to ask this,

1102
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,020
but did you mistake
next week's theme for this week's?

1103
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,900
- Are you sure that's not it?
- It's a bit too much.

1104
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,870
Beat it!

1105
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,730
His stylist got slapped
in the restroom just now.

1106
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,600
You're dressed for
next week's theme, right?

1107
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,310
Why aren't you dressed
for the occasion today?

1108
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,880
Why? This is what people wore
in the 1990s.

1109
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,580
- Isn't this from last week?
- Of course not.

1110
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,020
You're mistaken.

1111
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,350
This is like the clothes
you usually wear.

1112
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,150
What I usually wear?
Don't be mistaken.

1113
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,480
- We're the entering class of 1991.
- You, my friend.

1114
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,520
I'm sorry to have to say this,

1115
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,650
but you should go home.

1116
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,920
- It's just weird.
- What's with you today?

1117
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,130
You got it all wrong.

1118
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,630
Are you coming back from a funeral?

1119
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,330
Why are you dressed this way?

1120
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,290
Anyway, where are our minions?

1121
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,770
- I wasn't going to say this but...
- Unbelievable.

1122
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,210
Whenever we talk about our style,

1123
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,540
he immediately
changes the subject...

1124
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,400
and suggests that we move along.

1125
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,900
Kwang Soo, let him have
something you're wearing.

1126
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,270
Why are you dressed this way?

1127
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,940
- Let's enjoy our trip.
- What trip?

1128
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,120
We're all travelers, aren't we?

1129
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,650
Just dance, why don't you?

1130
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,690
Did you hear the news?

1131
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,290
We won't be changing out
of our outfits today.

1132
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,880
(It's a day without
matching team shirts.)

1133
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,330
It'll be awkward for me all day.

1134
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,190
Hey, Long Legs. What's your dream?

1135
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,960
A fashion designer.

1136
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,100
Go ahead, sir.

1137
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,790
(Coming through)

1138
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,870
Bye.

1139
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,540
That was my uncle.

1140
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,630
He's not even acknowledging us
makes it more humiliating.

1141
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,540
Why didn't you tell me
someone one coming?

1142
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,580
- You should've told me.
- Not even the staff said anything.

1143
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,210
My vision on this side is impaired.

1144
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,170
- Here.
- A fashion designer?

1145
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,250
- You must be studying fashion.
- I see.

1146
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,350
What about you?

1147
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,040
- Us?
- What's your dream?

1148
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,210
- The Campus Comedy Contest.
- That's what we'll enter.

1149
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,960
Why you though?

1150
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,480
Me?

1151
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,980
Meanwhile, a comedy contest
seems fitting for you.

1152
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,150
Watch your mouth.

1153
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,750
- Me?
- Aren't you already a comedian?

1154
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,920
No, I'm not.

1155
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,960
We came up with
quite the catchphrase, you know.

1156
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,500
Anyway, let's get going.

1157
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,730
- You...
- We'll jump on the count of three.

1158
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,170
1, 2, 3.

1159
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,270
(One, two, three, jump!)

1160
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,500
Why haven't we transported?

1161
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,650
(That's hilarious!)

1162
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,940
- Unbelievable.
- I love...

1163
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,750
that we'll be in these characters
for the rest of the day.

1164
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,270
Is this
how it should be done though?

1165
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,310
(While the 4 unique young men
make an introduction...)

1166
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,980
I haven't been to a place like this
in a while.

1167
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,080
(A coffeehouse in Euljiro)

1168
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,310
It's a first for me.

1169
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,480
- I smell ssanghwacha.
- Exactly.

1170
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,650
- I can smell that too.
- The scent of ssanghwacha.

1171
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,420
Ji Hyo, you look pretty today.

1172
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,790
Are you making fun of me?

1173
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,420
When did I ever tease you?

1174
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,630
Please don't punch me again.

1175
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,060
Again?

1176
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,540
Did you say "Again?"

1177
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,710
Why would you say that?

1178
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,100
Will you punch me again?

1179
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,440
How about a ssanghwacha
with an egg yolk?

1180
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,940
Are you supposed to pop the yolk...

1181
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,670
or just eat the whole thing?

1182
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,810
The yolk.

1183
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,880
I'm not that old, you know.

1184
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,250
I wasn't born in the 1970s.

1185
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,580
(Her purple eyelids say otherwise.)

1186
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,650
- You seemed to know things.
- I...

1187
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,810
Do you swallow the yolk as is...

1188
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,750
or pop it and swirl?

1189
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,830
You're supposed
to eat the yolk as is?

1190
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,960
It's bland though, so why would you?

1191
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,330
You're here on a blind date.

1192
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,420
A blind date?

1193
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,290
Am I here for a laugh then?

1194
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,230
I'll be the one they avoid.

1195
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,440
(I'll be the one they avoid.)

1196
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,480
Who will our blind dates be?

1197
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,310
(Who will our blind dates be?)

1198
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,710
I should look like a lady today.

1199
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,770
A well-behaved lady.

1200
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,850
I hope they don't see me
as someone odd.

1201
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,650
Order something on the menu...

1202
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,810
if you like one of them.

1203
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,980
(Lemonade, Plum Juice,
Iced Coffee, Ssanghwacha...)

1204
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,850
In my case,

1205
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,150
if I like someone,

1206
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,350
I'll order an iced coffee.

1207
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,560
And if I don't like anyone,

1208
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,900
I'll order a ssanghwacha.

1209
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,290
I'll order...

1210
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,770
a ssanghwacha with an egg yolk...

1211
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,230
if I absolutely loathe the guys.

1212
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,730
- All right.
- Right.

1213
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,500
I'll order iced kudzu juice.

1214
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,000
Iced kudzu juice.

1215
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,380
Always so feeble.

1216
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,810
Where's your energy?

1217
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,850
Is that so?

1218
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,210
I hear their voices.

1219
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,120
Their voices...

1220
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,290
(Their voices sound familiar.)

1221
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,020
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

1222
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,580
(Could it be...)

1223
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,330
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

1224
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,730
(Jae Suk, an aspiring comedian)

1225
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,850
Hello.

1226
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,670
Goodness. May I ask
who you guys are?

1227
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:52,960
Well...

1228
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,440
(Likewise...)

1229
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
Wait.

1230
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,230
Are you the owner?

1231
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,130
Is she the owner?

1232
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,310
Please have a seat.

1233
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,080
You seem overly dressed
for the occasion.

1234
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,080
- I...
- I'm sorry to ask this,

1235
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,170
but what happened to your eyes?

1236
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,080
(Sighing)

1237
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,040
- Are they bruised?
- Of course not.

1238
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,250
It's as if someone punched you.

1239
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,650
- That's absurd.
- Hello.

1240
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,040
- It's a pleasure.
- Hi.

1241
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,020
- Hello.
- My friend here was born in 1966.

1242
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,560
- Really?
- In 1966?

1243
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,520
That's right. I was born in 1966.

1244
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,100
You see, from what I can tell...

1245
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,520
- I took some time off.
- You see,

1246
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,270
something came up for the friend
who was supposed to be here,

1247
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,540
and he was the only one...

1248
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,400
who I could reach
before coming here.

1249
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,400
- I see.
- Well,

1250
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,710
in my case...

1251
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,380
- He's married.
- What? No, I'm not!

1252
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,880
What are you talking about?

1253
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,580
- Today...
- I'm not married.

1254
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,880
I mean it. I'm a man...

1255
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,850
- looking for a fairy tale love.
- I see.

1256
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,920
Anyway, you see...

1257
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,420
This is called
a denim jacket, right?

1258
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,060
He has zero fashion sense.

1259
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,520
We hate it when women whisper.

1260
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,150
- You...
- Isn't that a bit rude?

1261
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,520
- To be honest...
- He's wearing socks with dots.

1262
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,350
I'm sorry to ask you this,

1263
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,600
but what's with the handkerchief?

1264
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,920
What's with the handkerchief?

1265
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,440
(The handkerchief
makes her seem cheesy.)

1266
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,670
I mean...

1267
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,040
- She's trying to be ladylike.
- This is killing me.

1268
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:06,770
Unbelievable.

1269
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,210
Is it okay to leave?

1270
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,210
- Sit back down, will you?
- Unbelievable.

1271
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,710
I can't take this.

1272
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,100
Sit back down.

1273
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,210
This is exactly the type I hate.

1274
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,420
There's no need to ruin the mood.

1275
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,350
- So...
- Anyway...

1276
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:19,980
Are you Song Ji Hyo?

1277
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,120
Me? Yes, that's my name.

1278
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,350
- Right?
- Yes.

1279
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,750
He's Ji Seok Sam.

1280
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,130
- Seok Sam?
- Seok Sam.

1281
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,690
Seok Sam born in 1966.

1282
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,420
Can I call you Seok Sam, then?

1283
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,690
No, no.

1284
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,270
- You should call him "mister."
- Mister?

1285
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,600
How can you call him by his name...

1286
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,670
- when there's a huge age gap?
- Hold on.

1287
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,500
How old are you guys? Darn it.

1288
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,230
(To Seok Sam who wanted
to be seen as young)

1289
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,540
What was that for?

1290
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,850
You should be more formal
considering the age gap.

1291
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,440
Were you born in 1970?

1292
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,080
In 1975, actually.

1293
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,520
In 1975?

1294
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,650
- Then...
- 1975?

1295
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,350
Does that make sense?

1296
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:55,080
It's 1991, so that means
you're in middle school.

1297
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,520
(That means
you're in middle school.)

1298
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,290
Something isn't right.

1299
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,330
Sorry about that.
I was actually born in 1965.

1300
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,850
1965? Then you're older than me.

1301
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,600
Gosh, I'm sorry about that.

1302
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,370
Say you were born in 1972 or 1973.

1303
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,130
- 1973.
- 1972 seems about right.

1304
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,770
- 1972?
- Yes, 1972.

1305
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,100
What do you major in?

1306
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,230
I study food and nutrition.

1307
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,100
- Food and nutrition?
- Yes.

1308
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,850
(Even her major sounds cheesy now.)

1309
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,210
What about you, Ji Hyo?

1310
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,770
I study fashion design.

1311
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:22,980
Fashion design?

1312
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,020
You never got into college.

1313
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,850
- Why are you whispering?
- Sorry about that.

1314
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,080
Why are you two whispering?

1315
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,150
- You two...
- She told me...

1316
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,790
that I don't go to college.

1317
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,980
I didn't mean it like that.

1318
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,080
- Wait.
- Hold on.

1319
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,400
Are you lying to us?

1320
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,190
- It's not like that.
- Only So Min's in college then?

1321
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,650
Ji Hyo, why didn't you...

1322
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,520
Not going to college
isn't a crime, but still.

1323
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,730
You see, she...

1324
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,900
I'm getting ready
for the Miss Korea contest.

1325
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,100
The Miss Korea contest?

1326
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,130
- Really?
- Yes.

1327
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,270
Wait.

1328
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,400
- The Miss Korea contest?
- Contestants these days...

1329
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,500
all seem to have
these puffy hairstyles.

1330
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,670
Like a lion's mane. What is it?

1331
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,620
You're bad at these sketches.

1332
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,750
I'm a master at them.

1333
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,210
It's not like you're any better.

1334
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,650
You should make it seem
more natural.

1335
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,080
- It was natural enough.
- He was always bad at these.

1336
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,420
He was terrible at these sketches.

1337
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,580
I'm sorry to interrupt,

1338
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,230
but why don't we order some drinks?

1339
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,730
- Of course.
- Something to drink?

1340
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,850
What would you like?

1341
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:12,630
(A few minutes ago)

1342
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,100
(If I like someone,
I'll order an iced coffee.)

1343
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,330
(And if I don't like anyone,
I'll order a ssanghwacha.)

1344
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:22,440
Can I have an iced coffee?

1345
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,880
(I'll have an iced coffee.)

1346
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:26,500
- An iced coffee?
- Yes.

1347
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,170
Me too. Could I have...

1348
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,380
an iced coffee
that's not too strong?

1349
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,440
Could I perhaps order a parfait?

1350
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,350
(Which of the two does she like?)

1351
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,120
- Black coffee?
- Yes, that'd be nice.

1352
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,420
- Both of you?
- A mild iced coffee for me.

1353
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,850
- Same here.
- Right.

1354
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,000
I'll have iced kudzu juice, please.

1355
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,560
That'd be nice.

1356
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,870
He's one to worry about
his health, you see.

1357
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,560
You should drink
something healthier too.

1358
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,940
So three glasses of iced coffee?

1359
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,000
- Yes, me too.
- Don't read too much into this,

1360
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,230
but I own a car.

1361
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,210
I own a car.

1362
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,270
- Unbelievable.
- I'll have an iced coffee!

1363
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,670
- An iced coffee.
- I own a car.

1364
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,750
With sugar, please.

1365
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,000
- You can't...
- Coffee with sugar?

1366
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,310
Do you perhaps know
what this bell is?

1367
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,150
- What is it?
- What is this?

1368
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,290
Well,

1369
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,810
it brings you luck.

1370
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,810
Ringing this bell...

1371
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,580
You know what they say, right?

1372
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,020
Have you had your first kiss?

1373
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,520
(Have you had your first kiss?)

1374
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,230
(They're lost for words
at her abrupt question.)

1375
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,520
Hold on a second.

1376
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,130
- Unbelievable.
- I can't take this anymore.

1377
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,960
- This...
- Can you believe it?

1378
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,500
I mean...

1379
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,060
- You're killing me.
- Ji Hyo's...

1380
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,370
not that cheesy,

1381
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,500
but So Min's a bit too much.

1382
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,710
- Hold on.
- Unbelievable.

1383
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,150
Which character
are you playing today?

1384
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,170
Why do you keep
holding up your handkerchief?

1385
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,210
You'll give your nose a rash.

1386
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,620
- Here we go.
- Here are your drinks.

1387
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,750
Thank you, ma'am.

1388
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,880
This is the kudzu juice.
How did you know?

1389
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,380
I could tell by the color.

1390
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,750
I'd love to listen to some songs
by Sunflower.

1391
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,830
You know Sunflower, right?

1392
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,480
Why don't you sing one yourself?

1393
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,830
(She immediately cuts him off.)

1394
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,420
- You want me to sing?
- You said you wanted to...

1395
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,900
listen to a song by Sunflower,

1396
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,440
and she responded by
telling you to sing one.

1397
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,130
Don't you offer music
to your customers?

1398
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,770
Sunflower.

1399
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,040
(Even the generous owner
knows how to clear a bomb.)

1400
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,900
He only said he wanted
to listen to their song.

1401
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,270
"Why don't you sing one instead?"

1402
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,440
Hilarious, right?

1403
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,580
(Just then)

1404
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,750
- Hello.
- Goodness, who is it?

1405
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,710
- My gosh.
- What's going on?

1406
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,920
What on earth?

1407
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,690
What are you wearing?

1408
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,790
- What's going on?
- Who are these thugs?

1409
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,400
- What is he, Gen X?
- Look at them.

1410
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,900
What's going on?

1411
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,900
Look at these delinquents.

1412
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,500
Why is he dressed
like Michael Jackson?

1413
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,290
- Hey.
- Are you Michael Jackson?

1414
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,870
Did you go to a funeral
or something?

1415
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,170
(We are the 4 fashion kings.)

1416
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,770
- My goodness.
- What is this?

1417
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:36,630
- What's happening?
- Who are they?

1418
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,940
Look at his sunglasses. My gosh.

1419
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,670
We're here for a blind date.

1420
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:43,020
Hold on. You look like my aunt.

1421
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,580
- What? Gosh, she scared me!
- She scared me.

1422
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:46,790
- You're not...
- What do you mean by aunt?

1423
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,310
- That's not the 1990s style.
- Hey!

1424
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,960
Why are you insulting my girlfriend?

1425
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,480
- She's your girlfriend?
- Yes.

1426
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,920
Wait. How dare he yell at me?

1427
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,520
- What does he mean by aunt?
- Why are you yelling at me?

1428
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,350
Why are you yelling at me?

1429
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,790
- Suk Jin.
- Why are you yelling at me?

1430
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,560
- You need a beating.
- Get up.

1431
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,130
I'm serious.

1432
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,560
- What do you think you're doing?
- Suk Jin.

1433
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,830
- He's the worst at doing skits.
- Hey!

1434
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:05,940
- How dare you yell at me?
- He's picking a fight with me.

1435
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,000
He deserves a beating.

1436
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,080
- Why would you yell?
- I'm seeing him...

1437
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,210
- for the first time.
- I didn't yell at you.

1438
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,630
Please make him come to his senses.

1439
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,600
I guess the one in the yellow cap
isn't popular.

1440
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,980
- No, that's not true.
- Oh, you mean him?

1441
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,850
- He's not popular at all.
- You must not be popular.

1442
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,580
She keeps hitting on me,

1443
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,350
but I'm pushing her away.

1444
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,710
- Then she's...
- I clearly...

1445
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:21,980
She's the one who is into you?

1446
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:25,650
- She blatantly chose me,
- Really?

1447
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:26,920
- so she...
- Maybe she will...

1448
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,060
stay in character
until she gets home.

1449
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,420
- Look how tacky her clothes are.
- You're the ugliest one here.

1450
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,830
- That's not it.
- Wake up, will you?

1451
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,330
- That's not it.
- She keeps hitting on me.

1452
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,230
I'm sorry, but don't you think...

1453
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,130
he's too into his character
all of a sudden?

1454
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,370
- But...
- Isn't that too sudden?

1455
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,500
This is driving me crazy!

1456
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,400
I think he picked
the wrong character.

1457
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,650
- That's not it.
- All of a sudden...

1458
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,650
You must be the chief mourner.

1459
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,540
You're the chief mourner, right?

1460
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,350
I hate how his stomach
is sticking out.

1461
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,190
You should say something.

1462
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,630
- Why don't you talk?
- Say something, Michael Jackson!

1463
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,650
He's pretending he didn't hear us.

1464
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,650
His head is too big
compared to his body.

1465
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,600
I love that
he's playing Michael Jackson.

1466
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,960
What? Is he going to dance?

1467
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,270
He's dancing out of the blue.

1468
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,170
He's dancing out of the blue!
Beat it!

1469
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,440
(Michael Jackson is in Euljiro!)

1470
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,600
- He's good.
- His belly is so plump.

1471
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,540
His belly is so plump.

1472
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,150
(The king of pop has a plump belly.)

1473
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,770
His belly is so plump.

1474
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:20,900
What's that?

1475
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,310
- Mister!
- His belly is...

1476
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:23,920
Mr. Michael Jackson!

1477
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,810
- His belly is...
- What's with his belly?

1478
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,190
He keeps doing that dance.

1479
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:30,880
- What's with your belly?
- Say something!

1480
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,750
- We're supposed to be in the 1990s.
- But why...

1481
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,630
Why did you make me
dress like this alone?

1482
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:35,900
Wasn't Michael Jackson
more active in the 1980s?

1483
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,000
So why are you dressed like this?

1484
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,730
- Why did you make me do this?
- Why did he dress like that?

1485
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,690
- We didn't suggest the concept.
- By the way,

1486
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,060
you were on "Master in the House."

1487
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:44,400
Why are you bringing that up?

1488
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,670
- Out of nowhere?
- Hey.

1489
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,100
- We're doing a skit!
- I mean...

1490
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,170
- We're in the 1990s!
- We're doing a skit!

1491
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,580
- Don't bring that up!
- Aren't we in the 1990s?

1492
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,400
- What is "Master in the House?"
- I was okay with everything,

1493
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,440
but when he was asked
how he held out...

1494
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,810
in the entertainment industry
for so long,

1495
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:58,420
he said
his positive attitude helped.

1496
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,040
(But on Running Man,
he's the most critical member.)

1497
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,120
That's...

1498
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,960
(I try to find even the smallest
aspect that might be positive.)

1499
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,230
(Master Kim lectured on the belief
that's the opposite of his life.)

1500
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,330
- I was like...
- Wait a minute.

1501
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,630
I was okay with everything,

1502
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,770
- but he went on about positivity.
- Wait a minute.

1503
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,670
You can't talk about what we've
been up to all of a sudden.

1504
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:19,330
- We're in the 1990s!
- Positive attitude?

1505
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,710
Yes! Don't you know
how positive I am?

1506
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,880
- Positive attitude?
- I am where I am...

1507
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,440
thanks to my positive attitude.

1508
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,770
That was just...

1509
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,440
Are we not sticking to our concept?
I'll take off my hat otherwise.

1510
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,580
- No, don't.
- Don't take it off.

1511
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,120
- Don't take it off.
- You should stick to it.

1512
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,190
It's so difficult.

1513
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,850
Back when I was in college,

1514
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:39,480
areas such as
Euljiro and Myeong-dong...

1515
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,500
were nearby.

1516
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,060
I've been to this area a lot.

1517
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:46,400
This area is really popular
these days.

1518
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,290
Yes, it is because it's unique.

1519
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,900
- Metro...
- Euljiro is...

1520
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,210
Sorry, but it's not metro.
It's retro.

1521
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,540
It's not "metro."

1522
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,310
I was just kidding!

1523
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,980
- You were kidding, right?
- Of course!

1524
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,980
- Goodness.
- He's so funny!

1525
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,250
He's funny.

1526
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,380
It was really funny.

1527
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,480
I didn't know he was this ignorant.

1528
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,480
Just stay still
if you don't know anything.

1529
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,750
I should've restrained myself,
but I just blurted it out.

1530
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,920
I feel the same way.

1531
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,250
But how could he confuse it
with "metro?"

1532
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,130
We're supposed to be in 1991.

1533
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,850
How old were you?
Weren't you in middle school?

1534
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:14,900
What did you say?

1535
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,690
- Since it's in the 1990s...
- How old were you?

1536
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:17,960
- He was 5.
- I was 5.

1537
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,960
- I was five years old.
- I was in middle school.

1538
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,100
- I was in middle school.
- You were in middle school?

1539
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,270
- That's as good as being an adult.
- Right.

1540
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,600
- My heyday was in middle school.
- He looked like this.

1541
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,710
Suk Jin was 26.

1542
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,900
- What?
- I was...

1543
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,080
I was discharged
from the military in 1990.

1544
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,750
- We are almost 20 years apart.
- I was 26.

1545
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,770
You were 26?

1546
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:35,980
He was 26 years old.

1547
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,170
In 1991,

1548
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:38,940
I released a song.

1549
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,210
- Yes, you did.
- Right?

1550
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,350
- Wasn't that in 1992?
- So you and I...

1551
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,560
Oh, it was when I was
recording my songs...

1552
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,790
to make my debut.

1553
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,750
I met him before my debut
as a singer.

1554
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,480
- At Yong Man's place,
- Since I'm friends with Yong Man.

1555
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,400
he played an LP album
of his friend called Ji Suk Jin.

1556
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,020
He told me Suk Jin is making
his debut as a singer.

1557
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,400
Yong Min wanted me
to listen to his songs with him...

1558
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,330
as he was coming with his album.

1559
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,330
His album?

1560
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:58,940
And he actually commented
on my songs.

1561
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,940
I did.

1562
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,600
So I told him,

1563
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,480
"Your songs are too listless."

1564
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,670
- You said that?
- Do you remember?

1565
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,040
- For real?
- I actually...

1566
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,520
- You weren't trying to be funny?
- No, I wasn't.

1567
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,850
The chorus wasn't as upbeat
as I thought it'd be.

1568
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,920
- I'm not good with the chorus part.
- It wasn't impressive.

1569
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,750
But my strong aspects...

1570
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,960
were my voice color
and singing techniques.

1571
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,190
Back in my days, we'd go on
blind dates in Jongno 2-ga.

1572
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Have you heard of...

1573
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,730
- Five Cent House on Jongno 2-ga?
- No, never.

1574
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,020
I think I've heard of it.

1575
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,130
- Of course.
- Everything cost five cents.

1576
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,000
Oh, right. I forgot
that Michael Jackson was with us.

1577
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,130
Join us in our conversation!

1578
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:34,560
Michael! He's very resolute.

1579
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,040
He can't join our conversation
because of his concept.

1580
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,980
- Hey, you are...
- "Give me some chocolate!"

1581
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:42,270
- "Give me some chocolate!"
- Why did you dress like this?

1582
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,380
I was told to dress like this.

1583
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,310
- He's not talking much.
- Why did you dress like this?

1584
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:47,480
He's not talking
because he's dispirited.

1585
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,850
I thought everyone would dress up
like pop stars, such as MC Hammer.

1586
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,020
- MC Hammer?
- Yes.

1587
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,790
Why did they make Haha
dress like this alone?

1588
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,520
1991 was the heyday...

1589
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,730
- of Michael Jackson.
- He was the best.

1590
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,290
- Was it his heyday?
- He was the best.

1591
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:02,560
Didn't you say you went to
his concert when he came to Korea?

1592
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,830
- It was in 1999.
- I went to his concert too.

1593
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,000
- Oh, it was in 1999?
- It was in the Olympic Stadium.

1594
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,480
He was in a spacecraft.

1595
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,270
He jumped onto the stage
out of nowhere.

1596
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,600
- He jumped onto the stage, and...
- He stood like this for a minute.

1597
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,310
- It was longer than a minute.
- That was in Korea?

1598
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,440
It was longer than a minute.

1599
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,810
- He stood like this.
- Just like Haha.

1600
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,440
- That's it!
- Isn't he Michael Jackson?

1601
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,810
He'd stare in that direction
for 10 to 15 seconds.

1602
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:21,880
It was longer than a minute.

1603
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,190
- Then he'd turn to the other side.
- Then he turned to the other side.

1604
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,920
I remember it now.

1605
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,630
The crowd went crazy.

1606
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:33,730
He's so ugly.

1607
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,500
- I remember it now.
- Right? I remember it too.

1608
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,770
- I remember it.
- Look. What's wrong with him?

1609
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,400
- It was crazy.
- Of course.

1610
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,130
He'd go around the stadium
on a crane.

1611
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,000
I saw how some people
passed out during his concert.

1612
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,580
- Yes, they did.
- Please keep quiet.

1613
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,880
Don't you remember that?

1614
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,100
- Stop it! Stop!
- Actually, they didn't pass out.

1615
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,770
- They were taken to the hospital.
- No, no.

1616
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,920
- That's enough.
- That was New Kids on the Block.

1617
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,020
It was another concert.

1618
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,880
When New Kids on the Block
performed in Korea,

1619
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,520
there were many comedy shows.

1620
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,350
- We were called Sidewalk Blocks.
- With Yong Man...

1621
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,560
- Seung Kyung, and me.
- It was your best days.

1622
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,420
We came up with these skits...

1623
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,040
You know how horrible
your dance was, right?

1624
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,170
- I mean...
- You were even off the beat.

1625
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,460
No, I often went
in the wrong direction.

1626
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,810
When everyone went
to their right, I went to the left.

1627
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,210
- He was...
- Why did you do that?

1628
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,630
- It's because...
- I was too nervous.

1629
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:17,810
- I mean...
- I was so nervous.

1630
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,150
- I was so nervous.
- My gosh.

1631
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,150
I was so nervous.

1632
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,650
(Jae Suk in 1991,
when he was 20 years old)

1633
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,440
(Struggling)

1634
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,880
(He's the only one who's excited.)

1635
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,060
(He ruined the performance
because he was nervous.)

1636
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,460
(He became pale
as he was too nervous.)

1637
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,920
(He suddenly became timid.)

1638
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,770
(Then he suddenly showed
his signature dance.)

1639
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,980
(He was left with many regrets
in his 20s.)

1640
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:52,100
- I was nervous in front of cameras.
- When does it get better though?

1641
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,100
Because of stage fright,
I was really nervous.

1642
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,250
And I completely
forgot all the moves.

1643
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,850
We talked so long
about our old days.

1644
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:00,480
- I'm sure there's a lot to share.
- We do.

1645
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,710
But since we're taking a trip down
memory lane to 30 years ago,

1646
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:06,190
you'll be a senior
who entered college in 1991.

1647
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,790
You're to introduce the culture
of the 1990s...

1648
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,250
that has become popular
to your juniors, the viewers.

1649
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,290
All right.

1650
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,870
As we're going back to 30 years ago,

1651
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,900
we've prepared 20 popular items
from the 1990s.

1652
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:19,960
- Really?
- That sounds like fun.

1653
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,900
If you don't collect all the items
by the end of the race,

1654
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,880
we'll determine
who'll get the penalty...

1655
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,040
by the number of items you missed.

1656
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,980
(If they can't find 3 items...)

1657
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,790
(Pencil sharpener, vintage doll,
robot puppy, comic book set)

1658
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,190
(The ones with the lowest number of
items will get the penalty.)

1659
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:38,060
(Penalty)

1660
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,850
All right. Before we begin
the main mission,

1661
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:45,020
let's play a simple game
to determine who'll get the items.

1662
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:49,190
The members of the winning team
will win the items.

1663
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,270
That means, when you go
to a certain spot,

1664
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:54,330
you'll play a mission to determine
who'll get the items.

1665
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,670
You'll only find out
after playing the mission.

1666
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,040
(Only 2 people will be
receiving 2 gifts.)

1667
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,100
Here are the 20 hot items
that we prepared.

1668
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,250
- What is it?
- Let me see.

1669
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,750
Pencil sharpener?

1670
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,710
- Oh, so that's a map.
- It's a map.

1671
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:07,020
My gosh.
I know that this is still sold.

1672
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,250
- I have that at home.
- Right?

1673
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,980
- What?
- It looks like a train.

1674
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,560
- I have it.
- They still sell these.

1675
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,630
We used to hide money
in the pencil shavings.

1676
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,190
They still sell this.

1677
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,020
- There's a pager.
- Look, a pager.

1678
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,230
There's a pager.

1679
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,130
I remember that candy.

1680
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,830
Of course. My grandma had them too.

1681
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,130
That's right.

1682
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:24,960
Taxi drivers used to...

1683
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,060
- keep coins in them.
- That's right.

1684
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,630
I can't see
those candies these days.

1685
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,710
This is the bottle
for Del Monte orange juice.

1686
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,500
- You're right.
- The ones we can recycle.

1687
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,810
- Yes, the orange juice.
- We kept reusing them for tea.

1688
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:34,810
That's right.

1689
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,980
We used to put barley tea
in that glass bottle.

1690
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,350
- I know.
- It was delicious.

1691
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,940
So today, you'll be taking...

1692
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,350
those few items with you.

1693
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,250
It looks so cool.

1694
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,790
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

1695
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:47,830
The phone is ringing.

1696
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:51,350
(Right then,
the phone starts to ring.)

1697
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,190
The ugliest guest of...

1698
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:55,600
the entering class of 1991
got a phone call.

1699
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,060
- He's already standing up.
- Hey.

1700
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,290
Don't be like that.

1701
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,600
How did you know they'd call you?

1702
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,670
- Wait.
- He's up.

1703
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,940
- Gosh, I'm dumbfounded.
- If it wasn't for you,

1704
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:02,980
then it would've been for Se Chan.

1705
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,710
This is how we'd call people
back when we used pagers.

1706
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:05,850
The owner would call for you.

1707
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:07,080
- The owner did?
- So the owner...

1708
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,620
connected me to the person
I wanted to talk to.

1709
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,440
My mom used to tell me
the same thing.

1710
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,480
Hello.

1711
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,790
Here's the first mission
to win the items.

1712
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,850
- Okay.
- Each of you will play a quiz,

1713
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:18,190
and the winning members
will get the gifts.

1714
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:20,520
The challenger will listen
to the question,

1715
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,250
and say the answer
into the receiver.

1716
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,690
- My gosh.
- Into the receiver?

1717
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,900
Anyway, this is
a competition, right?

1718
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,290
Will the quiz be about the 1990s?

1719
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:28,500
We don't know the answer at all.

1720
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,100
It's related to the 1990s.

1721
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,460
(The first question
the ugliest guy is answering)

1722
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,810
- Hello?
- Hi.

1723
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,600
Listen to the song being played,
and tell us its singer and title.

1724
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,000
- This is difficult.
- Is it for Jae Suk?

1725
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,580
- It's for Jae Suk.
- It's his question.

1726
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,420
- I think he knows every song.
- There will be a penalty.

1727
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,540
I think he will know.

1728
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:52,790
(Tell us the title and singer
of the song.)

1729
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,060
- Hold on.
- I know this song,

1730
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:57,190
- but I can't remember.
- My heart is already beating fast.

1731
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:00,100
(The prelude that makes your heart
beat fast)

1732
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,460
Oh, I know this song.

1733
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:02,940
I need to listen to it first.

1734
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,100
(Who sang this song
and what's the title?)

1735
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,000
(They're familiar with the melody,
but they can't remember the title.)

1736
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,670
I can't remember this song.

1737
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,580
Can we not hear the lyrics?

1738
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,770
I know this song.

1739
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:14,900
All right, guess the answer.

1740
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,620
I can't guess the answer
based on this.

1741
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,520
- It's a song from 1991.
- How can you not know this?

1742
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,380
I'm familiar with the melody,
but I have to listen to the lyrics.

1743
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,190
- I don't think it's a famous song.
- Me neither.

1744
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,920
- No, it's famous.
- How come you don't know this?

1745
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,290
(Se Chan and Kwang Soo
already know the answer.)

1746
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:31,150
(What's Jae Suk's answer?)

1747
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,520
I have no idea.

1748
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,190
All right. Let us play the answer.

1749
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,900
- What is it?
- We don't know this song.

1750
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,130
It's Lee Moon Sae's song.

1751
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,670
- Right, it's Lee Moon Sae's song.
- Yes, it's Lee Moon Sae's song.

1752
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,000
- No, it's not his song.
- It's in his seventh album.

1753
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,810
- It's not "Gwanghwamun Love Song."
- It was right there.

1754
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:47,040
It's not "When I Stand Under
the Shade of Roadside Tree."

1755
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,540
I'm familiar with the melody, but...

1756
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,270
I know all of Lee Moon Sae's songs.

1757
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,080
What's this song called?

1758
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,190
It's "Old People."

1759
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,650
- Are you sure?
- Isn't it "Old Love?"

1760
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,630
- It's "Old Love."
- It's "Old Love."

1761
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:01,250
I see, it's "Old Love."

1762
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:12,270
Michael Jackson!
Don't perform right now!

1763
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,810
- Hey!
- It's Moon Sae!

1764
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,000
- I look like him, right?
- You look like Moon Sae.

1765
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,170
- They're very similar.
- They look alike.

1766
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:21,850
It's like Moon Sae
dressed up as Michael Jackson.

1767
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,310
- Moon Sae is...
- It was Moon Sae's song.

1768
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:26,250
- That was really close.
- Jae Suk,

1769
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,440
lift the phone again.

1770
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,580
- That was really close.
- He's playing again?

1771
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,460
- It's worth trying.
- Of course.

1772
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,980
I can't guess the title
based on the prelude.

1773
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,880
Jae Suk, you failed. Please pass it
to the next ugliest person.

1774
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,020
My goodness.

1775
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,520
- Here.
- You picked me?

1776
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,630
It's Suk Jin.

1777
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,100
- It's not me.
- No, no.

1778
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,900
He passed the phone to Suk Jin.

1779
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,960
- This doesn't make any sense.
- I mean...

1780
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,400
- Hey, you should've picked him!
- You are...

1781
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,540
- Do you think you're handsome?
- Very much so.

1782
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,540
- What are you talking about?
- My gosh.

1783
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,580
Okay. Let's do this.

1784
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,650
It's disturbing that you think
you're handsome.

1785
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,580
(Here we go.)

1786
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,210
I'm sorry.
I need to use the bathroom.

1787
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,150
He's such a nuisance.

1788
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,080
- Why can't I go?
- He's playing!

1789
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,920
It's not like I'm going to play.

1790
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,750
- You need to do your job.
- That's true, but...

1791
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:08,150
- My gosh.
- Then do you want me to...

1792
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,000
relieve myself here?

1793
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,650
- Sir!
- How can you say it like that?

1794
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:13,190
- I'm sorry.
- Sir.

1795
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,730
You need to be more positive.

1796
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:15,770
(Positive attitude)

1797
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:16,940
Please stay.

1798
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,100
- That's how you last long.
- That's his secret to success.

1799
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,730
- Got it?
- Okay, I got it.

1800
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,730
- You need to be positive, okay?
- Yes, I got it.

1801
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,770
- Positive, positive!
- Positive!

1802
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,500
- Okay.
- I'll get this. Watch me.

1803
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,310
Suk Jin, listen to the sound
we're about to play carefully...

1804
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:32,650
and guess the name
of the product of the ad.

1805
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,350
- This is...
- I think it'll be easy.

1806
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:36,120
You should've given me
this question.

1807
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,730
- Play the sound.
- I don't know ads from the 1990s.

1808
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:40,630
Everyone!

1809
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,900
(The background music
sounds like a carol.)

1810
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,190
- Everyone!
- Of course I know this!

1811
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:47,020
- I got it right away.
- I know this.

1812
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:49,400
(Everyone, I hope
you become prosperous.)

1813
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,100
- I hope you become prosperous.
- Of course I know this!

1814
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,730
You should've...

1815
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:55,060
- We know this too.
- You should've given this to me.

1816
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,630
We know this too.

1817
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:58,170
- I have to name the product?
- Yes, you need to name it.

1818
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,310
You need to tell us the brand.

1819
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:00,380
You want me to tell you
the brand of this ad?

1820
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,620
It's an ad for
a credit card company.

1821
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,350
- This is...
- Two...

1822
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:29,250
Samsung Card.

1823
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,250
- My goodness.
- Isn't it a credit card ad?

1824
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,650
It's an ad for a bank.

1825
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:33,860
Isn't his answer close?

1826
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,880
- I hope you become prosperous.
- It's really famous.

1827
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,150
"I really hope so!"

1828
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,650
I really hope so!

1829
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,820
The company that's considerate
of your finances, BC Card.

1830
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:42,920
That's right!

1831
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,770
- It was a BC Card ad.
- I remember it now.

1832
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:46,730
You should've given me
this question.

1833
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:47,770
- I could've gotten this right.
- Please pass the phone...

1834
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:48,900
to the next ugliest person.

1835
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,880
- Here you go, Se Chan!
- It can't be helped.

1836
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,480
- Jong Kook, it's you.
- It can't be helped.

1837
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,980
(Jong Kook, it's you.)

1838
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,880
- No, it can't be Jong Kook.
- Why not?

1839
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,050
(They try to stop Suk Jin
who seems overly excited.)

1840
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,710
- It's okay.
- No, that's not okay.

1841
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,340
- You need to be positive.
- You're not supposed to go next.

1842
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,780
- You're not the next one.
- Are you not in a good mood?

1843
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,610
- I am, since I'm positive.
- You're next.

1844
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:04,880
- It's you.
- Me? Okay.

1845
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,710
You're uglier than Jae Suk
in some sense.

1846
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,420
Oh, really? That's fine too.

1847
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,420
- You're okay?
- Yes, I'm very positive.

1848
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,320
Nobody can stop him
from being positive.

1849
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,860
- I see.
- But his face turned red.

1850
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:14,900
Sit down.

1851
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,670
I'll play this with a positive mind.

1852
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:20,400
There are three people
who are uglier than me.

1853
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:22,130
You see?

1854
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,340
1, 2, 3.

1855
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,710
That's not true.

1856
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,280
- Come on.
- He's being ridiculous.

1857
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,940
- It's true.
- Okay.

1858
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,340
He said I'm being ridiculous.

1859
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,880
Listen to the song we'll play...

1860
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,520
and guess the title and the singer.

1861
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,340
- Okay.
- I'm good at this kind of question.

1862
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,690
- It's difficult.
- This song is also from 1991.

1863
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:38,860
It's difficult.

1864
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:39,860
Music, cue.

1865
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,320
It suits you, Ji Hyo.

1866
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,880
(The song is being played.)

1867
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,750
- Tell us.
- It suits you, Ji Hyo.

1868
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:49,530
(The piano melody
is being played gently.)

1869
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:50,690
(I got this!)

1870
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,630
- You know this.
- You can't tell him.

1871
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:53,690
(What's this song?)

1872
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:54,730
Hey!

1873
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:55,840
(Why don't you know this?)

1874
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,880
- Hey!
- Guess the song!

1875
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,840
- You know this song?
- I told you...

1876
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,980
I know this song. Let me answer.

1877
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:04,710
Let me answer.
Isn't it "Dancing Queen?"

1878
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:06,320
- Wrong!
- Hey!

1879
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,880
The yellow place in the far distance

1880
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,920
- Let me answer.
- It's not my song?

1881
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,920
It's Lee Sang Woo's song!

1882
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,980
- What?
- It's "Met Her 100m Away."

1883
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,880
- Oh, it's that song?
- He's right.

1884
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:14,920
Seriously.

1885
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,360
The yellow place in the far distance

1886
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,860
(Listen to this.)

1887
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,130
That's right.

1888
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:22,960
(Even Michael Jackson
knows this song.)

1889
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:24,960
The place where I met her

1890
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,270
It's 100m away

1891
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,110
(I thought it was an upbeat song,
but it's a slow one?)

1892
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,500
- It's that song?
- It is.

1893
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:31,340
(There has to be a beat
that goes like this.)

1894
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,980
(Bom, bom, bom)

1895
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:38,710
("Met Her 100m Away"
by Lee Sang Woo)

1896
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,210
I haven't heard this song
for so long.

1897
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,650
Let's dance!

1898
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,750
Hello! Now turn!

1899
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,250
You're good!

1900
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,650
(They start showing off
their charms.)

1901
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,270
That's the dance.

1902
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:56,530
Can you move? What are you doing?

1903
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,530
I used to like this song,
but I had no idea.

1904
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,340
Jong Kook! How could you miss this?

1905
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:03,610
- You should've guessed it right.
- My gosh.

1906
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:04,980
Jong Kook, remember this dance?

1907
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,940
- This dance.
- I thought it was "Dancing Queen."

1908
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,250
(Shyly dancing
to the old dance moves)

1909
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,050
- It's Sang Woo's song.
- My gosh.

1910
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,650
- That's it!
- I used to love this song.

1911
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:13,880
He's excited.

1912
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,520
All right!

1913
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,590
(Dancing)

1914
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:23,960
Shall I do it?

1915
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,860
It's not the climax yet.

1916
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,130
(Some kids act cool alone.)

1917
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,170
Let's go back to the 1990s!

1918
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,360
- I think she's coming to me
- I think she's coming to me

1919
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,750
(The Town Musicians of Bremen
are excited by the lyrics.)

1920
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,420
- That was...
- That's it!

1921
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,630
That was so nice.

1922
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:03,300
It's so heart-fluttering.

1923
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,340
- That was so nice.
- By the way...

1924
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,860
That was so exciting.

1925
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,940
So Min is good
at this kind of stuff.

1926
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,300
That was fun.
It reminds me of the old days.

1927
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,340
(Cute steps of the coy girl)

1928
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,400
So Min is good at stuff like this.

1929
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,280
I absolutely loved this song,

1930
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,670
but I couldn't recognize it
from the prelude.

1931
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:17,750
This song...

1932
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,280
This song was ranked number 1
for the longest in 1991.

1933
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,520
- This song?
- That's right.

1934
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,690
- How did you not recognize it?
- I remember it now.

1935
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:25,960
I had no idea from the prelude.

1936
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:26,980
By the way,

1937
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:28,860
I saw you dance...

1938
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,820
with your uncle
for the first time in a while.

1939
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:33,650
You danced with him
for the first time in a while.

1940
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:35,690
Seriously.

1941
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,770
- The age gap isn't that big.
- You are like her uncle.

1942
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:38,900
You are like her uncle.

1943
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:41,170
Are you saying
I am older than her dad?

1944
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:42,940
Yes.

1945
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,170
That makes no sense.

1946
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,570
- Her dad!
- I am not older than him, okay?

1947
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,070
- It's just my impression.
- Her dad!

1948
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,210
That makes no sense.

1949
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,800
- It's just my impression.
- That's right.

1950
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,320
- Suk Jin.
- I am younger than her dad!

1951
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,610
Why are you angry?

1952
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:55,420
- Why are you angry?
- I am upset.

1953
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,480
- You should be more positive.
- Suk Jin.

1954
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,690
- What?
- Be positive.

1955
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,920
- Always.
- Be positive.

1956
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,030
Learn from Jong Kook.

1957
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:03,630
- Wouldn't you be angry?
- Of course not.

1958
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,050
Be positive.

1959
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:07,420
- Wouldn't you be angry?
- Of course not.

1960
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,530
It just means you have that image.

1961
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:10,900
- That's right.
- That's right.

1962
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,690
- That's right.
- Be positive.

1963
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,300
- It's just my impression.
- He changed a lot...

1964
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,630
since "Master in the House."

1965
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,440
I didn't know...

1966
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,000
- that he could be so positive.
- Be positive.

1967
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,170
Of course.

1968
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,980
I doubt it will go on
past this week.

1969
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,920
- Next.
- You should have gotten it right.

1970
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,920
Please pass the phone...

1971
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,520
- to the next ugliest person.
- I knew it right away.

1972
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:30,340
- Take it.
- Why is it me?

1973
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,150
- Take it.
- I refuse.

1974
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,610
Be positive and take it.

1975
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:36,460
- So Min made a chicken.
- It's a chicken.

1976
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,460
- I haven't seen it in a while.
- Seriously.

1977
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,630
Look at this.

1978
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:40,650
(They used to make chickens
out of handkerchiefs.)

1979
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,870
I haven't seen it in a while.

1980
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,040
Back in the days,
Dad used to bring fried chicken...

1981
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,370
Be quiet!

1982
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,160
It's a funny episode!

1983
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:50,160
- It isn't funny.
- It's a story of my memory!

1984
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,300
Stop it.

1985
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,580
Stop it.

1986
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,840
- I will tell my dad.
- There is no need to keep going.

1987
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,200
Why would you share another story
about a chicken?

1988
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,450
Listen to the sound
we're about to play carefully...

1989
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:01,840
and guess the name
of the product of the ad.

1990
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,410
I don't know much about commercials.

1991
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:04,690
It's too bad.

1992
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:05,880
Commercials are hard.

1993
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,520
(Sound)

1994
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,690
What is that?

1995
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:11,230
After going an entire day
without sleep,

1996
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,590
it's 2 a.m. again.

1997
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:14,660
- I don't know.
- What is this? I have no idea.

1998
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,770
I know this commercial!

1999
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,070
You should know this commercial!

2000
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:18,990
Gosh!

2001
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,290
Let me answer.

2002
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,830
- TRY.
- It's correct.

2003
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,130
- What's the answer?
- TRY.

2004
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,480
Incorrect.

2005
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,630
- What is it?
- I will play the commercial.

2006
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,410
- Isn't it TRY?
- Doesn't he have a bandage?

2007
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:29,670
- TRY.
- It sounds unfamiliar.

2008
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,980
(What could be the commercial
with ragged breathing?)

2009
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,150
It's the sound of a basketball.

2010
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,710
Shall we play another game?

2011
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,490
- The energy drink.
- Youth knows no weakness.

2012
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:38,620
(The symbol of youthful commercials,
energy drinks)

2013
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,520
I should have answered
this question!

2014
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:41,860
Look what you have done!

2015
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,330
- Why did you make me go third?
- Be positive.

2016
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:45,620
Be positive.

2017
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:48,270
- Kim Positive!
- Kim Positive!

2018
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:50,030
I am sure good things will follow.

2019
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:51,460
- That's right.
- You should think that.

2020
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,490
Although I got the question wrong,

2021
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:54,800
- good things will follow.
- That's right.

2022
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:56,870
The next one.

2023
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:58,170
Give it to the next ugliest member.

2024
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:00,410
Gosh, why would you say that?

2025
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:01,800
- Just...
- There are too many.

2026
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,410
(Handing over)

2027
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,480
- Ji Hyo?
- She would be annoyed.

2028
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,620
It seems fake.

2029
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,020
She would be annoyed.

2030
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,450
I switched it up a bit.

2031
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:13,880
My decision wasn't based
on your looks.

2032
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,920
Ji Hyo.

2033
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:16,030
Hip Ji Hyo.

2034
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:17,620
The next ugliest member picked up
the phone.

2035
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,360
Listen to the sound
we're about to play carefully...

2036
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,620
and guess the name
of the product of the ad.

2037
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,960
- The commercial jingle.
- You can get it right.

2038
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,900
(Majestic background music)

2039
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,740
- What is this?
- Isn't this a movie?

2040
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:29,740
What is this?

2041
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:30,830
Is there a commercial like this?

2042
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,410
(Majestic background music)

2043
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:34,500
There will be lines.

2044
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,700
(Ji Hyo doesn't have a clue.)

2045
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:38,840
(Jae Suk
doesn't have a clue either.)

2046
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,040
What is this?

2047
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,650
(The air is thick with tension
as if something will happen.)

2048
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:45,190
What is it? Do you know?

2049
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,450
- Do you know?
- All right.

2050
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:49,360
- I totally know.
- Is that all she gets?

2051
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,090
- Is that all I get?
- Yes. 5, 4...

2052
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:53,660
- Guess.
- You should know this.

2053
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,120
- Two,
- Do you know? You don't, right?

2054
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,570
- one.
- He knows.

2055
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:59,700
- I don't know.
- Incorrect.

2056
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,370
- A telecommunications company?
- I will play the commercial.

2057
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:02,610
"Do you know the taste of crabs?"

2058
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:04,070
- Is it that one?
- Really?

2059
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,980
"Calls go through if it's Gulliver."

2060
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,240
- No, no.
- Gulliver.

2061
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:10,450
- "Do you know the taste of crabs?"
- Shin Gu says,

2062
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:12,980
- "Do you know the taste of crabs?"
- It's the pager generation.

2063
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,690
- Is it correct? Really?
- Do you know the taste of crabs?

2064
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:17,290
(Do you know the taste of crabs?)

2065
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:18,520
That's right.

2066
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,380
Is this from 1991?

2067
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,360
- Is it from 1991?
- You were in their commercial once.

2068
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,530
- I was a model for Lotteria.
- Seriously.

2069
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:26,700
- She eats rice in it.
- That's right.

2070
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:27,870
The rice burger.

2071
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:29,660
- Here.
- I should have known.

2072
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,900
- Haha.
- Then we are at the top...

2073
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,240
- when it comes to the rankings.
- This choice is more natural.

2074
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,500
- They suit each other.
- I would have felt good...

2075
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:37,000
- if you hadn't moved up with me.
- They suit each other.

2076
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,500
I will play the song
that was released in 1991.

2077
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,580
- It's a song.
- 1991?

2078
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:41,840
- I have confidence.
- Guess...

2079
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,170
- Guess the song title and singer.
- It could be by Michael Jackson.

2080
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:47,840
Then you should dance.

2081
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:49,540
(Boom, boom)

2082
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:50,620
Hey!

2083
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,620
Then you should dance.

2084
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,320
(As soon as the music comes on,)

2085
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,790
(everyone gets up.)

2086
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:58,330
This is too much.

2087
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:00,360
Hey!

2088
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,490
For goodness' sake.

2089
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,660
Show your moves before you answer.

2090
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,330
This is ridiculous.

2091
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:08,040
(Euljiro's Ha Jackson
came to take over the coffeehouse.)

2092
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,300
Answer. Answer.

2093
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,410
- Do you want me to answer?
- He looks similar.

2094
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,940
- Do you want me to answer?
- Keep dancing.

2095
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,610
You don't know the song title,
do you?

2096
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:16,910
- I know.
- Do you know?

2097
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,480
(He is the most excited
since the opening.)

2098
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,540
Do you know?

2099
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:22,190
- Here I go.
- All right.

2100
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,520
Let me answer.

2101
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:25,290
- Michael Jackson.
- What's the song title?

2102
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:26,290
"Dangerous."

2103
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,830
That's right. It's "Dangerous."

2104
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:33,120
("Dangerous" by Michael Jackson
took the world by storm in 1991.)

2105
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:35,400
It was the perfect question
for Haha.

2106
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,660
(Euljiro's Ha Jackson
shows off his dance moves.)

2107
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,240
Since you answered correctly,
give us a ceremony.

2108
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,740
All right.

2109
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:43,240
Do it properly.

2110
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,780
(Ha Jackson takes the stage.)

2111
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,910
What?

2112
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,820
(He goes forward as he shows off
his dangerous belly.)

2113
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,240
What?

2114
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:04,920
(The entering class of 1991
is highly satisfied.)

2115
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,250
That's it.

2116
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,420
(Jackson is back.)

2117
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,700
Jackson!

2118
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,740
(He is out of breath.)

2119
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:14,500
- Ha Jackson!
- His belly is so plump.

2120
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,960
- This Michael Jackson...
- Why is it so plump today?

2121
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,870
has the proportions of a snowman.

2122
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,800
His belly is plump.

2123
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,840
He danced right away.

2124
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,150
My goodness.

2125
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:26,120
- I miss Michael Jackson.
- Next.

2126
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,710
- Kwang Soo.
- Me?

2127
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,580
Then I'm number one
when it comes to looks.

2128
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,080
Is Se Chan the most handsome?

2129
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,380
(The sexy hermit crab)

2130
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,230
Listen to the sound
we're about to play carefully...

2131
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:36,250
and guess the name...

2132
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:37,330
- of the product of the ad.
- Okay!

2133
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,530
He knows a lot of commercials.

2134
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:39,590
- I know.
- He knows a lot.

2135
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,750
I got all the previous ones right.

2136
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:41,900
(Twinkling sound effect)

2137
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,200
Putting an elephant in the fridge?

2138
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,590
(Elephant sound)

2139
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,590
- Let me answer.
- I know the answer.

2140
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,770
Did you figure it out already?

2141
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:50,440
Think Big.

2142
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:54,330
(Kwang Soo is correct.)

2143
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:55,480
He is incredible.

2144
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,450
How old are you?

2145
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:00,120
- He is incredible.
- He is incredible.

2146
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:01,710
I knew the answer.

2147
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:03,790
- Se Chan.
- Give it to me.

2148
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:05,910
- I am the most handsome man.
- Se Chan is the most handsome man.

2149
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:07,920
Here comes the most handsome man!

2150
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,990
I see that the rankings are
in reverse.

2151
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:11,190
That's right.

2152
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,590
- Give me the question.
- Listen to the sound and guess...

2153
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:15,270
- the name of the product in the ad.
- An ad.

2154
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:16,290
(Se Chan gets a question about
a commercial from the 1990s.)

2155
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:17,790
(Background music)

2156
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:20,160
(I love)

2157
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,960
(Even the sadness in the world)

2158
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,670
(I know this one!)

2159
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,780
(The two of them make it clear
that they know the answer.)

2160
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:31,150
Don't give him a hint.

2161
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:34,740
(The woman raises his head.)

2162
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,540
- You got all the information.
- Seriously.

2163
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,710
- You got all the information.
- 1, 2, 3.

2164
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:40,160
Cheonggwanjang.

2165
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,290
- Hey!
- Hey!

2166
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,690
You are incorrect.

2167
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:44,530
- Why don't you know?
- Ghana Chocolate.

2168
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:46,490
- She did that.
- Lee Mi Yeon.

2169
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:49,230
It was this. She did this!

2170
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,990
(Lee Mi Yeon's facial expression...)

2171
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:55,410
(made people create many parodies.)

2172
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:58,240
How could you not know?

2173
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,780
I didn't know.

2174
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:02,000
- He was too young.
- They are in the reed field.

2175
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,780
- Her face is buried in the coat.
- The coat.

2176
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,370
- That was the preliminary mission.
- One person got the answer.

2177
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,080
Haha and Kwang Soo got the answer.

2178
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,950
Haha, pick a product you want.

2179
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,080
- That's too bad.
- Okay.

2180
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,750
- Please don't take the LP.
- Seriously.

2181
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:17,880
- Lee Moon Sae's seventh album LP.
- Oh, no.

2182
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:19,330
Oh, no.

2183
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,290
- I'll take the Walkman.
- Okay.

2184
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:23,230
That's too bad.

2185
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:24,570
I used to listen to my Walkman
so often.

2186
01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:27,040
We will now move
to the next location.

2187
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:29,870
In the order of ugliness,
which is the same...

2188
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:31,240
as the order
you picked up the phone,

2189
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:33,500
- move to the counter.
- Really?

2190
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:34,800
- Really?
- The counter.

2191
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,040
(Is there a secret mission?)

2192
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,110
Ma'am.

2193
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,210
Who will pay for the drinks?

2194
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:41,650
(The tab will be deducted
from one member's paycheck.)

2195
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,950
Should I say the name?

2196
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,660
Okay.

2197
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,290
Well, he has...

2198
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,910
(Well, he has...)

2199
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,920
- the most amount of money.
- Please write down the name.

2200
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:55,030
(He doesn't even hesitate.)

2201
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:56,290
All right. Thank you.

2202
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,920
(He picked Old Man Suk Jin.)

2203
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:58,960
(Old Man Ji Suk Jin)

2204
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,440
Shall I give her a rose?

2205
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,440
What should I say?

2206
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,370
Who will pay for the drinks?

2207
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:13,780
(He pretends to hesitate...)

2208
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:16,380
(and picks Jae Suk.)

2209
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,580
Make sure he pays.

2210
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:20,860
(Jae Suk and Suk Jin picked
each other.)

2211
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:25,920
(Each member wrote down a name.)

2212
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,990
For us, the song is...

2213
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,160
Yoo Young Seok.

2214
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,920
- I want to walk down the street
- I want to walk down the street

2215
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,330
I want to get drunk
on a fragrant cocktail

2216
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:37,660
- That was the heyday of reggae.
- That's right.

2217
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:38,700
Was that reggae?

2218
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,800
- You seemed to have forgotten me
- At first

2219
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,980
It was popular.

2220
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:44,820
- Did you put on your seatbelts?
- Yes.

2221
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:47,020
You want to go back
to the 1990s, right?

2222
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,650
Wouldn't you go?

2223
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,790
- Where?
- Would you give everything up...

2224
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:52,250
to go back to 1991?

2225
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,450
I wouldn't go back
if I had to give everything up.

2226
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:56,530
You have to lose your memory, right?

2227
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:57,920
- That's right.
- You have to live...

2228
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,090
- as you did before, right?
- Yes.

2229
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,900
- Then I wouldn't go back.
- Really?

2230
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,570
It wasn't fun anyway, right?

2231
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:05,960
It really wasn't fun.

2232
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,070
Things weren't easy in the 1990s.

2233
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:09,500
- I struggled.
- You had no money.

2234
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,830
If I could go back...

2235
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:13,480
with the mindset I have now,
I would go back.

2236
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:16,300
I would live each day diligently.

2237
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,480
Why would you live
even more diligently?

2238
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,710
- But I regret the past.
- You have lived diligently.

2239
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,580
- You still have regrets.
- Yes.

2240
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,820
I have an example.

2241
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,490
I had so much time back then.

2242
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:28,580
- Had I learned English...
- That's right.

2243
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:30,790
Who could have imagined
the present day?

2244
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:32,230
- That's right.
- Had I memorized one word a day...

2245
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,400
That's right.

2246
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,230
I had so much time back then.

2247
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:37,620
- You played every day.
- I just lazed around.

2248
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:38,960
There is another thing.

2249
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,160
I didn't have much money then,

2250
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,070
but if I had invested in stocks...

2251
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:44,410
(If I had invested in stocks...)

2252
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,440
If I had done that regularly...

2253
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,240
- That's right.
- Everyone thinks that.

2254
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,700
I should have invested in stocks.

2255
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:52,020
- Even if I had 2,000 dollars...
- We are thinking that now, right?

2256
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,910
"I should have invested in stocks
back then."

2257
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:57,520
But 10 or 20 years from now,
we will think,

2258
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,580
- "It wasn't too late to start."
- That's right.

2259
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:03,050
"It wasn't too late to memorize
English words."

2260
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,050
"It wasn't too late."

2261
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:06,920
People always have the same regrets.

2262
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,950
That's right.

2263
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,730
"Why did I laze around at home?"

2264
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:12,660
If Suk Jin starts
studying English now...

2265
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:14,770
- Everyone.
- Yes?

2266
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:18,040
Earlier, you chose a member
who will pay for the drinks.

2267
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:21,300
- No way.
- The highest number of votes...

2268
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,870
determines the number of presents
in the first mission.

2269
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:27,320
So, if Suk Jin placed
1st with 3 votes,

2270
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:30,190
three people will receive a present
after the next mission.

2271
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:34,690
Your results are strangely varied
when you do something like this.

2272
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:35,880
- Okay.
- It's really strange.

2273
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,550
The member who received 2 votes
placed 1st.

2274
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:38,750
Everyone else received one vote.

2275
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:40,090
The results were varied.

2276
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,830
Thus, the next mission
will involve...

2277
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:44,090
- only two presents.
- No way.

2278
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:46,570
The person who will have
38 dollars deducted...

2279
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:48,570
- from his paycheck is...
- Let's see.

2280
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,130
- Kwang Soo.
- Me?

2281
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,110
- Kwang Soo.
- Me?

2282
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,080
- In the end...
- Why me?

2283
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,370
In the end, Kwang Soo was chosen.

2284
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:57,370
- All right. This is good.
- Why me?

2285
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,820
Kwang Soo, you received two votes.

2286
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:02,410
We will pay for the drinks
with money from your paycheck.

2287
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,410
Kwang Soo, that's Bosingak.
At the end of the year,

2288
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:07,210
the bell-ringing ceremony
takes place.

2289
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:09,120
- Look.
- That came out of nowhere.

2290
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,190
So that's Bosingak.

2291
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:11,790
- I went there once with my parents.
- Take a photo.

2292
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:14,250
It's like the golden bell.

2293
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,270
(Kwang Soo's golden Bosingak)

2294
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:19,090
Jongno is where I spent...

2295
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:20,900
my adolescence.

2296
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,440
I spent so much time in Jongno
in my 20s.

2297
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,040
We will go around Jongno today.

2298
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,200
- Suk Jin and Yong Man...
- I hung out in Jongno.

2299
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,540
hung out here very often.

2300
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:33,520
There was a restaurant called
Pine Hill.

2301
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,410
- Was it run by Kim Du Han?
- Have you heard of it?

2302
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:37,240
- It was a famous restaurant.
- Hey.

2303
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,580
Kim Du Han isn't
from that time period.

2304
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,360
Kim Du Han, the Jongno kid.

2305
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,190
Didn't he mostly eat
at gukbap restaurants?

2306
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,920
Kim Du Han had gukbap every morning.

2307
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,030
For goodness' sake.

2308
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:48,050
The first place is...

2309
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,460
a pool hall.

2310
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,730
- Okay!
- I can't play pool.

2311
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:51,790
I love pool.

2312
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:52,940
- If you can play pool...
- I could hit...

2313
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,160
250 points.

2314
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,000
Suk Jin lowers his average
on purpose.

2315
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,160
Seriously.

2316
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,440
- He can hit 300 points.
- He does it to earn money.

2317
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,670
By lowering his average,
he takes all the money.

2318
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:02,780
That's his trick.

2319
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,410
- Du Han!
- Hey!

2320
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:06,240
He avoids raising the average.

2321
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:07,540
- That's his trick.
- He doesn't want to lose money.

2322
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,690
He doesn't want to lose money.

2323
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,080
It has been a while since I played.

2324
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,120
(The pool hall from 1991)

2325
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,120
(A retro pool hall that has
the same sentimentality)

2326
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,250
I haven't been to a pool hall
in a while.

2327
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:17,530
It has been a long while.

2328
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:19,920
- Gosh, this place is...
- It has been a while.

2329
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,620
Back in the day, these places
were filled with cigarette smoke.

2330
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:25,240
- That's right.
- Was the ceiling this low?

2331
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,090
The ceiling wasn't so low back then.

2332
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,440
- No, it wasn't.
- In the 1990s...

2333
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,300
This place has a low ceiling.
Don't make a fuss.

2334
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,130
- Really?
- This place has a low ceiling.

2335
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:35,110
Pool halls didn't have a low ceiling
in the 1990s, right?

2336
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:36,200
It's just this place.

2337
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,240
What is Michael Jackson doing
at a pool hall?

2338
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:39,620
What is he doing at a pool hall?

2339
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:41,080
Does Michael Jackson play pool?

2340
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,450
I like it.

2341
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,750
- Pool.
- Pool.

2342
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,120
- Yes.
- Can you play pool?

2343
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,190
- My goodness.
- That's so funny.

2344
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:49,360
He is an amateur.

2345
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,050
- Suk Jin is excited...
- Look at Suk Jin.

2346
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,920
- to show his skills.
- Hit from this angle.

2347
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,460
- He is excited.
- He lies about his points.

2348
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,870
He lowers his average points
on purpose.

2349
01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:59,900
To those who can play well,
he says his average is 200 points.

2350
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,290
To novices,
he says his average is 250 points.

2351
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,500
- Really?
- The points fluctuate.

2352
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,070
He is a total swindler.

2353
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:05,280
He is the worst.

2354
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,280
He should be punished.

2355
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:09,410
(Master Kim begins to punish him.)

2356
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:10,500
Look at his mouth.

2357
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,500
(They play pool as they did
in the past...)

2358
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,710
(and use seduction skills.)

2359
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,410
(Even Michael Jackson loves
Korean-style pool!)

2360
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,690
It's really retro.

2361
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:19,210
(The entering class of 1991
begin their journey to the past.)

2362
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:22,030
(The popular memories
are brought back!)

2363
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:23,120
- 2, 3.
- Come on out!

2364
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,990
(Girls and boys who loved
the alleys)

2365
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,290
(They even go to the LP bar!)

2366
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,090
(They forget about the shoot
and become excited for real.)

2367
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:33,630
(And...)

2368
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,070
(The songs of the past
conclude the journey.)

2369
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,170
(They write down stories
of the past.)

2370
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:41,630
I took a trip down memory lane.

2371
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:42,740
Why are you crying?

2372
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:44,110
What's wrong?

2373
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:50,910
Standing before the passing time

2374
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:52,490
(Revisiting memories
makes them think about their past.)

2375
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,750
(The Entering Class of 1991
Is Back!)
