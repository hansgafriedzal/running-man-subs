1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,420
(Generation X appeared
to sweep the 20th century.)

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,880
(Here come 8 unique,
freewheeling college students!)

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,350
(The fashion leaders
from the 20th century are back.)

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,750
(The Entering Class of 1991
Is Back!)

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,550
(Jeon So Min, a coy freshman)

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,320
Ji Hyo, you look pretty today.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,570
(Song Ji Hyo,
Miss Korea Applicant)

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,600
(They are all dressed up
for their blind dates)

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
Again?

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,300
He's Ji Seok Sam.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,070
(Their dates are
old college students.)

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,600
Seok Sam born in 1966.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,480
(Can I call you Seok Sam, then?)

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,040
No, no.
You should call him "mister."

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,770
(Seok Sam has mature charm
like a grandma's doenjang.)

16
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,110
How can you call him by his name?

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,150
(While they force themselves
to smile for their dates...)

18
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,650
- What's going on?
- Aren't they together?

19
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,120
(Generation X shows up
looking chic.)

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,050
What are you wearing?

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,360
(The Orange Gang shows off
their outstanding fashion tastes.)

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,520
Who are these thugs?

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,660
(Hello, guys?)

24
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,550
(While Generation X
boasts their charms...)

25
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm sorry, but don't you think...

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,060
(Don't you think he's too into
his character all of a sudden?)

27
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,300
(Ha Jackson misunderstood
today's concept.)

28
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
(He breakdances
to hide his embarrassment.)

29
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,230
He's dancing out of the blue!
Beat it!

30
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,760
He misunderstood today's concept.

31
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,880
(Back to 1991 with Ha Jackson)

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,980
His belly is so plump.

33
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,650
Today, you'll be a senior
who entered college in 1991.

34
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,320
You're to introduce the culture
of the 1990s...

35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,380
(The Entering Class of 1991
Is Back Race)

36
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,680
All right.

37
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,460
(Popular items from 1990s)

38
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,460
- Really?
- That sounds like fun.

39
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,460
(They will get the penalty
by the number of items they missed.)

40
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,460
We'll determine
who'll get the penalty...

41
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,730
by the number of items you missed.

42
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,130
Before we begin the main mission,

43
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,400
let's play a simple game
to determine who'll get the items.

44
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,570
The members of the winning team
will win the items.

45
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,510
(The first place for the mission)

46
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,570
(A pool hall)

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
It has been a while since I played.

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,770
(It's a place
where they spent their 20s.)

49
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,070
(It's a pool hall
from the year 1991.)

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,150
The first mission...

51
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,210
will take place in the pool hall
where young people wasted...

52
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,210
- their youth in 1991.
- A pool hall.

53
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,350
It's called Pool Hall Grand Prix.

54
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,380
Why did I waste my youth like that?

55
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,460
- I have a lot of memories of this.
- Me too.

56
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,130
You will play pool
and four-ball billiards,

57
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,570
and two members
of the winning teams will get items.

58
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,840
We need two male members
to play pool.

59
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,000
Isn't my outfit perfect
for playing pool?

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,610
- All right then.
- That's colorful. You play pool.

61
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,370
I think Michael Jackson will be
good at playing pool.

62
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,180
- Right.
- Michael Jackson would be good.

63
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,390
It would look good.

64
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,710
- Michael Jackson, come here.
- All right.

65
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,590
I was going to play billiards.

66
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,120
Michael Jackson
can't play billiards.

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,050
You don't know
how to play four-ball billiards.

68
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,120
I should wear arm warmers.

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,650
He's practicing.

70
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,330
The ball should go like this.

71
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,060
- Everyone.
- Ji Hyo, can you play?

72
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,140
We should decide
who will hit striped balls.

73
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,700
- So, for pool...
- Good.

74
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,170
I haven't done this for a long time.

75
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,560
- This feels good.
- Do you want me to hold the cue?

76
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,300
- Yes.
- Guys.

77
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,530
Please listen to me.

78
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,800
- Okay.
- People didn't listen in the 1990s.

79
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,550
- Let's do this.
- If you make a ball into a pocket,

80
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,780
you claim the type of ball.
You know that, right?

81
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,490
I can pick one of the two types.

82
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,490
Then you can shoot any ball you want
from 1 to 7.

83
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,830
You need to sink
the eight ball last.

84
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,150
The first ball to sink
will be Jae Suk's ball.

85
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,860
You should sink the eight ball last.

86
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,120
He doesn't look so good
from the beginning.

87
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,400
He's wearing gloves.

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,090
You should hit the balls this way.

89
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,340
(The yellow cap
looks quite serious.)

90
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,460
Nice.

91
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,140
- None of them are going in?
- None of them went in.

92
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,970
Good. They are scattered.

93
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,580
There are a lot of balls to sink.

94
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,150
If Haha sinks a ball,
he can claim the type.

95
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,270
If he sinks a ball.

96
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,150
This is a good one.

97
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,950
Ha Jackson has good posture.

98
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,890
- Michael Jackson!
- Jackson has good posture.

99
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,890
Nice.

100
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,620
(He sank the ball easily.)

101
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,250
- Nice.
- All right.

102
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,990
Stripes.

103
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,330
I bet he can make it.

104
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,520
- This isn't easy.
- Gosh, I didn't make it. Go in!

105
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,490
- We don't know yet.
- It's not in.

106
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,220
All right. Move over.

107
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,740
- Go, Jae Suk.
- Move over!

108
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,030
You're wearing the glove alone.

109
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,240
- Obviously, he's bad at this.
- He's the only one wearing it.

110
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,270
He's never done this before.

111
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,430
He has poor posture.

112
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,050
- You might die.
- He would sink the cue ball.

113
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,680
Hit heavily. Am I right?

114
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,770
- He will make it.
- Nice.

115
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,310
(He made a clean shot.)

116
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,370
He will make it.

117
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,240
- Nice.
- Move over.

118
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,150
You just got lucky.

119
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,150
Jae Suk, start with the seven.

120
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,490
- The seven ball.
- You look cool, Jae Suk.

121
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,620
Jae Suk, two points from here...
Can't you hit this one?

122
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,860
Hey, who are you playing with?

123
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,060
Hang on. Are you pointing
the cue at me now?

124
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,070
Be positive.

125
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,790
- Okay.
- Kim Positive.

126
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,030
- Let's do this.
- This is hard. You can't make it.

127
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,510
- Hit it gently.
- You should hit this one.

128
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,530
Look at his mouth.

129
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,770
He's trying his best.

130
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,580
(He pouts when he focuses.)

131
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,470
- Make it gentle.
- He pouts when he focuses.

132
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,540
- He's serious.
- Gosh.

133
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,250
- That was close.
- How could you miss that?

134
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,470
That was good, right?

135
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,540
I can't believe he missed it.
Hit the ten ball.

136
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,820
Do you play pool in the States?

137
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,980
We do.

138
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,760
Of course they do.
This is from the States.

139
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,920
- It's from the States.
- I think he'll make it this time.

140
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,560
He's good.

141
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,850
- Haha.
- Jackson.

142
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,150
Good luck!

143
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,420
(Celebrating with the moonwalk)

144
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,570
Haha is good at this. He looks cool.

145
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,310
This is hilarious.

146
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,770
- Back.
- That's right.

147
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,710
(He made a difficult shot.)

148
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,710
Michael Jackson!

149
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,170
(He returns the compliment
with his ceremony.)

150
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,540
Gosh, he's pretty good.

151
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,590
It's done.

152
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,410
Jackson, you're so cool.

153
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,820
- There's nothing you can sink.
- I think...

154
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,410
Just block the ball.

155
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,420
So Min, just hit this hard.

156
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,520
You should hit it hard.

157
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,590
What are you doing?

158
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,560
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hey.

159
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,700
Why do you try useless things?

160
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,700
What are you doing?

161
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,030
- So Min, you can't do that.
- You can't hit it like that.

162
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,530
- Hey.
- You can't do that.

163
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,940
You don't have to do this.

164
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,960
- Why are you being like this?
- I want to look sexy.

165
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,770
- I want to look sexy.
- That's not important.

166
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,900
A sex appeal.

167
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,310
She wants to look sexy.

168
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,150
Where did she learn that from?

169
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,710
Gosh, So Min.
Your boyfriend will be really tired.

170
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,150
(So Min's boyfriend has to react
to every move she makes.)

171
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,560
- Hit the ball?
- Yes. Hit it hard.

172
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,760
So Min, are you doing that
on purpose?

173
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,480
- Yes.
- Stop touching your hair.

174
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,760
Just hit it.

175
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,290
Go ahead and hit it.

176
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,520
We don't have guests today.

177
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,220
- Just do it.
- So Min, you should do this.

178
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,400
- Do you need some wind?
- It's done.

179
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,070
- Hey.
- Hey.

180
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,790
(She learned how to play pool
in the wrong way.)

181
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,070
Don't do that. Just split the balls.

182
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,340
Only those who are good
at playing pool can do this.

183
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,530
How should I split them?

184
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,510
- Good.
- That's right. Well done.

185
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,510
It might work.

186
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,320
- It's going in.
- It's done.

187
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,770
- It would've been nice if it sank.
- Hit this hard.

188
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,890
I wish it worked.

189
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,410
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

190
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,850
- You sank only one ball.
- Don't worry.

191
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,110
I'll sink three balls in a row.

192
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,650
Just try to push the ball.

193
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,960
Look. The cue and the ball
should be in a straight line.

194
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,260
Hey, you can't give a lesson here.

195
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,290
Move over.

196
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,590
- Here?
- He sounds nothing like his outfit.

197
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,590
My gosh.

198
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,200
Michael Jackson sounds
like a Korean man.

199
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,400
- Hey, mister.
- Make it straight.

200
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,010
Jackson speaks good Korean.

201
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,360
Hit it.

202
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,340
Just hit it gently.

203
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,470
Gently.

204
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,970
(One shot, one kill)

205
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,210
This isn't your first time, is it?

206
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
Gosh, I made it.

207
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,610
That was amazing.

208
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,540
That's because you taught me well.

209
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,410
That wasn't an easy one.

210
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,780
Are you sure this is her first time?

211
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,920
- You can't hit it this way.
- Hang on.

212
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,480
- Why is she playing like this?
- I'll hit the green one.

213
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,000
- The green one?
- Hang on.

214
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,700
- Are you left-handed?
- Aren't you a right-hander?

215
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,570
- I'm right-handed.
- Why are you playing like that?

216
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,420
Why? Isn't this right?

217
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,640
You're not playing
with your right hand.

218
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,770
Why are you playing
with your left hand...

219
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,010
when you're right-handed?

220
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,100
- I thought something wasn't right.
- That's for a left-handed person.

221
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,310
- Should I do it this way?
- Why are you wearing the glove?

222
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,900
- How could you do it so well?
- This is more comfortable.

223
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,080
She says this is more comfortable.

224
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
She used her left hand,
but she did a great job.

225
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,520
- This is a lot better.
- Put a glove on this hand.

226
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,910
Ji Hyo, hit it lightly.

227
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,390
Stay focused.
Don't listen to anyone.

228
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,850
Ji Hyo, just try to hit the ball.

229
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,060
- It's okay.
- Ji Hyo is so funny.

230
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,650
- I didn't know.
- "This is more comfortable."

231
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,350
- This is a lot better.
- Of course it is.

232
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,560
Haha.

233
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,290
She hit the wrong ball,
so you can start from two points.

234
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,660
Two points.

235
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,460
You can start within the two points.

236
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,700
I'll start from here.

237
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,570
No, it's not like that.
It's two points.

238
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,640
I know that.

239
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,810
- But this is three points.
- Mister.

240
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,140
- I said two points.
- I'll just start from here.

241
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,470
- No.
- He just does whatever he wants.

242
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,710
I want to start from here.

243
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,650
She hit the wrong ball,
so it's two points.

244
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,170
You have bad manners.

245
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,980
Hey.

246
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,410
- You have no manners.
- Hey.

247
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,610
- What's wrong?
- It's two points.

248
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,760
Mr. Michael Jackson.

249
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,560
I can't believe this.
Move over, So Min.

250
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,130
Hey, you should start
within the two points.

251
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,330
Within the two points,

252
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,330
- you can choose a spot you want.
- I know that.

253
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,720
But I want to start from here.

254
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,770
- Will you just hurry?
- You have to stick to the rules.

255
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,590
- You should get on here.
- Why?

256
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,730
Aren't you a ball?

257
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,940
Why am I a ball?

258
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,400
You can hit this one.

259
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,810
Go ahead and hit it.

260
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,270
- Just hit it lightly.
- It doesn't have to be hard.

261
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,600
- Gosh.
- Oh, dear.

262
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
- Jae Suk.
- That was so lame.

263
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,020
- Jae Suk.
- You're really bad at this.

264
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,690
- He's not good at this.
- Jae Suk.

265
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,020
Gosh, I said I'm not good at this.

266
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,090
Michael Jackson is so good at this.

267
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,880
He has only one ball left.

268
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,120
- Jae Suk.
- But this one isn't easy.

269
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,800
(Hyun Mee is back.)

270
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,570
He looks really scary.

271
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,570
(A horrible mix of Hyun Mee's
hairstyle and Jackson's costume.)

272
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,090
- Just hit this.
- Can't you put it back on?

273
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,310
I love his costume.

274
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,340
- Miss it.
- Hit it.

275
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,360
He did it.

276
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,940
(A clean shot)

277
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,210
- Haha is really good.
- Now he should sink this ball.

278
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,080
It will end in the next round.

279
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,680
- It'll be over.
- My gosh.

280
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,710
- It's going in.
- It's over.

281
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,010
(He sinks the last ball as well.)

282
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,190
It's done.

283
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,110
(The grand finale)

284
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,160
(Thanks to Ha Jackson,
Team Mapo wins the game.)

285
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,250
Mapo!

286
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,250
Good luck.

287
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,390
They won.

288
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,490
Okay.

289
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
(Jong Kook and Se Chan win
the four-ball billiards game.)

290
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,960
- It feels so good.
- I'm really upset.

291
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,670
- This is billiards.
- I'm really mad.

292
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,130
So we have four winners now.

293
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,600
Since we have only two items,

294
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,630
you will play rock-paper-scissors
and the winners will get the items.

295
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,180
- Okay.
- Let's play 2 to 2.

296
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,710
The final winner's team
will get the items.

297
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,050
We will take the items.

298
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,790
Rock-paper-scissors

299
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,140
- Okay!
- That's good.

300
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,050
- You have to win.
- Oh no.

301
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,820
How can I possibly beat
Michael Jackson?

302
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,430
- He's collecting his energy.
- Go, Michael Jackson.

303
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,620
- He's collecting his energy.
- Go, Michael Jackson.

304
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,850
Go, Jackson.

305
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,670
Jong Kook, stay positive.

306
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,960
You can win with a positive mindset.

307
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,390
- Today is Jackson's day.
- Rock-paper-scissors

308
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,710
(Ha Jackson wins.)

309
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,470
Nice!

310
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,210
(He couldn't beat Jackson
with the power of positiveness.)

311
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,280
- He's cool.
- Haha and Ji Hyo can pick...

312
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,470
an item each.

313
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,970
Is Haha getting another item?

314
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,580
This is his second item.

315
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,290
I'll have the LP player.

316
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,980
I'll have...

317
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,190
- the nickel-silver table.
- The nickel-silver table?

318
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,610
- Yes.
- My gosh.

319
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,200
(So far, 4 items are gone.)

320
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,590
Before we move to the venue
for the next mission,

321
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,940
you will play a game to determine
the number of presents.

322
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,260
- I see.
- All right.

323
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,230
Kwang Soo,
you paid for the drinks earlier.

324
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,840
You should go down
to the fourth floor.

325
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,280
- It's one floor down.
- One floor down.

326
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,730
- Behave yourself.
- Right.

327
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,050
We will be watching you.

328
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,240
I will just follow my feelings...

329
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,470
to pick a person.

330
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,050
I feel it.

331
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,960
(They should do this well to get
more presents on the next mission.)

332
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,010
(Kwang Soo enters looking nervous.)

333
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,160
Hello.

334
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,480
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

335
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,090
Did you just push or pull the door?

336
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,990
I pushed it.

337
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,720
This is what you do.

338
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,760
You should guess
what the next member will do.

339
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,570
Since you're the first one
to come in,

340
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,670
- we consider it a success.
- Okay.

341
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,280
If you guess
the next members' behavior right,

342
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,470
you'll get more presents.

343
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,680
Now, name the next member
to come in...

344
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,610
and guess if that member will push
or pull the door.

345
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,820
(He should guess it right
to get more presents.)

346
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,010
I'm sure about this.

347
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,980
Jong Kook will push the door.

348
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,030
(He thinks Jong Kook
will push the door.)

349
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,160
He pushes the door...

350
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,200
even when it says "pull."

351
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,930
I'm sure he will push.

352
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,170
(It's his instinct
to push the door.)

353
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,430
- Next up is Jong Kook.
- Me?

354
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,390
- Why me?
- Go downstairs.

355
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,040
I guess Kwang Soo named Jong Kook.

356
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,730
- Is that it?
- Jong Kook, stay positive.

357
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,910
Of course.

358
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,100
- Did he pick Jong Kook?
- Okay.

359
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,450
(Master Kim comes down
with a positive mindset.)

360
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,010
Please.

361
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,740
(Will he push the door
as Kwang Soo predicted?)

362
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,110
Okay!

363
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,980
Okay!

364
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,110
(His prediction is right.)

365
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,420
What?

366
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,530
- Jong Kook.
- All right.

367
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,750
- Aren't I the next to come?
- Jong Kook.

368
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,960
- You just pushed the door.
- Right.

369
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,250
And Kwang Soo predicted
that you'd push the door.

370
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,700
(Kwang Soo guessed it right,
so they get 2 presents.)

371
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,070
Okay!

372
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,170
(What was that sound?)

373
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,390
- What?
- He shouted.

374
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,000
I think he got hit.

375
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,970
Did he shout because he got hit?

376
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,370
He just said, "No!"

377
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,780
Jong Kook, you should name
the next member to come in...

378
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,240
and guess if that member will push
or pull the door.

379
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,340
- We usually push the door.
- It should be Suk Jin.

380
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,790
And he doesn't pull. He pushes.

381
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,640
- I agree.
- He doesn't bother to pull a door.

382
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,920
- I agree.
- He finds it cumbersome.

383
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,190
He will definitely push the door.

384
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,330
Next up is Ji Suk Jin.

385
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,850
He will push the door.

386
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,250
- It's easier to push.
- Sure.

387
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,960
This is all about science.

388
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,220
(It could be possible to guess
all the members' behaviors right.)

389
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,300
Here I go.

390
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,800
(Next up is Big Nose.)

391
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,130
(He always tries to save his energy
as much as possible.)

392
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,100
He wouldn't waste his energy
for no reason.

393
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,600
- He always pushes the door.
- Right.

394
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,340
- Okay!
- See?

395
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,470
- He always pushes the door.
- Right.

396
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,810
Okay!

397
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,410
See? I told you.

398
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,740
- I knew he would push.
- What?

399
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,580
Is it push or pull?

400
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,980
Okay!

401
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,460
- Oh, I get it.
- What is it?

402
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,250
I think it's like left or right.

403
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,290
Or it's like number 1 or 2.

404
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,960
Or it might be about which foot.

405
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,590
- It's about feet.
- Which foot you put first.

406
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,260
- I'll go in with both feet.
- Me too. With both feet.

407
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,990
- I should do that too.
- Jae Suk.

408
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,460
Go in with both feet.
Then we will win.

409
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,840
You should go in on your hands.

410
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,540
I guess that's it. Okay.

411
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,170
- They mostly push.
- Did you push?

412
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,340
- Pick the next one to go.
- Pick the next member.

413
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,180
Pick someone lazy. Like Ji Hyo.

414
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,000
- She will also push the door.
- Song Ji Hyo.

415
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,140
- She will push.
- Right?

416
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,710
There's no way she will pull.

417
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,980
Ji Hyo might do this.

418
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,290
"What?"

419
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,290
- Then she might pull.
- That's possible.

420
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,460
She jumped with both feet last time.

421
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,160
Right. That's what she does.

422
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,250
She wouldn't pull.
She'll definitely push.

423
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,330
I know.

424
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,220
I bet she will push.

425
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,760
I think So Min will push as well.

426
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,860
See what she does?

427
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,340
(As Jong Kook said,
she hesitates in front of the door.)

428
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,840
- See what she does?
- You guessed right.

429
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,890
I know.

430
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,780
Okay.

431
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,940
(It's 100 percent.)

432
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,100
- What?
- Am I right?

433
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,640
She didn't come in right away.

434
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,780
- She was like this.
- What's going on?

435
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,320
- I'll pick So Min.
- Okay.

436
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,450
- She'll push.
- She will push.

437
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,790
See?

438
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,460
(I knew it.)

439
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,480
- The door is supposed to be pushed.
- What...

440
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,850
- It was about pushing or pulling.
- I see.

441
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,990
The door is supposed to be pushed.

442
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,960
Everyone will push the door.

443
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,260
I bet they will all push.

444
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,960
I think it'll be strange
to pull the door.

445
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,330
- They will all push.
- It shows an abnormal personality.

446
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,440
Those who pull
the door are perverts.

447
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,630
- I agree.
- Right?

448
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,230
- I pick Yang Se Chan.
- Push?

449
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,440
- He'll push.
- Definitely.

450
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,460
He'll push for sure.

451
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,130
- Good luck.
- Okay.

452
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,180
(Next up is Se Chan.)

453
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,310
(If he pushes the door again,
they will get 6 presents.)

454
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,450
If you want to pull the door,
you have to use both hands.

455
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,420
- There's no room for that.
- I never thought of pulling it.

456
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,550
You need to do it with both hands.

457
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,920
It will be uncomfortable
to pull the door.

458
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,350
(He goes against their expectation.)

459
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,190
My goodness.

460
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,490
What?

461
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,960
I came in with my left foot.

462
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
(He made a wrong guess.)

463
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,570
- What's wrong with you?
- Why?

464
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
I came in with my left foot.

465
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,890
I can't believe this.

466
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,410
He's the weird one.

467
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,070
What's wrong with him?

468
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,130
- What was that?
- You're the strange one.

469
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,210
He's even wearing a strange hat.
What's wrong with him?

470
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,640
What did I do?

471
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,310
- He pulled the door?
- Hey.

472
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,470
- You should push the door.
- How could he pull it?

473
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,920
- I see.
- People usually push the door.

474
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,840
Why did you pull it?
What were you thinking?

475
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,010
- Why did you pull?
- If I pushed,

476
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,010
it would've covered my face.

477
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,060
I wanted to show my face first.

478
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,880
- Are you an attention seeker?
- He's an attention seeker.

479
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,120
- Did you push?
- Yes.

480
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,660
We all pushed the door.

481
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,390
I bet those who like
to get attention...

482
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,800
will pull the door. You'll see.

483
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,330
- Did we fail?
- Yes, you did.

484
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,070
Se Chan, pick the next member...

485
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,540
- and guess if he will push or pull.
- Jae Suk.

486
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,870
We all pushed the door.

487
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,940
If you think about the probability,
you should go with pushing.

488
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,810
- He might pull it though.
- We all pushed.

489
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,840
- Just do whatever you want.
- Why did you pull?

490
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,710
I think Jae Suk will pull.

491
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,470
- Jae Suk...
- We don't know that.

492
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,820
Jae Suk will pull the door...

493
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
and bump his face into it.

494
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,250
(It's possible
because he has a protruding mouth.)

495
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,480
(Jae Suk shows up.)

496
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,560
I think he will pull.

497
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,220
(Se Chan predicted
that Jae Suk would pull.)

498
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,060
(What's Jae Suk's choice?)

499
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,200
Hello, my love

500
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,170
See? He pushed.

501
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,200
- See?
- I knew it.

502
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,940
He's not in yet.

503
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,210
He's not in.

504
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,550
He's so flippant.

505
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,550
(He's so flippant.)

506
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,680
- He...
- A lot is going on in his head.

507
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,840
- He's confused.
- But he already guessed wrong.

508
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,690
- Jae Suk.
- Are you trying to figure it out?

509
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,420
You already guessed wrong.

510
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,480
- It's not what you think it is.
- You're wrong.

511
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,430
- Jae Suk, try something else.
- Isn't this it?

512
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,660
- That's not it.
- Jae Suk, start over again.

513
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,590
You can close the door
and open it again.

514
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,720
- Really?
- Yes.

515
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,390
(Isn't this it?)

516
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,260
- It might be different this time.
- If he fails again...

517
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,860
- This is stressing me out.
- Hold on.

518
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,670
(He's pushing the door
while walking backward.)

519
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,970
(Oh, boy.)

520
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,130
That's not it.

521
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,780
- You're in now.
- Come on in now.

522
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,050
(It took him so long to come in,
but he failed to figure it out.)

523
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,950
- See? Pushing it is more probable.
- Pushing or pulling the door.

524
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,950
You failed.

525
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,240
Se Chan predicted
that you'd pull the door, Jae Suk.

526
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
- What would you have predicted?
- Of course, I would push it.

527
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,920
- Most people push doors.
- We all pushed it except for him.

528
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,590
- Only Se Chan pulled it.
- He was the only one.

529
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,060
- Why did I do that?
- Most people push doors.

530
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,750
Haha might pull the door
and enter while moonwalking.

531
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,390
- That's possible.
- He might do that.

532
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,530
- Will Haha push or pull it?
- I'm sure he'll push it.

533
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,670
I'm 100 percent sure
that he'll push it.

534
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,390
- We all pushed the door.
- Only I failed.

535
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,340
- Haha, you may go now.
- Okay.

536
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,360
(They already failed twice
and lost 2 presents.)

537
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,170
He'll definitely push the door.
I'm 100 percent sure of it.

538
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,780
(Haha should push the door,
so they can get another present.)

539
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,310
(What could be Haha's choice?)

540
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,780
(He's pulling the door
with all his might.)

541
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,910
My goodness.

542
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,720
(Goodness gracious.)

543
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,520
- Why? What's wrong?
- See?

544
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,610
What was that?

545
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,940
- My gosh.
- Nice!

546
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,490
- What's wrong with him?
- It's a habit.

547
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,110
- He's an attention addict too.
- Why did you pull the door?

548
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,150
- What's wrong?
- Why would you do that?

549
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,180
- Why, Michael?
- Why pull it?

550
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,530
There's nothing wrong
with pulling the door, right?

551
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,450
- Why would he pull it?
- My gosh.

552
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,620
I didn't want the staff behind me
to get hurt.

553
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,090
That's what I thought too.
I was considerate of them.

554
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,340
- Nonsense. There was no one there.
- There might have been.

555
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,040
Five of you in total succeeded.

556
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,970
Therefore, you will receive
five presents in the next round.

557
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,970
- Got it.
- Five presents?

558
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,580
Let's move to the next location.

559
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,700
We're going to a cafe this time.

560
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,780
- Nice.
- Really?

561
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,750
- I'll drink coffee.
- Can we have some parfait?

562
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,910
- What will you do? Will you hit me?
- Hold the edges on both sides.

563
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,750
- Here too.
- You can use nicer words.

564
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,990
- But it's embarrassing.
- It's underwear.

565
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,950
- So Min, you always do weird stuff.
- What are you two doing?

566
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,490
- Haven't you tried this at school?
- Are you enjoying a romantic time?

567
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,030
- That's so weird. Do you know this?
- When you were in college...

568
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,450
I'll make a fish for you.

569
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,590
- A fish?
- A fish?

570
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,190
Jae Suk is a romanticist.

571
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,920
- Isn't he romantic?
- He must've made many paper cranes.

572
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,360
And paper crane eggs.

573
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,540
I'm sure he made
more than 10,000 paper cranes.

574
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,770
- He must've made 50,000 of them.
- No, 500,000 of them.

575
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,780
- He must've asked many girls out.
- And paper crane eggs.

576
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,600
- And then he got rejected?
- Yes.

577
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,280
- Then he asked another girl out.
- I received 3,000 paper crane eggs.

578
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,840
- Has anyone received that much?
- Of course.

579
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,370
- I made them.
- It's true. Suk Jin received...

580
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,110
- crane eggs...
- I received a lot.

581
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,320
from someone who was raising cranes.

582
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,560
- You mean, actual crane eggs?
- Yes.

583
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,590
- Crane eggs?
- That's right.

584
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,590
Did you fry them?

585
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,790
- For his health...
- Hey.

586
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,330
- You ate a lot of protein.
- For his health...

587
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,330
- I was very popular in college.
- That's so funny.

588
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,800
- Should we go to the rooftop?
- To the rooftop?

589
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,860
The rooftop?

590
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,470
This place is so nice.

591
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,570
(Cute and pretty teacups
used back in the days...)

592
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,930
- This place is so nice.
- That's nice.

593
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,280
Look at this. I like this place.

594
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,510
(And an old, nostalgic radio)

595
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,780
- Guys. Oh, my.
- Why?

596
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,810
(And on the rooftop...)

597
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,820
- Look at that.
- Oh, wow. This is the real deal.

598
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,320
- I love it.
- Is this place always like this?

599
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,840
(The 1990s style rooftop cafe)

600
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,590
Look at that. "I love you!"

601
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,560
(The ads and movie posters add
the 1990s sentiment to the place.)

602
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,260
My gosh. There are
Chow Yun Fat and Leslie Cheung.

603
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,030
"The General's Son!" Oh, my.

604
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,800
Park Sang Min played Kim Doo Han.

605
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,190
I got into a fight
whenever I watched that movie.

606
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,970
- "Once Upon a Time in China."
- Such movies make you feel like...

607
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,160
- you're a good fighter.
- True.

608
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,770
The weather is really nice today.

609
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,860
- It's nice.
- Indeed.

610
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,070
Have a seat.

611
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,010
- Thank you.
- "Thank you."

612
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,010
(Cheesy)

613
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,580
- I'm not sure how this might sound.
- What is it?

614
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,110
You all look ridiculous.

615
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,750
- So do you.
- You don't look so great either.

616
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,610
- So do you.
- Didn't you see yourself?

617
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,410
- Hey, the year 1991 is my world.
- That's nonsense.

618
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,990
- Look behind you. Be careful.
- Be careful.

619
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
- It looks good.
- Parfait.

620
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,150
- Can we have some parfait too?
- They have these old-style cups?

621
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,190
- This place is so nice.
- If you look at it...

622
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,230
It's a multigrain shake.

623
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,500
Yes, it looks delicious.

624
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,890
- I'll drink a multigrain shake.
- Won't you drink coffee?

625
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,240
- I want coffee. I want it.
- Won't you drink coffee?

626
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,700
- I'll drink coffee.
- This is a multigrain shake.

627
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,840
This multigrain shake is amazing.

628
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
The multigrain shake is good.

629
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,200
(Even Michael Jackson fell in love
with a multigrain shake.)

630
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,670
(Whenever she hears this song,)

631
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,140
(So Min starts dancing
the cheesy dance.)

632
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,580
She starts dancing automatically.

633
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,080
- I like things like this so much.
- So Min...

634
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,640
- I really do.
- I know. You like it so much.

635
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,410
Show me how to do that dance move.

636
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,180
Do you put your hands together
behind your back?

637
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,720
So Min looks so happy.

638
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,530
(Dancing lightly)

639
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,920
- Is it good?
- By the way...

640
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,360
I used to hang out with Suk Jin
and Yong Man very often.

641
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,030
When we went to a cafe,
we always ordered parfait...

642
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,000
- or hot chocolate.
- Hot chocolate.

643
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,930
- That's cute.
- When we ate parfait...

644
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,280
Almost all the other people ordered
beer or alcoholic drinks.

645
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,600
"Can I have draft beer, please?"

646
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,980
- We didn't.
- But we ordered hot chocolate.

647
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,200
- Something sweet and delicious.
- "Can I have parfait, please?"

648
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,910
"Do you not have
non-alcoholic drinks?"

649
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,520
"Oh, I see."

650
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,490
(The non-alcoholic drink lover)

651
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,640
"Don't you serve
non-alcoholic drinks?"

652
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,990
Then why did you even go out?
You should've just stayed at home.

653
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,410
- Did you go to bed at 10 p.m.?
- Hey!

654
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,260
- You could drink that at home.
- I went out to have fun.

655
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,420
- I mean, what would you have done?
- I went out to have fun.

656
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,190
- Eat parfait?
- I went out for some parfait.

657
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,350
Gosh, seriously.

658
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,730
- You're the worst.
- We always ordered such drinks.

659
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,300
Were you expecting something
when you went out?

660
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,660
- What do you mean by that?
- Did you expect...

661
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,660
- Expect what?
- something romantic to happen?

662
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,840
- Of course, I did.
- Romance?

663
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,040
- Did you, really?
- Of course, I did.

664
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,660
Did you dress up nicely too?

665
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,840
Of course, I dressed up nicely.

666
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,100
Has anyone tried to
hook up with you?

667
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,130
No.

668
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,540
Of course, that never happened.

669
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,200
Did he look all right back then?
Tell me honestly.

670
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,140
He just attracted attention...
To put it simply...

671
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,910
- There were peddlers in the past.
- He was a wingman?

672
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,410
- And there's always a monkey.
- Like drug peddlers.

673
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,640
- The monkey attracted attention.
- That's right.

674
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,950
He played the role of that monkey.

675
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,320
While he was making jokes
to attract girls' attention,

676
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,230
we were sitting down
trying to look cool.

677
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,350
- And then...
- Did he even make anyone laugh?

678
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,850
- Jae Suk?
- Didn't he get nervous?

679
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,830
- He never got nervous about it.
- Really?

680
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,000
- Gosh. That's so funny.
- We always said,

681
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,530
"He's so funny
when he's with his friends,"

682
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,740
- "but he gets nervous on stage."
- That's the biggest problem I have.

683
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
He got too nervous back then.

684
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,810
I still remember
what Suk Jin used to say.

685
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,280
- What is it?
- People would come and go, right?

686
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,100
- Right.
- Many would do that.

687
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,310
- To meet other people?
- Yes.

688
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,440
Suk Jin would say,

689
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,940
"Come join us!
Our room is the room of freedom."

690
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,020
- Yes, I did that.
- What a lousy comment.

691
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,180
I used to say that.

692
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,140
- What's "the room of freedom?"
- "You can..."

693
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,910
- "stay or leave just as you want."
- To come and leave freely.

694
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,330
- The room of freedom.
- "No pressure."

695
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,680
"Our room is the room of freedom."

696
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,120
- Also...
- I was lucky to meet you

697
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,060
(They sang "Beautiful Restriction"
while seeking freedom.)

698
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,500
If a girl they like comes in...

699
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,800
If a girl they like comes in,
they would sing that song.

700
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,970
That's so cheesy.

701
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,740
- You guys wouldn't know.
- Those were good old days.

702
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,810
It's hard for me to picture him
acting so playful...

703
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,340
- in front of women.
- He wasn't shy.

704
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,540
- He was so flippant.
- Exactly how did he act?

705
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,670
- Was he?
- Yes, he was.

706
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,600
- He was...
- I was that type, you know.

707
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,340
I was shy
in front of someone I like.

708
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,410
- I know how that feels.
- But if I wasn't interested in...

709
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,410
- All ugly guys are like that.
- The same goes for Se Chan.

710
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,880
- Se Chan is just like that.
- Ugly guys...

711
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,410
(The tradition of ugly boys
that continued for over 30 years)

712
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,650
- always try to look cool.
- Se Chan is...

713
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,820
He's acting as if he's a celebrity.

714
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,920
Beggars can't be choosers, Jae Suk.

715
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,230
- I just...
- I know how he must've felt.

716
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,620
I couldn't be funny
in front of someone I liked.

717
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,090
- Was anyone your type?
- I just couldn't be funny.

718
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,920
He once...
I think he was 20 something.

719
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,660
He cried his heart in front of me
after a breakup.

720
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,160
- That's true. I cried.
- Yes.

721
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,270
My goodness, Jae Suk.

722
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,160
- I just heard he had a girlfriend.
- Did he have a girlfriend?

723
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,200
- What really happened?
- He pretended he had one.

724
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,540
- There's no one who really exists.
- He lied about it.

725
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,940
- Actually...
- Isn't it so creepy?

726
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,550
He cried when he didn't even
date anyone.

727
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,750
That's creepy.

728
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,750
- Just to make it convincing.
- Exactly.

729
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,910
- "We broke up today."
- No.

730
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,550
- Jae Suk.
- I'm angry but holding it back.

731
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,350
He said he had a girlfriend,
but I never saw his girlfriend.

732
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,290
- He never introduced her to me.
- By the way...

733
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,620
I didn't tell you this, right?

734
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,030
Suk Jin also cried his heart out
in front of me.

735
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,920
- Really? Really?
- Yes.

736
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,970
- Did he cry in front of you?
- Really?

737
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,970
- I can't imagine that.
- Did he really cry?

738
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,900
- I can't imagine them crying.
- He said...

739
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,900
He said it was too painful
while crying.

740
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,980
- That happens when you're sad.
- It's so hilarious.

741
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,200
Also, we didn't have a lot of money
but acted like we were rich.

742
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,080
Pretending to be rich,
we went to a soju bar...

743
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,110
Suk Jin, let's stop it here.

744
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,340
- They won't let us talk.
- What did you say?

745
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,410
- We have good memories too.
- Gosh. Hey.

746
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,350
- You talked about your memories.
- They won't stop talking.

747
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,590
- Can't I talk about mine?
- How much longer will you continue?

748
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,830
- However long it may take.
- I don't want to hear it.

749
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,950
Stop talking about the old days.

750
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,090
Have you two ever succeeded in
hooking up with girls?

751
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,470
Hey, we were awesome.

752
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,590
- Really?
- Of course.

753
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,630
Have you ever succeeded?

754
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,470
- You spent a lot of money, right?
- Of course.

755
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,470
Yes, we did.

756
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,480
(They kept failing
and running out of money back then.)

757
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,040
- He really is talkative.
- I didn't know that happened.

758
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,600
I really am curious how they were
at the time.

759
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,750
The mission
you will carry out here is...

760
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,220
what people who were in college
in the 1990s must've done before.

761
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,440
It's the top-spinning game.

762
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,110
(Top-spinning game)

763
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,410
- I haven't done it in a long time.
- Me neither.

764
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,420
(We rarely see spinning tops now.)

765
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,420
You should make your top
hit someone else's.

766
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,000
- That's right.
- You should tie a knot at the end.

767
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,330
(Whoever is good at spinning tops
was a superstar in the area.)

768
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,300
- We'd put it on the palm of a hand.
- Right.

769
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,240
- We'd drop it onto someone else's.
- After making it spin,

770
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,860
we would make it jump
with the string.

771
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,570
2 groups of 4 people will
have a match,

772
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,280
and only 3 people in each group will
advance to the final match.

773
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,750
Only 5 out of the 6 people will
receive a present.

774
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,080
I haven't done it in a while either.
Do you know how to do it?

775
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,110
Of course, I know.

776
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,340
- I played with it as a little boy.
- Okay.

777
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,880
- Dropping onto another was allowed.
- So Min, I'll show you.

778
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,220
- Watch me.
- You have to tie a knot on top.

779
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,410
- Wrap it around here.
- Like this.

780
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,410
You should wrap it
around your pinky, right?

781
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,880
- Shouldn't you hang it somewhere?
- No, here.

782
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,030
You should wrap it around the top
tightly to make it spin faster.

783
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,890
(Wrap the string around the top
and throw it.)

784
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,530
- And then wrap it around the top.
- Se Chan, you must be good at this.

785
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,920
- I'm a pro at this. I'm worried.
- This makes it spin fast.

786
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,590
- Se Chan, you must be good at this.
- Of course, I am.

787
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,130
I often played with tops
at Dongducheon.

788
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,240
- When you asked for chocolates?
- That's right.

789
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,510
I gave a performance
in front of American soldiers,

790
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,400
and they gave me chocolates.

791
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,550
You should wrap it tightly.

792
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,900
(The more tightly you wrap it,
the better the top spins.)

793
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,020
Oh, my. He's good at it.

794
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,280
But it keeps loosening.

795
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,410
- Why does it look like this?
- You should tie a knot on top.

796
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,520
(Ssaebssaeb's top performance
that mesmerized American soldiers)

797
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,790
- Se Chan is so good at this.
- I did it, but it doesn't work.

798
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
Oh, my. He's good at it.

799
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,560
When I did this,
they gave me chocolates.

800
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,990
He's really good at it.

801
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,390
You're so good at this, Se Chan.

802
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,000
You're wearing the perfect beret
for this game.

803
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,770
(The top-spinning master looks great
in a beret too.)

804
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,230
This brings me back
a lot of old memories.

805
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,800
(He's quite good.)

806
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,200
(Michael Jackson also succeeded in
spinning his top.)

807
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,540
Haha is good at it too.

808
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,510
It's so weird to see Michael Jackson
spinning a top so well.

809
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,080
(Michael Jackson mastered
all Korean cultures.)

810
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,590
I haven't played with a top...

811
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,220
in such a long time.

812
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,820
- Everyone, please step back.
- It's been a long time.

813
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,260
- Oh, no. I failed.
- Hey, hey.

814
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,420
- You just threw it.
- You don't know how to do this.

815
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
It's hard to do
if you haven't done it in a while.

816
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,860
- It's not easy.
- It's because it keeps loosening.

817
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,770
- Se Chan is good at this.
- Se Chan is really good at this.

818
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,040
You move your top around
with the string like this.

819
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,970
Am I doing it the right way? No?

820
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,100
- I failed.
- Come and watch this.

821
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,340
- No. It doesn't work.
- Let me see it.

822
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,900
I don't think we can play this game.

823
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,940
Okay. I got the hang of it.

824
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,110
That's amazing, Jae Suk.

825
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,820
Good. Jae Suk, we should move
closer to each other.

826
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,590
- That's right.
- Let yours come closer to mine.

827
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,110
Lower your body. That's good.

828
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,380
- This is how it's done.
- Yes.

829
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,120
- You're good at this, Jae Suk.
- Of course.

830
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,760
It doesn't require special skills.
Make it spin and hit another top.

831
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,330
- He'll be too nervous in the match.
- You won.

832
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,590
You pulled it off.

833
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,690
You saw that, right?

834
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,470
- You're all used to it now, right?
- Yes.

835
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,390
No. Not at all.

836
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,740
- Let's divide groups by ages.
- Okay.

837
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,510
The 4 oldest members will be
in the 1st group.

838
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,080
- Okay. How does it work?
- How many will move up?

839
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,900
From each group, 3 will move up,
and 6 will go to the final round...

840
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
- where only one will be eliminated.
- Okay.

841
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,480
- Let's start with the older group.
- Okay.

842
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,720
My, this brings me back
good memories.

843
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,910
- You may begin.
- Let's begin.

844
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,720
1, 2, 3.

845
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
(Only 1 out of 4
will be eliminated.)

846
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,610
(Which of them will be eliminated
in the preliminary round?)

847
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,150
- Okay!
- Oh, no.

848
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,590
1, 2, 3.

849
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,120
- Okay!
- Oh, no.

850
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,450
- The 3 of us are safe.
- We'll move up.

851
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
- Good.
- Haha.

852
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,160
(Michael Jackson was hit
by Jae Suk's top.)

853
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,090
- Let's continue the match.
- Keep going.

854
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,500
- Come here.
- You come to me.

855
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,010
- He sounds like a foreigner.
- I'm so sorry.

856
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,010
- He even groans like a foreigner.
- Haha, I'm sorry.

857
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,010
(They'll advance to the final round,
but their pride is on the line.)

858
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,280
- Come over here.
- Come on.

859
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,600
I'll just let it spin
as long as it can.

860
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,080
- I have no reason to attack.
- Come on.

861
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,990
Hey, come over here.

862
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,320
- Let's fight. Come here.
- Come on.

863
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,490
I already made mine jump twice.

864
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,060
Which is the right direction?

865
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,760
None of them will start attacking.

866
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,650
- What's going on?
- It's because we're all so nice.

867
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,830
- Haha's top stopped spinning. Wait.
- That...

868
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,650
- Hey...
- Suk Jin came in last.

869
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,800
- Haha came in second...
- But it doesn't matter, right?

870
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,160
You will be in the final round.

871
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,890
- Next group.
- It's disappointing.

872
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,000
- The group of younger members.
- You never know.

873
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,340
Do you want to try it one more time
in this group?

874
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,600
- What? Yes!
- We won't accept him.

875
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
- I'll join that group.
- No way.

876
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,370
- We don't accept any old fossils.
- We won't accept him.

877
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,370
Since I entered college in 1991...

878
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,810
Why would you try to play
with younger members?

879
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,870
Please let me join you.

880
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,370
- It's done.
- All right.

881
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,480
That's good. Yes.

882
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,670
- That's it. Lower your body.
- He did a great job this time.

883
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,820
He'll get too nervous
in the match anyway.

884
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,640
- Why would he be so nervous?
- You do so well when practicing.

885
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,950
You see how I am, right?

886
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,260
Please take some herbal medicine
for anxiety.

887
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,490
- Hey.
- He would shake so much.

888
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,730
You should pull it well
when you throw it.

889
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,450
- Yes, you should pull it.
- Should I pull it hard?

890
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,120
You should pull it well.

891
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,970
What do you mean by that?
How exactly should I pull it?

892
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,840
Watch this, Kwang Soo.
I'll show you.

893
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,070
Don't just throw it.

894
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,860
- You see what I mean now, right?
- What?

895
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,630
Why would he teach the others
when he's not even good at it?

896
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,870
It was supposed to land
in the center.

897
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,400
But his top flew over there.
Does it make sense?

898
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,080
You should only boast
if you're actually good at this.

899
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,910
- Come on.
- Kwang Soo.

900
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,340
Don't pull it too hard.

901
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,560
Once three of you are left,
the game will be over.

902
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,330
Be calm and cautious. Ready, go.

903
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,450
- He's so mean, right?
- Good.

904
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,330
It's spinning. Okay!

905
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,560
- It's spinning.
- Make it spin faster.

906
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,270
- I pulled it off.
- The three of you will compete.

907
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,330
So Min, bring it on.

908
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,970
(These three will advance
to the final round automatically.)

909
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,500
- Come here.
- Right. You two fight.

910
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,400
You two go ahead
and fight each other.

911
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,870
Hey, stop it.
Both of us can move our tops.

912
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,250
I'm allowed to move my top too.

913
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,510
She's blocking me.

914
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,980
It's moving slowly.

915
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,170
Mine is moving slowly.

916
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,110
No. You should wait. Okay.

917
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,610
(So Min is out!)

918
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,520
- It doesn't matter anyway.
- Hey, you're so sly!

919
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,490
You should've fought too.
Why were you hiding here?

920
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,530
(While So Min
and Se Chan were competing,)

921
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,300
(Jae Suk was waiting anxiously.)

922
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,800
- How could you call me "sly?"
- He was hiding there.

923
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,000
Okay!

924
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,070
We'll begin the final round.

925
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,160
Still, I made it to the final round,
didn't I?

926
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,270
Only one of you will be eliminated.

927
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,270
- Really?
- Really?

928
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,740
If your top doesn't spin, it's over.

929
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
He's right.

930
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,510
We'll give you another chance
if it doesn't spin...

931
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,010
- One more chance? Okay.
- because this is the final round.

932
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,370
I must say,
whatever the director says,

933
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,820
- He listens to the director.
- you follow his decision.

934
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,340
- He always listens to the director.
- He's the decision-maker.

935
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,990
- I mean, earlier on...
- Listen. He's the decision-maker.

936
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,290
Gosh. I mean... Seriously.

937
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,290
- He's the decision-maker...
- Suk Jin, don't call Bo Pil...

938
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,420
to ask him to only use the parts
where you did well when editing.

939
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,830
- I must say, he's unbelievable.
- He's unbelievable.

940
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,300
- He really is unbelievable.
- Gosh.

941
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,530
You don't seem to know
how things work.

942
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,160
I'm impressed. Let's begin.

943
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,690
- Let's begin.
- Shall we? Shall we begin now?

944
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,470
Yes. Ready. Get set. Go.

945
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,700
- Good.
- I threw it too hard.

946
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,810
(Jong Kook, Suk Jin,
So Min, Se Chan, Jae Suk, Haha)

947
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,400
- Good.
- I threw it too hard.

948
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,440
- It's good.
- Good. Keep spinning, Yellow.

949
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,410
- Jong Kook, be careful.
- I should move this chair.

950
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,910
Jong Kook is fighting with a chair.

951
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,440
- No presents for the last place.
- I know.

952
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,090
- All of our tops are spinning.
- Let's fight.

953
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,110
- It's spinning fast.
- They're all spinning fast.

954
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,290
- We shouldn't fight.
- Mine looks precarious.

955
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,720
If we fight, we'll lose.

956
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,730
Your top is
about to touch the camera. Good.

957
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,650
It won't. I'll move the camera.

958
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,530
- Maybe the floor isn't even.
- I'm sweating so much.

959
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,920
- Oh, no. It's uneven here.
- Look.

960
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,120
- His top will stop shortly.
- I'm in trouble.

961
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,590
Oh, gosh. What do I do with mine?

962
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,300
(Jae Suk and Haha's tops are
about to stop.)

963
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,510
- No. It's moving toward the camera.
- His top is going downhill.

964
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,740
- Hey, move aside.
- What is he doing?

965
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,630
- No!
- Kwang Soo, hold this for me.

966
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,980
- Kwang Soo, hold the camera for me.
- Darn!

967
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,900
(Haha's top stopped while Haha was
trying to avoid the camera.)

968
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,520
Hey!

969
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,780
The camera!

970
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,520
Haha is out.

971
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,110
- The camera!
- I'm sorry.

972
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,410
I'm so sorry.
Why were you standing there?

973
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,290
- Is this yours?
- Why would you move the camera?

974
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,350
I'm sorry.

975
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,590
There's no space behind it.

976
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,850
It needs more space. Gosh.

977
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,390
Jong Kook is in fourth place.

978
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
No. I mean, fifth place.

979
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,920
- Gosh. Darn it.
- He's out.

980
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,970
Jae Suk is in fourth place.

981
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,970
Gosh. I'm so disappointed.

982
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,090
- So Min is in third place.
- So Min is out.

983
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,010
Let's do nothing and let it spin.

984
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,480
(Only Se Chan and Suk Jin's tops
are still spinning.)

985
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,100
- No! Keep spinning.
- Maybe I shouldn't have hit it.

986
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,100
(Who will be the winner?)

987
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,700
Let's do nothing and let it spin.

988
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,820
No! Keep spinning.

989
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,110
(Se Chan is out!)

990
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,340
- Keep spinning. I lost to Suk Jin.
- No, no.

991
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,820
- Suk Jin is the winner.
- Suk Jin won.

992
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,990
Suk Jin is in first place.

993
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,030
(Suk Jin is the winner!)

994
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,450
- I knew it.
- He won just as I thought.

995
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,300
- He has a lot of experience.
- You camera!

996
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,690
- I knew it.
- The fifth place gets one, right?

997
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,390
Haha's top was spinning faster
than the others.

998
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,420
Haha, I'm... I'm so sorry.

999
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,690
All of you except for Haha,

1000
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,630
please choose a present you want.

1001
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,480
- The glass bottle.
- The vintage doll.

1002
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,600
I pick the comic books.

1003
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:49,010
You'll leave 1 by 1
just as you did earlier...

1004
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,610
to decide the number of presents
you'll get on the next mission.

1005
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,610
Okay.

1006
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,520
Suk Jin will go first
since he won the game.

1007
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,640
(Big Nose,
the top-spinning winner goes first!)

1008
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,490
(The number of presents
will be decided through this game!)

1009
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,720
Is this it? What should I do here?

1010
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,180
- Starting now...
- Yes.

1011
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,830
- Do you see the snack over there?
- Yes.

1012
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,450
Throw and eat as many pieces as
you can.

1013
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,860
- Throw and eat?
- Yes.

1014
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,390
This? Okay.
This is my favorite snack.

1015
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,890
- I'm good at this.
- Okay. The mission ended.

1016
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,970
It's over.

1017
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,810
- Please give me the bag.
- I didn't even start.

1018
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,510
You're ridiculous.

1019
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,510
You should've at least told me
when to begin.

1020
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,440
Eating the snack wasn't the mission.

1021
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,340
We wanted to see how you open
the bag.

1022
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,340
My gosh.

1023
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,880
You ripped it open lengthwise.

1024
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,380
The number of the members
who open it the same way as you...

1025
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,620
will be the number of presents.

1026
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,620
However, we'll tell the next person
to throw and eat the snack...

1027
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,030
just as we told you.

1028
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,920
- Pretend like that's the mission.
- Got it.

1029
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,620
I should hope many of them
will open it the way I did.

1030
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,620
That's right.

1031
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,540
I think most of them will.

1032
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,070
(How many of them
will open the bag lengthwise?)

1033
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,480
(Next up is Se Chan.)

1034
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,080
- Should I go in?
- Yes.

1035
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
Okay.

1036
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,440
(Suk Jin is wearing a mask
not to say anything.)

1037
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,020
Throw and eat the snack over there.

1038
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,180
You have to eat more than he did
to succeed.

1039
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,520
We won't tell you how many he ate.

1040
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,620
- Can I start now?
- Yes.

1041
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,560
- I should throw and eat?
- Correct.

1042
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,970
(If he opens it lengthwise
as Suk Jin did, it's a success.)

1043
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,860
I'm sure he didn't eat a lot.

1044
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,240
(Se Chan grabs the bag widthwise!)

1045
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,600
(But then...
He picks up the scissors!)

1046
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,100
I should eat more
than he did, right?

1047
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,630
If you eat more than he did,
you succeed.

1048
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,700
The mission is over.

1049
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,900
(The mission is over!)

1050
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,910
The mission is over.

1051
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,910
(Why?)

1052
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,750
- My gosh.
- Actually, the mission is not...

1053
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,180
- about eating the snacks.
- Did you use the scissors?

1054
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,530
You succeed only when you open
the bag the same way Suk Jin did.

1055
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,350
But he ripped it open lengthwise.

1056
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,030
(Suk Jin ripped it open lengthwise
whereas Se Chan used scissors.)

1057
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,030
Why would you use scissors?

1058
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,770
I felt like it was a hassle,
so I used the scissors.

1059
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,690
The scissors are a trap.

1060
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,810
Think about it. Why would there be
saw-tooth patterns on top?

1061
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,900
- It has that shape...
- I know.

1062
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,080
- to make it easy to rip it.
- I get that, but...

1063
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
(While Suk Jin is claiming
it's easier to open it lengthwise,)

1064
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,200
(So Min enters.)

1065
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,220
Throw and eat the snack
in 30 seconds.

1066
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,940
There's no way I can succeed.
Se Chan is good at it.

1067
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,490
(Without hesitating,)

1068
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,490
(she picks up the scissors!)

1069
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,550
But why do we open a new bag?

1070
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,720
The mission is over.

1071
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,490
Why?

1072
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,820
Actually, you had to...

1073
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,720
open the bag the same way
as the first person did...

1074
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,320
to succeed.

1075
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,800
Suk Jin, why didn't you
use the scissors?

1076
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,160
- Exactly. Right?
- They were right here.

1077
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,010
This way?

1078
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,800
(Jae Suk, the fourth member!)

1079
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,800
(He's trying to get a hint
with all his might.)

1080
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,450
There he goes again.
He won't come in.

1081
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,450
- He's trying to figure it out.
- He's doing it again.

1082
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,410
- He's pretending to be smart.
- Come on in, Jae Suk.

1083
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,640
Should I sit in the center?

1084
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,890
No, that's not it.

1085
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,450
So Min, please don't say anything.
Jae Suk, please come in.

1086
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,660
- We're not allowed to speak.
- You must not speak from now.

1087
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,350
All right. You will...

1088
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,760
throw and eat the snack.

1089
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,930
You'll succeed if you eat more
than the previous member did.

1090
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,100
We won't tell you...

1091
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,340
- Should I throw and eat it myself?
- Yes.

1092
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,370
We won't tell you.

1093
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,430
(Jae Suk is fooled
by the fake rule.)

1094
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,600
(He's walking toward the snack
with swag.)

1095
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,510
(The others are quietly watching
everything Jae Suk does.)

1096
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,410
Well... This is...

1097
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,510
(He grabbed the edge of the bag!)

1098
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,620
(Jae Suk and Suk Jin have been
friends for 30 years.)

1099
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,050
(What could be his choice?)

1100
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,720
Well... This is...

1101
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,720
The mission is over.

1102
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
(Jae Suk used the scissors too!)

1103
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,320
(What?)

1104
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,760
- Hey.
- Actually, the mission wasn't...

1105
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,390
about eating more snacks
than the previous person,

1106
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,220
but about checking how you open
a bag of snacks.

1107
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,260
Why would you rip it open
when you have scissors?

1108
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,470
Gosh. Why would the top side
be saw-toothed?

1109
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,890
- For you to rip it open easily.
- But the scissors are right there.

1110
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,410
But using scissors makes it
even easier to open.

1111
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,640
We are so different
from one another.

1112
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,100
- It's interesting.
- I can trust only Jong Kook.

1113
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,740
He wouldn't use the scissors.

1114
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,800
Who's the next?

1115
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,280
(Big Nose's only hope,
Jong Kook is here.)

1116
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,910
You'll succeed if you eat more
than the previous member did.

1117
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,240
Oh, I throw it myself?

1118
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,090
I see, but Suk Jin is good
at things like this.

1119
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,180
You have to eat more than he did
to succeed.

1120
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,280
(How will Jong Kook,
whom Big Nose trusts, open the bag?)

1121
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,720
(He chose to use the scissors.)

1122
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,990
The mission is over.

1123
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,990
(He only cut the corner.)

1124
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,620
- See?
- I knew it.

1125
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,470
(All of them except for Suk Jin
used the scissors!)

1126
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,260
- I knew it.
- What is wrong with you?

1127
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,010
- Hey, why did such a strong man...
- Of course, he used the scissors.

1128
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,100
- use scissors?
- Of course, I used the scissors.

1129
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,340
- You should rip it open this way.
- Did you open it like that?

1130
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,780
He only ripped it that way
to seem younger.

1131
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,550
I would've too
if the scissors weren't here,

1132
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,220
- but they were.
- Exactly.

1133
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,720
I thought we were
supposed to use it.

1134
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,780
Be honest with me.

1135
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,890
- Did you give me the scissors?
- Yes.

1136
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,780
I never saw them though.

1137
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,050
Suk Jin, please.

1138
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,450
Don't be like that.

1139
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,600
- Is it this way?
- His appearance makes me laugh.

1140
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,100
Look.

1141
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,820
- Come on in.
- It's Michael Jackson.

1142
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,390
- Michael Jackson.
- He's back.

1143
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,640
There's no need to be tense.

1144
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,840
His entrance always gets me.

1145
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,140
I laugh every single time.

1146
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,970
It's not at all difficult.

1147
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,240
(After hearing the fake rules,
he heads to the snack pack.)

1148
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,700
All you have to do
is eat more than the one before you.

1149
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,950
(Glancing)

1150
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,510
How should I rip it open?

1151
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,570
(Michael Jackson is onto something.)

1152
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,890
(All eyes are on the member
who guessed the real mission.)

1153
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,090
(Which way will he
rip open the bag?)

1154
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,350
(Contemplating)

1155
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,820
Wait.

1156
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,990
(Suk Jin couldn't seem
more desperate.)

1157
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,600
This is how people usually
rip it open.

1158
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,800
But I open it this way.

1159
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,030
(But I open it this way.)

1160
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,430
Do I go with the American style?

1161
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,740
Americans open it this way.

1162
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,950
Don't worry about what they think.

1163
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,620
I'll give you 3 seconds. 3...

1164
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,320
- Hold on a second.
- Two.

1165
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,620
(He dances his old move again
and turns his back to the camera.)

1166
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,760
(He then makes eye contact.)

1167
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,050
This is hilarious.

1168
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,590
(What will MJ choose to do?)

1169
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,930
(He chooses the American way.)

1170
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,870
- The mission is over.
- What? Why?

1171
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,260
- I'm such an idiot.
- That was smart.

1172
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,370
- What? Why?
- You're the weird one, Suk Jin.

1173
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,390
This is crazy.

1174
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,970
The mission is over.

1175
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,870
Don't people open snacks this way?

1176
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:53,280
(Ji Hyo chooses the scissors
while Kwang Soo makes a fuss.)

1177
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,410
(He ends up choosing the scissors.)

1178
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,780
The mission is over.

1179
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,550
Why was it so much work for you?

1180
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,010
Use your brain.

1181
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,010
He almost cut his hand just now.

1182
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,220
- What is it?
- This mission...

1183
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,280
was about opening the snack...

1184
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,390
in the same way Suk Jin did.

1185
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,100
- No one did.
- No one.

1186
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,700
Don't you open it
from top to bottom?

1187
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,970
But it wouldn't open.

1188
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,530
Why would there be
a serrated edge here?

1189
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,390
- See this right here?
- That's not the issue...

1190
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,240
- because we had scissors.
- This is how you should open it.

1191
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,870
We were given scissors
to open it easily.

1192
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,140
The scissors were provided.

1193
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,930
No one opened the snack
like Suk Jin did,

1194
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,410
so no gifts will be picked up
at the next location.

1195
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,450
This is bad.

1196
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,910
Let's go and eat next.

1197
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,450
- This is bad.
- We just don't click.

1198
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,780
- It must be shaved pork belly.
- No way.

1199
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,950
Frozen pork belly.

1200
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,720
- It'll be delicious.
- This is really good.

1201
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,950
Frozen pork belly?

1202
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,350
(Frozen pork belly was the soul food
of students...)

1203
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,260
(in the 1980s and 1990s
who desired cheap but hearty food.)

1204
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,490
Look at him walk into
the pork belly restaurant.

1205
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,140
Could the picture be any weirder?

1206
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,340
- MJ!
- Why are you all looking at me?

1207
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,600
- You look weird almost everywhere.
- Was it this easy to be funny?

1208
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,870
It's just too much.

1209
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,200
Being funny is the easiest.

1210
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,970
- I love it.
- I love it too.

1211
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,370
Today, you're more of a thug.

1212
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,850
One that beats laughter out of us.

1213
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,280
I love it.

1214
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,990
There aren't any gifts
to be won in this round,

1215
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,760
so you'll go ahead and eat.

1216
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,160
- I'm hungry.
- Bring it in.

1217
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,890
- Can we all eat?
- Of course.

1218
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,620
Frozen pork belly is to die for.

1219
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,660
- It's been a while for me.
- This looks delicious.

1220
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,760
- The plates are old-fashioned too.
- This is authentic...

1221
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,970
- Korean food.
- It brings back memories.

1222
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,660
Frozen pork belly is the best.

1223
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,410
Okay, let me.

1224
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,510
(Se Chan's about to grill
the meat when...)

1225
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,640
(He places them on the grill
one by one.)

1226
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,240
This looks delicious.

1227
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,910
Hey.

1228
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,910
Just pour them on there.
Don't you know how it's done?

1229
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,450
(Don't you know how it's done?)

1230
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,620
Just put those all on there.

1231
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,390
- There's no need to be angry.
- Exactly.

1232
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,550
- I just...
- Why does that anger you?

1233
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,720
I'm sorry, Suk Jin.

1234
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,120
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it.

1235
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,220
(Seok Sam just froze the mood.)

1236
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,660
- Can't we eat comfortably?
- I don't get it.

1237
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,090
- That's not it.
- Suk Jin...

1238
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,760
That was me being opinionated.

1239
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,930
(Seok Sam is too excited
by this trip down memory lane.)

1240
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,320
There's no need to get angry.

1241
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,800
How can I be angry when I'm smiling?

1242
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,490
Should I sprinkle the pepper?

1243
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,200
- I would...
- A little later.

1244
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,640
- Hey.
- Really?

1245
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,530
- Not yet.
- Of course you should.

1246
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,030
Haha says not now.

1247
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,930
- What's going on?
- Exactly.

1248
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,910
- Can you let us eat by ourselves?
- And the motorcycle.

1249
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,780
I'm sorry to ask,
but can you just stick to your side?

1250
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,820
What are you saying?

1251
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,450
Are you drawing a line between us?

1252
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,950
You're unbelievable.

1253
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,220
Aren't we here on a trip together?

1254
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,450
- A trip?
- What?

1255
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,050
- How is this a trip?
- That's not the case.

1256
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,680
We're filming a variety show.

1257
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,260
Why would you
sprinkle pepper on these?

1258
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,030
- He did it on ours.
- It's the highlight of this dish.

1259
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,470
- We don't want any pepper.
- But frozen pork belly...

1260
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,720
We don't like pepper
with our frozen pork belly.

1261
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,660
- Are you kidding me?
- Jong Kook,

1262
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,370
- take that from him.
- Hey.

1263
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,430
- I don't want any pepper with mine.
- Suk Jin.

1264
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,570
Sprinkle some on your head,
why don't you?

1265
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,970
(Sprinkling pepper on his head
is recommended.)

1266
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,180
That's a good idea.

1267
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,370
Very good. Nicely done.

1268
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,320
- Yes, just like that.
- That's the best option.

1269
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,010
It's a good idea.

1270
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,950
- Does it seem denser now?
- Yes.

1271
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,410
Anyone who needs it should go next.

1272
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,050
- Should I sprinkle some more?
- No, I'm good.

1273
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,450
Right on top of the head.

1274
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,890
- They're good to eat now.
- Gosh.

1275
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,430
- Let's enjoy it.
- We'll enjoy it!

1276
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,240
(Seok Sam enjoys it too...)

1277
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,240
(despite not getting his way
with the pepper.)

1278
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,340
How is it?

1279
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,430
Can you say this is cooked?

1280
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,640
It's good.

1281
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,510
(It fills the stomachs
of hungry students.)

1282
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,840
(Haha is welcomed into
the world of frozen pork belly too.)

1283
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,350
It's to die for. This is crazy.

1284
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,910
(Haha is welcomed into
the world of frozen pork belly too.)

1285
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,950
You know,

1286
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,620
to be here with Michael Jackson...

1287
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,120
Tell me about it.

1288
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,350
- The restaurant will get famous.
- It'll hit the jackpot.

1289
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,490
Do you like frozen pork belly?

1290
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,390
- Bacon?
- Bacon.

1291
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,180
- Nice bacon.
- This is killing me.

1292
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,530
- Gosh.
- How is it?

1293
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,490
This is crazy. It's really good.

1294
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,970
Why does he sound so awkward?

1295
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,700
Why...

1296
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,800
Come on. You should elaborate.

1297
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,430
Why? I don't want to be good at it.

1298
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,030
You don't want to be good at it?

1299
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,280
(What does he mean by that?)

1300
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,680
- You don't want to be good at it?
- I'm not good at it.

1301
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,870
Shouldn't one say
he's not good at it?

1302
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,950
Suk Jin,

1303
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,620
- are you a foreigner too?
- Are you Michael Suk Jin?

1304
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,590
- Suk Jin Jackson?
- You're not making any sense.

1305
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,780
Why not just dress like Haha?

1306
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,160
Which Korean language school
do you go to?

1307
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,220
- Yonsei.
- Yonsei?

1308
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,280
- I'm like this at home though.
- You can start eating now.

1309
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,660
- This is hilarious.
- So don't say it's weird.

1310
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,850
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1311
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,160
It's Chapaghetti.

1312
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,200
Gosh, thank you so much.

1313
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,840
You should eat that with...

1314
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,430
- With the noodles.
- It's to die for.

1315
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,800
- That's mine.
- No, it's mine.

1316
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,240
- It's mine!
- The Chapaghetti.

1317
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,840
It's mine!

1318
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,910
What's wrong with you?

1319
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,240
- Let's share.
- You can have some later.

1320
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,870
I haven't seen anyone
be this childish before.

1321
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,490
Unbelievable.

1322
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,950
How many do you have left?

1323
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,350
What?

1324
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,590
- None?
- I'm sure there's more.

1325
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,030
Hey. Darn you.

1326
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,430
What's the matter with you?

1327
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,620
Unbelievable.

1328
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,220
(Seok Sam's outcries
lead them to share.)

1329
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,870
- It's been cooked well.
- I can't believe it.

1330
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,430
Why don't I...

1331
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,160
eat it deliciously?

1332
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,300
(After cooling down
the noodles a bit...)

1333
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,840
He's making it look so good.

1334
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,870
- South Korea.
- No one eats noodles like he does.

1335
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,240
He makes it look good.

1336
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,450
(What's enjoyable
is considered as protein.)

1337
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,180
What do you need?

1338
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,620
Aren't you curious
as to how that tastes?

1339
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,390
- Do you want some?
- Sure.

1340
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,450
(Smirking)

1341
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,450
- That...
- Michael, do you want some?

1342
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,990
- Does it intrigue you?
- Yes.

1343
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,490
("Running Entertainment News")

1344
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,600
What's that?

1345
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,570
Is that jjamppong?

1346
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,760
- No, it's not jjamppong.
- It's jjolmyeon.

1347
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,530
- Jjolmyeon?
- It's jjolmyeon.

1348
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,140
J, j, o, l.

1349
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,870
J, j, o, l. Jjol.

1350
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,280
I get it. It's jjol!

1351
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:31,620
I had forgotten
how good frozen pork belly is.

1352
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,950
(Suk Jin steals it
as soon as it's cooked.)

1353
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:34,950
My gosh.

1354
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,550
This is the best.

1355
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,450
- The kimchi.
- Isn't the kimchi good?

1356
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,450
- Look at Suk Jin's eyes.
- Why?

1357
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,990
He's dead serious and hungry.

1358
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,620
He's set on having his fill today.

1359
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
- Suk Jin, my friend.
- Yes.

1360
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,300
Oh, no.

1361
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,870
- No.
- No?

1362
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,160
That's not what I like.

1363
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,840
(Michael's generosity
is too much for Seok Sam.)

1364
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,600
(After enjoying
a good amount of pork...)

1365
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,780
I'd love some rice with this.

1366
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,530
I see you eat meat with rice.

1367
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:00,850
Yes, I do.

1368
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,140
How many would you like?

1369
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,450
- I think it's just Suk Jin.
- Well...

1370
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,180
But you had the noodles.

1371
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,720
- But still.
- You still want the rice?

1372
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,590
- There's always room for rice.
- Can we get a bowl of rice?

1373
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,350
Sure. Don't you think about
stealing from me.

1374
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,510
(Suk Jin answers...)

1375
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,530
(when the order is made.)

1376
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,680
Suk Jin.

1377
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,050
(Seok Sam's blinded by gluttony.)

1378
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:20,120
- Why did you answer him?
- Am I not allowed to do that?

1379
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,600
What do you mean?

1380
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,320
I'm genuinely worried now.

1381
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,470
- Are you okay?
- Suk Jin.

1382
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,410
The bowl of rice...

1383
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,300
What's with you today?

1384
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,470
Is something up with you?

1385
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,200
Is this a restaurant you know?

1386
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,700
(Nothing's up with him,
and it's not a restaurant he owns.)

1387
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,640
- What's with him?
- What's gotten into you?

1388
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,370
Thank you.

1389
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,240
(Suk Jin's bowl of rice is served.)

1390
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,010
Nothing beats this, you know.

1391
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,160
With the rice?

1392
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,280
(He's curious.)

1393
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,050
No one's eating rice over here.

1394
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,760
(He said that when
it's only him eating rice.)

1395
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,620
- I...
- Suk Jin's out of it.

1396
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,120
Why?

1397
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,430
He needs to eat,

1398
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,820
respond to what we say,

1399
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,530
work the show,

1400
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,260
and listen to the director.

1401
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,200
- Right.
- He has so much to do.

1402
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,840
That's why...

1403
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,200
Suk Jin.

1404
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,600
Look at him eat.

1405
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,970
He just won't stop eating.

1406
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,450
- I know.
- Look at his chopsticks move.

1407
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,950
Who knew they could move this fast?

1408
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,140
What's with you today?

1409
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,390
I'm so glad this was fully cooked.

1410
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:16,950
He's nimble today as well.

1411
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,890
(After eating their fill...)

1412
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,050
Gosh, that was enjoyable.

1413
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,220
I'm full now.

1414
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,820
I'm turning off the stove.

1415
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,660
We're done, right?
Does anyone want more?

1416
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,760
Me.

1417
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,070
(Me!)

1418
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:29,700
For how long are you going to eat?

1419
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,240
- What about the show?
- That's enough.

1420
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,700
You should eat more
when you get home.

1421
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,030
- Suk Jin's eating a lot today.
- Tell me about it.

1422
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,930
- His appetite must be back.
- I think that's the case.

1423
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,240
Gosh, this is good.

1424
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,850
It'll be funny
if Suk Jin gets a stomachache.

1425
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,320
- "I'm not feeling well."
- "What... What's wrong with me?"

1426
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,410
"We should stop filming
for a second."

1427
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,010
- "Something's wrong."
- "Bo Pil, hold on."

1428
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,320
"Bo Pil, can you edit this out?"

1429
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,350
- "Call an ambulance."
- "An ambulance."

1430
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,450
No way.

1431
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,260
He'll be like this. "Gosh!"

1432
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,120
"Bo Pil, only air the scenes
where I look healthy."

1433
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,660
"What could be wrong with me?"

1434
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,700
"I'm dying over here."

1435
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,160
If that happens,

1436
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,700
it'll be a funny way
to end the show.

1437
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,410
Suk Jin develops a stomachache.

1438
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,070
- That's the worst.
- Suk Jin's stomachache.

1439
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,430
Imagine calling him tomorrow
only to hear him say this.

1440
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,910
"I'm in the hospital."

1441
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,800
(He'd say he's in the hospital
if Jae Suk calls him tomorrow.)

1442
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,870
(Suk Jin's story would suddenly
develop into a hospital scene.)

1443
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,240
"Did I add too much pepper?"

1444
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,410
"The doctor told me
not to eat burnt food."

1445
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,010
It's killing me.

1446
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,280
When will you put down
your chopsticks, Suk Jin?

1447
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,350
(The pork belly lover
finally puts down his chopsticks.)

1448
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,200
- Everyone. Now we'll decide...
- It was good!

1449
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,100
on the number of gifts
you'll acquire in the next spot.

1450
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:37,970
This mission is to take selfies...

1451
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,200
to capture your happy moments
right now.

1452
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,490
(Taking Selfies to Capture
Your Happy Moments)

1453
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:41,970
Everyone will stand
in front of the camera.

1454
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,030
Once the three-second timer starts,

1455
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,950
you'll hide so that no one
can be captured in the picture.

1456
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,100
- The picture?
- We have to hide?

1457
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,050
You'll get a total of eight chances.

1458
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,510
Each time you fail,

1459
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,280
the number of gifts will be deducted
by one.

1460
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,350
(1 gift will be deducted
each time they fail.)

1461
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,850
We will make it easier gradually.

1462
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:58,850
(But it will get easier gradually.)

1463
00:46:58,850 --> 00:46:59,990
We have to hide?

1464
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:01,660
- All right.
- We can't just turn our backs?

1465
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,720
You have to hide
your body completely.

1466
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,800
- There's nowhere to hide though.
- How are we supposed to hide?

1467
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,700
There's no way
we can hide completely in here.

1468
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,930
We should all hide under the tables.

1469
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,640
- It's a group mission, right?
- Yes, it's a group mission.

1470
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,800
Let's give it a try
since you have many chances.

1471
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,570
Here we go. Get ready.

1472
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,030
It's three seconds.

1473
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,410
Set, go!

1474
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,740
(3 seconds start.)

1475
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,570
2, 1.

1476
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,240
Why are you blocking me?

1477
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,490
(Wrestling)

1478
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:29,720
- Why would you block him?
- Why are you doing this?

1479
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,950
- Why did you block me?
- What's wrong with you?

1480
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,120
- My gosh.
- I was trying to hide, but...

1481
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,620
- You're so mischievous.
- This isn't an individual mission.

1482
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:38,030
- It's not an individual mission!
- You should've moved!

1483
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,820
It's a group mission.

1484
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,370
- My gosh.
- We lost the chance.

1485
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,660
You see? Everyone is in the picture.

1486
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,660
They are.

1487
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,970
Anyway, that's a fail.

1488
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,260
We'll move to a spot
that's a little easier.

1489
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,640
- My gosh.
- It's close by.

1490
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,510
(The alley outside the restaurant
is a little more spacious.)

1491
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,100
Isn't the alley more difficult
than the restaurant?

1492
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,680
(So Min came outside first
to look for a spot to hide.)

1493
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,450
There's nowhere to hide.

1494
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,240
(Smiling)

1495
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,890
Let's take a photo, Ji Hyo.

1496
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
Shall we jump?

1497
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,260
(Precious sisters,
the sentiment of the old days)

1498
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,300
(These girls are having fun
with the burst mode.)

1499
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,160
- We have to hide in the alley?
- Yes.

1500
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,240
- I'll hide here.
- Ji Hyo!

1501
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,510
Ji Hyo! Can you see me or not?

1502
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,870
- I can't see you.
- I'll hide here.

1503
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:26,930
Can you see me, Ji Hyo?

1504
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,680
What about me?

1505
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,070
Kwang Soo, that won't work.
I think putting this on will help.

1506
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,550
- You want me to put that on?
- If you put this on...

1507
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,740
If you put this on and stand,
they wouldn't know.

1508
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,820
(Se Chan suggests Kwang Soo
put on a safety cone to hide.)

1509
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,890
Put it on.

1510
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,620
- Like this?
- No one would know it's you.

1511
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,850
- I can't see you.
- Right?

1512
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,030
- You can't see me?
- No.

1513
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,090
Where did Kwang Soo go?

1514
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,100
- Kwang Soo!
- Kwang Soo passed.

1515
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,600
- He passed.
- Really?

1516
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,160
- Yes.
- You'll let me pass if I do this?

1517
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,740
They're making fun of you.

1518
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,430
(Darn you.)

1519
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,070
Where will you hide?

1520
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,870
I'll go up there with Se Chan.

1521
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,200
- Kwang Soo, listen.
- So Min and I'll go there.

1522
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,410
Gather around, everyone,
so I can see all of you.

1523
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,070
- This is... Wait a minute.
- Gather around.

1524
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,240
You should press the button, Haha.

1525
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,240
Run as fast as you can.

1526
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:09,950
- I'll run right after you do.
- Don't hide there.

1527
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,050
Okay!

1528
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,620
- Wait.
- Okay!

1529
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,390
Wait. Why is he so tense?

1530
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:16,680
- What's wrong with you?
- I'll run that way.

1531
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,430
- Okay. Run that way.
- You're sweating.

1532
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,550
I'll run that way.

1533
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,760
Press it.

1534
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,660
1, 2, 3.

1535
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,720
Move!

1536
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,800
(3 seconds start.)

1537
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,840
(Seok Sam and Jong Kook
run and hide behind the door.)

1538
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,370
(Ji Hyo and So Min hide in front
of the door as promised.)

1539
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
Move!

1540
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,070
(His overalls slipped down?)

1541
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,740
(He reveals his underwear
while trying to climb up the wall.)

1542
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,990
(He freezes in shock.)

1543
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:45,620
(He's like a salmon flapping around
after failing to return home.)

1544
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,410
What are you doing? Come on.

1545
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,220
- Come on, Kwang Soo!
- I'm sorry.

1546
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,490
- Hey.
- My gosh, seriously.

1547
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:51,550
What's with you?

1548
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:52,620
One of you should've hidden
somewhere else.

1549
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,030
- Hey!
- Why did you...

1550
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,370
- I'm sorry.
- His pants came off.

1551
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,760
- I'm sorry.
- Listen.

1552
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,890
- Let's check out the photo.
- All right.

1553
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,140
The one who presses the button...

1554
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,930
- should hide somewhere close.
- He's right!

1555
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:03,970
The one at the back
should go the farthest.

1556
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,370
Look at Kwang Soo.

1557
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,700
- Gosh, Kwang Soo.
- Darn it.

1558
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,740
You should grab me, Se Chan.

1559
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,010
I shouldn't run.

1560
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,140
Why are your pants off?

1561
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,780
- This thing just slipped.
- He took them off himself.

1562
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,090
- Seriously.
- This slipped.

1563
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:16,390
We should move a little faster.

1564
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,590
- I'm in the picture too.
- You are?

1565
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,720
I'm almost in the picture. You see?

1566
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,590
Everyone, please gather
in front of the camera.

1567
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,950
Hurry. Let's do this then.

1568
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,280
The ones at the back...

1569
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,620
- should go the farthest.
- Hide as much as you can.

1570
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,930
Also, I'm really fast,

1571
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,120
so make way for me.

1572
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,070
- I think...
- You're fast?

1573
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,470
you'll fall when we do the mission.

1574
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,800
- I think you'll fall.
- Make way for me since I'm fast.

1575
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,740
Kwang Soo, don't stand there.
Stand with Se Chan.

1576
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,010
- I'll go over there.
- That's right.

1577
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,140
- I couldn't climb the wall.
- Ready.

1578
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,180
- Ready.
- I'll hold you.

1579
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,240
Run fast.

1580
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,570
Set, go!

1581
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,300
- Hurry!
- You punk.

1582
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,870
- Hurry!
- You punk.

1583
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,620
(Hurrying off)

1584
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,890
(They manage to hide
faster than before.)

1585
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:50,910
We got it.

1586
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,280
- No, no.
- We aren't in the photo.

1587
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,450
- What was I supposed to do then?
- We chose the same spot.

1588
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:55,760
- Haha didn't...
- I think we got it.

1589
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,260
- Come on, Suk Jin!
- My gosh.

1590
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,120
- Suk Jin. Jong Kook!
- Why? What's wrong?

1591
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,120
Haha and I hid in the same spot.

1592
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,570
It got messed up.

1593
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:03,820
Suk Jin is actually showing
a V-sign.

1594
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:04,840
What were you doing?

1595
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,640
- Suk Jin is showing a V-sign.
- Wait, am I in the picture too?

1596
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:09,100
- All right.
- I laughed because it was funny.

1597
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,070
We'll give you
five seconds from now.

1598
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,470
- Okay.
- Five seconds is more than enough.

1599
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,680
We can hide in five seconds.

1600
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,050
- We have enough time.
- Just run as fast as you can.

1601
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,070
Everyone, run.

1602
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,280
Ready. You need to run fast.

1603
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,350
- You too, Suk Jin.
- Okay.

1604
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:20,570
- I'll push you.
- Ready.

1605
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,910
Set, go!

1606
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:22,910
Go, go, go!

1607
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,680
Go!

1608
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,620
Go!

1609
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,780
Go!

1610
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,820
(Amid the busy crowd,)

1611
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,660
(the two middle-aged men
struggle to hide.)

1612
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,350
Who grabbed me? Darn it.

1613
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,430
- I... Who was it?
- Come on!

1614
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,370
- Why would you grab me?
- I didn't grab you!

1615
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,370
This is...

1616
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,370
Gosh, Suk Jin.

1617
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,570
Suk Jin, Jae Suk.

1618
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,200
- Suk Jin.
- What's wrong with them?

1619
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,300
Does everyone have to hide?

1620
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,340
Of course.

1621
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,840
Everyone needs to hide?

1622
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,570
- That's what we're doing!
- By the way,

1623
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,200
- Who made this rule?
- why does everyone have to hide?

1624
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,140
- Why do you need to be so strict?
- Seriously.

1625
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,550
You're too strict.

1626
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:54,620
We have only a few left.

1627
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,280
- How many do we have? 4?
- There are 4 gifts left.

1628
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,350
- If so, then let's try again.
- Only four can get the gifts.

1629
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,660
You need to gather in front
of the camera before beginning.

1630
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,280
- Jackson, look at the camera.
- Jackson.

1631
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,950
1, 2, 3! Move!

1632
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,990
(They're off!)

1633
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,760
Three! Move!

1634
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,930
(Stampeding)

1635
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,870
(After a few trials,)

1636
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,530
(they hurriedly run and hide
behind the doors.)

1637
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,680
I might be seen.

1638
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,680
(Ha Jackson does not lose his pose
until the end.)

1639
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,680
(Did we get it?)

1640
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,910
All right. Please check.

1641
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,350
- Did everyone go inside?
- Why are we fighting...

1642
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,680
- among ourselves?
- I'm sure we got it.

1643
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,410
We got it.

1644
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,260
- We got it, didn't we?
- We got it, right?

1645
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,890
- Gosh, Jae Suk!
- If you are in the picture...

1646
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,820
- Jae Suk is in the picture!
- What?

1647
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,200
- What's wrong with you?
- You should've moved inside.

1648
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,390
- Jae Suk.
- Whose are these colorful shoes?

1649
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,200
- I really moved deep inside.
- Darn you.

1650
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,970
(A colorful shoe
was caught on camera.)

1651
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:47,490
- I mean...
- Whose are these colorful shoes?

1652
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,410
- I mean, I did move...
- What on earth happened?

1653
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,430
I really moved deep inside.

1654
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,280
What's wrong with him seriously?

1655
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,410
This is unbelievable.

1656
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,010
- You should just run.
- What's wrong with you?

1657
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,680
- This will be our last chance.
- For real.

1658
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,620
- Let's go, entering class of 1991!
- Let's do it!

1659
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,120
- Let's do it.
- You should run to the restaurant.

1660
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,120
- I'll do that.
- We need to succeed this time.

1661
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,990
Just hide behind the doors!
Come here, you.

1662
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,090
- Just hide behind there.
- Go behind there.

1663
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,510
- Run.
- I'll follow you.

1664
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,760
Just follow me.

1665
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,350
We can all hide there
since we have five seconds.

1666
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,350
Let's all hide behind the doors.

1667
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:11,720
Yes, we have more than enough time.

1668
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,760
Let's all hide behind the doors.

1669
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,890
You'll have to look at the camera
before you start.

1670
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,030
- I can't...
- Jackson.

1671
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,600
- Stand in front of me.
- Guys.

1672
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,930
- Haha, come to the front.
- Jackson.

1673
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,530
- I can see my face.
- Jackson.

1674
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,100
- Jackson, you're too far away.
- Come closer, Jackson.

1675
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,200
Come on.

1676
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,600
You'll keep calling me Jackson?

1677
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,600
(He's happy about it.)

1678
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,200
He likes it.

1679
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,700
Ready.

1680
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,100
- Go! Run!
- Run!

1681
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,870
(They try hiding within 5 seconds
for the 6th time.)

1682
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,720
Come inside. Stick to the wall.

1683
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,490
(Almost everyone managed
to reach the doors.)

1684
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:44,090
(Michael Jackson who lives for style
manages to strike a pose.)

1685
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,480
Come inside. Stick to the wall.

1686
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,920
Okay.

1687
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,460
There's no way we'd fail this time.

1688
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,030
- Did we get it?
- I have a bad feeling about it.

1689
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,190
(They come outside
with much confidence.)

1690
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,500
(There's no way
we'd fail this time.)

1691
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,670
- We got it, right?
- We got it this time.

1692
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,670
- I think we got it.
- I think Jae Suk's in it.

1693
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,130
- No way we'd fail this time.
- I'm not in it.

1694
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:23,510
(They need to succeed this time
to get 3 gifts at least.)

1695
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,780
(Although he was the main reason
for failing so far,)

1696
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,940
(Jae Suk seems confident.)

1697
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,840
- He's in it, right?
- No, he's not.

1698
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,980
- We got it!
- We got it!

1699
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,380
It's perfect.

1700
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,650
I can't believe this worked.

1701
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:34,690
We did it.

1702
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,820
- Go! Run!
- Run!

1703
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,690
Come inside. Stick to the wall.

1704
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:44,030
(It's a complete success.)

1705
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:45,860
(They succeed after 6 tries!)

1706
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,460
- Isn't it amazing?
- We did it.

1707
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,500
Let's move to the next spot.

1708
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,260
You can get in the car now.

1709
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,340
- Let's go.
- It was...

1710
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,940
The place we're heading to next
is a comic book store.

1711
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,840
- I love comic book stores.
- Wow, really?

1712
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,880
Comic book stores are really nice
these days.

1713
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,780
- It's the sentiment of the 1990s.
- This place is amazing.

1714
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,440
- Wow.
- There are so many books.

1715
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,590
Look, it's an old-style sofa.

1716
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:10,820
Jae Suk,
they must've read this many times.

1717
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,980
I know.

1718
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,690
The popular ones are all tattered.

1719
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,090
It's "Champ."

1720
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,920
- I had one in my neighborhood.
- I practically lived there.

1721
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,500
How about "Urban Legend?"

1722
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,400
"City Conquest" is right here.

1723
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,190
I can't remember
how far I read "City Conquest."

1724
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,500
Of course you can't.

1725
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,630
Wow, there are so many new ones.

1726
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,110
- It's "Princess Hours."
- "Princess Hours."

1727
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,230
- Ji Hyo, it's "Princess Hours."
- This is amazing.

1728
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,900
("Princess Hours" is
the original comic...)

1729
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,900
(of the drama Ji Hyo was in.)

1730
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,780
I also read
the comic book version first.

1731
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,570
(The original pretty girl
from comic books, Ji Hyo)

1732
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:39,880
Should I take "Princess Hours?"

1733
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,070
Yes, you should.

1734
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,840
"Vitamin!"

1735
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,190
(Oh, gosh, it's "Vitamin!")

1736
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,920
I learned about love
through these books.

1737
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,090
(The romance comics that taught
Love Frog about love)

1738
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,480
(Michael Jackson is immersed
in the basketball comic.)

1739
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,050
This is the best scene.

1740
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,760
This one right here.
I bawled my eyes out.

1741
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:56,260
"Mr. Ahn."

1742
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,940
(Mr. Ahn.)

1743
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,940
"I want to..."

1744
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,190
(I want to...)

1745
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,260
"play basketball."

1746
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,840
(I want to play basketball.)

1747
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,130
(Jackson chokes up.)

1748
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,670
- Eight.
- Wrong.

1749
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,800
- Wrong.
- What's the line again?

1750
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,280
- You won't get a prison sentence...
- You won't get a prison sentence,

1751
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,440
but you'll have to pay a fine.

1752
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,710
Of course.

1753
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,010
- Glass.
- That's it. That one's nice.

1754
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,880
- It's pretty.
- Pencil sharpener.

1755
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,380
Where are we going
for the last spot?

1756
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,880
- Where do you think we're going?
- Pil-dong.

1757
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,880
Hyehwa-dong?

1758
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,380
- Where are we going?
- Samcheong-dong?

1759
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,590
- It must be a retro town.
- Insa-dong!

1760
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,670
- Suk Jin! Suk Jin.
- It's Gwanghwamun.

1761
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,460
- Isn't this where you used to live?
- It's Gwanghwamun.

1762
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,090
(Gyeongbokgung Palace)

1763
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,190
- Isn't this...
- Oh, right.

1764
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,030
I used to
sweep the garden a lot here.

1765
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,940
This is the place.

1766
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,030
I had to stoop down all the time.

1767
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,440
- Right?
- I never got to see the sky.

1768
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,170
(Leaving the place
of Suk Jin's memories behind...)

1769
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,440
The last place we're going to
is an LP bar.

1770
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,440
(The last place of memories
is an LP bar.)

1771
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,610
I love it!

1772
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,420
That'll be our last place.

1773
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,710
Seriously, music is...

1774
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:54,280
Lee Sang Woo's song
we listened to earlier...

1775
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,480
- I loved it.
- "La Boum."

1776
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,000
- "La Boum."
- "La Boum."

1777
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,300
We should listen to the Beatles.

1778
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,760
Look at these.
I want to have one too.

1779
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,840
- I love this song so much.
- I love this song too.

1780
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,230
It's my favorite song. Hello, sir.

1781
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,510
- It's "Take On Me."
- It's A-ha's song.

1782
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,710
It's "Take On Me" by A-ha.

1783
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,780
(Excited Michael Jackson
enters the LP bar as well.)

1784
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,250
- Look at him.
- Haha, come on.

1785
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,280
He automatically becomes
Michael Jackson.

1786
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,280
We finally found a place
that suits Haha!

1787
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,610
We finally found it!

1788
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,690
Michael Jackson!

1789
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,260
(Michael Jackson finally found
a place that suits him.)

1790
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:27,860
It's A-ha's song.

1791
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,780
(They take a trip down memory lane
with an LP song.)

1792
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,590
(The middle-aged men
move to the music.)

1793
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,730
(Too immersed)

1794
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:38,670
(Everyone around the globe...)

1795
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:41,760
(dances to the masterpiece
of memories.)

1796
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,360
So this is how an LP sounds?

1797
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,230
It's A-ha. You know A-ha, right?
It's "Take On Me" by A-ha.

1798
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,750
I used to love A-ha.

1799
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,780
The music video of this song
is a montage of pencil drawing.

1800
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,150
That's right!

1801
00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:00,920
(The music video
of A-ha's "Take On Me")

1802
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,730
They made a parody
of this music video...

1803
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,030
and shot a commercial for a drink...

1804
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,360
with Cho Yong Pil.

1805
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,130
- It was a commercial for McCOL.
- McCOL?

1806
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:17,030
- They parodied this music video.
- Right, I remember.

1807
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,710
A-ha is an amazing band.

1808
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:20,710
This song still sounds amazing.

1809
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,570
This place is an LP bar.

1810
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:25,110
You must listen to the stories
of others and songs in an LP bar.

1811
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,110
- That's right.
- In an LP bar?

1812
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:30,010
We'll give you a chance
to earn extra gifts here.

1813
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,090
(It's a chance to earn extra gifts.)

1814
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,920
Please briefly write your story
related to...

1815
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,460
the song you're requesting
and give it to us.

1816
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,900
The owner will choose one,
and we'll give that person a gift.

1817
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,860
- Oh, we're writing our own story?
- Just like how we...

1818
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,130
- used to request a song to DJs?
- This is... Wait a minute.

1819
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,900
Shall we take a trip
down memory lane again?

1820
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,260
I do have good memories.

1821
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,510
(Radio shows used to read out
handwritten stories and play songs.)

1822
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,800
Shall I reminisce the old days?

1823
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,380
- Gosh.
- The old days...

1824
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,650
This won't be enough
to write my story.

1825
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,070
(This won't be enough
to write my story.)

1826
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,280
The owner will pick
the story he likes?

1827
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,650
He'll read your stories and...

1828
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:03,340
Sir. I'll write a story
about my breakup.

1829
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,360
- Me too.
- You can't do that.

1830
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,710
- You can't hint at him like that.
- Why not? What's wrong with it?

1831
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,380
- I mean...
- I'm just telling him.

1832
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,690
I'll write
about my beautiful breakup too.

1833
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,360
Wait, I should write about that.

1834
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,420
I was a high school senior...

1835
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:16,900
when I met this woman.

1836
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,940
- Wait, is it okay...
- I was a high school senior.

1837
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,570
- to talk about other women?
- It's fine.

1838
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:21,670
- Of course.
- Is it okay?

1839
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,010
- Yes.
- Is this okay?

1840
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:24,360
- Doesn't your wife watch the show?
- You mean my wife?

1841
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,210
Of course it's okay.
It's been decades already.

1842
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,980
But I think she wouldn't like it.
I know I wouldn't.

1843
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,940
I failed the college exam,
but she passed.

1844
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,070
So we had to break up.

1845
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,440
I gave her...

1846
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,820
I gave her a gift.

1847
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,440
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

1848
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,650
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong with you?

1849
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,590
I'm sorry,
but today is not your special.

1850
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,190
- Why would you...
- You gave me happiness

1851
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:43,630
(Immersed in memories)

1852
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:45,000
That's Sunflower's song.

1853
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,500
- You know that song, right?
- I know that song.

1854
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:49,730
It was when I was
a high school senior.

1855
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:50,860
Oh, was it?

1856
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,000
- I...
- Is that so?

1857
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,190
- went on a blind date.
- Wait a minute.

1858
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,010
No, this song is...

1859
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,210
I can't choose this song.
I'm reminded of someone else.

1860
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,030
- Hold on.
- I should pick Kim Jong Seo's song.

1861
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:03,070
I should pick "You Do Not Answer"
by Kim Jong Seo.

1862
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,670
I can't forget the girl I met
by chance on the bus.

1863
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,550
I can't forget...

1864
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,610
(I can't forget...)

1865
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,260
the girl I met by chance.

1866
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:15,130
Why do you two read it out loud
when you write something?

1867
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,380
- When I saw you...
- Why do you do that?

1868
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,300
- That's how you write a story.
- Please.

1869
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,300
- I can't forget...
- That's what old people do.

1870
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,500
It's what old people do.

1871
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,530
They also read it out loud
when they text someone.

1872
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:28,300
He also says his password
out loud when he presses it.

1873
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:32,510
The song that was being played
on my cassette player...

1874
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,900
I almost wrote
"cassette player" too!

1875
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,170
- I'm writing it again.
- The song that was played...

1876
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,780
I need to read it out loud
to write it.

1877
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,110
My goodness.

1878
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:44,690
What can I do then?
This is the only way I can write.

1879
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:45,860
(Glancing)

1880
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,860
- Hold on.
- What? What is it?

1881
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,130
It's true. It's a true story.

1882
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:53,030
Why would you write that a big fire
broke out in your house in 1995?

1883
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,400
- It's a true story.
- Don't try so hard...

1884
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,500
- to be picked.
- I'm just writing my story.

1885
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,760
- Don't lie.
- It really was on fire.

1886
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,130
I'm done.

1887
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,400
(I'm done.)

1888
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,710
I kept it short.

1889
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:06,800
What? Do you think I wrote it long?

1890
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,550
I'll read them for you.
Give them to me.

1891
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,250
- So then...
- It's a true story.

1892
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,110
- Don't write something like this.
- Let us hear it.

1893
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,320
"Dear owner."
Why would you write this?

1894
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,860
- But still...
- I'll just skip it.

1895
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,920
- Don't write things like this.
- Right, you shouldn't.

1896
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,460
"The interior design
of your bar is really pretty?"

1897
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:25,800
Someone needs to butter him up.

1898
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,590
"There was a big fire in my house
in 1995."

1899
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,300
Why would you talk about this?

1900
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,940
- This is so sad.
- Why would you tell us this?

1901
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,190
I just wrote my story.

1902
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,690
- It must've been shocking.
- Right.

1903
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:36,300
"I was immature,"

1904
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,880
"and I asked my parents for money
to go to an arcade."

1905
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,940
"I'm still embarrassed
by what I did."

1906
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,380
"To reflect on my bad behavior,
I request 'Arcade' by Han's Band."

1907
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,980
- That's a good choice.
- Han's Band's "Arcade."

1908
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,840
- It's a great song. Of course.
- It brings back the memories.

1909
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:51,250
(Everyone who loved going to arcades
must've hummed to this song.)

1910
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,280
Yes. My gosh.

1911
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,280
(I love it.)

1912
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,780
- It's a great song.
- "It was..."

1913
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:55,980
"It was when I was
a high school senior."

1914
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,090
"I went on a blind date..."

1915
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,260
(It was when I was
a high school senior.)

1916
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,090
I don't understand what he wrote.

1917
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,800
- The next paragraph says...
- Are you just skipping it?

1918
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:04,690
I'll read it.

1919
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:06,130
(I'll read it.)

1920
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,360
- Wait.
- Hey.

1921
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,510
- How can a DJ do this?
- I mean, the story...

1922
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,510
- Hey, what kind of a DJ...
- The story was too...

1923
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:15,010
It made me yawn
from the first paragraph.

1924
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,400
You'll get a chance
to read it someday.

1925
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,820
My gosh, how could he disregard
my memories like that?

1926
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,920
I'll try not to fall asleep.

1927
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,280
Okay. Let me read it again.

1928
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,380
"It was when I was
a high school senior."

1929
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,860
"I went on a blind date..."

1930
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:30,480
"with a girl who was a May Queen."

1931
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,400
"When we started
developing feelings for each other,"

1932
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,360
"I failed the college exam,
and she passed it."

1933
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,400
"I want to listen to the song
I gave her as a gift..."

1934
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,460
"when we broke up at a bus stop."

1935
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:41,000
"That song is Sunflower's
'Someone Who Gives Me Happiness.'"

1936
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,940
It's a very ordinary story.

1937
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,300
You think that's ordinary?

1938
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,880
- It is.
- Hey.

1939
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,010
It's ordinary.

1940
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,480
- I failed the exam, but she passed.
- This isn't anything special.

1941
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,110
That's why we broke up.
Isn't that sad?

1942
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,670
It's one of those stories
that radio DJs get all the time.

1943
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:53,710
He's right.

1944
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,650
- You've never been a DJ.
- I'll read the next story.

1945
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:59,880
"Have you ever had a coffee
with an angel?"

1946
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,210
It's a song title.

1947
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,730
"Would you like to
have one with me?"

1948
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:06,650
"Where are you looking at?"
"I'm looking at you."

1949
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,530
- It's So Min's.
- It must be So Min's story.

1950
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,030
- Just rip that story, Jae Suk.
- It's So Min's story.

1951
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,800
It's the worst.
What kind of story is that?

1952
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,670
- It's full of nonsense.
- Why?

1953
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:17,300
- Is it one of your stories?
- Just rip it, Jae Suk.

1954
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,880
It's too corny.

1955
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,340
- Why?
- I always say this,

1956
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,670
- She's just...
- but...

1957
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:26,650
I've never thought
that a woman could be corny.

1958
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:27,650
She's too corny.

1959
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,250
All right. Here's the next story.

1960
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,480
He requested a song first.

1961
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,780
It's "Fate" by Lee Sun Hee.

1962
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,230
"A burglar broke into my house
in 1990."

1963
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,860
Who is it?
Didn't someone talk about...

1964
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,900
a burglar already?

1965
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,460
"A burglar broke into his house."
A fire and a burglar.

1966
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,760
- Whose story is it?
- It's a true story.

1967
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,860
- Who would...
- Why did everyone suffer so much?

1968
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,360
So is it a story about how you
made friends with the burglar?

1969
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,900
- No, it's not.
- Is that it?

1970
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:54,610
"A burglar broke into my house
in 1990."

1971
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,800
"My mother had a hard time."

1972
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,980
"This is my mother's favorite song."

1973
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,650
"That's right. I'm a bad son."

1974
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,210
"If you pick this song,"

1975
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,820
"I will be a filial son
for the first time."

1976
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:06,260
(He tries to appeal to emotions
with talks of filial love.)

1977
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,690
He is appealing to emotions.

1978
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,280
- Kwang Soo.
- That's not true.

1979
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,030
- This is messed up.
- "I will be a filial son."

1980
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,320
"Please let me be a filial son."

1981
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,420
"I want to see my mom's smile."

1982
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,420
Ji Hyo, you wrote something too.

1983
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,730
(It's time to read the story
by the girl with purple eyeshadow.)

1984
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:23,300
"They say the higher power sent you
a mother..."

1985
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:26,480
"because it can't grant
your every wish."

1986
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:29,110
"This is for all the mothers
in the world."

1987
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,250
(That came out of nowhere.)

1988
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,610
- That came out of nowhere.
- What is this?

1989
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:35,090
- What does that make us?
- I wanted Na Hoon A's song,

1990
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:37,090
- so I wrote something fitting.
- "I respect them."

1991
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,960
- "I love them. They are precious."
- What's the song?

1992
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,920
It's "Don't Cry, Hong Do"
by Na Hoon A.

1993
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,190
- There is more.
- What?

1994
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:46,190
"I am dying for a smoke right now,"

1995
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,420
"so please play
'Cigarette Girl' as well."

1996
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,230
(Jackson slanders her.)

1997
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,230
Jackson.

1998
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:51,570
Jackson, that's rude.

1999
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,230
- No smoking. No smoking.
- That's rude.

2000
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,030
- No smoking.
- That's hilarious.

2001
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:56,300
All right.

2002
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,530
"There was a shy child."

2003
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:00,030
"He was a particularly shy child."

2004
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,340
"He couldn't even order jjajangmyeon
at a Chinese restaurant,"

2005
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:05,610
"so he would trudge home
on an empty stomach."

2006
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,670
"He would trudge home."

2007
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,420
"He was a particularly shy child,"

2008
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,420
"so he couldn't even tell the girl
that he likes her."

2009
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:12,780
"He had to see her leave
without a word."

2010
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,010
"On his way back,
he cried his eyes out."

2011
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,550
"A woman and man
who were passing by said,"

2012
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,630
"'Child, are you okay?'"

2013
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:19,230
"'Child, why are you crying?'"

2014
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,050
"'Child, it's okay.'"

2015
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,900
(His writing skills
make them laugh.)

2016
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,670
"That child now lives
as a father of three children."

2017
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:26,840
"I want to tell him,"

2018
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,900
"'Child, are you okay?'"

2019
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,630
"'Child, I love you.'"

2020
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:32,130
"Earth, Wind and Fire's
'September.'"

2021
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,340
(The story is a mess,
but he picked a nice pop song!)

2022
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,980
- "September."
- Do you remember?

2023
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,650
(He feels proud.)

2024
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,710
All right. Here is another one.

2025
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,090
"I was in 11th grade."

2026
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:43,820
"That girl was standing
at the bus stop."

2027
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,480
"She caught my eyes at first sight."

2028
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,710
- Jae Suk, I heard it before.
- Is it yours?

2029
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,420
- Really?
- You read it as you wrote it.

2030
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:51,130
"Red Rose on Wednesday."

2031
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:52,360
(Yellow Cap revealed the story
as he wrote it.)

2032
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,460
I see.

2033
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,820
- We are done.
- There is another one.

2034
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,900
Jong Kook's story.

2035
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,730
"I dreamed of becoming a singer,"

2036
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:01,260
"but I wondered if I should give up
since my parents were against it."

2037
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,900
"Many songs comforted me,"

2038
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,110
"but I listened to this often
when I lost my way."

2039
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,340
"It was played on the streets.
It's Choi Ho Sub's..."

2040
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:09,750
- "As Time Passes."
- "As Time Passes."

2041
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:10,880
- It's an incredible song.
- I know.

2042
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,110
- As time passes
- As time passes

2043
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:17,940
You will forget about
how your heart almost burst

2044
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:19,590
With longing

2045
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:22,280
"I want to feel those emotions again
after all these years."

2046
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,190
"Please take me
on a time machine ride."

2047
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,130
The owner listened
to all the song requests.

2048
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:29,360
Sir, please play a song.

2049
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,190
Everyone had a nice story.

2050
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:33,360
- Sir, please play a song.
- Which song would he like?

2051
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,570
I think he will play Haha's song.

2052
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,900
- A pop song would be nice.
- He is taking it out.

2053
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,610
He is choosing it.

2054
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:41,400
Red rose on Wednesday

2055
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,440
- As time passes
- Do you remember?

2056
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,050
Please play it.

2057
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:47,070
- It must be something upbeat.
- I know.

2058
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:48,650
No.

2059
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,250
There is this sentimentality.

2060
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,320
Hey!

2061
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,760
(He recognizes the song
from the first note.)

2062
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,260
- "As Time Passes."
- "As Time Passes."

2063
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,760
- "As Time Passes."
- All right.

2064
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,230
He took me on a time machine ride.

2065
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:59,500
I admit defeat.
Choi Ho Sub's "As Time Passes."

2066
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,030
- He is going back in time.
- He took Jong Kook...

2067
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,300
- on a time machine ride.
- Seriously.

2068
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,500
- He took me on a time machine ride.
- I am becoming absorbed.

2069
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,000
- Seriously. This song is nice.
- I am becoming absorbed.

2070
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,440
The chorus is really sad.

2071
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,440
That's right.

2072
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:16,480
(This song helped him find his way
and debut as a singer.)

2073
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,110
This song...

2074
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,210
("As Time Passes" by Choi Ho Sub)

2075
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:20,420
I listened to it so many times.

2076
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,110
(For me)

2077
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,550
(You show a smile)

2078
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:26,760
Isn't there a version
by a female singer?

2079
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,920
(But you can't hide
a dejected look on your face)

2080
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,190
- Park Bo Ram sang it.
- You are right.

2081
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,730
(But you can't hide
a dejected look on your face)

2082
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:36,920
(Weakly)

2083
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,500
You turn around

2084
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,590
This is so nice.

2085
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,130
I really like Suk Jin's voice.

2086
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,460
I really like his voice.

2087
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:45,480
Sir, please get us a bottle of beer.

2088
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,210
A bottle of soju too.

2089
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:50,570
I know it

2090
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:53,440
- When it comes to our love
- When it comes to our love

2091
01:07:54,250 --> 01:08:00,710
- This is the end
- This is the end

2092
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:05,260
Even if we want it to,
it can't last forever

2093
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,360
Why are you crying?

2094
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:14,530
- Time passes without fail
- Time passes without fail

2095
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:18,260
- As time passes
- As time passes

2096
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,650
- You will forget about
- You will forget about

2097
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:25,670
- How your heart almost burst
- How your heart almost burst

2098
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:28,650
- With longing
- With longing

2099
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:35,150
But there was love
you cherished dearly

2100
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:41,820
- Please remember that
- Please remember that

2101
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:45,640
- As time passes
- As time passes

2102
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,970
- You will forget about
- You will forget about

2103
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:56,050
How your heart almost burst
with longing

2104
01:08:56,050 --> 01:09:02,680
But there was love
you cherished dearly

2105
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:09,820
- Please remember that
- Please remember that

2106
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,430
It's a masterpiece of a song.

2107
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:14,300
You chose a great song. Thank you.

2108
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,820
It was amazing.

2109
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:16,970
Did you watch a performance?

2110
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,020
- Did you watch a performance?
- No.

2111
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,770
It's such a sad song.

2112
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,230
- Stop crying.
- Stop crying.

2113
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:22,310
Why are you crying?

2114
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:23,510
Did you watch a performance?

2115
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,140
It's such a sad song.

2116
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:26,600
She drives me crazy.

2117
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,230
"Please remember that."

2118
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:33,470
- Please remember that
- Please remember that

2119
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:35,780
"Your heart almost burst
with longing."

2120
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,350
Why is Ji Hyo so funny?

2121
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,810
Look at Ji Hyo.

2122
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:40,850
Ji Hyo.

2123
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,020
(She is drunk on the song.)

2124
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,390
Can I take a photo?

2125
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,350
- This is driving me crazy.
- Sir.

2126
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,350
I am sorry,
please play an upbeat song.

2127
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,930
I want to shake my body.

2128
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:52,190
Why don't I choose one of you
to pick a present?

2129
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,230
- Shall we do that?
- Yes.

2130
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,930
- All of us will shake our bodies.
- Yes.

2131
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,840
- He picked a song.
- It will be amped up.

2132
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,230
(The upbeat song is on standby.)

2133
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:01,570
All right.

2134
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:03,380
(This song is...)

2135
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:04,850
It's the song we talked about.

2136
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:05,970
I took a trip down memory lane.

2137
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:07,110
Is it a song by Two Two?

2138
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,850
It's the song we talked about.

2139
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,420
(She begins to make herself pretty.)

2140
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,940
My body remembers the song.

2141
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,630
- She is so scary.
- What?

2142
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,760
(I don't know anything.)

2143
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,960
- When did she start doing that?
- Do you have a split personality?

2144
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,970
When did she start doing that?

2145
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,060
(Her mood changes with the song.)

2146
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:27,030
- What is going on?
- She was just crying.

2147
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,810
- She was crying.
- Hold on.

2148
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:30,970
Weren't you crying?

2149
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,770
(When did I do that?)

2150
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:34,840
She is scary.

2151
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:36,100
(Dancing)

2152
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,140
Hey.

2153
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,350
You are ridiculous.

2154
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:40,380
(Generation X has
shocking mood swings!)

2155
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:46,680
(Her cute steps
liven up the atmosphere.)

2156
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,180
You should dance too.

2157
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:52,320
Come on and dance.

2158
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:53,760
Come on, Ji Hyo.

2159
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:56,970
(Ji Hyo comes forward in the end.)

2160
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,360
(Her fans double over.)

2161
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,530
(Haughty)

2162
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,140
That dance suits her.

2163
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,210
(I became two)

2164
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:06,180
This is crazy.

2165
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,710
That dance suits her.

2166
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,250
Good job. Good job.

2167
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,440
She is so funny.

2168
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,020
(The queen bee
of the roller skating rink is back.)

2169
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,750
She is good.

2170
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,520
That dance suits her.

2171
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,180
She is so funny.

2172
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,680
I love it.

2173
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:22,760
- She is the best.
- You know...

2174
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,630
Sir, it was a great song.

2175
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,190
Thank you.

2176
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:27,720
It was the best.

2177
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,800
You know, I must point this out.

2178
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,470
In Part One, So Min cried.

2179
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,890
(Then she transformed.)

2180
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,400
- She wiped her tears.
- It was scary.

2181
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,970
- It was scary.
- In Part Two,

2182
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,510
she got up from her seat.

2183
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:42,550
- She was like a princess.
- Ji Hyo.

2184
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:45,270
- Seriously.
- It was so funny.

2185
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,250
These sisters are funny.

2186
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,810
I became a fan of them.

2187
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,640
(Double Bells Sisters
have distinct charms.)

2188
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,680
- I feel faint.
- I almost died from laughing.

2189
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:56,430
I went to the roller skating rink
so often.

2190
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,820
"La Boum?"

2191
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,820
- What is this?
- What is this?

2192
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:01,460
- "Touch by Touch."
- "Touch by Touch."

2193
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,800
- Gosh, this song...
- What is this?

2194
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,890
What is this?

2195
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,140
He loves it.

2196
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,530
- What is this?
- Don't you know this song?

2197
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:11,840
I don't know it.

2198
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,380
Look at Suk Jin.

2199
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:16,550
He loves it. Suk Jin loves it.

2200
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:17,940
He loves it.

2201
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:19,680
- What is this?
- His face turned red...

2202
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,770
because he is so happy.

2203
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,640
(The 20-year-old Suk Jin
loves the song.)

2204
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,890
Look at Suk Jin.

2205
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:27,780
It's so funny.

2206
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:29,820
Seriously.

2207
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,090
He is the only one who is excited.

2208
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,460
I will dance with Suk Jin.

2209
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,630
(I will dance with Suk Jin.)

2210
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,300
- This dance.
- What is this song?

2211
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,820
(The ugly duo in the ballroom)

2212
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:40,190
Did they dance at the club
like that?

2213
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,300
(Did they dance at the club
like that?)

2214
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,140
(Surprisingly,
they used to dance like this.)

2215
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,930
Did they dance at the club
like that?

2216
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:49,010
They are the only ones
who are excited.

2217
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,900
- Why are they so happy?
- I don't even know.

2218
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:53,070
(No women would approach them.)

2219
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:54,920
Those women keep looking at us!

2220
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,920
Dance diligently!

2221
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:01,220
They are looking at us.

2222
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,560
- They are looking at us.
- They are looking at us.

2223
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,890
(The queen appears.)

2224
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,260
Would you dance with us?

2225
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,670
How old are you?

2226
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,670
I am 25 years old.

2227
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:13,800
- Suk Jin is excited for real.
- Would you dance with us?

2228
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,800
Dance with us.

2229
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,840
The friend.

2230
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,400
Hey, I talked to her.

2231
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:19,530
- Really?
- I talked to her.

2232
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:20,600
"I talked to her."

2233
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:21,930
I talked to her.

2234
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,640
(The two men's timid outing
ends with a misunderstanding.)

2235
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,850
Thank you.

2236
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,140
I haven't danced like this
in a long while.

2237
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,640
Everyone danced like this back then.

2238
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,720
- So this is how they partied.
- That was funny.

2239
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,060
They partied in a fun way.

2240
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:37,130
After two songs,

2241
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:39,720
- our clothes were sweaty.
- They were sweaty.

2242
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,890
(They always ended up sweaty
after a grand outing.)

2243
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:42,300
After this,

2244
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,130
you guys trudged home together.

2245
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,230
- Right?
- In the rain.

2246
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,800
I bet you guys didn't have bus fare.

2247
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,840
We took the bus home.

2248
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,140
We danced until we turned sweaty.

2249
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,010
The owner...

2250
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:55,640
will choose someone who expressed
the good cheer of the song.

2251
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,510
Everyone did well,

2252
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:00,520
but one member danced diligently...

2253
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,610
even though the song was old.

2254
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:03,850
So Min.

2255
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:04,920
(So Min!)

2256
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:06,780
Thank you.

2257
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,850
So Min acquired a present.

2258
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,590
Pick one present each.

2259
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,320
I will pick the pager.

2260
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,000
- It will be nice to have it.
- I will pick the retro crayons.

2261
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,800
(6 presents remain.)

2262
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,000
(Robot puppy, song encyclopedia,
Sarangbang candy, video cassettes)

2263
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,500
1, 2, 3.

2264
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,930
(4 people will acquire the present!)

2265
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,600
(Who will take 4 presents
through this mission?)

2266
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,640
This mission will decide
who will get the four presents.

2267
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,680
It's simple.

2268
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,270
I divided you up into 2 teams of 4,

2269
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:33,110
Team Old and Team Young.

2270
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,810
You remember how
you were divided up earlier, right?

2271
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:36,310
- Yes.
- That will be your team.

2272
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:37,680
(Glancing over)

2273
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,150
- Am I Team Old?
- You are Team Old.

2274
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:43,060
- You are Team Old.
- I brought a story...

2275
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:44,720
from the production crew.

2276
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:47,430
Find the LP record
of a song that suits the story...

2277
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:48,690
and play it.

2278
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,500
Then the production crew
will pick a song.

2279
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,470
- Okay.
- A song that suits the story.

2280
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,670
- The production crew's story.
- We will win.

2281
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:57,600
- In any case,
- We have that sentimentality.

2282
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,600
the production crew members are...

2283
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,880
about our age.
We have the same sentimentality.

2284
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,050
So this is the story.

2285
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:05,680
The title is,
"I Am Going Crazy Too."

2286
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:09,440
"Hello, I am So Min's cameraman,
Ji Bong Jo."

2287
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:10,780
- It's Bong Jo's story.
- Bong Jo?

2288
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:14,480
"Due to the incessant complaints
by a fellow cameraman, Yun Sang,"

2289
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,020
- "I am losing weight day by day."
- Really?

2290
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,630
Oh, no.

2291
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,460
"It's all because of Kwang Soo."

2292
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,770
"As soon as the shoot begins,
he complains about Kwang Soo..."

2293
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,970
"and it honestly gives me
a headache."

2294
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:29,360
"I am exhausted
because Kwang Soo runs too fast."

2295
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,170
"Gosh, Kwang Soo got the penalty.
I will have to go home late."

2296
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:34,730
- My goodness.
- I understand how he feels.

2297
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:35,850
I can relate to him.

2298
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:36,970
I am so disappointed in him.

2299
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:38,140
"Yun Sang..."

2300
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:39,220
Seriously.

2301
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:42,310
"Yun Sang is old,
so he doesn't have enough energy."

2302
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:46,060
"Since it gets repeated every week,
I don't know how to react."

2303
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,480
"What should I do?"

2304
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,720
"Please tell me what I can do..."

2305
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,850
"and recommend a song
for the complaining cameraman."

2306
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:54,820
A song
for the complaining cameraman.

2307
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:57,800
Two people from each team.
You have a minute.

2308
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,230
Are most songs here?

2309
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:01,390
That's perfect, So Min.

2310
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,900
- Nothing can beat it.
- Right?

2311
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,100
That song will bring us victory.

2312
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,970
That's right.

2313
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:07,730
- So Min.
- Sir, we chose this one.

2314
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,140
Did you choose a song?

2315
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:11,680
It's for Bong Jo.

2316
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,970
Please play Team Old's song first.

2317
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,810
I hope it will help him
find comfort.

2318
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,590
Until when will you be able
to deal with his complaints?

2319
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,110
(Team Old creates
a heartwarming atmosphere.)

2320
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,460
(Which song did they choose?)

2321
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:23,820
Gosh, it's this song.

2322
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:25,560
It's a masterpiece.

2323
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,820
("White Butterfly" by Kim Jung Ho)

2324
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:28,890
What's the title?

2325
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:30,000
"White Butterfly."

2326
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,390
I think I know this song.

2327
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:32,470
(Team Young barely recognizes
the song.)

2328
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:36,140
(They are already absorbed.)

2329
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:41,070
(Oh, don't think)

2330
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:42,380
It's incredible!

2331
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,350
Hey, don't think. Forget everything.

2332
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:48,110
(About what's in the past)

2333
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:49,940
Why did they choose this song?

2334
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,180
It's too depressing.

2335
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,890
The cameraman might not know it.

2336
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:54,780
He is unsure.

2337
01:16:55,850 --> 01:17:00,020
(Don't be sad)

2338
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,260
(They are absorbed
in the song they chose)

2339
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:07,360
- When it's time
- When it's time

2340
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:10,860
You know,
we are listening without a thought.

2341
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:13,100
Look at them. They became emotional.

2342
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,680
They are old and we are young.

2343
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,100
Michael Jackson, don't cry.

2344
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,070
- Don't cry, Michael.
- Don't cry.

2345
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,350
Don't be sad.

2346
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,980
Once it's in the past,
you will see that it's nothing.

2347
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,220
It will pass.

2348
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:27,810
This song is too depressing.

2349
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:28,890
Don't be sad.

2350
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:30,150
The song is really nice,

2351
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:32,690
but it doesn't go well
with the story.

2352
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,020
You should have thought
about Bong Jo's feelings...

2353
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,000
and what he wanted to say
to Yun Sang.

2354
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,770
- Here we go.
- Let's hear it.

2355
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:40,030
This song represents his feelings.

2356
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,140
Let's go.

2357
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:42,510
Oh, this song.

2358
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:43,600
- I knew it.
- Let's go.

2359
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,030
- I thought about this song.
- I thought about this song.

2360
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:46,070
("Speed Up Losers" by Crying Nut)

2361
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:49,880
(The strong lyrics
made the song popular.)

2362
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:53,920
(This song will represent
Bong Jo's feelings.)

2363
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:55,770
Yun Sang!

2364
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:56,980
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

2365
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,650
One more time! Yun Sang!

2366
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:00,780
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

2367
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:01,960
There you go.

2368
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,520
(Yun Sang feels faint.)

2369
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,520
(Bong Jo laughs so hard
that his glasses become foggy.)

2370
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:07,930
Yun Sang!

2371
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:08,930
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

2372
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:09,930
There you go.

2373
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,970
- They won.
- 2, 3, 4.

2374
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:13,100
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

2375
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,840
- Yun Sang! Shut up!
- Shut up!

2376
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:17,030
- Yun Sang! Shut up!
- Shut up!

2377
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:20,230
- Yun Sang! Shut up and listen!
- Shut up and listen!

2378
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:23,600
(Team Young livens up the atmosphere
with the karaoke hit song.)

2379
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:30,020
(Speed up, losers)

2380
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,960
(Yellow Cap crashes the party.)

2381
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:36,680
(Michael Jackson runs out
as if he is in a trance.)

2382
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,670
(They are relieving
their pent-up stress.)

2383
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:46,170
(The one-shot addict
hogs the camera again.)

2384
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:47,670
(Uncomfortable)

2385
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:51,530
(Because of Yellow Cap
who jumped around excitedly,)

2386
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:52,770
Okay.

2387
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:53,810
(the messy performance
livened up the atmosphere.)

2388
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:55,180
It was perfect.

2389
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,600
Team Young doesn't disappoint.

2390
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,440
- You need to delve into the story.
- That's right.

2391
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,850
We thought of this song too.

2392
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:01,880
Seriously.

2393
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:04,280
The person who wrote the story
will announce the winner.

2394
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,550
- Bong Jo will do it.
- Yes.

2395
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:06,780
(Which song will Bong Jo choose?)

2396
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,890
My body reacted right away.

2397
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:10,220
His body.

2398
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:12,390
So Min's team.

2399
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:16,270
That's it.
We share that sentimentality.

2400
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:18,800
He made that choice
because he is So Min's cameraman.

2401
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,840
(Jae Suk suspects them
of collusion.)

2402
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,690
- Why did he share the story?
- Hey.

2403
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,400
To be honest, I doubt Yun Sang said
anything useless.

2404
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,570
- Seriously.
- It was Kwang Soo's fault.

2405
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:28,840
They are old farts.

2406
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,470
You are unbelievable.

2407
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:31,550
Nice choice.

2408
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:34,070
(A Western old fart appears.)

2409
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:36,720
We should listen
to "White Butterfly."

2410
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,810
That's right.

2411
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:38,850
That's so funny.

2412
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:40,650
(Team Old wins the next match.)

2413
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,220
Pick two people from each team
with rock-paper-scissors.

2414
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,260
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

2415
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:45,350
(Since there are 4 presents,
each team picks 2 people.)

2416
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:46,500
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

2417
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,960
My goodness.

2418
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:49,560
(Jong Kook, Jae Suk, So Min,
and Kwang Soo get the presents!)

2419
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,630
That's good.

2420
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:52,670
I will get the robot puppy.

2421
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:54,600
I will get the Sarangbang candy.

2422
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,210
(Thinking)

2423
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:58,470
"Farewell My Concussion."

2424
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,010
It's "Farewell My Concubine."

2425
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:01,510
(What?)

2426
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:03,440
It's "Farewell My Concubine,"
not "Farewell My Concussion."

2427
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,270
Okay. "Farewell My Concubine."

2428
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:07,350
(She isn't good with big words.)?

2429
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,610
Right?

2430
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,220
I will get the one
that is in Chinese characters.

2431
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:13,150
This one.

2432
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:14,350
(He chooses
by looking at the pictures.)

2433
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:15,520
This one.

2434
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,260
You will get the presents
right away.

2435
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:20,020
Since 2 presents remain,
2 people will receive the penalty.

2436
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:24,170
(Since 2 presents remain,
2 people will receive the penalty!)

2437
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:27,270
The ones with the fewest presents
will receive the penalty.

2438
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:29,510
Se Chan and Ji Hyo have one present.

2439
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:30,840
Excuse me?

2440
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,230
You will see the presents first.

2441
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,840
The LP record.

2442
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,510
It's a turntable.

2443
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:37,570
It's a nice present.

2444
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:39,970
Look at this.
I got the best presents.

2445
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:42,110
What is this?

2446
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,520
- It's the best.
- I know.

2447
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,590
(Ha Jackson
got a lot of presents in Korea.)

2448
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,920
The two of you will receive
the penalty.

2449
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,220
I will tell you what the penalty is.

2450
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,720
Use the sentimentality
of the 1990s...

2451
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:54,560
including the cringe-worthy comments
and actions...

2452
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,130
to make a one-minute commercial
for Running Man.

2453
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:59,360
A one-minute commercial?
That's long.

2454
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,030
The completed commercial
will be posted...

2455
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:03,860
on Running Man's social media
for promotion.

2456
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:07,380
The entering class of 1991's
introduction to 1991...

2457
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,180
will end here.

2458
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2459
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:12,380
(The short trip through memories
comes to an end.)

2460
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,350
(Behind-the-scenes)

2461
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:17,050
- This is...
- You are an actress!

2462
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,310
This is ridiculous.

2463
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:19,350
Let's get ready.

2464
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:22,180
It's an honor to work
with a great actress like you.

2465
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:24,020
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It's an honor, Ji Hyo.

2466
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,460
You know, it's rare for you...

2467
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,800
to work with a comedian.

2468
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:29,720
When else would I work with Ji Hyo?

2469
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,670
I am free at 5 p.m. on Sunday.

2470
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:33,730
Shall we watch Running Man together
at 5 p.m. on Sunday?

2471
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:36,710
(They look pretty serious.)

2472
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:41,840
(You can check out the commercial
on our official social media.)

2473
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:44,510
It's pretty.

2474
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:47,270
(The members have a relaxing time
on the rooftop.)

2475
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:48,270
Let's have a glass of beer.

2476
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:51,020
(They enjoy the camping trip.)

2477
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:52,810
(A text breaks the peaceful moment.)

2478
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:55,060
(184 dollars, Running Campground)

2479
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:58,090
(24 hours at the TV station
you enjoy with someone else's money)

2480
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,560
(It costs a lot of money
to spend a day at the TV station.)

2481
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:07,230
(A meeting with the director
is a must at the TV station.)

2482
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,730
- The legendary director?
- This is ridiculous.

2483
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,010
That's just wrong.

2484
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:11,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

2485
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:14,380
(The members have a tearful show
to avoid the meeting.)

2486
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,600
(It isn't easy to spend a day
at the TV station.)

2487
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:19,550
(Everything will be paid
with someone's money.)

2488
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:21,750
(Who will be the one
to pay for everything?)

2489
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,720
(Credit Card Payment Race,
When You Go to the TV Station)
