1
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,540
(A sunny day with no fine dust)

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,670
(The members are gathering
around the SBS building.)

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:13,970
Hello.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,120
SBS is the best.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480
(Who's the first one to arrive?)

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,210
Hello.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,280
(She checks her temperature
and sterilizes her hands.)

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,460
Oh, hello.

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,620
Hello. Come this way.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,190
Did you eat?

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,030
Yes.

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,940
You can order some coffee
and snacks at this cafe.

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,940
- Really?
- Yes.

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,700
That's why we're shooting
the opening here.

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,830
Are we doing product placement
for the SBS building in Mok-dong?

17
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,700
No, this isn't product placement.

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,940
You can order what you want.

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,580
And we have the credit cards
of the members...

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,080
- and the main producer.
- Okay.

21
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,580
(The credit cards of the 8 members
and the main producer)

22
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,220
(Please give the members' cards
to our production crew...)

23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,840
(as soon as you get
to the filming site this week.)

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,120
(Haha's manager: Okay)

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,190
(Okay, I will.)

26
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,930
(That's how they got
the members' cards beforehand.)

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,330
(Why do they have the cards
of the members and the producer?)

28
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,030
You can pick any card you want...

29
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,030
and spend as much money as you want.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,370
Why do we have
the producer's card here?

31
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,580
There's the producer's card.

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,250
What happens if I use
the main producer's card?

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,480
You'll see.

34
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,950
You can just choose a card you want.

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,110
Song Yi. Where's Song Yi?

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,190
No one's here. Where are our staff?

37
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,310
Do you want to eat anything?

38
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,420
What do you want?

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,230
Do you want something?
Bong Jo, this is a good chance.

40
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,230
- What do you want? Coffee?
- An IA.

41
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,530
- An Iced Americano?
- Yes.

42
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,000
- What do you want to eat?
- Fruit juice.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,030
- Fruit juice?
- Yes.

44
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,300
- What do you want?
- An Iced Americano.

45
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,390
Then 3 iced Americanos
and 2 fruit juices.

46
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,640
What do you want?

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,700
A caramel macchiato.

48
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,110
You sound firm.

49
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,230
A caramel macchiato. Okay.

50
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,870
Whose card are you going to use?

51
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,000
(Whose card does she want to use?)

52
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,140
(She picks the main producer's card
with no hesitation.)

53
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,840
This is on me.

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,840
You should remember that.
I'm buying this for you.

55
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,010
I'm buying.

56
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,650
I'd like to order. This is amazing.

57
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,780
Six iced Americanos.

58
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,390
Two orange juices.

59
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,230
And a caramel macchiato.

60
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,800
Would you like to drink something?

61
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,020
It's on me.

62
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,230
This doesn't cost a lot.

63
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,260
(She's being generous
with someone else's card.)

64
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,540
(Receipt: 32.20 dollars)

65
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,910
It's not much.

66
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,910
Hello.

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

68
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,550
What is this?

69
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,980
(She's on alert as always.)

70
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,420
- This is my card.
- Right.

71
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,580
I'll use the producer's card then.

72
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,390
Are you serious?

73
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,680
(Tilting her head)

74
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,710
What's going on?

75
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,660
Does anyone want a hot dog?

76
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,050
(Me.)

77
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,130
Seriously?

78
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,260
(Me too.)

79
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,260
Okay. Hot dogs are on me.

80
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,130
I'll have eight hot dogs.

81
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,570
And one earl grey please.

82
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,300
(She pays 31 dollars.)

83
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,360
Thank you.

84
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,930
Can we really do this?

85
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,170
You can pick any card you want.

86
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,450
And can I pay with it?

87
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,510
Well, today...

88
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,820
(He hesitates for a moment.)

89
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,610
I'll have fun
with Jong Kook's card today.

90
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,850
It's gold.

91
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,610
I'll spend Jong Kook's money.

92
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,830
(He looks like he will go
on a spending spree.)

93
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,230
(He buys expensive cookies
that Jong Kook would never buy.)

94
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,020
I'll have five of these.

95
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,660
- Is this a secret?
- Yes.

96
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,200
Hello.

97
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
(Se Chan leaves with his cookies,
and Kwang Soo shows up.)

98
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,730
Here's my thought.

99
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,510
Actually, Jong Kook wouldn't mind...

100
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,010
spending some money on his friends.

101
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,110
I'm serious. That's true.

102
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,880
He loves it.

103
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,910
And he doesn't like it...

104
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,450
when I pay for my own food.

105
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,480
So I'll pick Jong Kook's card.

106
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,510
(He chooses Jong Kook's card.)

107
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,680
I'll have one iced Americano...

108
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,550
and this cookie.

109
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,210
And a mini cream puff.

110
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,230
Will he find out right away?

111
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,420
No, he won't.

112
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,990
Then I'll have one more.

113
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,160
Aren't you spending too much
with Jong Kook's card?

114
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,390
What are you doing?

115
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,630
(Paparazzi Yang shows up.)

116
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,100
(He secured the evidence
of Kwang Soo's spending.)

117
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,170
Done.

118
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,430
You're over. You're doomed.

119
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,880
- Hey.
- You'll... Forget it.

120
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,420
- I'll give you the money.
- You're doomed.

121
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,820
You're done for.

122
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,110
Gosh, he spent a lot.

123
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,050
- This is delicious.
- Right. It's warm.

124
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,110
(So Min and Ji Hyo are enjoying
brunch on the rooftop.)

125
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,860
If I know we'd be doing this,

126
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,360
I would've called my parents.

127
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,660
To use my card?

128
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,270
- I didn't use your card.
- Really?

129
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,420
(She lies.)

130
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,560
(Hesitating)

131
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,630
I'm sorry.

132
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,110
The assistant directors are mean.

133
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,730
I guess they told him right away.

134
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,970
- I got text messages.
- He got text messages.

135
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,610
(I got text messages.)

136
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,500
(Choi Bo Pil, 32.20 dollars,
Choi Bo Pil, 31 dollars)

137
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,780
I didn't think of that.

138
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,920
They offer 15 percent discounts
to employees of SBS.

139
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,020
Did you get a discount?

140
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,020
No, I didn't.

141
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,050
You should've asked for it.

142
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,050
I'll do it later.

143
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,660
- Should I keep it a secret?
- Of course.

144
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,980
You'll see. I'll do you a favor.

145
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,230
They bought a lot of stuff.

146
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,360
It's a meal.

147
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,770
- What is this?
- Whose card did you use?

148
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,170
- That's a secret.
- We already came clean.

149
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,040
You didn't use mine.
I didn't get a text message.

150
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,340
Right. I didn't use yours.

151
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,630
Oh, right. We'd get a text message.

152
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,910
(Flustered)

153
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,610
- Do they send text messages?
- Sure.

154
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,550
You're done for.

155
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,610
(He teases Kwang Soo
pretending to be calm.)

156
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,940
What's this?

157
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,150
Do they sell food that costs
this much here?

158
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,180
I didn't think of text messages.

159
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,220
(He hasn't adapted
to the age of information yet.)

160
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,360
Jong Kook would say this
as soon as he comes up.

161
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,050
"Hey, someone bought food
with my money."

162
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,490
"Okay. I got you."

163
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,300
- "It's you, right?"
- "It's you, isn't it?"

164
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,270
I'm getting off to a bad start.

165
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,930
(I'm getting off to a bad start.)

166
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,340
It's like I stepped in poop
as soon as I got off the car.

167
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,840
(He eats his cookie
with mixed feelings.)

168
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,930
Look at him.

169
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,070
He's...

170
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,780
(Giggling)

171
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,000
He's afraid someone might say,

172
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,170
"Why did you buy
something you won't even eat?"

173
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,720
- So he forces himself to eat it.
- This is a contrived situation.

174
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,550
"Why did you eat it
when you didn't want to eat it?"

175
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,250
So I'm forcing myself to finish it.

176
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,420
- There's one more.
- Not to make it look contrived.

177
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,590
You used Jong Kook's card.

178
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,920
I usually don't let
the younger members pay.

179
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,660
But it feels like...

180
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,860
Jong Kook is older than me.

181
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,230
- I'll pick Jong Kook's card.
- Okay.

182
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,400
Oh, okay.

183
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,560
Thank you.

184
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,840
- What did you eat?
- I bought food for our staff.

185
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,300
I used Jong Kook's card.

186
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,340
What?

187
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,280
- Jong Kook's card.
- You did?

188
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,370
- Yes.
- Jong Kook is spending...

189
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,780
a lot of money this morning.

190
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,070
Really?

191
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,290
Did you use his card too?

192
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,810
I thought you'd use Suk Jin's card.

193
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,550
(Jae Suk gets a text message
at that moment.)

194
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,660
My card...

195
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,180
I guess someone used your card.

196
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,820
- Gosh, he is...
- How much is it?

197
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,090
- It's 184 dollars.
- What?

198
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,960
- Really?
- What did he buy?

199
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,300
- My goodness.
- How is it possible?

200
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,730
I'll spend a fortune with this card.

201
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,340
2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

202
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,060
That's 15. I'll take them all.

203
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,670
Blend all 15 of them.

204
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,800
And...

205
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,040
I'll buy all of these.

206
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,570
(He's an expert at heavy buying.)

207
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,000
Here. Take one each.

208
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,070
You must be hungry. Here.

209
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,290
I bought fruit juice
which is good for your health.

210
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,790
It's the most expensive thing.

211
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,980
Our crew members are working
really hard.

212
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,590
How would he possibly spend
180 dollars at a cafe?

213
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,690
Did he have the coffee delivered
to his house?

214
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,250
(Furious)

215
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,490
How could he...

216
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,920
With my card... My gosh.

217
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,970
(184 dollars spent at a cafe is
an unbelievable amount.)

218
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,670
Actually, this would be...

219
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,840
better for me.

220
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,360
- It's war.
- It's war now.

221
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,410
I knew it.

222
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,670
- "Bring it on."
- Exactly. "Bring it on."

223
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,070
Can you believe that he spent
184 dollars at a cafe?

224
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,740
I...

225
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,350
really like this guy.

226
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,150
But sometimes, he can be annoying.

227
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,250
I've never seen him spend his money.

228
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,660
If he at least tries to pay,
I'll stop him right away,

229
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,750
but he never does.

230
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,820
I hate him
when he's being like that.

231
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,860
I should teach him a lesson.

232
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,400
He's spoiled.

233
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,560
- Hello.
- I'll buy everything you have.

234
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,840
(I'll buy everything you have.)

235
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Can I withdraw cash with this?

236
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,730
(He even tries to withdraw cash
with the card.)

237
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,000
They're working hard.

238
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,850
This is on Kwang Soo.

239
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,940
(He even offers drinks
to the receptionists.)

240
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,110
Thank you.

241
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,720
Try this drink, sir.

242
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,810
(He's forcing Kwang Soo
to do good deeds.)

243
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,940
- I appreciate your hard work.
- Ji Suk Jin.

244
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,660
I should use
the oldest member's card.

245
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,160
I'll have one iced Americano.

246
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,820
There's nothing expensive.

247
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,920
(All the drinks at the cafe
are relatively cheap.)

248
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,960
Hang on.

249
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,560
By the way...

250
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,190
Some people used my card.

251
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,730
What did they buy here
that they paid that much money?

252
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,300
I spent only three dollars
to buy an iced Americano.

253
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,930
They spent a lot.

254
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,980
(He's getting furious
about the money they spent.)

255
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,150
What did they eat?

256
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,910
Hello, Jong Kook.

257
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,840
You seem very upset.

258
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,080
What's there to spend
more than 10 dollars on?

259
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,080
- Really?
- He got it.

260
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,660
- What?
- He got you.

261
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,720
What's there to spend
more than 10 dollars on?

262
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,850
He's angry again.

263
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,030
I saw something.
They bought cookies.

264
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,690
How much are cookies?

265
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,000
- They are like eight dollars.
- What?

266
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,590
I saw them share cookies
with others.

267
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,170
He wouldn't even eat them.
It's just too contrived.

268
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,740
I told you this would happen.

269
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,700
I knew he'd say it's contrived.

270
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,740
I shared them with others.

271
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,440
Why would you buy
something you won't eat?

272
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,670
- Hey, that's enough.
- You like to buy us food.

273
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,710
- I said that's enough.
- I'm okay with that,

274
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,940
but it's just strange.

275
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,180
Did you use Jong Kook's card?

276
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,390
You should be reasonable.

277
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,580
- I already talked about this.
- Hey.

278
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,660
- Just apologize.
- I was...

279
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,420
- I'm sorry.
- Good.

280
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,390
It's over as soon as you apologize.
Why go on about it?

281
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,790
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

282
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,260
- Someone spent 184 dollars.
- Who?

283
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

284
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,370
With whose card?

285
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,240
He's not even generous with money.

286
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,510
- How could you spent 180 dollars...
- He spent 184 dollars.

287
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,800
How is it possible?

288
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,330
So all of you paid...

289
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,700
with a member's card or mine.

290
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,050
This is
what you're going to do today.

291
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,120
A member who wins the missions
will be a decision-maker...

292
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,150
and pick a card to pay
during the race.

293
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,790
It will take place
in the SBS building all day.

294
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,420
It's called When You Go
to the TV Station Race.

295
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,920
You will be shooting
various TV shows...

296
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,890
in the building all day long.

297
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,800
And all the expenses
for the TV shows will be paid...

298
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,060
with these credit cards.

299
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,030
- That sounds great.
- And...

300
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,740
depending on whose credit card
you pick,

301
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,040
the number of people
to get the penalty...

302
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,330
and the chances of
getting the penalty will change.

303
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,460
(The number of people and the odds
of the penalty will change.)

304
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,040
If you stay loyal to your friends...

305
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,550
and pick only the main producer's
card throughout the race,

306
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,520
all of you will get a prize,

307
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,250
and only one person
will get a penalty.

308
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,440
That's easy.

309
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,120
- There's no way we can't do this.
- This is so simple.

310
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,710
If we pick the producer's card,
we all get a prize.

311
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,120
We should use Bo Pil's card.

312
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
- There's no reason not to use it.
- I know.

313
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,760
There's no reason.

314
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
We should definitely use
Bo Pil's card.

315
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,950
I'll tell you why you'd want
to use someone else's card.

316
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,220
The member to get a penalty...

317
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,190
will be decided at the ending.

318
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,960
Do you remember
the game with marbles...

319
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
- that you found very interesting?
- Of course we do.

320
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,240
That's how we will decide.

321
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,670
It will be exciting.

322
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,200
- One person will get a penalty.
- Really?

323
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,670
And you all will start
with one marble each.

324
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,290
And the winner of each mission
will pick a credit card to pay.

325
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,520
If you pick the producer's card,

326
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,890
the number of people to get
the penalty remains the same,

327
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,720
but you will get one more marble.

328
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,390
(If they pick the producer's card,
they get one more marble.)

329
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,920
How could you...

330
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,760
That's horrible.

331
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,460
- Gosh.
- We won't pick the card then.

332
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,220
- No one could use it then.
- You're evil.

333
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,740
But if you pay
with another member's credit card,

334
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,870
one of your marbles is deducted,

335
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,240
and one marble is added
to the credit card owner's.

336
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,410
That is, you can reduce your chances
of getting a penalty...

337
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,010
while increasing
someone else's chances.

338
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,940
- That means we have no choice.
- We have no choice. Gosh.

339
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,340
- Darn you. You petty punk!
- This is ridiculous.

340
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,990
- What is this?
- Hey, treat us for a change!

341
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,710
- Hey!
- Hey, this is too...

342
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,390
- Gosh, you. Don't join the game.
- My gosh.

343
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,790
- I can't believe this.
- Why didn't you just tell us...

344
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,850
- not to use your credit card?
- Let's just leave yours out.

345
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,180
- What's the point of having rules?
- I don't like this.

346
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,320
Listen, everyone.
If you think about it rationally,

347
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,320
one more marble won't increase
your chances that much.

348
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,630
- It'll make it from 1-8th to 2-9th.
- Nonsense.

349
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,300
- That's just nonsense.
- You don't want us to use yours.

350
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,560
- You just don't want that.
- That's not convincing at all.

351
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,510
- That's what you mean.
- We should have no marble.

352
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,300
- That we'd better not use yours.
- We can just use ours.

353
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,880
- Let's use ours.
- It's obvious.

354
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,410
What's the prize? If it's good,
it'd be worth trying.

355
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,940
The prize is Korean beef.

356
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,210
- I want it.
- That sounds great.

357
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,940
- I want to get the prize.
- That brand's meat is delicious.

358
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,080
How about we let one of us get
a penalty and aim for the prize?

359
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,250
Let's do that.

360
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,050
Can I use my credit card
instead of another member's?

361
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,080
- I doubt you would do that.
- You wouldn't do that.

362
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,350
- Hey.
- I've decided how to play this.

363
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,820
- I've made up my mind.
- What a joke.

364
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,030
You'll use your credit card?

365
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,460
Then we'll begin the first round.

366
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,000
- Look at this.
- What is this?

367
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,090
These must be presents for us.

368
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,800
- So Min, there are ball lights too.
- Oh, my.

369
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,240
What's all this?

370
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,510
I see a coffee brewing kit too.

371
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,510
- What are those poles for?
- I have no idea.

372
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,800
- There's a tent here too.
- Why...

373
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,600
The first round is...

374
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,410
- "Law of the Jungle."
- What?

375
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,940
(The first round of the race is
"Law of the Jungle.")

376
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,440
This is our base camp.

377
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,680
- Right here?
- Really?

378
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,920
Aren't we in the middle of the city?

379
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,120
- Here?
- We're surrounded by buildings.

380
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,180
- Try to think you're in the jungle.
- This is driving me nuts.

381
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,320
(The rooftop of the TV station
turned into the jungle.)

382
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,160
In fact, where we are now is
the true jungle.

383
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,190
That's true.

384
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,320
- We're in the wild.
- We're in the jungle.

385
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,770
- We face the intense reality...
- You're right.

386
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,900
I agree.

387
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,090
- This is the jungle in this era.
- Yes, it is.

388
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,370
- We all live intensely, you know.
- That's right. We do.

389
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,780
We all do. Look at Suk Jin.
He lives so intensely.

390
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,540
- No, I don't.
- His clothes are even ripped.

391
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,750
Exactly.

392
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,050
- I take it easy.
- As if he'd been cast away.

393
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,570
- He has holes in his clothes.
- He's managing somehow.

394
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,890
How many patches did you put
on your clothes?

395
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,310
This is considered fashionable.

396
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,050
- There are so many patches on it.
- Vintage never goes out of style.

397
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,660
- You know that.
- You just look poor to me.

398
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,130
You don't look stylish.
You just look poor to me.

399
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,420
He's Poor Ji. Right.

400
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,090
- Poor Ji?
- Yes.

401
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,260
- Poor Ji.
- Yes.

402
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,630
- Your English name is Poor Ji now.
- That suits him.

403
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,590
By the way, Long Legs...

404
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,870
Long Legs, what's with that patch
on your jacket?

405
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,010
- What is that?
- You mean this?

406
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,010
- What's that?
- What's that?

407
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,670
- Is that...
- Is it a charity badge?

408
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,070
- Is it?
- Is it a mountain?

409
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,280
- Hold on.
- Did you...

410
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,470
- I think it looks like an idiot.
- An idiot.

411
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,050
Does this look like
an image of an idiot to you?

412
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,810
- It looks like a school uniform.
- It's just a badge.

413
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,250
- Hey, Long Legs.
- Is it your old school uniform?

414
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,490
- Long Legs, did you...
- Why do you call me that suddenly?

415
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,490
- Long Legs, is it a school uniform?
- It's because you have long legs.

416
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,030
This badge came with the jacket.

417
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,080
(They're criticizing
one another's outfits as always.)

418
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,450
Isn't he wearing clothes
from the same brand as mine?

419
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,900
You're right.

420
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,170
- That's from this brand.
- Isn't that a knock-off?

421
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,920
- That's a knock-off.
- What do you mean?

422
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,090
His jacket is from
the same brand as mine.

423
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,770
- You mean Kwang Soo's jacket?
- That's a knock-off.

424
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,770
This isn't a knock-off.

425
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,170
(The same brand labels were found
on their sleeves.)

426
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,380
You're wearing a knock-off.

427
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,240
- What are you saying?
- I can tell that that's authentic.

428
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,880
- Mine looks like an authentic one.
- Indeed.

429
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,650
- I can tell that.
- We're wearing different jackets.

430
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,440
Comedians never wear
knock-off clothes.

431
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,210
- That's true.
- Hey, stop it. That's enough.

432
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,710
- I'm a comedian too.
- My gosh. That's enough.

433
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,050
(Kwang Soo finally admitted
that he's a comedian.)

434
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,550
This is not a knock-off.

435
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,920
- What's that?
- Fine.

436
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,450
- Hey, stop it now.
- What's that?

437
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,550
What's wrong with this badge?

438
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,450
- Just leave him be.
- All right.

439
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,370
- Isn't that a crab?
- Guys, stop it.

440
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,690
- I think it's a crab.
- Stop it.

441
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,400
- I mean...
- Is it a crab?

442
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,060
- Let's love one another.
- Hey, guys.

443
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,830
- I love you all.
- Isn't it a crab? I think it is.

444
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,270
I'll take it off! Gosh.

445
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,380
That's enough.

446
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,780
- That's not a heart.
- Hey,

447
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,910
if you take that off, you lose.

448
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,710
Don't take it off to the end.

449
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,970
- Stop it.
- Right.

450
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,290
- Long Legs, you punk.
- Why is Suk Jin's jacket so short?

451
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,440
- Look at his shoulders.
- You have no fashion sense.

452
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,050
- Poor Ji.
- It's sagging too much.

453
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,420
It looks cool because it's short.

454
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,630
Yours is too long.

455
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,050
- I'll show you...
- I think his outfit looks nice.

456
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,030
- I think it's nice.
- Are you serious?

457
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,350
That's a playful style.

458
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,690
- It's simple and nice.
- He looks cute.

459
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,090
(He suddenly started
acting playful.)

460
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,770
- That style suits him.
- It looks nice.

461
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,830
He looks so cute.

462
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,370
(He's jumping to the side
to tease Poor Ji.)

463
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,300
- He looks cute.
- Rascal, Rascal.

464
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,740
- He dressed up cute today.
- This is...

465
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,170
from an expensive brand.

466
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,550
- As you can see,
- Suk Jin, you should try this too.

467
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,880
he kept the color combination
simple.

468
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,080
- With a bright color.
- The colors look good on him.

469
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,660
I just can't speak to those
who have no fashion sense.

470
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,760
It's a calm color.

471
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,210
Jong Kook likes this style.

472
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,890
- And it's oversized.
- Yes, it is.

473
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,680
- He looks cute in it.
- Indeed.

474
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,260
- Look how cute he is.
- I look even cuter if I do this.

475
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,850
- Exactly.
- He looks like a little boy.

476
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,090
- He looks so cute.
- I look even cuter...

477
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,320
- when I wear it sideways.
- He looks so cute.

478
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,240
- He's best at teasing others.
- Look at him.

479
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,170
Haha, you know, right?
You have a good fashion sense.

480
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,200
Be honest with me.

481
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,410
Would you have this or that?

482
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,670
- I'd choose that one.
- Be honest... Gosh.

483
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,750
Would you have this or that?

484
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,310
(I would have that one.)

485
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,840
You guys are all so pretentious.

486
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,250
- Sorry, I had to choose this.
- Does he look cute or not?

487
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,120
- I had to in this situation.
- You look cute.

488
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,990
- Given the situation...
- That was the only reason, right?

489
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,050
- Right?
- He looks cute.

490
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,490
Oh, it was customized?

491
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,080
Actually, I heard that this style is
in style.

492
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,220
They usually wear a vest like this
without a T-shirt under it.

493
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,350
- But...
- Which one?

494
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,370
I was supposed to wear this best
on my bare skin.

495
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,800
- Forget it.
- I mean...

496
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,560
- Hey!
- On your bare skin?

497
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,000
- That's how they style this vest.
- You made me picture it.

498
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,560
- On your bare skin?
- Are you a member of Solid?

499
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,430
- You're talking nonsense.
- You must've lost your mind.

500
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,970
- What is she talking about?
- On your bare skin?

501
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,670
- You must've lost your mind.
- Are you a member of Solid?

502
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,440
Even men don't wear a vest
on their bare skin.

503
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,650
I wore this T-shirt under the vest
because our show is rated PG.

504
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,150
Are you saying that you'd wear it
on your bare skin otherwise?

505
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,520
- People usually wear it...
- Stop it.

506
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,580
- Keep it together.
- Why are you guys so conservative?

507
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,850
- Don't do that.
- We're not conservative.

508
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,260
Stop saying nonsense.

509
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,320
- You sound like an old man.
- You brat.

510
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,630
Don't do that. Don't do it!

511
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,590
Look at Ji Hyo. She's dressed
like a girl in the 1960s.

512
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,530
- Look at her, you brat.
- She looks so feminine.

513
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,030
She looks so diligent.

514
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,460
- She looks diligent too.
- Why? I...

515
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,460
- Like a perfect daughter-in-law.
- True.

516
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,960
You wear revealing clothes too
on "I Can See Your Voice."

517
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,600
- What? That's different.
- On "I Can See Your Voice."

518
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,430
- That show has a different concept.
- He dresses casually only on here.

519
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,300
He dresses like this when he's asked
to dress like a romantic boyfriend.

520
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,920
- Why? Hey!
- Go and shave your mustache.

521
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,580
What's wrong with this style?
It could be a personal trainer.

522
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,520
Must all boyfriends dress up?

523
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,310
- It's never-ending.
- Personal trainers dress like this.

524
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,000
(The new definition of the style
goes right into his ears.)

525
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,800
- Hey, am I bleeding?
- It's never-ending.

526
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,090
- Hang in there. It'll be over soon.
- I think I'm bleeding.

527
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,730
- Hey!
- Look at his body.

528
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,940
I'm like G-DRAGON
among personal trainers.

529
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,300
- Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

530
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,660
I thought you were a singer.

531
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,210
- Are you a personal trainer?
- No.

532
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,980
He mentioned the boyfriend style.

533
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,980
- There could be a boyfriend...
- By the way,

534
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,310
I met Kim Jin Ho of SG Wannabe
not long ago.

535
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,340
I found out that he always dresses
just like you do.

536
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,190
- Has he been working out lately?
- He likes to wear black.

537
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,250
Really?

538
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,110
- KCM dresses like that too.
- Exactly.

539
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,790
- Some men like to wear black.
- Everyone has his own style.

540
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,910
- That's funny.
- We haven't even started it.

541
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,290
- Let's stop chatting now.
- You're right.

542
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,350
- Stop it!
- Let's stop chatting.

543
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,430
(Unlike what they said,
they like to have a chat.)

544
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,500
As I told you,
this is our base camp.

545
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,800
You got a text when someone used
your credit card.

546
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,940
You'll exchange your phones
in the order of payment.

547
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,970
- What does that mean?
- Now,

548
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,270
So Min, give your phone to Ji Hyo.

549
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,400
- My phone...
- Ji Hyo, give yours to Se Chan.

550
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,100
Se Chan's goes to Kwang Soo.
Kwang Soo's goes to Jae Suk.

551
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,280
Jae Suk's goes to Suk Jin.

552
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,210
Suk Jin's goes to Haha.
Haha, give yours to Jong Kook.

553
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,070
- Here you go. This is my phone.
- Gosh.

554
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,310
- Jong Kook, here you go.
- I don't have it now.

555
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,520
- I'll give it to you later.
- Oh, I should give it to So Min?

556
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,610
Yes, that's right.

557
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,610
- And then?
- Here you go.

558
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,690
- Me?
- Yes.

559
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,190
(Kwang Soo to Jae Suk)

560
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,820
I couldn't even imagine that.

561
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,490
He was holding his phone like this.
I wondered what he was doing.

562
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,650
By the way, this is...

563
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,300
Wait. Someone gave this to me
instead of his phone. What is this?

564
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Oh, that?

565
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,300
- It's a flip phone.
- Yes. That's my phone. Take it.

566
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,630
(The unprecedented flip phone
made of plastic)

567
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,770
- That flip phone is so cool.
- You answer it like this?

568
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,070
- It's from S brand, right?
- Yes, it's the latest model.

569
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,450
He must look down on me
seeing that he gave this to me.

570
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,870
That phone has such a big screen.

571
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,840
(Here you go!)

572
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,990
The first mission is to decorate
the base camp...

573
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,460
using the given item regardless of
the location and size of the area.

574
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,490
All of these? Really?

575
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,000
The staff members who went
to shoot "Law of the Jungle..."

576
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,620
will choose the person who made
the biggest contribution.

577
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,730
(The chosen member will have
the right to decide how to pay.)

578
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,660
You have two sets
of every camping item.

579
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,560
So you'll be divided into
2 teams of 4 members.

580
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,560
Jae Suk, since the largest amount
was spent on your credit card,

581
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,630
you can choose three members
you want to team up with.

582
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,630
(Jae Suk will select
his team members.)

583
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,450
- So it's a competition.
- Oh, I see.

584
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,010
And the person who did the most work
will decide how to pay.

585
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,750
Setting up a tent is very difficult.

586
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,480
I was a Boy Scout.

587
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,410
For the honor of all Boy Scouts...

588
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,260
- I need Jong Kook to set up a tent.
- Right.

589
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,380
- I'll choose Jong Kook.
- I was a Boy Scout.

590
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,030
- The Three Good Deeds Promise.
- He was a Boy Scout.

591
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,820
(Another former Boy Scout appeared.)

592
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,320
Doing three good things every day.

593
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,360
- I promise!
- I promise!

594
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,970
- Join my team.
- Yes!

595
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,700
You see... I was a Boy Scout too.

596
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,130
- Really?
- Yes.

597
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,300
- Did you go on backyard camping?
- Of course.

598
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
You did?

599
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,710
You should tie up toilet paper
with the string not to trip over...

600
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,980
- at night.
- That's right.

601
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,950
I was a member of Aramdan.

602
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,720
- Aramdan? Join my team.
- Aramdan?

603
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,550
- She's on our team.
- We need someone like you.

604
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,880
- Her outfit looks like the uniform.
- It looks like Aramdan uniform.

605
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,910
- I just need the beret.
- Indeed.

606
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,690
I was a member of Aramdan too.

607
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,020
We're on the same team then.
Come here.

608
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,230
- I... I have...
- I have no such experience.

609
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,430
- I've done some volunteer work.
- You're good at this, right?

610
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,500
- Setting up a tent.
- I joined Aramdan.

611
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,730
- Of course.
- All right.

612
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,800
I'm a little worried.

613
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,160
You have to set up 1 tent, 4 chairs,

614
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,500
shelves, 1 table, 1 parasol,
and 1 hammock. That's all.

615
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,700
- Okay.
- Let's move.

616
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,860
Really? It won't be so easy.

617
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,270
What should we do first?
We should start with a tent, right?

618
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,600
- Oh, my.
- Kwang Soo!

619
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
- Yes, Jae Suk.
- Let's move this first.

620
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
We need tools like a hammer.

621
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,610
- To stick stakes in the ground...
- Oh, I see.

622
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,520
And we need to
put these poles together.

623
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,110
We rarely go camping.

624
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,020
- We're not that type.
- It looks like a hassle to me.

625
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,530
I don't know why I joined Boy Scout.

626
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,350
Why did I join Boy Scout
when I didn't even like camping?

627
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,230
Se Chan appeared
on "Law of the Jungle."

628
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,390
(Three years ago, Ssaebssaeb joined
Byung Man's Tribe.)

629
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,440
Where should this go?

630
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,100
Just put them all together for now.

631
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,130
I'll tell you the basic skills
for setting up a tent.

632
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,630
- I should build up the frame first.
- Correct.

633
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,870
And then...

634
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,980
I think we need some more space.
Kwang Soo, move those boxes.

635
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,410
Move faster!

636
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,410
I'm trying.

637
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,110
Bring me one of those small ones
to stick it in the ground.

638
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,220
(Bring that small one over there.)

639
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,430
Place it here. Right here.

640
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,120
- That's good. That side too.
- Be careful not to get hurt.

641
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,700
Run over there
and place another one.

642
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,320
You should grab the corner,
you punk!

643
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,630
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

644
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,770
- Boy Scouts aren't like him.
- What kind of Boy Scout were you?

645
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,770
- This isn't what Boy Scouts do.
- What kind of Boy Scout...

646
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,440
I was a Boy Scout leader
at my school.

647
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,400
I had so many badges...

648
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,680
that I had no space
for another one on my vest.

649
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,640
Are you sure you didn't take
those badges from other kids?

650
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,720
- Are you?
- My badges...

651
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,410
Hey, my team members are working
quietly and well.

652
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,410
Come over here. Like this.
That's good.

653
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,050
- Should I start at the bottom?
- Put it in here like this.

654
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,230
(The tent duo quietly started
setting up a tent.)

655
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,580
- Got it?
- Yes.

656
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,760
(Okay.)

657
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,890
I'm done.

658
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,800
- Are you?
- Good job!

659
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,030
Okay. Nice.

660
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,270
How does this work?

661
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,040
Put that... That goes to the front.

662
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,940
- It goes this way, right?
- Yes, finish the bottom part first.

663
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,830
Oh, gosh, seriously. Darn!

664
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,830
(Oh, gosh, seriously. Darn!)

665
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,780
Gosh!

666
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,800
(He's groaning
while grabbing the one-touch chair.)

667
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,370
Gosh. I can't put them together!

668
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,070
(He's struggling
while holding the legs.)

669
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,520
Gosh. Why can't I do this?

670
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,580
We have a manual for that chair,
Suk Jin.

671
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,220
Oh, man.

672
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,610
(He's wasting his energy
without reading the instructions.)

673
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,850
Gosh.

674
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,050
There's a manual for that?

675
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
- Oh, gosh.
- Gosh!

676
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,890
(He threw a tantrum in the end.)

677
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,430
- Gosh!
- Read the manual.

678
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,820
Gosh. What's wrong?

679
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,000
(He got so frustrated
that he blurted out a swear word.)

680
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,330
Suk Jin, you should probably put it
through that.

681
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,510
(He's living another intense day.)

682
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,540
Suk Jin, let's do it together.

683
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,940
Should I put it here first?

684
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,780
I think I should.

685
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,280
- It should be reversed, Suk Jin.
- Really?

686
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,550
- This side should go up.
- I see.

687
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,950
- You're right.
- Yes.

688
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,310
- Oh, right.
- Yes.

689
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,720
So Min, move a little to this side.

690
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,580
- This is it. Okay.
- Wait there.

691
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,960
- We're almost done.
- Yes, this is it. Good.

692
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,260
"Law of the Jungle" with the cast
of Running Man.

693
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,270
This is a house for me and Se Chan.
It's our house of love.

694
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,890
- I refuse.
- Hey.

695
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,970
I would definitely sleep outside.

696
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,940
- Okay.
- Yes!

697
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,330
- One chair is done.
- Done.

698
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,740
Okay.

699
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,600
Suk Jin,
why don't we set this one up?

700
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,900
Let's do it together.

701
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,410
- Do the same on that side.
- This is so nice. It's comfortable.

702
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,110
It's done!

703
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,250
- Let's move it to this side.
- Good job!

704
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,960
Let's adjust the shape.
And now let's make a door.

705
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,150
- Awesome.
- Let's make a door.

706
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,230
- Hello. I'm Yoon Do Hyun.
- Yoon Do Hyun?

707
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,960
Gosh, they've probably only stayed
in hotels.

708
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,230
Hey. What can you guys do?

709
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,800
Look at this.

710
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,030
We already finished setting up
the tent and a chair.

711
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,620
Suk Jin,
it wasn't you who set them up.

712
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,240
My gosh. I set up the chair.

713
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,240
Okay. It's done.

714
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,470
- A chair?
- Yes.

715
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,400
Let's set up the chairs now.

716
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,630
(Hammering hard)

717
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,280
Hey, you're hammering so hard...

718
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,050
Is there a storm coming
or something?

719
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,810
No, I thought it could help to get
some extra points...

720
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,020
- from the staff members.
- Great. Go ahead.

721
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,080
Go ahead and try.

722
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,990
Hammer it hard, you punk.
This one too.

723
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,320
Good.

724
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,620
- Hold on.
- Give it to me.

725
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,430
- I mean, he's acting weird...
- Watch me.

726
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,060
Hit it right in the middle,
you punk.

727
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,270
(Meanwhile, Team Suk Jin finished
setting up a hammock.)

728
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,500
- Look at that hammock.
- Oh, yes!

729
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,740
The hammock looks great.

730
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,900
- There you go.
- Nice!

731
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,900
(The hammock looks great.)

732
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,740
- Hey, get out for a second.
- Why?

733
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,240
Once we finish setting something up,
Suk Jin comes to try it.

734
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,400
- Just move.
- Why?

735
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,710
I want to lie in it.

736
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,640
I was lying in it.

737
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,050
(Wobbling)

738
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,550
Awesome. I always wanted this.

739
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,050
(Laughing)

740
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,410
(The greedy man bursts out laughing
on the hammock.)

741
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,260
They got so excited
when it's not so hard to set it up.

742
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,030
- Exactly. They're showing off.
- I can't believe them.

743
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,150
- My gosh.
- They're showing off.

744
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,820
They know nothing about camping.

745
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,130
(The frame fell on his foot.)

746
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,630
- Jae Suk.
- Are you okay?

747
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,900
- It's okay. Pretend you're okay!
- I'm fine.

748
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,330
You'll lose points.
Don't act like it hurts.

749
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,070
- He didn't get hurt.
- Right.

750
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,780
What did they learn as Boy Scouts?

751
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,300
- Don't act like it hurts.
- What are they doing?

752
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,140
- I think this is right.
- We should put this one vertically.

753
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,370
- That's right.
- Vertically?

754
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,020
- Put the legs down.
- Aren't these legs?

755
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,690
- Yes, they are, but they're...
- I'll show you.

756
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,690
Aren't they legs?

757
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,690
(Kwang Soo is getting in
to see where the legs should be.)

758
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,020
I get it. We should hang it here.

759
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,150
- Try it.
- We should hang it here.

760
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,260
Try it. Leave the frame as it is.

761
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,530
- Kwang Soo, get out.
- Get out, you punk.

762
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,530
- Hey, get out now.
- I said, get out!

763
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,000
- Get out.
- Bend it backward.

764
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,330
- Put the legs down. Kwang Soo, go.
- Okay.

765
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,330
- This is it.
- Put the legs down.

766
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,000
- Put them down.
- That's good.

767
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,060
- Like this?
- No, it goes this way.

768
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,510
- It's almost done.
- You're right.

769
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,570
- We can just put these together...
- Don't do anything!

770
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Put the legs down.

771
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,750
I don't think we're doing it right.

772
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,840
We should bend them like this.

773
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,720
I shouldn't have joined Boy Scout!

774
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,050
- How?
- Kwang Soo, hold this.

775
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,220
- And spread it.
- Oh, this is it.

776
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,520
Spread it widely, Kwang Soo!

777
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,220
- Okay?
- Good. Put it down.

778
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,610
- Move aside.
- Move, you punk.

779
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,020
No, not there.

780
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,850
- Move.
- It's done.

781
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,260
Gosh, I love camping.

782
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,030
Hey, come and lie in it
so we can see if it's safe.

783
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,700
- Oh, right.
- Come and lie in it.

784
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,320
- Let's see if it's safe.
- Wait.

785
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,740
Good. Is it okay?

786
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,040
- My, it's nice.
- Okay. Get out now.

787
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,540
- It's so nice.
- Get out now!

788
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,710
- My gosh.
- Okay. Get out now.

789
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,040
(If it's okay, get out!)

790
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,100
- Great.
- Get out.

791
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,510
- Get out!
- Do you call this camping?

792
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,680
- Go away, you punk. It's done.
- Kwang Soo.

793
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,410
Hey, we have to decorate it too,
don't we?

794
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,410
Let's do that now.

795
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,520
(Jong Kook aims to gain extra points
by setting up the parasol.)

796
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,850
It's weird.
There's no shade over the hammock.

797
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,430
- Jong Kook.
- The sun is above our heads.

798
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,030
- The sun moves, you know.
- It's right above us.

799
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,360
Let's set up the parasol too,
Suk Jin.

800
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,470
Don't copy us!

801
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,130
Don't be ridiculous.
We have the same items...

802
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,600
(Would you look at this guy?)

803
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,010
We're not copying you.
We have to set it up eventually too.

804
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,640
What was that, you punk?
What did you say?

805
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,900
I was talking to him.

806
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,220
What?

807
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,050
Okay.

808
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,950
You hit me just because you won
the Grand Award.

809
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,080
What?

810
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,020
(Picking up a pole)

811
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,820
Don't cross this line. The pole.

812
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,050
- Let me ask your team a question.
- Don't cross the pole.

813
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,890
- Don't cross it.
- Do you have Grand Award winners?

814
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,890
Hey. That's... Hey.

815
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,770
(Hey. That's...)

816
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,830
Hey, I'm eligible to get
the COVID vaccine.

817
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,860
- I'm a research test subject.
- What?

818
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,710
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

819
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,440
- Congratulations, Suk Jin.
- Congratulations.

820
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,540
- Thank you.
- He's the first...

821
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,450
- to get it among us.
- Tell us how it felt.

822
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,550
(Jong Kook turned around
after applauding him.)

823
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,550
(Kwang Soo takes out a tissue.)

824
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,220
We might trip and fall at night,
so I'll tie tissue around the pole.

825
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,990
(I'll tie tissue around the pole.)

826
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,760
(He's trying to impress the judges.)

827
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,030
- What are you doing?
- Pardon?

828
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,230
- What are you doing?
- They're watching us.

829
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,090
You did well. Go ahead.

830
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,270
(He ties a tissue just for show.)

831
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,360
- We won't trip over the pole now.
- Okay.

832
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,390
What are you looking at?

833
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,400
(He puts a pinwheel
on top of the tent this time.)

834
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,070
I'll put a pinwheel here
so we can tell how fast the wind is.

835
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,640
The judges aren't there.

836
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,720
Aren't they the judges?

837
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,310
(Aren't they the judges?)

838
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,020
Who are those ladies?

839
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,150
(He gave his lengthy, silly speech
to the wrong people.)

840
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,150
Done!

841
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,580
- It looks quite nice.
- It looks great.

842
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,150
Good. Kwang Soo, you're doing great.

843
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,150
Thank you.

844
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,390
- What is this?
- Tie it up there.

845
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,890
Oh, no. Goodness. I'm sorry.

846
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,590
(Oh, no! Goodness! I'm sorry!)

847
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,440
(The hammock fell down.)

848
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,130
I tripped over it accidentally.
It's true.

849
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,740
(He tries to sabotage the other team
right in front of them.)

850
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,600
Oh, no. I'm really sorry.

851
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,280
- My gosh.
- I apologize.

852
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,010
- How could you...
- I'm so sorry.

853
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,400
- You did it intentionally.
- I'm sorry.

854
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,280
- I'm sorry.
- Be careful, Jae Suk.

855
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,640
- Sorry.
- What was that?

856
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,790
Are you starting a fight?

857
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,340
Come on, are you from
the Green Mothers' Association?

858
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,810
(They set up the base camp
amidst a war of nerves.)

859
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,760
We'll give you ten more minutes.

860
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,760
All done!
We should hang the ball lights.

861
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,820
I forgot about the shoot
for a moment.

862
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,850
- I forgot about it too.
- I'm having so much fun.

863
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,270
- Me too.
- I like things like this.

864
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,270
So do I.

865
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,970
My, it's pretty.

866
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,560
I'm becoming more attached to this
since we've set it up now.

867
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,160
Kwang Soo,
this pinwheel is spinning so fast.

868
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,740
- Indeed. Jae Suk.
- Great job.

869
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,840
I should adjust the length.

870
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,140
- It's amazing that we did this.
- Right?

871
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,020
- Okay.
- This is hard to believe.

872
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,720
I have never set up a tent
or anything like this before.

873
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,310
This is my first time ever.

874
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,880
But did Suk Jin do anything
to set those up?

875
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,380
Suk Jin?
All he did was try what we set up.

876
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,690
He just watched us working.

877
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,000
- It's so nice.
- Why is Suk Jin so excited?

878
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,050
This is why I hate camping
with dads.

879
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,090
It's so nice.

880
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,740
If I have a place to lie down,
food to eat,

881
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,390
and time to rest,
isn't that what happiness is?

882
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,830
What else could it be?

883
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,940
Cut that nonsense. You told me...

884
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,240
that only money can
bring you happiness...

885
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,780
and that you are looked down on
when you're poor.

886
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,450
That's a total lie.

887
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,370
He's such a good liar.

888
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,310
Happiness isn't far away.
This is what happiness is about.

889
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,410
Shall we drink something?

890
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,220
It's nice.

891
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,990
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

892
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,050
- We have non-alcoholic beer.
- Where?

893
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,230
(- We have non-alcoholic beer.
- Where?)

894
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,590
(She sounds so cheerful.)

895
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,320
- Hey.
- She never sounds that cheerful.

896
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,860
It's my first time too.

897
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,390
- She never sounds that cheerful.
- Whom is she talking to?

898
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,710
- Ji Hyo, here's non-alcoholic beer.
- Thank you, Jae Suk.

899
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,860
- Beer is essential for camping.
- I was so surprised.

900
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,160
Absolutely. It's essential.

901
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,600
- Do you like it?
- It's so good.

902
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,800
Ji Hyo just sounded so cheerful.

903
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,980
- "Where?"
- "Where?"

904
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,050
Hey.

905
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,750
Are you guys still working?

906
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,910
This makes me feel so happy.

907
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,310
So Min, are you still working?

908
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,310
- I'm enjoying this.
- She's knitting something.

909
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,790
- All four of you should be working.
- Exactly.

910
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,150
- Oh, great. It's so relaxing.
- That's what I'm trying to say.

911
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,590
- She likes doing things like this.
- That's true.

912
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,800
I like things like this.

913
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,390
Look how they're lying around
just because their work is done.

914
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,830
We told her not to do it,
but she insisted.

915
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,130
- This helps me relax.
- Stop. You're making us look bad.

916
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,270
This helps me relax...

917
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,900
- Stop liking things like this.
- The other members...

918
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,940
- Stop it. Give me that.
- Come on. I'm really enjoying it.

919
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,510
- How many times did I tell you?
- What's wrong with you?

920
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,450
I want to do it. Don't take it away.

921
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,050
Don't do it even if you want to.
We're in an awkward position.

922
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,580
It looks as if we made you do
all the work.

923
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,990
This is fun.

924
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,110
Then say it out loud
so they can hear you.

925
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,730
I'm enjoying this!

926
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,730
Good.

927
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,730
(She was forced to say it.)

928
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,120
- So Min, you're having fun, right?
- Yes, this is so fun.

929
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,700
Keep saying that out loud.

930
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,470
Or else, you'll make us look bad.

931
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,330
Keep saying
how much you're enjoying doing that.

932
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,740
- I'm happy that you're enjoying it.
- My, this is so much fun.

933
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,970
- How nice.
- This is really nice.

934
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,510
I see why people like camping
so much.

935
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,480
This is so nice.

936
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,640
By the way, you two...

937
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,180
look a little weird together
with that thing behind you.

938
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,410
What's that?

939
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,310
- Aren't those for babies?
- Hey, you guys...

940
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,850
(Aren't those for babies?)

941
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,850
You two look like...

942
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,490
Where did our child go?

943
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,000
You should've watched our child.

944
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,530
- Where did our child go?
- Oh, let's clock out for a while.

945
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,590
(She announces she's clocking out
from childcare for today.)

946
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,240
(It suits her perfectly.)

947
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,240
This is the beauty of camping.

948
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,980
- Isn't the why people go camping?
- This is great.

949
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,280
(While everyone enjoys
a laid-back camping trip)

950
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,870
(Abruptly)

951
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,800
Why don't we neighbors
raise our glasses?

952
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,840
Here. How about some beer?

953
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,520
- Well...
- You must know how to have fun.

954
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,790
Aren't you having any beer?

955
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,290
Come on.

956
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,610
- Here.
- Hold on a second.

957
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,810
- Did you speak informally to her?
- Sorry about that.

958
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,960
Are you out of your mind?

959
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,930
- She's a stranger to you.
- Well,

960
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,320
- she looks like someone I know.
- Unbelievable.

961
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,500
Okay, then. Cheers.

962
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,970
- Mister.
- Yes?

963
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,560
We'd like our peace,
so please get lost.

964
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,270
Just join me for a drink.

965
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,770
- Hold on.
- We're not here for that.

966
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,740
I'm here with my subordinates.

967
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,010
That's now what we're here for.

968
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,830
We're to clear our heads
from a bad event.

969
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,640
So what brings you by here?

970
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,950
How do you four know each other?

971
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,640
(Gulping down)

972
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,310
- He...
- Unbelievable.

973
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,680
- Is he drunk?
- Are you drunk?

974
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,340
No, I'm not.

975
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,610
- This is to die for.
- He's in a drunken frenzy.

976
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,220
This is good.

977
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,350
I feel bad for him.

978
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,380
- Suk Jin.
- No one wants him there.

979
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,500
- Just get back here, will you?
- It's sad to see you this way.

980
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,230
They can't possibly
harm me physically.

981
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,820
- Here.
- What's up with him?

982
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,160
- This is great.
- Your time is up.

983
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,730
This is nice.

984
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,330
(They've completed
their base camps.)

985
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,700
They're constantly
writing things down.

986
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,040
We're being evaluated.

987
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,540
If only I had a guitar here.

988
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,900
When, when, when

989
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,370
- When the stormy sea
- When the stormy sea

990
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:33,410
- Calms down
- Calms down

991
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,140
Will you come to me
Here we go.

992
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,080
- From across the sea
- From across the sea

993
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,320
- Only you
- Only you

994
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,620
- I'll await
- I'll await

995
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,090
My love, I will always

996
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,830
Await you

997
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,890
(While the laid-back trio sing,
the others change clothes.)

998
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,860
This is why people go camping.

999
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,660
It feels real thanks to
the non-alcoholic beer.

1000
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,800
- Right?
- Yes.

1001
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,180
Would you like a beverage?

1002
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,210
We have our own, darn it.

1003
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,870
Why are you acting like
we're the enemy?

1004
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,550
Can't you say it more peacefully?

1005
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,310
Why be prickly
when we're only being generous?

1006
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,910
Shut it!

1007
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,910
There's no need for this.

1008
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,930
Look at him cozying up to Jong Kook.

1009
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,030
I wouldn't mind smacking him.

1010
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,530
That lanky...

1011
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,890
- Hey!
- Seriously?

1012
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,360
(He falls on his back.)

1013
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,630
- Hey!
- Seriously?

1014
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,890
Stop that, will you?

1015
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,510
(He ends up washing his face
with alcohol.)

1016
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,240
You're being like Suk Jin.

1017
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,540
(All they can do is laugh
at Kwang Soo's mishap.)

1018
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,400
- That was too much, wasn't it?
- Sorry about that.

1019
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,010
Look at how embarrassed he is.

1020
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,870
He's embarrassed.

1021
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,050
Can I do anything to help?

1022
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,280
Camping isn't complete without beer.

1023
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,310
Guys,

1024
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,810
there is a staff member
who's been watching you from afar...

1025
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,880
that always rolls with
"Law of the Jungle" team.

1026
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,530
For every episode? Really?

1027
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,460
Out of the eight of you,

1028
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,430
he'll announce the member
that contributed the most.

1029
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,090
That member will choose the card
to pay for this all with.

1030
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,200
- Se Chan worked hard.
- I bet it's someone from our team.

1031
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,440
(Who will get to choose
the credit card first?)

1032
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,940
The member
who contributed the most is...

1033
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,740
It's Se Chan.

1034
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,400
- It has to be Se Chan.
- Se Chan worked hard.

1035
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,840
(Will it be Se Chan
who led his team...)

1036
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,280
(using what he learned
on "Law of the Jungle?")

1037
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,580
Today, we collaborate
with Running Man.

1038
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,080
(Will it be Kwang Soo
who only did chores...)

1039
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,720
(that made it seem
like he was contributing?)

1040
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,850
(Or will it be Jong Kook,)

1041
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:27,720
(the former Boy Scout member
who hotly ordered everyone around?)

1042
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,030
I forgot that we were
filming Running Man for a second.

1043
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,530
(Will it be So Min
who decorated the tent...)

1044
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,030
(as if it were actually hers?)

1045
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,530
(Who did the jungle expert choose?)

1046
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,450
It's Se Chan.

1047
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,600
(Yang Se Chan)

1048
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,850
(The experienced jungle explorer
was chosen.)

1049
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,780
- Him?
- How did he contribute?

1050
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,050
But...

1051
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,740
Se Chan,

1052
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,720
please head to the cashier...

1053
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,080
and pick a credit card...

1054
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,990
to pay for the camping equipment
used in this round.

1055
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,200
Just so you know, the total cost...

1056
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,430
is 300 dollars.

1057
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,490
- That's quite a lot.
- It's a lot.

1058
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,640
(The equipment
would've cost 300 dollars.)

1059
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,760
That's a lot.

1060
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,260
(The equipment
would've cost 300 dollars.)

1061
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,760
It's a lot.

1062
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,600
I'll get going then.

1063
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,030
Hi there.

1064
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,200
(Se Chan heads to the cashier.)

1065
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,450
I'm still on the fence.

1066
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,580
You start with only one
being up for punishment...

1067
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,450
and a marble each for every member.

1068
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,080
If I use someone else's card,

1069
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,310
my marble will be taken away.

1070
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,060
If you pay
with someone else's credit card,

1071
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,390
your marble will be added
to that person,

1072
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,600
and one more person
will receive the punishment.

1073
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,970
(1 more person
will receive the punishment.)

1074
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,370
But if...

1075
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,700
I choose to pay with
the head director's credit card...

1076
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,430
If you pay with
the head director's card,

1077
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,640
the number of people receiving
the punishment will stay the same,

1078
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,200
but a marble
will be added to your name.

1079
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,470
I can't have that.

1080
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,700
(Paying with the director's card
will give him an additional marble.)

1081
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,370
(Se Chan chooses someone's card.)

1082
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,470
I'd like to pay now.

1083
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,720
They're written down as LOL.

1084
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,950
LOL.

1085
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,950
(300 dollars has been paid
via credit card.)

1086
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,120
You weren't kidding.

1087
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,260
(Whose credit card
did Se Chan choose?)

1088
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,430
- Can I go now?
- Sure.

1089
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,220
That person now has
an additional marble.

1090
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,370
Got it.

1091
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,140
They weren't kidding.

1092
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,700
(Someone now has
an additional marble.)

1093
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,010
I'm back, guys.

1094
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,410
The credit card was used
to actually pay for everything.

1095
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,100
- For real.
- Is there a payment terminal?

1096
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,410
Yes, there's one.

1097
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,510
I even saw the receipt come out.

1098
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,280
Wait, I felt a gentle vibration.

1099
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,450
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

1100
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,910
(I'm good, right?)

1101
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,780
- Is it for real?
- Yes.

1102
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,450
(Haha checks the phone he has.)

1103
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,180
Yes, that one.

1104
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,600
It's for real.

1105
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,390
- What do you mean?
- 300 dollars.

1106
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,260
Really?

1107
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,870
Wait, is this 30 dollars?

1108
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,560
How many zeroes are there?

1109
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,740
- 300 dollars.
- What is it?

1110
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,990
Suk Jin, I had a blast.

1111
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,200
- Thanks for everything.
- Exactly.

1112
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,510
(What?)

1113
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,910
You sure know how to set an example.

1114
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,050
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Suk Jin.

1115
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,740
Thanks to you, we got to go camping.

1116
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
Thanks.

1117
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,780
Suk Jin, thank you.

1118
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,720
- It's for real.
- What did I tell you?

1119
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,010
Hey. Seriously, Yangsebari?

1120
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,310
Thank you so much.

1121
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,720
- I had a blast.
- Thanks.

1122
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,760
This much I can understand, but...

1123
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
What...

1124
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,490
do you think you're doing?

1125
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,760
(Se Chan is down a marble
while Suk Jin has 1 more.)

1126
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,600
I'm glad that you had fun.

1127
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,060
- This is great.
- Could this be any better?

1128
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,030
- This is why...
- Maybe I should go camping.

1129
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,260
This is why people wish to live
in a house with a yard.

1130
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,600
With a dog, right?

1131
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,430
Yes, with a dog to keep you company.

1132
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,370
(His eyes are fixed.)

1133
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,370
Later on...

1134
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,740
(Jae Suk's ready to attack.)

1135
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,870
(Suk Jin avoids eye contact.)

1136
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,850
Suk Jin gets nervous
when you look at him,

1137
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,010
- so don't.
- It's okay.

1138
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,160
Look all you want.

1139
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,310
Stare at me.

1140
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,280
- He's nervous.
- Later on in life,

1141
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,030
after I retire,

1142
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,450
I'll go and live on an island.

1143
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,560
Sure.

1144
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,220
(Jae Suk ends the conversation
with a half-hearted answer.)

1145
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,200
Give him a warmer response.

1146
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,430
- But he...
- He might cry, you know.

1147
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,600
What's there to be upset about?

1148
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,910
All right.

1149
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,830
Now it's time for the second show.

1150
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,330
- We're busy today.
- You'll be playing for lunch...

1151
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,470
in the "Alley Restaurants" round.

1152
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,640
- "Alley Restaurants!"
- This is the real deal.

1153
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,680
- Right.
- I'm hungry.

1154
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,550
There are a total of two dishes,

1155
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,890
and you'll play a game
to see which two will pay for them.

1156
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,910
- Right.
- Not one.

1157
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,560
Each winner will get to choose
a credit card to pay with.

1158
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,990
We looked up some games
to play while out camping...

1159
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,120
and found a variation
of the strawberry game.

1160
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,930
- Unbelievable.
- A variation of it?

1161
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,030
- Jae Suk, thanks in advance.
- Thanks, Jae Suk.

1162
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,990
Jae Suk, we'll enjoy the food.

1163
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,700
Jae Suk, three.

1164
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,870
(The one with strawberry-phobia)

1165
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:32,010
(When his condition worsens,
he breaks out odd tunes.)

1166
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,370
(- Is he really this bad at it?
- His only flaw.)

1167
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,200
(- He could do it better off-screen.
- He's only good at hosting shows.)

1168
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,220
(His run at the strawberry game
only stirred up controversies.)

1169
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,950
(Today, you'll get to see
his true gaming ability.)

1170
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,010
The strawberry game?

1171
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,760
Just like the original version,

1172
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,010
you can attack others
by saying the name...

1173
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,350
and a number.

1174
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,030
To defend the attack,

1175
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,990
you must say
the right amount of strawberries...

1176
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,390
starting with the first beat.

1177
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,830
Unlike the original version,

1178
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,240
you must say
the number of strawberries...

1179
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,530
and fill in the rest of the beat
with claps.

1180
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,470
(One must say the right number
of strawberries first.)

1181
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,740
And then attack.

1182
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,280
- It's too difficult.
- So we can say up to eight.

1183
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,370
It's easier.

1184
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,350
Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry
-strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1185
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,450
(The two winners of the game
will choose the credit cards.)

1186
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,450
We'll choose two winners
with this game.

1187
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,450
Jae Suk, three.

1188
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,140
Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1189
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,180
(He's beginning
to feel the pressure.)

1190
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,080
Let's not do more than four.

1191
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
- It's too difficult.
- Keep it at 3 or 4.

1192
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,620
We'll start with Se Chan
who won the last game.

1193
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,760
Points will be deducted
if you get it wrong.

1194
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,060
Ready, set, go.

1195
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,640
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1196
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,490
Jae Suk, two.

1197
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,830
Strawberry-strawberry

1198
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,600
- Isn't that right?
- You were late.

1199
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,030
- It starts immediately.
- Was I late?

1200
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,280
Let's give him one free pass.

1201
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,550
Jae Suk, that's how it's done.

1202
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,050
- Strawberry-strawberry
- Strawberry-strawberry

1203
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,350
- The beat goes like so.
- That was an easy one.

1204
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,780
Consider it a practice round.

1205
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,640
- This is for real now.
- Here we go for real.

1206
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,950
I'll say "Jae Suk, two."

1207
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,390
- All right.
- And go.

1208
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,010
- I like strawberries
- It's sad that he agreed to it.

1209
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,930
Jae Suk, three.

1210
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
Strawberry

1211
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,700
(Se Chan's trick...)

1212
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,620
(has Jae Suk crumbling.)

1213
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,890
2 and 3 are practically the same.

1214
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,200
- It's the same.
- It's still the same beat.

1215
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,560
- Strawberry
- You start at the first beat.

1216
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,370
Strawberry!
Jae Suk, thanks for lunch.

1217
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,510
Strawberry-strawberry

1218
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,910
- Strawberry
- Strawberry-strawberry

1219
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,410
Just start saying strawberry
on the first beat.

1220
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,140
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1221
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,050
- Suk Jin, four.
- Strawberry

1222
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,220
Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1223
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,990
Jae Suk, two.

1224
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,390
Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1225
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,390
What?

1226
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,120
- How many was that?
- Three.

1227
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,160
That was adorable.

1228
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,950
- She said two.
- Two strawberries.

1229
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,450
Just say strawberry twice.

1230
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,990
Don't tell me you're upset now.

1231
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,700
- Unbelievable.
- There's...

1232
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,260
no confidence in his voice now.

1233
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,030
This game and I don't go together.

1234
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,430
- Doesn't it?
- This game isn't for me.

1235
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,060
- What about other games?
- Got it.

1236
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,410
I'm good at other games.

1237
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,470
After this one,
let's play a game that you want.

1238
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,970
What about apples?

1239
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,280
- What about apples?
- Yes, that one.

1240
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,450
Anyway, ready, set, go.

1241
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,180
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1242
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,220
- Jong Kook, four.
- Strawberry-strawberry

1243
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,220
Strawberry-strawberry

1244
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,810
- Jae Suk, three.
- Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1245
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,760
- Ji Hyo, two.
- Strawberry-strawberry

1246
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,950
Incorrect.

1247
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,180
Just start off at the first beat.

1248
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,120
- We managed a rally.
- Jae Suk, nice.

1249
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,300
Jae Suk's gotten
the hang of it now.

1250
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,620
- Ji Hyo, do better.
- He's gotten the hang of it.

1251
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,620
Gosh, strawberry!

1252
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,030
- Do it well, Ji Hyo.
- His lips were all purple,

1253
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,260
but they're back to pink now.

1254
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,870
- Do it well.
- He's been revived.

1255
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,530
Let's start with So Min.

1256
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,200
- I'm going to attack you, Jae Suk.
- Okay.

1257
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,280
- I'll call 4.
- 4?

1258
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,810
Strawberry-strawberry
-strawberry-strawberry

1259
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,640
I'm calling four. Ready, go.

1260
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,970
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1261
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,370
- Suk Jin, five.
- Strawberry

1262
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,640
Suk Jin, five.

1263
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,140
(Startled)

1264
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,220
(He suddenly sang a taryeong
by So Min's surprise attack.)

1265
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,950
- Don't let your guard down.
- Suk Jin.

1266
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,260
- Well done.
- You...

1267
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,100
Strawberry

1268
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,530
Don't let your guard down.

1269
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,560
- Let's start with Suk Jin.
- Okay, then.

1270
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,890
- I keep calling his name.
- I'll call So Min six.

1271
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,640
- Six? Okay.
- Let's go.

1272
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
Ready, go.

1273
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,970
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1274
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,330
Kwang Soo, six.

1275
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,580
Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry
-strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1276
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,240
- He's good.
- Haha, eight.

1277
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,180
Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry
-strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1278
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,240
Strawberry-strawberry

1279
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,410
Jae Suk, one.

1280
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,950
(He missed the first beat again.)

1281
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,990
Wow.

1282
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,890
(He was just gaping at them,)

1283
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,390
(and he missed his turn again.)

1284
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,060
- Strawberry
- I pity him now.

1285
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,350
- Just yell "strawberry" first!
- But I wasn't going to...

1286
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,600
- call him this time,
- Don't call him for a while.

1287
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,850
- but I'm used to saying his name.
- Don't call him.

1288
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,930
Let's leave him out and do a rally.

1289
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,100
- He's already done for.
- I'm used to calling him too.

1290
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,060
Let's start. Ready, go.

1291
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,370
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1292
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,970
- Suk Jin, three.
- Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1293
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,510
- Jae Suk, two.
- Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1294
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,180
- Jae Suk, two.
- Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1295
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,240
(His name was called again
only 5 seconds after the ban.)

1296
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,120
- I just...
- You said we should leave him out!

1297
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,280
- He is...
- Don't do this to him!

1298
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,120
- I mean...
- We're used to calling him!

1299
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,660
I wasn't going to call him,
but it just came out.

1300
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,410
- He's upset.
- Jae Suk is upset.

1301
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,060
- Let's not call him.
- Jae Suk is upset.

1302
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,390
- Don't call him.
- It can't be helped.

1303
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,160
He didn't say it at first,
but he went,

1304
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,450
strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1305
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,890
(He said it vaguely,
pretending to be a little late.)

1306
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:48,930
- Strawberry-strawberry
- He wanted to do well.

1307
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,200
- I can't do it.
- Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1308
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,390
- Let's play again.
- Ready, go.

1309
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,030
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1310
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,010
- Kwang Soo, two.
- Strawberry-strawberry

1311
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,080
Se Chan, four.

1312
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,330
Strawberry-strawberry
-strawberry-strawberry

1313
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,280
- Haha, four.
- Strawberry-strawberry

1314
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,310
Strawberry-strawberry

1315
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,640
- Ji Hyo, seven.
- Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1316
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,370
(She missed the beat.)

1317
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,680
- You punk.
- Jae Suk is going to treat us.

1318
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,390
- You're so mean.
- Why?

1319
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,760
It just can't be helped.

1320
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,010
- Okay, you're dead.
- Do whatever you want.

1321
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,220
I'm going to attack you now.

1322
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,660
She's going to attack
Jae Suk instead.

1323
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,560
- I think she'll attack Jae Suk.
- She'll attack Jae Suk.

1324
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,800
- Ji Hyo, calm down.
- I read her face.

1325
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,330
- Everyone attacks Jae Suk only.
- I've never seen him so down.

1326
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,700
I like strawberries

1327
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,530
- He really didn't want to play it.
- It's not easy.

1328
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,030
- You want to go home, right?
- I hate this game.

1329
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,060
- He focuses too hard.
- I really hate it.

1330
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,870
- 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.

1331
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,370
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1332
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,640
- Jong Kook, two.
- Strawberry-strawberry

1333
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,450
- Why is he so good?
- Ji Hyo, two.

1334
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,580
Strawberry-strawberry

1335
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,240
- Jae Suk, two.
- Strawberry-strawberry

1336
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:44,950
Ji Hyo, four.

1337
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,950
(He defended well,)

1338
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,580
(but he failed to attack back.)

1339
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,800
- Hey.
- Hey!

1340
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,830
(They can't continue playing
this game.)

1341
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,390
What's wrong with you?

1342
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,970
Just give up already!

1343
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,600
- I can't play this game.
- He gets really nervous.

1344
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,760
I'm just bad at it.

1345
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,800
He gets really nervous.

1346
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,200
- Is there a game you want to play?
- Sorry?

1347
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,330
- The game you want to play.
- Let's play it.

1348
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,910
What's the game you want to play?

1349
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,780
- How about Silent 007?
- Something you're good at.

1350
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,910
- Shall we?
- Or we can play Silent 3, 6, 9.

1351
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,950
Let's play Silent 006...
No, Silent 007.

1352
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,350
- "Silent 006."
- Silent 006?

1353
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,780
Will you please relax?

1354
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,220
- Let's play that game.
- Why are you so tense?

1355
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,510
- Can you give him some medicine?
- But...

1356
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,640
- Let's play Silent 007.
- But if you show your teeth...

1357
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,490
- and laugh, you lose.
- Okay, you'll be out.

1358
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,180
- Let's make a circle.
- I'm good at this game.

1359
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,390
It's better
than the strawberry game.

1360
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,950
- We're playing Silent 007.
- You need to point clearly.

1361
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,390
- You need to point clearly.
- Let's start with this.

1362
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,350
- You lose if your teeth are shown.
- This is how we start.

1363
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,890
- You can't laugh.
- You'll be out if you do.

1364
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,160
Ready, go.

1365
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,740
(0, 7, bang)

1366
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,660
(0, 0, 7, bang)

1367
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,910
(So Min keeps picking herself.)

1368
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,580
(Bang)

1369
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,310
(He did "Argh"
when he's not next to Jae Suk.)

1370
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,910
Let's not play this.
Let's do strawberry again.

1371
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,010
- I'm not good at it.
- We got him.

1372
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,550
Stop picking yourself only.

1373
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,660
- You're quite good.
- You're good.

1374
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,450
You're so annoying though.

1375
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,660
- She's good.
- Jae Suk...

1376
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,030
He's become brighter.

1377
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,080
Jae Suk...

1378
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,950
- He's finally smiling.
- He's finally smiling.

1379
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,720
Jae Suk is finally clapping.

1380
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,890
- I got this.
- He likes it.

1381
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:04,100
- I got this. This is perfect.
- Point at others clearly.

1382
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,100
- All right.
- All right.

1383
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,830
(0, 0, 7, bang)

1384
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,470
He just smiled.

1385
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,910
He showed his teeth.

1386
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,100
(Chuckling)

1387
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,010
(Fail)

1388
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,220
He showed his teeth.

1389
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,550
You're the one who suggested
the rule.

1390
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,080
Did you see him?

1391
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,510
- It was so weird.
- Why did you do that?

1392
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,120
Is he a fool or what?

1393
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,850
- He was having fun.
- He was so happy.

1394
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,060
- He was so happy.
- Hey.

1395
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,600
- What was that?
- And he laughed like a fool.

1396
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,870
- It was so fun, that's why.
- Why did you do that?

1397
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,120
- I forgot that I shouldn't smile.
- That was so funny.

1398
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,300
I'm okay as long as it's not
that strawberry game.

1399
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,370
I forgot.

1400
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,700
I'm okay as long as it's not
that strawberry game.

1401
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,470
- It was so funny.
- This is...

1402
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,240
- You look so relaxed.
- I wasn't supposed to laugh.

1403
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,430
- Of course. I'm finally relaxed.
- Why did I do that?

1404
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,140
- But he's...
- Now I'm having fun.

1405
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,370
Because the game is so old,

1406
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:51,720
- there's not much movement.
- It's not fun.

1407
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,490
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1408
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:55,850
- Right.
- Look at Jae Suk.

1409
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,120
Fine, let's play it.

1410
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,220
Let's play it.

1411
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,660
All right. Ready, go.

1412
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,350
- It's so hard.
- Shall we play the strawberry game?

1413
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,830
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

1414
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,390
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1415
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,990
Jong Kook, four.

1416
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,470
Strawberry-strawberry
-strawberry-strawberry

1417
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,030
- Jae Suk, three.
- Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1418
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,660
- Is it correct?
- It is.

1419
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,660
Jae Suk!

1420
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,600
(He did it correctly,)

1421
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,970
(but he asked if he did it right.)

1422
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,680
- You did well!
- Don't give up!

1423
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,550
- Why did he become so timid?
- You did well!

1424
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,280
- You did really well!
- It was correct.

1425
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,410
- Why did he become so small?
- I don't like this game.

1426
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,280
He thought he did it wrong.

1427
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,050
He just couldn't believe
that he did well.

1428
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,160
- Why can't you play this game?
- He was embarrassed.

1429
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,810
- Why can't you play this game?
- This isn't my game.

1430
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,160
After two beats,
call someone's name.

1431
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
Got it.

1432
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,560
Ready, go.

1433
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,200
- I like strawberries
- Wait, wait.

1434
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,430
- You're not ready?
- Ready...

1435
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,030
- Ready, go.
- Go.

1436
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,120
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1437
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,260
- There he goes again!
- Sing it loudly!

1438
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,260
- He's doing that again!
- Don't move like this.

1439
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,390
- It needs to be exciting.
- I need to focus.

1440
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,470
- Ready, go.
- He needed some time to think.

1441
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,700
- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries

1442
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,910
- Kwang Soo, seven!
- Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1443
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,470
Strawberry-strawberry
-strawberry-strawberry

1444
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,780
- Jae Suk, six.
- Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1445
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:58,140
Strawberry-strawberry-strawberry

1446
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,640
Kwang Soo, eight.

1447
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,180
- Don't get mad at him.
- "Kwang Soo..."

1448
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,780
- It's, "Kwang Soo, eight."
- This is driving me crazy.

1449
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,010
- I was going to let it slide.
- "Kwang Soo, eight."

1450
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,220
- Why can't he play it?
- Then you should've continued!

1451
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,580
- Hey!
- He is...

1452
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,890
- Why didn't you continue?
- It's not that.

1453
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,700
I was watching him,
and after he said six correctly,

1454
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,220
he wasn't sure
if he did it correctly or not.

1455
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,560
And after he said it wrong,
he looked at me sharply.

1456
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,160
- "Kwang Soo, eight."
- Hey.

1457
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,600
You should've continued.

1458
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,930
Why didn't you?

1459
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:27,010
I calculated your scores again
including the result of this game.

1460
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,100
Okay!

1461
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,450
Currently...

1462
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,580
Kwang Soo and Jong Kook
must be in first place.

1463
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,120
They must be in 1st and 2nd place.

1464
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,780
The Winners who'll pick
the members to treat lunch...

1465
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,180
are Jong Kook and So Min.

1466
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,510
- Wow.
- I'm in second place.

1467
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,080
Jong Kook and So Min will pick
two people to pay for lunch.

1468
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,990
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

1469
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,720
- All right!
- I knew you'd win!

1470
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,560
- Jong Kook, I knew you'd win!
- Jong Kook, my brother.

1471
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,430
- You're good.
- They were bound to win.

1472
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,870
- Let me take a photo with them.
- Pink suits you.

1473
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,390
- Let me take a photo.
- Pink suits you well.

1474
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:55,410
- I knew they'd win.
- I want to take a photo with you.

1475
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,160
- Shall I pick you?
- No, no.

1476
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,510
- I didn't mean that.
- I'll pick him.

1477
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,470
You should take a photo of this.

1478
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,600
- We got it. They took it already.
- No, no.

1479
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,200
- I pick you.
- Wait a minute.

1480
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,870
Jong Kook and So Min,

1481
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,180
who are
in 1st and 2nd place respectively,

1482
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,640
can pick the menu and members
you want to have lunch with.

1483
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,280
- I can pick the members too?
- Today's lunch...

1484
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,780
is fried chicken,
which everyone loves.

1485
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,930
The second option is skewers
and cup noodles that suit camping.

1486
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,600
- I want to have skewers.
- Skewers sound nice.

1487
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,830
Then I'll pick fried chicken.

1488
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,390
- Please pick the members too.
- The members I want?

1489
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,640
I'll pick the team members
I played games with.

1490
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,700
- Okay!
- Nice.

1491
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,970
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1492
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,240
- All right, I like skewers.
- You'll have skewers,

1493
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,280
and they'll have cup noodles.

1494
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,280
- Cup noodles...
- We'll prepare the skewers for you.

1495
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,550
- Okay.
- All right.

1496
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,280
Wait, what's this?

1497
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,220
It smells delicious.

1498
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,550
- Wow! Isn't this that brand?
- By the way...

1499
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:42,810
- Hey, hey!
- It's the brand...

1500
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,240
- Stay still!
- Lee Yeong Ja is advertising.

1501
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,510
- Stay still.
- Don't say it!

1502
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:47,490
- You'll be edited out anyway.
- The condition of this PPL...

1503
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,930
- is to exclude you.
- Jae Suk.

1504
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,560
- You should stay out of it.
- I love fried chicken.

1505
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,100
- This is...
- People in my neighborhood...

1506
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,700
- only talk about this brand.
- Hey, hey!

1507
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,870
- Hey. Don't say anything!
- What?

1508
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,700
Jae Suk, there's sauce too.
We have a spicy sauce.

1509
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,800
I prefer boneless fried chicken.

1510
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,810
Me too.

1511
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,910
This is the one.

1512
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,330
It's spicy, sweet, and salty
all at once.

1513
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,330
You're right.

1514
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,970
- At first, it was kind of sweet.
- Right.

1515
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,720
- Right, it's sweet.
- Right?

1516
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,470
Then I tasted saltiness,

1517
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,850
and spiciness remains in the mouth.

1518
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,240
What's this?

1519
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:18,510
It's good, right?

1520
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,010
It's spicy, sweet, and salty.

1521
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,450
It got all three flavors!

1522
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,660
(Laughing awkwardly)

1523
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,760
(PPL is the best.)

1524
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,330
That's enough, you punk.

1525
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,870
(While the PPL monster goes all out
with advertising phrases...)

1526
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:32,930
They'd be jealous of us.

1527
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,740
- I know, right?
- It looks crazy good.

1528
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,160
Can you start grilling
chicken skewers?

1529
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,600
It really feels like we're camping.

1530
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,030
How much did you spend, Suk Jin?

1531
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,470
- I...
- You spent 300 dollars, right?

1532
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,080
- He didn't spend much.
- I did spend 300 dollars.

1533
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,620
Yes, yes. I can treat you...

1534
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,950
"Yes, yes?"

1535
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,490
- "Yes, yes."
- "Yes, yes."

1536
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:49,810
- I can spend...
- "Yes, yes."

1537
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,780
- much more than that for you guys.
- Yes, yes!

1538
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,950
- Yes, yes. Yes, yes.
- But...

1539
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,990
(Making fun of him)

1540
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,260
- Please continue. Yes, yes.
- Hey.

1541
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,330
- Stop teasing him!
- Yes, yes.

1542
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,300
Suk Jin is annoyed
because of you guys.

1543
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,350
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

1544
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,220
- Shall we grill some sausages too?
- Yes.

1545
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,640
(The skewers are getting grilled
perfectly by Se Chan.)

1546
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,560
Wow, Se Chan. You're so cool!

1547
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,240
You're good at grilling meat.

1548
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,470
- I like this kind of stuff.
- Did you...

1549
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,180
run a skewer stall or something?

1550
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,370
I know.

1551
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,600
- He's so good.
- He knows how to grill them.

1552
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,700
(Fancy two-hand handling)

1553
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,450
He's got the skills.

1554
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,970
- Please sit down. They're ready.
- This place...

1555
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,050
Haha is sitting so quietly. Look.

1556
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,490
- I know.
- Right? It's so cute.

1557
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,410
- He's so cute.
- You're cute!

1558
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,280
They're all done now.

1559
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,350
- Are they cooked?
- Yes.

1560
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,560
Let's eat!

1561
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,060
Thank you for the food.

1562
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,160
Sure thing.

1563
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,700
- Look at the color. It's cooked.
- It's cooked.

1564
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,990
Wow, Suk Jin!

1565
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,260
- Is it that good?
- It's really good.

1566
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,060
- Have the skewers.
- It's good.

1567
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,870
It's so good.

1568
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,830
So Min,
it's time to pick a credit card.

1569
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,780
- Right now?
- Go ahead, So Min.

1570
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,350
- You know whom to pick, right?
- So Min.

1571
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:50,970
Don't pick anyone from here.

1572
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,850
(With a solemn face,
she promises not to pick them.)

1573
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,720
(I believe in you, So Min.)

1574
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,740
So Min.

1575
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,390
Yes, hello.

1576
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,280
It's the second payment.

1577
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,830
We calculated again.

1578
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,200
Suk Jin has two marbles?

1579
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:06,850
Yes.

1580
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,300
I will pick...

1581
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,560
(Suk Jin already spent a lot
on the camping gear.)

1582
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,870
(Whose card will So Min pick?)

1583
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:13,870
(It's Suk Jin's card again!)

1584
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,600
Suk Jin's card.

1585
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:17,640
The skewers are 80 dollars.

1586
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,680
- 80 dollars?
- Yes.

1587
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,470
- We'll take out your marble.
- Thank you.

1588
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,640
And add one to Suk Jin.

1589
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,620
- Oh, he gets more marbles?
- Yes.

1590
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,680
I'm going to go pay now.

1591
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,870
(Jong Kook has arrived
at the station to make payment.)

1592
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,450
(Stealing a glance)

1593
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,910
If I get rid of my marbles
and if Kwang Soo gets two...

1594
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,560
- They wouldn't know, right?
- No.

1595
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,930
That could work.

1596
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,330
I shouldn't make Suk Jin pay
for everything.

1597
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:39,300
I'll pick Kwang Soo's card
this time.

1598
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,620
All right.
I'll use Kwang Soo's card.

1599
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,560
I'll use it to pay for the chicken,
take your marble out,

1600
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,930
and add a marble to Kwang Soo.

1601
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,760
Now we have one more person
to get the penalty.

1602
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,030
Got it.

1603
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,010
(Current number of marbles
and people to receive the penalty)

1604
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,580
(3 people are to receive the penalty
as of now.)

1605
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,850
(Timetable)

1606
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,850
(Period 3, "Master in the House")

1607
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,240
(Unlike other days,
there's a big TV in the front.)

1608
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,910
- What's that?
- What are...

1609
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,080
- these cushions for?
- We must be playing quizzes again.

1610
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,660
What's this? "Live chat?"

1611
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,180
- What's this?
- A chat?

1612
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,560
What's this?

1613
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,060
- What's going on?
- Live streaming is starting soon.

1614
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,470
- What's this?
- No. We're live streaming.

1615
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,600
- What's this?
- We are live streaming.

1616
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,560
There are so many people
tuning in already.

1617
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,310
- 18,000 people are watching?
- We're going live on YouTube?

1618
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,870
All right. The third period...

1619
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:26,430
is "Master in the House."

1620
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,740
We've been running a survey
for three hours to ask...

1621
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:33,470
which member seems to be the best
in communicating with their fans.

1622
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,890
The viewers have been casting
their votes.

1623
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,140
- Really?
- Really?

1624
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,240
(Running Man Surprise Live Show)

1625
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,660
(2021 Running Man Surprise Survey)

1626
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:46,450
(Who do you think will be the best
at communicating with fans?)

1627
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,300
(As soon as the survey was posted,
many people participated.)

1628
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,060
- Really?
- Really?

1629
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,930
- I'm the best communicator.
- I'm good at it too.

1630
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:54,370
Depending on the result,

1631
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,160
four members with the least votes...

1632
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,140
will have a talk with Director Choi,
the variety department director.

1633
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,780
- Really?
- What did you say?

1634
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,970
- Why would we?
- Hey!

1635
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,470
- The legendary director?
- Hey.

1636
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,470
(The legendary director?)

1637
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:09,280
(The legendary master,
Director Choi Young In...)

1638
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,280
(is the final boss who announces
the Grand Award winner...)

1639
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,160
(at the year-end entertainment award
every year.)

1640
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,430
First of all,
I want to thank Director Choi.

1641
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,950
(The winners of 2019 mentioned
Director Choi the most)

1642
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,370
(Her name was
on the most searched word list.)

1643
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,660
(He's thanking Director Choi
when he's never even seen her.)

1644
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,970
(The legendary master,
Director Choi Young In)

1645
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,930
(Do you know
what I'm not happy with?)

1646
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:38,310
(The master of variety shows
is honest and straightforward!)

1647
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,850
(The members will spend
precious time with her soon.)

1648
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,350
- Why would we meet her?
- The lowest four?

1649
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,080
- Why are we doing this?
- Are you serious?

1650
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,450
Why are we doing this?

1651
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:49,990
- It must be uncomfortable.
- Is it for real?

1652
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,990
- Out of the blue?
- This is...

1653
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:52,260
- We're having a talk with her?
- It'll be uncomfortable.

1654
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,450
- Why would we talk with her?
- Please, please!

1655
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:56,530
- To help them with the vote,
- I'm a good communicator.

1656
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,870
we prepared
a surprise online fan meet,

1657
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,760
which has been requested
for a long time.

1658
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,600
- Really?
- Really?

1659
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,910
I've never done it before.

1660
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,200
There are 17,000 people
tuning in right now.

1661
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,640
Through YouTube Live,
you'll communicate with your fans...

1662
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,080
for ten minutes.

1663
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,910
The winner of the survey
will pick a card to pay.

1664
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:16,640
Four people with the least votes
will have a talk with the director.

1665
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,620
- A talk?
- Oh, my gosh.

1666
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:22,660
The four of them
will get a marble too.

1667
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,660
(The 4 members with the lowest votes
will get 1 more marble.)

1668
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,220
During the ten-minute fan meet,

1669
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,700
you can't ask them to vote for you
in any way.

1670
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,390
If you do,

1671
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,830
five percent of the votes
will be deducted in the end.

1672
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,310
I should be careful.

1673
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,780
- If you're ready, let's start.
- Sure.

1674
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,030
Okay, you can start it.

1675
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,580
It's fascinating.
I've never tried it.

1676
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,850
I've never done
live streaming before.

1677
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,080
(Nervous)

1678
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,390
You can start now.

1679
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:49,390
(The live streaming starts.)

1680
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:51,660
(It's streaming live
around the world.)

1681
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,350
- I've never done it before.
- It's not a good time slot.

1682
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:54,390
I've never done
live streaming before.

1683
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:55,390
You can start now.

1684
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,160
- It's nice to meet you. Hello!
- Has it started?

1685
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,830
- Hello!
- Hello!

1686
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,160
We didn't know about it either,

1687
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,260
but we're doing
a surprise live stream.

1688
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:08,410
Actually, it's our first time to
do live streaming together.

1689
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,640
- Right. It's our first time.
- Yes.

1690
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,830
Everyone, this is Haha.

1691
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,640
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

1692
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,550
- You can't do that.
- I'm just saying hello.

1693
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:17,510
- I'm just greeting them.
- Hello, this is Big Nose.

1694
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:19,780
- Don't you hate that nickname?
- You don't like that nickname.

1695
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,810
I like it. I'm Ji Suk Jin.

1696
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,220
Hello, everyone. I'm Yoo Jae Suk.

1697
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,810
- This is Kwang Soo.
- It's being aired now.

1698
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:28,450
Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo!

1699
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,060
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello, I'm Yang Se Chan.

1700
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,450
Wow, over 20,000 people
are watching this right now.

1701
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,930
- Sometimes, Haha does...
- There are 22,000 people now.

1702
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,970
live streaming in his bathroom
when he's drunk.

1703
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,100
- Yes, I do.
- That's right.

1704
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,560
- I love talking with my fans.
- Don't do such things.

1705
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,930
I always want to talk with my fans.

1706
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,080
- Come on. Don't lie.
- Don't lie.

1707
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,310
"Suk Jin, I voted for you.
Please give me some pocket money."

1708
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,640
I will. How should I give it to you?

1709
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,310
"Don't doze off
when Big Nose preaches."

1710
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:54,780
(Don't doze off
when Big Nose preaches.)

1711
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:56,810
- I shouldn't doze off, seriously.
- It's a trend.

1712
00:55:56,810 --> 00:56:00,060
It's okay even if you do.
What matters is that we're together.

1713
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,180
They want us to introduce ourselves.

1714
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,830
- Shall we?
- Who should we begin with?

1715
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:04,280
- Kwang Soo will start.
- Okay.

1716
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,160
- Hello, everyone!
- Make it short.

1717
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,450
- This is Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

1718
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,160
- Are you done?
- That's enough.

1719
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,160
- That's enough.
- Your turn is over.

1720
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,100
Hello, this is Se Chan.

1721
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,560
- It's nice to meet you.
- Good. Next is Ji Hyo.

1722
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,470
Hello, this is Song Ji Hyo.

1723
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,560
- Yes.
- Next, So Min.

1724
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,580
Hello, I'm Jeon So Min.

1725
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,410
Hello, I'm Kim Jong Kook!

1726
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,370
Hello, I'm the eldest member
of Running Man.

1727
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,780
- And...
- No, just say your name only.

1728
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,370
- It's too long.
- He finished his introduction.

1729
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:27,970
- I'm Ji Suk Jin.
- Just say your name.

1730
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:30,720
Hello. Thanks to you guys,
we're having...

1731
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,450
- That's enough.
- Jae Suk.

1732
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,260
You said we'll keep it short!

1733
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,560
Can't I at least thank them?

1734
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,180
- No, you can't.
- I'm Yoo Jae Suk.

1735
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,990
Hello, I'm a father of three kids
who live in Mapo-gu.

1736
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,660
- I'm Haha. Bang, bang!
- Hey, hey!

1737
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,990
- Stop that.
- Someone asked this.

1738
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,560
"Kwang Soo,
can you do the 'Rollin'' dance?"

1739
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,640
- Kang Mun Deok. Get up now.
- Kang Mun Deok asked this.

1740
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,260
- Just do it.
- Mun Deok,

1741
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,930
Kwang Soo doesn't know
the "Rollin'" dance.

1742
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,680
- I do!
- Ready, go.

1743
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,780
(He starts communicating with fans
as soon they request it.)

1744
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,370
- Rollin', rollin', rollin'
- That's the dance.

1745
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,580
Well done.

1746
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,810
They want So Min
to do the "Rollin'" dance too.

1747
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,140
- So Min, dance to "Rollin'!"
- "Rollin'."

1748
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,390
The stingray dance.

1749
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:09,030
Hey, hey!

1750
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,260
(Running Man Surprise Live Show)

1751
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,560
(What's with her hands?)

1752
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,720
- So Min!
- Hey!

1753
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,390
- So Min!
- That looks weird.

1754
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:16,660
- You surprised them.
- This just fell.

1755
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,760
So Min.

1756
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,200
- This just slipped.
- She's indeed different.

1757
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,760
- They want Ji Hyo to dance too.
- They want you to do the dance.

1758
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,760
- The "Rollin'" dance.
- They're all asking that.

1759
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,030
Do you know the dance, Ji Hyo?

1760
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,830
- Do you know?
- Ready, go.

1761
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,970
(Ji Hyo's version of "Rollin'")

1762
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,280
- Good job, good job.
- The stingray dance.

1763
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,220
- Is this how it's done?
- She knows a lot of stuff now.

1764
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,910
- She knows a lot now.
- You're good, Ji Hyo.

1765
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,140
- She knows a lot now.
- She does.

1766
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,850
- You've improved.
- She knows a lot now.

1767
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,660
You're no longer
living under a rock.

1768
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,120
The number of viewers
keeps increasing.

1769
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,490
- There are 33,000 people now.
- Thank you so much!

1770
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,600
- You've done it a lot.
- Kwang Soo.

1771
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,830
Did you go to a wedding?

1772
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:49,970
Yes, last weekend.

1773
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,870
Hey, don't go to weddings.
You'll ruin the mood.

1774
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,260
- What?
- Why would you ruin their day?

1775
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,760
- I was officially invited.
- Why would you ruin their event?

1776
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,870
Don't go ruin their day.

1777
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:59,580
They said they saw you from the back
and you were over 2m tall.

1778
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,870
- I know.
- You can't hide it.

1779
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,580
I'm not that tall.

1780
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,310
On a good day,
he looks like he's over 3m tall.

1781
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:06,580
- Come on, Jae Suk!
- That's true.

1782
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,010
- I'm not that tall.
- I mean it.

1783
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,010
Look at that.

1784
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,350
- Suk Jin.
- Yes.

1785
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:11,950
They want you to recommend
a stock item.

1786
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:12,990
They want
a stock item recommendation.

1787
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,720
I can't tell you specific items.

1788
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,720
They'll buy every item
except the one you recommend.

1789
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,760
- Everything except that.
- Oh, except that?

1790
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,200
They're so funny.

1791
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,660
Many of my friends asked that too.

1792
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,890
They asked why Suk Jin
is so bad at investing.

1793
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,530
- I can't...
- Somebody asked this.

1794
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:28,160
- "Se Chan."
- "What's orange in English?"

1795
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,760
- "What's orange in English?"
- You guys are so harsh.

1796
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,180
- He's not that ignorant.
- I'm not.

1797
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,280
What is it then?

1798
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,370
- Tell us the spelling.
- You have to answer them.

1799
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,740
- Answer them.
- Do you want to write it down?

1800
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,010
- Try it.
- Darn it.

1801
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,950
- Darn it. Seriously?
- Yang Se Chan.

1802
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,720
You can do it, Se Chan!

1803
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,810
- Okay, okay!
- Just continue on.

1804
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:47,220
I need three minutes.

1805
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,890
- Hey.
- You need three minutes?

1806
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,990
- Kwang Soo.
- Make that happy yet sad face.

1807
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:52,330
They want you to make that face.

1808
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,850
- Later. He can't do it right away.
- It's been a while.

1809
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,930
Make three faces. Happy face,
sad face, happy yet sad face.

1810
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:59,970
- Okay. Happy face.
- Happy face.

1811
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,600
- Sad face.
- Sad face.

1812
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,060
- Happy yet sad face.
- Happy yet sad face.

1813
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,930
(Happy yet sad)

1814
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:07,640
(He gets happier every time
he makes that face.)

1815
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,680
(I'm scared that he might
appear in my dream.)

1816
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,680
(He's an actor and a comedian.)

1817
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:13,140
Now, we only have a minute left.

1818
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,680
(1 minute
before the live streaming ends)

1819
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,550
(With their active communication,
the results keep changing.)

1820
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,660
One minute left!

1821
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,160
- I'd like to...
- Look at all those hearts.

1822
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,660
thank all of you.

1823
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,890
I'm sad that there's only 1 minute.
I want to do it for an hour.

1824
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:25,930
- Right.
- So...

1825
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,390
I want to do it separately later.

1826
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,760
- Yes, please do that.
- Guys.

1827
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,030
Let's wrap it up and say goodbye.
Kwang Soo, go first.

1828
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:33,100
- Let's say goodbye.
- Shall we say bye one by one?

1829
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,030
- Everyone!
- That's enough!

1830
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,410
- We don't have much time.
- You're making it too long.

1831
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,410
Haha, go first.

1832
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:39,470
Everyone. Nothing else matters.

1833
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:42,180
Just stay healthy.
I'll work even harder.

1834
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:44,080
- Guys.
- Yes, please do that.

1835
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,580
Guys, thank you!

1836
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,580
(Guys, thank you!)

1837
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,370
- Why would you say it so casually?
- Why are you so informal?

1838
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:50,390
- Suk Jin!
- Guys, thanks.

1839
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,390
I love you guys.
That's how it's usually done.

1840
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,890
- What's wrong with you?
- My mom is watching it too.

1841
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,930
Don't you know?
This is how you communicate.

1842
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,620
- Who communicates like that?
- You can't be rude though.

1843
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,200
- That's so rude of you.
- I love you guys.

1844
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,530
- You can't say it like that.
- Don't be so rude.

1845
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:02,620
- I know.
- You need to use honorifics.

1846
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,660
- We're being polite to each other.
- You need to use honorifics.

1847
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,890
- That's how it's done.
- No. You should be polite.

1848
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:09,200
We're courteous people.
You can't be rude.

1849
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,530
- Guys.
- Why would you call them rudely?

1850
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:11,640
- Why would you do that?
- This is...

1851
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,510
- Apologize to them now!
- They hate rude people.

1852
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,370
- Why would you be condescending?
- Right. Don't do that.

1853
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:17,950
- We're so sorry.
- I was really surprised.

1854
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:19,010
- We're so sorry.
- Wait.

1855
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:20,220
- And thank you.
- We're so sorry.

1856
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,950
I hope what Suk Jin said
doesn't cause controversy.

1857
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,640
- I know.
- That's not it. You usually...

1858
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,160
- We're sorry.
- We're so sorry.

1859
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,120
- We apologize.
- Suk Jin was being ignorant.

1860
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,850
- On my YouTube channel...
- Just stay healthy!

1861
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:31,560
- We're not rude like him.
- We're so sorry.

1862
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,350
- He's the only one who's rude.
- Right.

1863
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:34,760
- So Min.
- Right.

1864
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,120
I want to say that I have nothing
to do with Suk Jin.

1865
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,830
- That's not what I meant.
- Ji Hyo, you're next.

1866
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:42,310
I apologize on behalf of Suk Jin.

1867
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,660
- Everyone is apologizing.
- Please keep supporting our show!

1868
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,410
- Yes!
- See you next time!

1869
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,100
(It's my turn now!)

1870
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,470
(What about me?)

1871
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:54,580
Stay... Stay healthy!

1872
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:55,720
What? It ended?

1873
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,740
- It ended.
- We said goodbye already.

1874
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,890
Why didn't you say goodbye faster?

1875
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:01,560
- But I should've said goodbye.
- You should've joined in fast.

1876
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,350
I said the closing comment.
I said, "Keep supporting our show."

1877
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,890
- It's over.
- It's time to reveal the result.

1878
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,200
The poll is now closed.

1879
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,890
- Please.
- I don't want a meeting.

1880
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,560
It will be funny...

1881
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,330
if Suk Jin has a meeting
with Ms. Choi.

1882
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,060
I would feel uncomfortable.

1883
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,030
The members who have
a private YouTube channel...

1884
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:18,510
- would have an advantage.
- You are right.

1885
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:19,930
- That's right.
- They have the image...

1886
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:21,410
- of being good at communicating.
- Seriously.

1887
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,810
Having a private YouTube channel
should help.

1888
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,910
Please. I mean,
I like Ms. Choi very much,

1889
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:26,950
I would feel uncomfortable.

1890
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:28,580
- You would be alone too.
- I am not close to her.

1891
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,350
If Ms. Choi canes your calves,

1892
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,450
would you take it?

1893
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,910
Punishment is necessary at times.

1894
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,660
- If that solves the problem,
- Punishment is necessary at times.

1895
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,720
I would feel at ease.

1896
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,100
If I must have a meeting
with Ms. Choi...

1897
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,120
for ten minutes...

1898
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,030
Ten minutes is a long time, right?
You wouldn't have anything to say.

1899
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:45,470
It would be hard to spend
ten minutes with Ms. Choi.

1900
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,430
The results are in.

1901
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:49,640
Please.

1902
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,810
- Please.
- As long as I am not included...

1903
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:53,530
I am good at communicating
with the fans.

1904
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:54,830
- I would get chosen.
- You and I...

1905
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:56,180
- All right.
- Seriously.

1906
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,470
First place.

1907
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:58,780
(90,000 votes came in
over the course of 4 hours.)

1908
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,120
Just stay healthy.

1909
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,390
(To receive more votes,)

1910
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:04,510
(they acted cute
during the live broadcast.)

1911
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:08,220
(Whom did the fans choose?)

1912
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,660
- I bet it's Haha.
- No.

1913
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,830
- It isn't me.
- Haha.

1914
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,260
This member received
about 23,000 votes.

1915
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,260
- 23,000 votes?
- No way.

1916
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,350
That's 26 percent of the votes.

1917
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,030
- A lot of people voted.
- It could be Jae Suk.

1918
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,330
I am the king of communication.

1919
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:18,370
(There are a few masters
of communication...)

1920
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:19,530
I am good at communicating.

1921
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,800
(who made an effort
through YouTube, social media, etc.)

1922
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,760
(Is the first place among them?)

1923
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,330
- The first place.
- Haha.

1924
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,870
The member who seems to be the best
at communicating with the fans is...

1925
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,100
It must be Jae Suk.

1926
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,910
Ji Hyo.

1927
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,120
- What?
- What?

1928
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,620
- What?
- What is this?

1929
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,910
- What is this?
- This is ridiculous.

1930
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,640
- Is this a popularity vote?
- This makes no sense.

1931
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,580
- This is a popularity vote.
- Seriously.

1932
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,010
- She doesn't do anything.
- This is ridiculous.

1933
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,390
That means
you don't need to have a meeting.

1934
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:43,990
She doesn't do anything
to communicate with the fans.

1935
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:46,120
- You don't need to have a meeting.
- This makes no sense.

1936
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,350
This makes no sense.

1937
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:49,060
Even Ji Hyo is surprised.

1938
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,120
- She is surprised.
- You are surprised, right?

1939
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,800
She is confused.

1940
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,830
The second place.

1941
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,560
This member received
23 percent of the votes.

1942
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:57,100
- Please.
- It's important...

1943
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,680
- to be included in the top 4.
- The 2nd place.

1944
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,740
- The top 4.
- The top 4.

1945
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,470
This member received
23 percent of the votes.

1946
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,780
You need to be included
in the top four.

1947
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:05,810
- Jae Suk.
- Okay.

1948
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:08,370
- The result is strange.
- This is a popularity vote.

1949
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:09,910
- This is a popularity vote.
- Seriously.

1950
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,240
- I did it.
- This is wrong.

1951
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,450
- I did it.
- Listen, Bo Pil.

1952
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:15,890
Aren't four members too many?

1953
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:17,780
- Suk Jin.
- Four members are too many.

1954
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:19,030
She said four members isn't enough.

1955
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,600
- Really?
- Ms. Choi said that.

1956
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,600
- The third place.
- It's too bad.

1957
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,830
This member received
15.8 percent of the votes.

1958
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,800
- This should be me.
- This is a popularity vote.

1959
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,760
- This should be me. Suk Jin.
- Kwang Soo?

1960
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,330
- Jong Kook.
- Thank goodness.

1961
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:32,580
- This is a popularity vote.
- What is this?

1962
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,870
Thank goodness. I communicate a lot.

1963
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,870
It'll be so uncomfortable
if Haha, Suk Jin,

1964
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:36,740
- So Min, and I have to go.
- Only one slot remains.

1965
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,950
- Right?
- The ones who are active...

1966
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,720
- on social media got left out.
- Seriously.

1967
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,280
- I'm active on social media.
- Me too.

1968
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,120
I'm on YouTube, Instagram,
and everything.

1969
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,080
Come to think of it,

1970
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,810
Haha and Suk Jin...

1971
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,120
I communicate
as if my life depends on it.

1972
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,280
My job is a YouTuber.

1973
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,220
- I post one video per week.
- He even does it in the restroom.

1974
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,620
He even communicates
with the fans...

1975
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,200
- in the restroom.
- I use TikTok too.

1976
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,260
Why didn't Suk Jin get included?

1977
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,160
I communicate so much.

1978
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,970
The last place has...

1979
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:05,160
- a little over 2,700 votes.
- Is it me?

1980
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,010
There is a difference of 10 votes
between the 7th and 8th places.

1981
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,080
(There is a difference of 10 votes
between the 7th and 8th places!)

1982
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,100
They received
3.2 percent of the votes.

1983
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,240
(The two bottom members)

1984
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,410
Suk Jin and Se Chan.

1985
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,490
This is a popularity vote.

1986
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,120
Is there a difference of ten votes?

1987
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,220
Who is in the last place,
Suk Jin or me?

1988
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:22,350
With 2,765 votes,
Suk Jin is the last place.

1989
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,430
With 2,783 votes,
Se Chan is the 7th place.

1990
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,660
Listen.

1991
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,390
- He is the king of communication.
- These days,

1992
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:30,490
- Suk Jin...
- He does it all the time.

1993
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:31,660
- I know.
- Seriously.

1994
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:32,890
He is the king of communication.

1995
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:33,930
- You know,
- He mostly...

1996
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,240
he gave up his daily life
for communication.

1997
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,240
He mostly lives
on social media platforms.

1998
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,600
Ji Communication.

1999
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,740
He spends more time there
than in reality.

2000
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:44,410
He spends
most of his hours communicating.

2001
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:45,910
I feel so victimized...

2002
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,640
because I use
all existing social media platforms.

2003
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:51,680
YouTube, Instagram,

2004
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,010
- TikTok... I joined Clubhouse.
- All right now.

2005
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:56,830
- Suk Jin is almost a cyber person.
- A cyber person.

2006
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:58,260
(The 21st century has Big Nose,
the king of communication.)

2007
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,990
I hoped I would be the fourth place.

2008
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,330
Now, I will announce
the fourth place.

2009
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,870
It's either Kwang Soo or Haha.

2010
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,720
- Is it So Min?
- It will be either So Min,

2011
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,200
- Kwang Soo, or Haha.
- Please.

2012
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,870
- It can't be me.
- This person won't have a meeting.

2013
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,030
The fourth place...

2014
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:10,600
unfortunately won't have a meeting.

2015
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,100
It's truly unfortunate.

2016
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,330
This person won't get encouragement.

2017
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,700
The fourth place received...

2018
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,740
- 11.3 percent of the votes.
- All right.

2019
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:17,810
It must be Kwang Soo.

2020
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,280
Kwang Soo.

2021
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,390
How disappointing!

2022
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,450
(Screaming)

2023
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:37,660
How disappointing!

2024
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,550
- I will tell Ms. Choi.
- I am disappointed.

2025
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,660
- I am so annoyed.
- So Min is the fifth place...

2026
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,140
and Haha is the sixth place.

2027
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,740
- You know,
- Are you the sixth place?

2028
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,510
I find it so funny...

2029
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:50,140
that Ms. Choi and So Min
will have...

2030
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:52,110
- a talk.
- I don't have anything...

2031
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,110
to say.

2032
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:54,200
I don't know that person.

2033
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,640
- I don't have anything to say.
- Seriously.

2034
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:56,950
"That person."

2035
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:57,970
Se Chan.

2036
01:05:57,970 --> 01:05:59,780
- Se Chan.
- Let's do this.

2037
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,640
I don't know that person.

2038
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,390
I feel like...

2039
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:05,680
- I will get scolded.
- Think of her as a teacher.

2040
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,950
Just say that you are sorry.

2041
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:09,550
The masters of communication
got left behind.

2042
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,050
- Ms. Choi...
- Put this on the table...

2043
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,300
and have a meeting
until the sand runs out.

2044
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,370
Just how much
do people want me to communicate?

2045
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:15,530
It's so funny.

2046
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:17,070
- Communication...
- Here are...

2047
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,700
a rose and a Swiss roll.

2048
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,430
I can't believe...

2049
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:22,070
- Suk Jin and Haha...
- Right now...

2050
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:23,740
got left behind.

2051
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,280
The four members will move first.

2052
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,780
The first place will pay...

2053
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,970
and move to the next location.

2054
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:31,140
- Ji Hyo is the first place, right?
- Yes.

2055
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,510
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo will pick...

2056
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:33,950
- the card.
- You get to pay.

2057
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:35,490
- Ji Hyo.
- The king of communication.

2058
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,390
- It's so funny.
- Ji Hyo, the king of communication?

2059
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:40,320
It's so funny
that Ji Hyo placed first.

2060
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,930
- You are the king of communication.
- I think...

2061
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:43,930
the fans misunderstood
and chose the member...

2062
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:45,320
who doesn't communicate.

2063
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:47,530
I won't communicate anymore!

2064
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,720
Let's go.

2065
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,990
- I will communicate.
- I will work hard.

2066
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,640
I will work hard.

2067
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,700
You let me know that I am lacking.

2068
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,740
(The bottom four go
to Ms. Choi's office.)

2069
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,640
- Let's hurry up.
- I feel so uncomfortable.

2070
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,340
I feel like I'm suffocating already.

2071
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,280
Well, it has been a while...

2072
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,470
since I said hello to Ms. Choi.

2073
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:04,620
This is a good opportunity.

2074
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,340
I have never had
a proper conversation with her.

2075
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,720
I don't know her well.

2076
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,450
- Ms. Choi?
- Yes.

2077
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,220
Even if you don't know her well,
you will be intimidated.

2078
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:17,360
(She is excited to see the members
for the first time in a long while.)

2079
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:20,760
Which shows did she work on?

2080
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,070
"Truth Game."

2081
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,390
- "Truth Game?"
- She made that show.

2082
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:26,760
- She also made "Ya Shim Man Man."
- "Ya Shim Man Man."

2083
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,010
- Really?
- "Ya Shim Man Man?"

2084
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,140
- She made a lot of hit shows.
- She is cool.

2085
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,430
- Is this the office?
- You should go in first.

2086
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:34,140
Okay. Me will go in first.

2087
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,470
- "Me."
- "Me."

2088
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:36,800
- "Me."
- He is nervous.

2089
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:38,140
- Is this the office?
- Go ahead.

2090
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,240
Go ahead.

2091
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,280
- Go on in.
- Hello.

2092
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:45,090
(Director of variety shows at SBS,
Choi Young In)

2093
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:46,280
Ms. Choi.

2094
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:47,860
- You know...
- Come on in.

2095
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,860
(He enters the office
with a rotten smile.)

2096
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,990
Hurry over.

2097
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:50,990
Come on.

2098
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:52,260
They are ridiculous.

2099
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:54,120
What are you doing?

2100
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,220
(What are you doing?)

2101
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,570
- Come on in.
- Come on.

2102
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,990
She wants you guys to come on in.

2103
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,260
- Hello.
- Hello.

2104
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,370
- Hello.
- You know,

2105
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,300
I should have visited sooner.

2106
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,800
It has been a while.

2107
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,910
We are the kings of communication.

2108
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:09,510
- Give her the flower.
- Thank you.

2109
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:10,640
Have you been well?

2110
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,510
- It's a Swiss roll.
- You shouldn't have.

2111
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:13,550
It's nothing.

2112
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:14,740
- You know,
- It's nice to meet you.

2113
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,840
- this is upsetting.
- Okay.

2114
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,550
While we are very happy
to receive...

2115
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:23,930
a chance to talk with you,

2116
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,860
it makes no sense...

2117
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:27,700
- that we are the bottom four.
- It makes no sense.

2118
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,620
Do you know what I'm not happy with?

2119
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:31,430
(Do you know what annoys me?)

2120
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:34,140
(What?)

2121
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,740
I don't know...

2122
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,330
why a talk with me is a penalty.

2123
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:38,430
- No, no.
- It's not a penalty.

2124
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:40,040
It's not a penalty,

2125
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,250
but the rest of the members
cheered loudly.

2126
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,540
- They were overjoyed.
- Seriously.

2127
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:43,970
- That's upsetting.
- Of course.

2128
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:45,340
Why would they do that?

2129
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,580
- We have no complaint.
- We are so happy.

2130
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,210
And thank you for the text, sister.

2131
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:49,580
Back then...

2132
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:51,580
Don't pretend to be close to her.

2133
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,860
Don't call her "Sister..."

2134
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,120
- for no reason.
- She is warmhearted.

2135
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,530
- She is totally warmhearted.
- Hey.

2136
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:57,590
Do you know why she is popular?
She is easygoing.

2137
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,090
- He is right.
- She is easygoing.

2138
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:00,830
- She is the best.
- Don't call her "Sister."

2139
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:03,500
Thanks for sending me a fruit basket
while I was in the hospital.

2140
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,630
- Really?
- Thank you.

2141
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,570
It's not a good deed or anything.

2142
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:07,710
- Really?
- Every holiday...

2143
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,130
- Every holiday, you send us food.
- I enjoyed the grapes.

2144
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,000
Both the dried laver and grapes
were really tasty.

2145
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,830
Her comments touched me
more than the gifts.

2146
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,080
I really appreciated the text...

2147
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,300
- because I was struggling.
- What did she write?

2148
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,040
- I was in a slump back then.
- Are the two of you that close?

2149
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,970
- She sent me a long text.
- Really?

2150
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:22,840
- It gave me so much energy.
- I still remember...

2151
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:26,750
how you got me a T-shirt
when you went on a trip to Europe.

2152
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,330
- Do you remember that?
- Wasn't that years ago?

2153
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,960
- 15 years ago.
- Ms. Choi, we want to know...

2154
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,130
why Suk Jin got pulled out
of "Same Life, Unlike Dreams."

2155
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,760
- Please explain.
- That's right. He got pulled out.

2156
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,090
Hold on.

2157
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:40,590
(No one remembers, but Suk Jin was
in "Same Life, Unlike Dreams 1.")

2158
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,610
(But he disappeared after 1 episode.
What happened?)

2159
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:45,630
Why did you bring that up?

2160
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:47,240
- We want to know.
- So...

2161
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,970
Why did he get pulled out?
He wanted to quit!

2162
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:51,040
- Really?
- I mean...

2163
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,710
I even went to his house
three times...

2164
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:56,620
so that he would reconsider.
I went to Siksa-dong, Ilsan.

2165
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:57,790
You did?

2166
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:59,160
Well,

2167
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,820
what happened is in the past.

2168
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:03,580
Ms. Choi understands.
It's all in the past.

2169
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,660
You must be embarrassed.

2170
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,250
- I have a lot to say about it.
- I am sorry.

2171
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:10,130
They only know about it
because Jae Suk brought it up.

2172
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:12,240
He turned down my offer.

2173
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:14,610
I told you that I was sorry.

2174
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:17,670
When I get married...

2175
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:18,830
Star in the show.

2176
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:20,930
(So Min prematurely promises
to star in a couple's show.)

2177
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,640
I thought about starring in the show
with Se Chan.

2178
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,670
- Really?
- It's a good idea.

2179
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:25,620
- What?
- We can do that if we get married.

2180
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,540
- The two of you?
- It might happen someday.

2181
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,840
- It might.
- Hey.

2182
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:31,290
Don't be ridiculous.
You startled me.

2183
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:32,750
Doesn't he look happy?

2184
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:33,750
(Teasing)

2185
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,630
He is smiling from ear to ear.

2186
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:37,530
- Don't play with love.
- We could make so much money.

2187
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:39,220
- If we make a contract...
- We could make so much money.

2188
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:42,590
- Don't be that way.
- You should be sincere.

2189
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:46,240
Please tell us what you think
about Running Man these days.

2190
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,540
- It's really fun these days.
- Right?

2191
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,330
- Suk Jin is on fire these days.
- Yes.

2192
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,040
It's impressive that such an old man
is on Running Man.

2193
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,210
Seriously.

2194
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,450
(An old man)

2195
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,300
He wants to have
his 60th birthday party on the show.

2196
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,620
- He must have it.
- I have that thought every time.

2197
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:01,420
Please talk about people
who are upstairs.

2198
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:04,120
(Thinking)

2199
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,510
There are members
you dislike, right?

2200
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:07,290
Jae Suk or Jong Kook.

2201
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,530
That's right.

2202
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,860
Well, both of them work too hard.

2203
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:14,630
- It's excessive.
- They need to take a breather.

2204
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:15,790
They are too much.

2205
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:17,790
- The production crew struggles.
- They are too much.

2206
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,460
Sometimes, we struggle.

2207
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:22,740
When the shoot resumes
after a break,

2208
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:25,800
you could relax and show up
2 or 3 minutes late.

2209
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,540
- That's right.
- Jae Suk always acts up...

2210
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,750
by getting there ahead of time.

2211
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,610
That's not right.

2212
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:31,780
Combine the 2 or 3 minutes.

2213
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,420
If 60 staff members
lose 2 or 3 minutes...

2214
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,640
Multiply 60 by 2 minutes.
That's 120 minutes.

2215
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,920
You should be right on time.

2216
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,860
Suk Jin is out. Suk Jin is out.

2217
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,330
- Out.
- He is out.

2218
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:44,030
Suk Jin is out.

2219
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:45,330
("Suk Jin is out" sounds strange
at the director's office.)

2220
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:47,890
I like that Ms. Choi is honest.

2221
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:49,670
- She is honest.
- She doesn't mince her words.

2222
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:51,070
I like that she is easygoing.

2223
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:53,200
Why did you bring these?

2224
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,540
It's because we love you so much.

2225
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:57,000
There he goes again.
There he goes again.

2226
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,930
- You are such a suck-up.
- Stop it already.

2227
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:03,500
- Stop it already.
- You are my woman

2228
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,950
He is disgusting.

2229
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:06,010
Is this how you live?

2230
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:08,380
- I like it when he does that.
- Right?

2231
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,990
You know,

2232
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:13,210
- she practically raised us...
- That's right.

2233
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:15,990
- ever since we were rookies.
- Yes.

2234
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,030
I have a final favor to ask.

2235
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:20,890
- What is it?
- Would you do it?

2236
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:21,960
(Serious)

2237
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:24,370
Sister, just stay healthy.

2238
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:26,370
(Sister, just stay healthy.)

2239
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:29,000
(She gets knocked out.)

2240
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,430
- Okay?
- Let's go.

2241
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,330
This won't do. For goodness' sake.

2242
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:33,610
Thank you so much.

2243
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,640
- Please stay healthy.
- She likes that.

2244
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,320
- Bye.
- He told me to stay healthy.

2245
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,780
- Bye.
- Be happy.

2246
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,320
- Thank you.
- We had a great time.

2247
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,450
- Bye.
- Bye.

2248
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:43,840
- Work hard.
- Okay.

2249
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,920
- Bye.
- May I drop by sometime?

2250
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,290
Drop by anytime.

2251
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:50,860
- Okay.
- "May I drop by sometime?"

2252
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,890
(They conclude the meeting well
with their obsequiousness.)

2253
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:53,830
- I should drop by.
- We had a great time.

2254
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:55,890
- Bye.
- All right.

2255
01:12:57,890 --> 01:13:00,040
(The 4 kings of communication
arrive to make a payment.)

2256
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,630
Ji Hyo, go in first.

2257
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:03,670
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo?

2258
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,280
- All right.
- Thank you.

2259
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,970
- We are a team.
- All right, Ji Hyo.

2260
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:08,340
- Okay.
- We are in a good mood.

2261
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,610
- That's right.
- That's right.

2262
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:11,140
This is the current situation.

2263
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:15,040
(The current number of marbles
is revealed first.)

2264
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:18,290
Everyone has one or more
except for Jong Kook.

2265
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:21,250
Jong Kook has a gold card.

2266
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:24,700
It stands out.

2267
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,530
(Jong Kook's gold card stands out.)

2268
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:29,500
I think I should give him a marble.

2269
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:32,240
- Here you go.
- I will pay with this card.

2270
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,330
(Jong Kook is chosen.)

2271
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,460
I chose your card
because your slot was empty.

2272
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,430
It looked too lonely.

2273
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:40,500
- It looked too lonely.
- All right.

2274
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,500
All right.

2275
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:45,120
(Ji Hyo loses a marble
and Jong Kook gains a marble.)

2276
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,380
Now comes the last schedule.

2277
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:48,620
- All right!
- He did it.

2278
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,680
("Flaming Youth")

2279
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,990
We are the last winners.

2280
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:52,180
I won thanks to you.

2281
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,660
- That's right, you punk.
- Let's go.

2282
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,530
- You and I have good teamwork.
- That's right.

2283
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:58,200
I didn't get to choose a card once.

2284
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,390
Me neither.

2285
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,790
So Min is done for.

2286
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,590
What? Why do I have a marble?

2287
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:05,540
Hold on. Ji Hyo.

2288
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,570
(He spots the marble
Ji Hyo gave him.)

2289
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:07,590
My goodness.

2290
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:09,830
Ji Hyo paid with my card.

2291
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:11,500
I was the last one before her.

2292
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,780
It would be best
to give a marble to Ji Hyo.

2293
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,250
- That's right.
- I need to remove mine.

2294
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,670
- You need to remove yours too.
- That's right.

2295
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,170
- All right.
- What are we going to do?

2296
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:20,170
(But only one of them
can take out a marble.)

2297
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,580
Se Chan has a marble too.

2298
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,210
In that case...

2299
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,620
(Whoever removes a marble
will be exempt from the penalty.)

2300
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,920
- This put us in a tight spot.
- Seriously.

2301
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,660
Things suddenly became awkward
between us.

2302
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,160
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2303
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,160
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2304
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,330
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

2305
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:35,830
- I am sorry.
- It's okay.

2306
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:37,700
(He is sad
that he didn't use force.)

2307
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,370
Okay. All right.

2308
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:40,630
Whom will you choose?

2309
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,000
- Ji Hyo.
- Choose Ji Hyo.

2310
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,740
I will make the payment
with Ji Hyo's card.

2311
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:46,740
Okay.

2312
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,380
We need to increase the chances.

2313
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

2314
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,970
I will make the payment.

2315
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:52,280
How many people will get
the penalty?

2316
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,250
- Five people.
- For goodness' sake.

2317
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:58,990
(The final number of marbles)

2318
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:01,660
I didn't get to choose the card
even once.

2319
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,720
You don't have many marbles.

2320
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,750
- Really?
- How about me?

2321
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:06,830
- Who has the most number of them?
- One member has a lot.

2322
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:09,530
But too many people
will receive the penalty.

2323
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:10,830
- 5 people.
- 5 people.

2324
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:13,170
- 5 people?
- Only 3 people will be spared.

2325
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:16,210
We will count the repeating marbles,
so it could be less than five.

2326
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:18,080
It's bad
if your marbles go in, right?

2327
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,210
The last ones to arrive
will determine who gets the penalty.

2328
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:21,840
- So they need to go in.
- Yes.

2329
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,670
They need to go in quickly.

2330
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:26,820
All right.
Here's what the penalty will be.

2331
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,540
This is the penalty.

2332
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,790
Put on a prisoner's wig
and a pillory...

2333
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:34,360
and stay at the TV station's lobby
for five minutes...

2334
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,630
to look back upon yourself.

2335
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:37,860
- It isn't too bad.
- It isn't too bad.

2336
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:40,220
However, the cameras will be hidden.

2337
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,670
You will be alone.

2338
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:42,790
- Alone?
- Yes.

2339
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,460
That would be a bit embarrassing.
There should be a camera crew.

2340
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,460
- How about the cameras?
- We need the cameras.

2341
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,070
- Give us the cameras.
- Just one camera.

2342
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:49,300
- Give us the cameras.
- Lend us one.

2343
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,300
A camera stand.

2344
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,670
We will film from afar.

2345
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:52,830
For five minutes?

2346
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:54,240
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2347
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,540
(Who will receive the penalty?)

2348
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,080
- Didn't we do this before?
- The track became longer, right?

2349
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,540
It became longer, right?

2350
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:02,340
The owner of the last five marbles
will receive the penalty.

2351
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,790
- This is driving me crazy.
- Please, please.

2352
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,860
Is Se Chan exempt?

2353
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:07,180
I am exempt.

2354
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,990
- Hold on.
- Mix them up at random.

2355
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,360
Let's mix them up.

2356
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,030
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2357
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,750
- Please, please.
- Come on.

2358
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:16,530
(The owners of the last 5 marbles
will receive the penalty!)

2359
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,460
- One...
- Come on, blue marbles.

2360
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:20,430
Let's go. Please, please.

2361
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:23,260
- I won the last time.
- This is fun.

2362
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,040
- Here we go!
- Let's go.

2363
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,000
Let's go. Please, please.

2364
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,450
(Suk Jin, Kwang Soo, Haha,)

2365
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:29,910
(Jae Suk, Ji Hyo,
So Min, Jong Kook)

2366
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:30,910
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2367
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:32,010
Go!

2368
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:33,470
- Let's go!
- What is that?

2369
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,290
- Come on.
- Let's go, yellow!

2370
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,320
What is that?

2371
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,790
- Come on.
- Let's go, yellow!

2372
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:38,920
- Please, please.
- Let's go.

2373
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,420
- Here we go!
- Let's go.

2374
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:41,630
Go!

2375
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,050
- Let's go!
- What is that?

2376
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,290
- Come on.
- Let's go, yellow!

2377
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,700
There go my four marbles.

2378
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,220
- There they go.
- Come on.

2379
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,830
- Let's go.
- There they go.

2380
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:52,890
(The owners of the last 5 marbles
become disheartened.)

2381
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:55,110
(You are doing great,
light green marble.)

2382
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:56,460
- The yellow one.
- No way.

2383
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,540
- Come on.
- Please.

2384
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:58,970
- The blue ones are fast.
- The blue ones are fast.

2385
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:00,170
- The blue ones are fast.
- Let's go.

2386
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,470
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, yellow marble!

2387
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:03,750
(Currently,)

2388
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,210
(the last 5 marbles belong to
Suk Jin, Haha, and So Min.)

2389
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:08,840
(Kwang Soo's yellow marble is
6th from the last.)

2390
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,250
(Suk Jin, So Min,
Haha, Haha, Suk Jin)

2391
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,710
- The green one.
- Let's keep going this way.

2392
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:17,220
- The green one. Turn the tables!
- I made it!

2393
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,290
Yellow marbles!

2394
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:20,000
(The last struggle)

2395
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,250
- Turn the tables!
- Yellow marbles!

2396
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,760
(In the end,)

2397
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,040
(who will receive...)

2398
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,540
(the penalty?)

2399
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,540
The fourth place.

2400
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:32,170
Okay.

2401
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,280
To whom
do the last five marbles belong?

2402
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,340
Red, yellow, blue, white, blue.

2403
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,640
(Who are the owners?)

2404
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,470
- Who are the owners?
- Suk Jin.

2405
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:40,710
- Two blue marbles.
- So Min.

2406
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,080
Haha.

2407
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:43,750
Who owns the yellow marble?

2408
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:44,860
- Yellow.
- Me.

2409
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:51,890
Haha, Suk Jin, So Min,
and Kwang Soo will get the penalty.

2410
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:52,920
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, and Jae Suk
got spared again.)

2411
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,200
- Thank goodness.
- Lucky.

2412
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,670
This is really fun.

2413
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,370
Would you spare one of us?

2414
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:58,700
- Among us.
- Spare one of us.

2415
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,740
- Spare 1.
- Spare 1.

2416
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:02,300
This game is fun.

2417
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,040
- Just 1. Okay, okay.
- The 4 of us will play.

2418
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,040
- This is the real deal.
- It's so much fun.

2419
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,330
- It's so much fun.
- I know.

2420
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:09,000
This game is so much fun.

2421
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,420
(Only 1 of them will be spared.)

2422
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:13,920
Only the first one will be spared.

2423
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,140
(So Min, Suk Jin, Kwang Soo, Haha)

2424
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:17,710
This is the real deal.

2425
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:20,050
The person whose marble
arrives first will be spared.

2426
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:21,360
- Please, please.
- One,

2427
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,630
- two,
- 25 percent chance.

2428
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:24,680
(Suk Jin, Haha, So Min, Kwang Soo)

2429
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,720
(So Min, Suk Jin, Kwang Soo, Haha)

2430
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,700
- 3.
- Only the 1st place.

2431
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,130
- You don't know yet.
- Red.

2432
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:30,390
Why is mine so slow?

2433
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:31,670
Run white marble, run.

2434
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:32,960
- Gosh, mine is last.
- Red.

2435
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,240
- It's the last chance.
- It might bounce off.

2436
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,930
- I have a bad feeling.
- Here they go.

2437
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,410
This is good.

2438
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:39,500
Here they go.

2439
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,640
What is wrong
with the yellow marble?

2440
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:42,750
(The yellow marble has no hope.)

2441
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:45,250
- It's so slow.
- What is it doing?

2442
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,620
(So Min's red marble is leading.)

2443
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,080
Gosh, there is no twist.

2444
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,120
- Come on.
- What?

2445
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,320
(You don't know what will happen
until the very end.)

2446
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,330
(Who will be spared
from the penalty?)

2447
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,490
What?

2448
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:59,500
(Haha, Suk Jin, So Min)

2449
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,660
It's red.

2450
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,590
(So Min wins 1st place.)

2451
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,000
(They just helped So Min win.)

2452
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:09,430
- Kwang Soo's marble...
- What was that?

2453
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:10,870
Was that computer graphic or what?

2454
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:14,040
Kwang Soo, Suk Jin, and Haha
will get the penalty.

2455
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,300
Let's go.

2456
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,300
(Kwang Soo, Suk Jin, and Haha
will get the penalty.)

2457
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:18,620
- This is so funny.
- There's no camera.

2458
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:21,140
Where is the camera?
This is embarrassing.

2459
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,290
I'm so embarrassed.

2460
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,290
(They are ready to repent
in the center of the lobby.)

2461
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:25,680
I'm so sick of getting penalties
with these two.

2462
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:27,920
This year,

2463
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:30,250
I've gotten a penalty every week
except for just once.

2464
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:31,360
I'm doing this every week.

2465
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:32,830
I can't believe this.

2466
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,530
This is really embarrassing.

2467
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,000
(The lobby is crowded today.)

2468
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:39,890
(They can't take their eyes
off the spectacle.)

2469
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:42,610
I'm sorry
but place the cameras closer to us.

2470
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:45,040
I hope there won't be any tourists.

2471
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,170
I hope not.

2472
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:48,450
(He's afraid
if he'd see someone he knows.)

2473
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:51,040
(Right at that moment...)

2474
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:53,540
Stop Se Chan from filming this.

2475
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,920
Go away.

2476
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,340
- Go away. Leave.
- Hey.

2477
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:00,080
- Go.
- Go home.

2478
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,750
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Se Chan.

2479
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:04,490
- What's wrong with him?
- Hey.

2480
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:05,500
(Se Chan brought someone.)

2481
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

2482
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:08,330
Hello.

2483
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:10,790
Hey, Se Chan.

2484
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:13,090
- 1, 2, and 3.
- What is he doing?

2485
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:14,390
(Mr. Yang lets people take
the best photo of their lives.)

2486
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:16,040
More people are coming.

2487
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:19,040
- Hey, Se Chan.
- This is like...

2488
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,240
Hey, you're attracting people.

2489
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,470
Hello.

2490
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:25,280
(Anyone can take the best photo
with the ugly men in front of them.)

2491
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,280
Oh, someone's behind us.

2492
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,820
Hey, why are you attracting people?

2493
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:29,380
I'm not attracting them.
They asked me to take a photo.

2494
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:30,880
Please come and take a look.

2495
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,120
Haha?

2496
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,510
Hey, Jae Joon.

2497
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:34,960
I'm ashamed.

2498
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,250
Hello.

2499
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,660
Hey, I'm embarrassed.

2500
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,250
I'm so pissed.

2501
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,660
(The 3 sinners became a small gift
for the people in the building.)

2502
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:42,090
Why is time going so slow?

2503
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:43,960
- What are you doing?
- Why is our crew taking pictures?

2504
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,130
Why are you doing this?

2505
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:47,590
You don't even care about us.

2506
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:51,130
(They are done being sinners
and everyone's photo attraction.)

2507
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:57,610
What?

2508
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:59,780
Welcome, Running Man.

2509
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:03,450
- What?
- Go into a room you want.

2510
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,790
What's all this?

2511
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:06,380
(Empty Head Land)

2512
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,330
(The 8 members must be smart
to escape Empty Head Land.)

2513
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,790
(The target score is 100 points.)

2514
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,530
Communicate by telepathy.

2515
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:15,590
(What's an exclamation?)

2516
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:16,670
(What's giraffe in English?)

2517
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:18,500
What kind of mission is this?

2518
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:21,390
(Empty Head Land shows them
the bottom of their knowledge.)

2519
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:25,410
(Only the smart ones can survive.)

2520
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,500
(However...)

2521
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:33,170
(The escape from Empty Head Land
begins now.)

2522
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:35,290
(The level of difficulty
goes up for no reason.)

2523
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,250
(The pressure to escape
is closing in on them.)

2524
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,010
(But something's standing
in their way.)

2525
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,490
(Smart Escape Race,
Empty Head Land)
