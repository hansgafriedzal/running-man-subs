1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,690
(A dark and rainy morning)

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,970
(A mysterious place...)

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,200
(with dim lighting)

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,010
(The 8 members have been invited
to this place.)

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,000
What?

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,320
What is this place?

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,440
(The 8 members have been invited
to this place.)

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,440
What is this place?

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,780
(The light is coming down
in dead silence.)

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,780
- Jae Suk.
- What?

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,320
Below the average common knowledge.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,730
(Below the average common knowledge)

13
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,750
- What is this?
- The empty heads of Korea.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,250
Welcome, members of Running Man.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
- What did it say?
- What?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,200
(With a mysterious voice,)

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,700
(all the lights are turned on.)

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,170
- What?
- I heard the word "empty heads".

20
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,500
- What?
- Did he say empty heads?

21
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,000
- "Empty Head Land"?
- "Empty Head Land"?

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,140
(The empty space appears.)

23
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,680
- Se Chan is Empty Head.
- What?

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,710
Hello.

25
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,420
- What are we doing here?
- I heard the word "empty heads".

26
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,680
- What?
- Empty heads?

27
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,820
- "Empty Head Land"?
- Did it say "Empty Head Land"?

28
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,250
- Why is it Empty Head?
- Empty Head Land?

29
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,960
We know what Empty Head is.

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,360
- Se Chan is Empty Head.
- Empty!

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,700
- This is strange.
- It is.

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,090
Are we taking tests today?

33
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,700
This is Empty Head Land,
a place you can escape from...

34
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,760
only when you're smart.

35
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,820
Only when we're smart?

36
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,200
The test will begin soon.

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,230
You can choose a room you want
from numbers 1 to 8.

38
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,400
Are the rooms different?

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,700
Is there any difference?

40
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,900
- What is this?
- What? Are we taking tests?

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,670
This is... Gosh.

42
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,010
- I'll pick number 6.
- I want number 8.

43
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,420
This is crazy.

44
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,890
What is this?

45
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,310
(Jong Kook picks Room 8,
and Jae Suk picks Room 1.)

46
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,420
What is this?

47
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,810
- I want number 2.
- Number 2?

48
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,320
- I pick number 4.
- I want number 8.

49
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,980
Number four.

50
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,700
I hate the rooms to begin with.

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,360
Gosh, it's stuffy in here.

52
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,670
I bet this can be difficult.

53
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,140
This is so annoying.

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,840
Gosh, I really hate this.
What do I do?

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,200
What's all this?

56
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,460
I might not be able to go home.

57
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,870
(Right at that moment...)

58
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,010
Who is it?

59
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,110
- Quiz...
- What?

60
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,650
- Are they locking it?
- What?

61
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,620
Why are you locking the door?

62
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,780
What are you doing?

63
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,420
Hey, quiet down!

64
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,510
- Why are you locking the door?
- Are they locking it?

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,950
Are they locking it?

66
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,260
- Don't lock the door.
- Why are you locking the door?

67
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,420
(The members are locked
in the rooms they picked.)

68
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,630
- What are you doing?
- Did they lock the doors?

69
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,860
Why are you locking the door?

70
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,570
- It's so stuffy in here.
- What is happening?

71
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,510
What is this? Number four...

72
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,610
(All 8 members are locked
in Empty Head Land at 10 a.m.)

73
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,570
Gosh, this is...

74
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,410
What is this? Invite a friend?

75
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,740
(Each room has a computer...)

76
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,640
(and a whiteboard.)

77
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,350
"This is Empty Head Land,
a place you can escape from..."

78
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,480
"only when you're smart.
This room is for the pretest..."

79
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,690
"where we will test your potential."

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,730
"Answer the questions of the pretest
to get 100 points in total."

81
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,730
"You can choose
the question's level of difficulty."

82
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,820
"And points vary according to
the difficulty of each question."

83
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,490
"Check the table below for
the difficulty level and points."

84
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,230
"If you answer wrong,
you lose ten points each."

85
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,970
Ten points for Kindergarten.

86
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,940
15 points for Elementary School,
25 points for Middle School.

87
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,140
And 70 points for Bar Exam.

88
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,350
(The questions are based
on the actual curricula.)

89
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,670
My gosh.

90
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,720
If I answer wrong
to the question for Kindergarten,

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,350
it will be humiliating.

92
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,550
Darn it.

93
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,320
To get 100 points,

94
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,130
I just have to answer ten questions
for Kindergarten.

95
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
It can be humiliating,
but I have to get out of here.

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,130
(They can get out by answering
10 questions for Kindergarten.)

97
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,130
I guess we should send a message.

98
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,600
(Each laptop has a chat room on it.)

99
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,940
Hello?

100
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,640
(Welcome to Room 1.)

101
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,510
(Can I chat now? Hello?)

102
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,170
(We will begin the pretest now.
Choose the level of difficulty.)

103
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,480
"We will begin the pretest
of Empty Head Land now."

104
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,820
"Choose the level of difficulty
that you want and type it."

105
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,190
"Then you will get
your questions accordingly."

106
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,160
"Write down your answer
on the whiteboard..."

107
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,020
"and show it to the camera."

108
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,190
I bet this is difficult.

109
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,550
(The members can only communicate
through the chat room and camera.)

110
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,550
(10 points, 15 points, 25 points,
and 70 points)

111
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,550
Come on.

112
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,700
I'll go with the question
for Kindergarten.

113
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,070
It's because...

114
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,670
I love children.

115
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,330
Are the questions
for Kindergarten difficult?

116
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,640
(Haha chose a question for
Kindergarten from the beginning.)

117
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,770
(Shouting)

118
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,830
Hey!

119
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,570
How is this...

120
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,200
How is this question
for kindergarteners?

121
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,570
What?

122
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,170
Hey, how is this question
for kindergarteners?

123
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,350
- Gosh, this is...
- Is it difficult?

124
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,180
This is so humiliating.

125
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,550
- I'm so ashamed.
- Is it hard?

126
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,420
Dream, don't watch this episode.

127
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,750
(Dream, don't watch this episode.)

128
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,900
I'm sorry, Dream.
Watch the show again next week.

129
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,670
I don't even remember
how many times I said this.

130
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,690
All right then.

131
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,130
(He starts thinking carefully.)

132
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,170
I need to read
the Chinese character.

133
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,970
Hang on. So this is...

134
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,540
This is for kindergarteners.

135
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,040
So this might be "yu".

136
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,650
I'll go with "yu".

137
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,480
I'll just take a guess.

138
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,610
(Yu)

139
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,110
(Incorrect. The answer is "jwa".
You lost 10 points.)

140
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,180
(Haha's current score is
minus 10 points.)

141
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,550
(He's a shameful father
who insists that "jwa" is "yu".)

142
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,180
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm so embarrassed!

143
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,730
(He lost 10 points right away.)

144
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,860
I'll go with Middle School.

145
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,560
Gosh, this is...

146
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,670
Is this for kindergarteners?
I don't think so.

147
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,970
Isn't this
for elementary school students?

148
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,470
How is this for kindergarteners?

149
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,970
That's ridiculous.

150
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,800
I'll go with Elementary School then.

151
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,170
(Jae Suk's current score
is 10 points.)

152
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,540
My fellow comedians
are watching this.

153
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,850
(The original Empty Head,
Se Chan is very anxious.)

154
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,870
I'm doomed.

155
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,520
I'll answer 10 questions
for Kindergarten and get out.

156
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,880
A question for Kindergarten.

157
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
"What's the Chinese idiom that means
you sing and shout while drunk..."

158
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,290
This is...

159
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,090
Hey!

160
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
Hey! This is ridiculous.

161
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,960
I know this one.

162
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,990
I know the answer,

163
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,670
but this is...

164
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,230
hard enough to be for Bar Exam.

165
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,400
"Goseong..."

166
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,840
(Goseongbang)

167
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,670
(Hesitant)

168
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,970
Is it "goseongbanggwa"?

169
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,500
(Goseongbanggwa?)

170
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,710
Goseongbangga...

171
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,500
Goseongbangga?

172
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,920
(He hesitates to write
his answer after bragging.)

173
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,540
Goseongbanggwa?

174
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,520
This should be right.
It's "goseongbangga".

175
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,380
No?

176
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,860
It's correct. Okay!

177
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,460
(Correct. You get 10 points.
Choose the next question.)

178
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,600
This question isn't
for kindergarteners.

179
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,990
Bar Exam.

180
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,900
"Bar Exam."

181
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,190
Do you think we'd never get
questions for Bar Exam right?

182
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,610
(The empty heads pick questions
for Bar Exam to avoid disgrace.)

183
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,670
I'll go with Bar Exam. Bring it on.

184
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,670
I just need to pick a number.

185
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,500
I should go with Bar Exam.

186
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,710
(Suk Jin tries to answer
the question for Bar Exam.)

187
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,670
I should give it a try.

188
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,110
It's here.

189
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,310
(The long question for
Bar Exam appears on the screen.)

190
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,110
Gosh, I'm doomed.
The Bar Exam question is too hard.

191
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,520
"Which of the following
is not true about the case?"

192
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,120
(The small letters
fill a whole page.)

193
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,290
What is this?

194
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,360
I want to go home already.

195
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,990
What is this thing?

196
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,540
What's the thing that looks
like a fly swatter?

197
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,360
(This is the fly swatter.)

198
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,410
There are Chinese characters.
I'm so doomed.

199
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,340
Constitutional Court?
I feel like throwing up.

200
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,170
(Retching)

201
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,420
I'm so stressed out.

202
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,170
(I'm so stressed out.)

203
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,790
I don't know. I took a guess.

204
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,250
(She just took a guess
after writing some letters.)

205
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,050
Oh no.

206
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,730
"Due to an infringement accident..."

207
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,530
Gosh, it's wrongfully used.

208
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,600
(The middle-aged test taker
still hasn't given up hope.)

209
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,400
(He carefully reads the question
in the tiny cell.)

210
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,670
"However, it was denied
for lack of legal grounds."

211
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,930
It was leaked.

212
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,840
All right then.

213
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
(He finally made up his mind.)

214
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,980
This is the answer
to the question for Bar Exam.

215
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,370
(Correct. You got 70 points.
Choose the next question.)

216
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,540
(Suk Jin's current score
is 70 points.)

217
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,680
I got it right! It's correct.

218
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,110
This is amazing.

219
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,110
(Big Nose picked the correct answer
to the question for Bar Exam.)

220
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,180
Guys.

221
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,120
My current score is 70 points.

222
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,290
- That's amazing.
- Are you bragging?

223
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,620
Yes, I'm bragging.

224
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,230
(Convert the following fraction
into a percentage.)

225
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,360
Percentage?

226
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,560
I don't know percentage.

227
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,970
(So Min is stuck on a math problem
for elementary school students.)

228
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,430
I'm not good at mathematics.

229
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,500
I can't do math.

230
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,000
This is my answer.

231
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,150
Isn't this it?

232
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,280
(She just multiplied 4 by 100.)

233
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,420
I lost 10 points. I'm in trouble.

234
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,080
25 percent?

235
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,980
Oh, it's about percent.

236
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,420
What do I do? It was percent.

237
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,860
I know that a fourth is 25 percent.

238
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,980
Please edit this part cut.

239
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,380
(So Min's current score
is minus 10 points.)

240
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,620
Okay. Let's go.

241
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,490
What?

242
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,690
Which one is not true?

243
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,470
(This is an invitation
to a birthday party.)

244
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,340
(Which of the following
is not true?)

245
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,840
Gosh, this is funny.

246
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,710
(Correct. You got 25 points.
Choose the next question.)

247
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,850
(What should Kwang Soo say
in the following dialogue?)

248
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,510
"Good morning, Kwang Soo."
"Hello, Dad."

249
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,350
(Good morning, Kwang Soo.)

250
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,590
(I slept like a rock.)

251
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,590
"Hello, Dad. I slept like a rock."

252
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,880
(I slept like a rock.)

253
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,230
(Incorrect. You lost 10 points.
The answer is "Good morning.")

254
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,390
(Se Chan's current score
is minus 20 points.)

255
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,840
(The more he tries to solve,
the lower his score gets.)

256
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,130
I want to get out of here.

257
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,340
My fellow comedians
from "Comedy Big League".

258
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,940
Change the channel.

259
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
(It's 3:20 now.
What time was it 43 minutes ago?)

260
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,980
43 minutes ago?

261
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,720
(She does the math carefully.)

262
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,250
All right.

263
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,650
(It's 3:20 now.
What time was it 43 minutes ago?)

264
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,750
I got it.

265
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,990
(2:57)

266
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,120
The answer is...

267
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,660
(Incorrect. You lost 10 points.
The answer is 2:37.)

268
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,730
Gosh, I calculated it in tens.

269
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,860
I can't believe this.

270
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,870
I calculated it in tens.

271
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,500
My goodness.

272
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,140
(Ji Hyo's current score
is minus 20 points.)

273
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,610
(What's the name
of the following formula?)

274
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,980
(He's facing the 2nd crisis.)

275
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,910
(It makes him repent
of his ignorance.)

276
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,950
Dream.

277
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,780
I studied liberal arts.

278
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,380
I mean, liberal arts are...

279
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,460
about something grammatical...

280
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,800
and something artistic.

281
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,100
That's what I studied.

282
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,360
I just try to be wise.

283
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,940
(What's the name
of the following formula?)

284
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,340
(Groaning)

285
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,000
When I took
the college entrance exam...

286
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,210
This is the trick I did.

287
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,810
Usually...

288
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,640
The answers are one of these.

289
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,110
One of them might be
the correct answer.

290
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,550
(It's the legendary principle
of -1, 0, and 1.)

291
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,220
All right then.

292
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,690
(He thinks he's supposed
to solve the equation.)

293
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,910
Minus b... Plus and minus?

294
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,190
Why does it have
plus and minus together?

295
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,280
It looks like a Chinese character.

296
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,960
Is this "to"?

297
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,620
(He says "to" after getting
the problem about "jwa" wrong.)

298
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,490
There are only a, b, and c.

299
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,700
It should have some numbers.

300
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,890
(Oh, right.)

301
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,030
"What's the name
of the following formula?"

302
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,610
Hang on.

303
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,440
Hold on.
What kind of formula do I know?

304
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,500
I think I can get this right.
The name of the formula?

305
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,350
It can't be the separation formula.

306
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,740
The only formula I know is...

307
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,110
(Quadratic formula!)

308
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,590
Here I go.

309
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,860
(He writes down
the only formula he knows.)

310
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,930
Quadratic formula?

311
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,230
(Quadratic formula)

312
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,560
(Correct. You got 25 points.
Choose the next question.)

313
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,200
(He finally stops losing points
and recovers from the minus.)

314
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,360
Hey.

315
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,800
This is going well.

316
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,230
(Haha's current score is 5 points.)

317
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,580
Make sure to show
that I said quadratic formula.

318
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,630
(He's surprised by himself.)

319
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,110
Is quadratic formula the base
times the height divided by two?

320
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,410
It's the radius times
the radius times 3.14.

321
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,820
3.14 is pi.

322
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,220
I'll go with Elementary School.

323
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,190
How many questions should I answer?

324
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,380
Continent?

325
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,200
Hang on. Which continent is this?

326
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,890
I don't think this is a question
for elementary school students.

327
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,020
(Oceania)

328
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,340
(Correct. You got 15 points.
Your current score is 55 points.)

329
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,070
Hey, this is too difficult.

330
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,230
(Correct. You got 15 points.
Your current score is 55 points.)

331
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,180
(He chose a middle school question
continuing his sweeping upturn.)

332
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,310
Oh, that? Gosh.

333
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,500
(What is the layer between the crust
and the outer core?)

334
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,610
I'm not sure if this is right.

335
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,980
(Mantle)

336
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,410
(Correct. You got 25 points.
Your current score is 80 points.)

337
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,510
Is it the correct answer?

338
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,280
(Correct. You got 25 points.
Your current score is 80 points.)

339
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,060
This is great.

340
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,860
Really? Is it the correct answer?

341
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,250
(Elementary school, 15 points,
Find the angle for the blank.)

342
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,250
What's this?

343
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,430
(Elementary school, 15 points,
Find the angle for the blank.)

344
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,800
So this is 80 degrees.

345
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,300
How would I know this?

346
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,990
This one here looks...

347
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,390
similar to that one.

348
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,130
I feel so lonely.
This is a lonely fight.

349
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,580
It's slightly wider than that.

350
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,130
(This is how he solved questions
his entire life.)

351
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,450
That means it's slightly bigger
than 45 degrees.

352
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,580
And the other one is 80 degrees.

353
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,980
It looks around 50 degrees.
Or 55 degrees.

354
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,880
It must be around 55 degrees.

355
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,280
55 degrees.

356
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,460
Darn. I'm so upset.

357
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,650
What? Is it the correct answer?

358
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,490
(Correct. You got 15 points.
Choose the difficulty level.)

359
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,260
Great. I just guessed
and got it right.

360
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,860
(Happy)

361
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
(He's excited that he solved
a math question after decades.)

362
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,860
That's funny.

363
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,500
(Write Lee Kwang Soo's nickname
"Giraffe" in English.)

364
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,470
They underestimated me.

365
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,310
Oh, I got it right. Okay!

366
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,980
- It can't be for a kindergartener.
- "Giraffe".

367
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,350
Gosh. I'm getting confused suddenly.
This is driving me nuts.

368
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,510
How to spell "giraffe"...

369
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,850
I think I'm not getting enough air
in this booth.

370
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,780
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

371
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,560
What is "giraffe" in English?

372
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,560
- It's "40 signal".
- "40 signal"?

373
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,890
Yes.

374
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,890
- Girin.
- This is ridiculous!

375
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,020
Is it "girin"?

376
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,330
(Is it "girin"?)

377
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,600
(Incorrect. You lost 10 points.
The answer is "giraffe".)

378
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,300
"Gir..."? "Giraffe"?

379
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,270
What... What's "giraffe"?

380
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,000
- Oh, man. Please.
- Please.

381
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,310
(Kwang Soo wrote "girafe".)

382
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,220
(It's missing an "F".)

383
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,720
(Incorrect. You lost 10 points.
The answer is "giraffe".)

384
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,560
(Room 7, Lee Kwang Soo,
current score, minus 20 points)

385
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,510
I swear. I really knew the answer.

386
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,650
I saw this word so many times.

387
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,020
(He got it wrong when it was one
of a few English words he knows.)

388
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,360
I choose the kindergarten level.

389
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,100
(The point hunter Jong Kook chose
the kindergarten level.)

390
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,860
What's this?

391
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,490
(Kindergarten, 10 points)

392
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,630
(Write the names of the dances
of each country.)

393
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,700
(Korea, Fan dance)

394
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,760
I don't know the answer
to the last one. Hold on.

395
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,680
(Egypt)

396
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,080
What country is this?

397
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,870
(The last question is
unexpectedly difficult.)

398
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,140
Why is the kindergarten level
so difficult?

399
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,140
What is
the traditional Egyptian dance?

400
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,010
Jong Kook, it's Macarena.

401
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,820
- No, it isn't. What?
- The sphinx!

402
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,910
The sphinx dance
that Ji Sang Yeol does!

403
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,020
Jong Kook, it's the cobra dance!

404
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,330
I'll pass.

405
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,020
(Incorrect. You lost 10 points.
The answer is "Tanoura".)

406
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,700
You know, I feel so betrayed
by kindergartens.

407
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,230
I told you so. It's not easy at all.

408
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,080
Then I should solve
another middle school question.

409
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,900
Come on. I've done well enough
to get out of here.

410
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Here. If I get this one right,
please let me out.

411
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,610
You should let me out now.

412
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,850
(Congratulations! You passed
the test with 105 points.)

413
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,980
105 points! I passed!

414
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,690
I want to get out of here.

415
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,960
Let me out now!

416
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,090
How do I get out?

417
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,650
(Jae Suk is the 1st
to get 100 points.)

418
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,520
(The door to the secret room is
opening.)

419
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,520
(Jae Suk who passed the test...)

420
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,620
(entered the main room
of the Empty Head Land.)

421
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,630
What?

422
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,610
Hurry up and come out, guys.

423
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,230
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk, did you get out?

424
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,840
- Of course.
- Really?

425
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,440
Of course, I came out.

426
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,940
(Jae Suk is waiting alone
in the main room.)

427
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,050
Jae Suk, I can't even understand
the questions.

428
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,510
What does it say?

429
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,140
I got another one wrong.

430
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,280
(Many are screaming
as they get questions wrong.)

431
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,220
I think I might have to wait
for too long.

432
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,820
(He might have to wait for long
in the empty main room.)

433
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,480
Gosh. My score is 90 points.

434
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,560
The kindergarten questions are
so darn difficult.

435
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,590
(Kindergarten)

436
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,960
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

437
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,730
Give me an easy question this time!

438
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,440
(He chose the kindergarten again
typing with only his index fingers.)

439
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,760
Give me a question about something
I learned in kindergarten!

440
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,770
I didn't learn things like this
in my kindergarten!

441
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:54,900
(Write the numbers in the blanks
in order.)

442
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,950
Oh, good.

443
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,510
(Write the numbers in the blanks
in order.)

444
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,110
But... It hurts my pride somehow.

445
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,510
(Write the numbers in the blanks
in order.)

446
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,280
21, 22, 23, 24...

447
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,650
(He's mumbling
after writing down the answer.)

448
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,960
I can't believe I had to
double-check my answer.

449
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,250
(Congratulations! You passed
the test with 100 points.)

450
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,200
Okay! Where do I get out?

451
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,260
(Jong Kook is the 2nd to pass.)

452
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,300
Jong Kook is done.

453
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,600
- Where do I get out?
- Jong Kook, did you pass the test?

454
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,660
(Jong Kook tenaciously stuck to
the kindergarten questions.)

455
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,500
- What's this? Hi.
- Welcome.

456
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,370
(He's overwhelmed to meet
the winner of the test.)

457
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,210
Why would the kindergarten questions
be so difficult?

458
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,870
- Gosh, seriously.
- They're from the actual exams.

459
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,010
Really?

460
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,370
- My gosh.
- They were so difficult.

461
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,820
Two of us got out.
It's my turn. I'll get out.

462
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,860
"1 carbon atom
and 2 oxygen atoms..."

463
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,330
(What is the molecule made up of
1 carbon atom and 2 oxygen atoms?)

464
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,830
(1 carbon atom
and 2 oxygen atoms...)

465
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,150
The square roots are inside and out
of the parentheses. I have no idea.

466
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,430
(Sparkling water)

467
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,390
Incorrect?

468
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,990
(Incorrect. You lost 10 points.
The answer is "carbon dioxide".)

469
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,710
Carbon dioxide? Oh, right.

470
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,500
But doesn't sparkling water have
something to do with carbon dioxide?

471
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
(Solve the equation below.)

472
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,640
(Darn it.)

473
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,550
Hey, you mean punks!

474
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,220
(Middle School, 25 points,
Solve the equation below.)

475
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,950
The square roots are inside and out
of the parentheses. I have no idea.

476
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,410
I'll try to solve it my way.
3 plus 2 equals 5.

477
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,380
And that's 4. The answer is 1.

478
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,530
3 times 2 equals...

479
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,560
(He even tries to multiply
all the numbers he can see.)

480
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
It's 6. So it's 6.

481
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,000
All right. The answer is...

482
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,220
Two.

483
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,890
Is it five?

484
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,700
(Incorrect. You lost 10 points.
The answer is 5.)

485
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,860
(While the original empty head is
struggling with square roots...)

486
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,900
She's coming out?

487
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,510
- Gosh. I'm upset.
- Ji Hyo passed it.

488
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,630
- What?
- How?

489
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,850
- Ji Hyo passed it?
- What?

490
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,900
No way!

491
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,370
(Jae Suk and Jong Kook were
watching the others.)

492
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,410
She's coming out?

493
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,350
- Ji Hyo passed it.
- What?

494
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,910
- What?
- Ji Hyo passed it?

495
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,320
- Ji Hyo got out?
- No way!

496
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,410
Ji Hyo passed it?

497
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,710
(Hi.)

498
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,120
- What did you say?
- Don't lie to me!

499
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,060
- Hey, you...
- Gosh, you empty heads.

500
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,180
Hey.

501
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,030
- Hey, how did you...
- You empty heads.

502
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,360
How did you get out so fast?

503
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,800
No way. Ji Hyo can't be out already.

504
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,390
No way!

505
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,740
There were very easy ones too.

506
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,070
I got one bar exam question right.

507
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,110
- Really?
- You got it right?

508
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,040
- She got a bar exam question right?
- Really?

509
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,130
- That can't be true.
- Are you serious?

510
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,280
- I got it right.
- You should start studying.

511
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,900
I choose the Bar Exam.

512
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,940
(5 minutes earlier)

513
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,440
(She got a question wrong
but tried again.)

514
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,710
I don't know.
I'll just take a guess.

515
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,020
(Number 4)

516
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,950
(And number 4 was
the correct answer.)

517
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,620
- That's impressive. Ji Hyo.
- You should take the bar exam.

518
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,330
- You're incredible.
- Prepare for the exam.

519
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,620
You should start studying.

520
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,360
Suk Jin is still in there.

521
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,570
(Suk Jin even solved
a bar exam question.)

522
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,600
- Even Ji Hyo got out too.
- The square root of three...

523
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,610
Hey, do you know
how to calculate a square root?

524
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,340
Gosh. This is so difficult.

525
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,580
Wait. It's not.

526
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,970
9 times 4 equals 36.
9 times 4 equals...

527
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,310
9 times 2 equals 18.

528
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,170
9 times 4... That's 37.
Then add 3...

529
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,490
9 times 9 equals 81. So it's 84.
That's right.

530
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,380
(After a weird calculation...)

531
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,560
Let's go. Let me answer.

532
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,790
This is it.

533
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,530
(He submitted a weird answer.)

534
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,590
5? The answer is 5?

535
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,650
(Incorrect. You lost 10 points.
The answer is 5.)

536
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,890
Gosh.

537
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,390
The staff members seem
quite baffled too.

538
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,070
That should be considered
as a correct answer.

539
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,770
You guys are so mean.

540
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,310
30 minutes have passed
since the test began.

541
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,080
From now on,
the points for every question...

542
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,630
- will be doubled.
- Okay.

543
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,940
- Okay.
- I'll be out if I get this right.

544
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,440
(If x is minus 3, what's the value
of 2 minus the square of x?)

545
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,850
No more math problems, please.
I was always bad at math.

546
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,940
It's taking you too long.

547
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,490
I got only 1 or 2 questions right
in the CSAT.

548
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,880
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

549
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,030
- That's pi. Pi equals 3.14.
- Please give me an easy question.

550
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,530
Darn it. I don't know.

551
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,860
(He wrote down an answer
while mumbling about pi.)

552
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,920
This one is actually quite easy.

553
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,530
- Isn't this correct?
- I want to get out of here.

554
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,630
(Correct. You got 50 points.
Your current score is 110 points.)

555
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,840
- What is it? Did you get it right?
- I got it right.

556
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,430
- What?
- I got it right.

557
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,110
Why are you so surprised?

558
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,550
Okay!

559
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,050
(Kwang Soo came in 4th
in the preliminary test.)

560
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,440
- Kwang Soo is coming out too.
- Kwang Soo passed it too?

561
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,710
It took me a long time.

562
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,050
(He came in 4th unexpectedly
just like Ji Hyo.)

563
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,440
- It's unexpected.
- Oh, this is what it's like.

564
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,450
- I'm getting out.
- Hey, you're out.

565
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,590
(Following Kwang Soo,
So Min escaped.)

566
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,790
So Min came out.

567
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,650
I knew it. You should've
studied hard in school.

568
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,120
"Complete the sentence
using the right interjection..."

569
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,190
Suk Jin hasn't come out yet?

570
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,830
Suk Jin, what's your score?

571
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,000
It's 55 points.

572
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,070
(He has a long way
to get 100 points.)

573
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,360
He didn't ask about your age.

574
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,810
- Not your age.
- My score is 55 points.

575
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,280
"Complete the sentence
using the right interjection..."

576
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,810
- "for the situation."
- Poor Suk Jin.

577
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,550
- Suk Jin is still in there?
- Why...

578
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,250
Why does he always act
like a know-it-all?

579
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,870
I think he's in there intentionally
to be funny.

580
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,410
- He always acts like that.
- I believe that's the case.

581
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,880
- He just wants to be funny.
- But do you think it's funny?

582
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,680
Is this funny?

583
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,320
It's not funny. It's sad.

584
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,360
Is this funny?

585
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,620
"The right interjection..."

586
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,690
She slipped and fell?
It says "It hurts."

587
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,890
"Thump! It hurts." An interjection?

588
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,500
An interjection?

589
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
I have to write an interjection?

590
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,190
Hey, what is an interjection?

591
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,860
An interjection, you know.

592
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,770
- "Wow."
- "Oh, gosh."

593
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,960
- "Oh, dear."
- "Darn."

594
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,200
- "Darn."
- "Oh, dear."

595
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,310
"Geez."

596
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,780
- "Shoot."
- "Shoot."

597
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,440
- "It hurts."
- Right.

598
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,940
- That's it, Suk Jin.
- This is the answer.

599
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,970
(He decided to go with
"Goodness! It hurts.")

600
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Gosh. The answer is "oops".

601
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
"Oops"?

602
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
(Incorrect. You lost 10 points.
The answer is "Oops!")

603
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,880
This is driving me nuts.

604
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,650
- Come on out now.
- "Oops!"

605
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,680
This is so...

606
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,880
- Suk Jin won't get out soon.
- Wait.

607
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,060
My score is 45 points.

608
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,760
- Okay!
- Is someone coming out?

609
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,890
Is it Se Chan?

610
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,460
Okay!

611
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,600
(Se Chan came in 6th
in the preliminary test.)

612
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,770
That made me feel so good.

613
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,240
(He barely managed to get 100 points
as the points were doubled.)

614
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,270
- Really?
- Se Chan passed the test.

615
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,810
Hey.

616
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,430
I'm totally humiliated.

617
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,970
(He's walking out
with an upset look on his face.)

618
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,050
- Are you serious?
- "Oops!"

619
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,180
- Are you serious?
- "Oops!"

620
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,610
(Right then,)

621
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,260
(Kwang Soo gave him a hand signal.)

622
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,450
(At the place Kwang Soo pointed at,)

623
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,860
My gosh.

624
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,220
(Se Chan received an envelope.)

625
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,720
Suk Jin won't get out soon.

626
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,220
Jong Kook, trust me.
He won't get out soon.

627
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,770
- Hey, you came out.
- He won't get out soon.

628
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,040
(Check that out first!)

629
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:01,470
(Those who passed the test
have their eyes on Se Chan.)

630
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,020
Okay.

631
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,210
(What secret could be written
in the envelope?)

632
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,110
(You are 1 of the geniuses
of Running Man...)

633
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,260
You are one of the geniuses
of Running Man...

634
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,030
who passed the preliminary test
before the others.

635
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,800
This is a hidden rule that's given
only to the six geniuses.

636
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,500
(You are 1 of the geniuses
of Running Man.)

637
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Hey.

638
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,770
(This is a hidden rule that's given
only to the geniuses.)

639
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,860
- The remaining two members...
- Focus!

640
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,860
will participate in the race
without knowing this rule.

641
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,340
So please act naturally
to the end of the race.

642
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,350
You should be smart
to escape from this Empty Head Land.

643
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,210
The 6 geniuses should use
the 2 dunces to escape.

644
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,490
You have six hours to escape.

645
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,150
If you figure out the passcode
for the exit door...

646
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,560
and escape from this room
in six hours,

647
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,150
the six geniuses win the race.

648
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,330
The geniuses will receive
3,000 dollars as a prize,

649
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,800
and the dunces will receive
a penalty.

650
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,040
However, if you fail to escape
in time,

651
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,630
the six geniuses will receive
a penalty,

652
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,840
and the dunces will receive
the prize money.

653
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
(The dunces will receive the prize
if the geniuses fail.)

654
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,350
(A few minutes earlier)

655
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,610
(Jae Suk who came out first
received the hidden rule.)

656
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,670
What is this?

657
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,210
(Jae Suk who came in 1st
received the hidden rule.)

658
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,410
Why would the kindergarten questions
be so difficult?

659
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,590
(Jong Kook who came in 2nd
also received it.)

660
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,820
Oh, my goodness.

661
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,420
I understand.

662
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,420
(Smiling)

663
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,530
When 1 of them comes out,
the remaining 2 will team up, right?

664
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,690
That's right.

665
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,920
- But we shouldn't tell them.
- Of course.

666
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,960
We shouldn't tell them.

667
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
(The geniuses were secretly informed
about the hidden rule for them.)

668
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,840
(So the team of 6 geniuses
was formed.)

669
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,580
When all eight of you gather again,

670
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,440
we will announce that today's race
is a group mission for all members,

671
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,370
so either all of you win
or all of you get a penalty,

672
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,490
which is a fake rule.

673
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,610
(When everyone gathers again,
a fake rule will be announced.)

674
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,760
Every time the geniuses succeed...

675
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,680
in completing a mission
while lying to the dunces,

676
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,790
the geniuses are allowed to enter
the escape room.

677
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,270
You can get all the information
regarding the escape in the room.

678
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,420
So you should act as if you are all
on the same team...

679
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,390
so that the dunces cooperate
to the end.

680
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,390
(You can find the passcode there,
so make sure the dunces cooperate.)

681
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,770
(The geniuses have to lie
to the 2 dunces...)

682
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,670
(and use them to escape
and win the race.)

683
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,510
- It's real money.
- We're on the same team, right?

684
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,510
Yes.

685
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
Here you go.

686
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,110
(While the geniuses exchange
silent signals with one another...)

687
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,590
Why are the kindergarten questions
so difficult?

688
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,680
(Why are the kindergarten questions
so difficult?)

689
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,060
Was it Dangun Wanggeom? Gosh.

690
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,490
Kids learn this in kindergarten?

691
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,490
- They're trying to make fun of me.
- Hey.

692
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,860
Suk Jin is still in there too.
So don't worry.

693
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,920
It's not too late.
Suk Jin is in there too.

694
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,390
Just focus!

695
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,960
This is the answer.

696
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,660
(Dunce 2 who used to be a genius...)

697
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,430
I got this one wrong too?
This is driving me nuts.

698
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,400
Hey, my score will
go below zero again.

699
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,510
Gosh.

700
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,810
Suk Jin...

701
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,510
(Laughing)

702
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,820
- Suk Jin looks so serious.
- If you just look at the screen,

703
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,170
he looks like a businessman
working in the IT industry.

704
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,350
Suk Jin...

705
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,410
What? Everyone else got out?

706
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,520
Time's up.
The preliminary test is over.

707
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,220
Suk Jin and Haha
who failed to pass the test...

708
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,880
will come out
regardless of the result.

709
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,530
- Is it over?
- Who else is left?

710
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,150
Gosh, those empty heads.

711
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,420
This is embarrassing.

712
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,740
- Forget it. Just come on out.
- You can just come out.

713
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,430
You majored in
business administration in college.

714
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,930
Gosh. I'm so upset.

715
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,240
- I mean, Those questions...
- You know, right?

716
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,810
- They can't be for kindergartners.
- It was so difficult.

717
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,430
- Exactly.
- I'm pretty sure...

718
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,550
- Suk Jin.
- There's something fishy about it.

719
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,850
- I think...
- They tried to make fun of us.

720
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,370
- I got more difficult questions.
- But...

721
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,410
It's because... Listen to me.

722
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,020
Those can't be questions
for kindergarteners.

723
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,210
I understand why Haha failed.

724
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,410
- But you...
- Hey.

725
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,560
- What?
- I...

726
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,860
- What?
- That's even more upsetting.

727
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,920
- Hey.
- Suk Jin.

728
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,420
- At first...
- I chose middle school questions.

729
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,600
All eight contestants,
please gather around.

730
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,340
As a result of the preliminary test,

731
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,570
only the six members who passed it
are acknowledged as geniuses.

732
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,840
Suk Jin and Haha who failed it...

733
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,580
will participate in the race...

734
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,940
- as dunces.
- Mr. Dunce.

735
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,520
As I told you in the beginning,

736
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,520
today's race is Smart Escape Race,
Empty Head Land.

737
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,380
You have to complete given missions
and solve quizzes...

738
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,210
and escape from this room
to win the race.

739
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,760
All we have to do is
to escape from this room?

740
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,120
You have six hours to escape.

741
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,920
- We'll start counting down now.
- How can you be one of them?

742
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,300
Today, all of you are
on the same team.

743
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,390
(Today, all of you are
on the same team.)

744
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,390
(The fake rule about all the members
playing as a team is announced.)

745
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,040
(When all eight of you
gather again,)

746
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,870
(we will announce that today's race
is a group mission for all members,)

747
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,810
(so either all of you win
or all of you get a penalty,)

748
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,510
(which is a fake rule.)

749
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,640
(Only the 6 geniuses were informed
about the fake rule.)

750
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,750
(The fake rule is announced again
for the 2 dunces.)

751
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,760
If you escape in time, you will all
share the price of 3,000 dollars.

752
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,860
(The geniuses are acting
as if they never heard about it.)

753
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,330
- Really?
- Oh, my. 3,000 dollars?

754
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,500
If you fail, all of you will receive
a penalty together.

755
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,420
- Can you see the escape room?
- Yes. What is it?

756
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,300
If you complete a mission
where all of you should succeed,

757
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,700
- we'll open it for five minutes.
- Is that so?

758
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,780
But only the geniuses are allowed
in that room for five minutes.

759
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,140
And if you solve a quiz in the room,

760
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,870
you'll get the passcode
for your choice of lock.

761
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,440
While the six geniuses are solving
quizzes representing the team,

762
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,320
the two dunces will carry out
another mission in the main room.

763
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,830
The result will determine
the difficulty level of the quizzes.

764
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,830
Got it.

765
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,120
We're good at things like that,
right?

766
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,030
The result of their missions will
determine the difficulty level...

767
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,120
- of the quizzes we'll solve, right?
- Correct.

768
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,740
- You should do well.
- But we're all on the same team.

769
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,500
- We're geniuses.
- We're geniuses, and you're dunces.

770
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,960
We'll solve the quizzes
while you two...

771
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,040
- Hey, stop saying that.
- Suk Jin, listen.

772
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,430
You and Haha should do well
in the main room.

773
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,370
- We need you guys to succeed here.
- Shut your mouth.

774
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,410
- You managed to get out somehow.
- We'll ask you.

775
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,410
(Time left: 05:51:42)

776
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,910
We'll begin the first team mission.

777
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,150
- What is it?
- The first test is...

778
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,830
the Brain Health Test.

779
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,120
- "Brain health"?
- "Brain health"?

780
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,600
This is a scientifically proven test
through which you can check...

781
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,500
your brain health by yourself.

782
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
- Really?
- It's scientifically proven?

783
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,540
Look at these 35 words
written in different colors,

784
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,360
and say the color of the words.

785
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,340
- For example...
- I should say "red"...

786
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,430
- Yes.
- although it says "blue".

787
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,510
That's right. You should say "red"
for this one.

788
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,280
- Okay. I get it.
- Black, green, blue, yellow...

789
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,110
In this case, you should say
"black, green, blue, yellow, red".

790
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,790
I can actually check
my brain health.

791
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,850
That looks difficult.

792
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,180
You'll take turns
until three of you succeed.

793
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,120
You will have 20 seconds
in the beginning.

794
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,030
You'll get 1 extra second
whenever 2 members fail.

795
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,500
Oh, boy.

796
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,960
But you will have to spend
more time escaping.

797
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,030
- Oh, right.
- I get it.

798
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,070
Okay. I understand.

799
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,190
- Let's give it a try.
- Black,

800
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,930
- blue, yellow, red...
- I see.

801
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,960
I'm mildly colorblind.

802
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,930
Me too. Actually, I'm...

803
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,130
I'm mildly colorblind too.

804
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,130
(I'm mildly colorblind too.)

805
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,610
You are?

806
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,940
The dunces will go last, right?

807
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,970
Let's put them in between
since they're bad at it.

808
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,410
- Gosh, those punks.
- Gosh.

809
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,050
Hey, how about a 2-on-2 match?

810
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,050
- Against whom?
- No way.

811
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,680
- How about a quiz match?
- Let's do it later.

812
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Come on. Both of you, calm down.

813
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,860
- You know why we're upset.
- Just laugh it off.

814
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,330
- But what are you going to do?
- I'm so upset.

815
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,920
Who wants to go first?

816
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,330
(Raising her hand)

817
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,420
So Min will go first.

818
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,270
- Ready. Set. Go.
- Get set.

819
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,810
- You can start now.
- Green, red, black,

820
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,340
black, red, black, yellow,

821
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,540
black, red, black.

822
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,040
- That's black.
- Keep going.

823
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,250
- Continue.
- Should I keep going to the end?

824
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,710
Red, yellow, black, green, black,

825
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,370
- green, re... Bla... No, blue.
- I don't think I can do this.

826
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,050
Green. No, bla...

827
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,550
(Bla... No, blue. Green. No, bla...)

828
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,880
Red, yellow...

829
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,910
- Gosh, seriously.
- It's difficult.

830
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,680
- Hey, hey!
- That's a lot.

831
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,790
- I couldn't...
- So Min, focus, will you?

832
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,530
Your brain has rotten!

833
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,420
Don't read the words.

834
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,120
You shouldn't see the letters.
You should focus on the color.

835
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,630
You shouldn't read them
but see the whole thing.

836
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,270
You can't see the forest
for the trees.

837
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,630
It's so difficult.
There are too many of them.

838
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,040
- So Min.
- I'll go next.

839
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,640
- You should focus, okay?
- I'll go next.

840
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
- I'll do it.
- You should...

841
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,910
You should never let the letters
confuse you.

842
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,940
- Hey, Rambo.
- Can you do that?

843
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,910
(Jong Kook tries it.)

844
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,380
Blue, black, red, yellow, black,

845
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,120
red, blue, black, green, black,

846
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,920
- red, blue.
- Oh, wow.

847
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,300
- black, green,
- Faster.

848
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,620
black, black, green,
yellow, red, red,

849
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,130
green, green, black, blue, red,

850
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,200
- blue, green, blue, red, black,
- Oh, my.

851
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,010
- green, black...
- He sounds angry.

852
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,130
- What a shame. You did well.
- That wasn't fast enough?

853
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,080
- Hey, you should've done it faster.
- You should be faster than that.

854
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,170
What?

855
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,170
(What?)

856
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,520
Hey, Rambo.

857
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Can't you do it?

858
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,820
Hey, Rambo.

859
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,320
- I mean...
- Look at me.

860
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
You see,

861
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,760
I watched one of the "Rambo" movies
starring Sylvester Stallone...

862
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,110
once again not long ago.

863
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,830
I think he looks just like Rambo.

864
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,620
- He looks just like Rambo.
- I agree.

865
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,030
- Hey, Rambo.
- Jong Kook, wear a red headband.

866
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,070
- Hey, listen. Keep your mind...
- Hey, Rambo.

867
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,720
- He looks just like Rambo.
- You see...

868
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,930
Watch me. I'll try this time.

869
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,800
(No one is listening to him.)

870
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,040
- Hey...
- I think he looks just like Rambo.

871
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,770
- No one is listening to you.
- He looks just like Rambo.

872
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,130
- I'm listening.
- Hey, Rambo.

873
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,200
- As if I was talking to myself.
- Since we're the dunces,

874
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,470
- Listen.
- we can't seem to blend in.

875
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,110
- I'll go next.
- Will you?

876
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,580
- I'll go next.
- No.

877
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,320
- I'll try. And I'll tell you...
- Step back, guys.

878
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,320
- what you guys did wrong.
- Gosh. I'm so upset.

879
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,560
- What did I do wrong?
- I'll tell you.

880
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,820
- You got carried away.
- Suk Jin.

881
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,610
- You should stay calm...
- Okay. Stop talking and show me.

882
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,120
- And speak in a low voice.
- Show me how to do it.

883
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,420
You should see it from a distance.

884
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,560
- You should speak in a low voice.
- We can't see the screen.

885
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,300
- We can't see it.
- Ready, go.

886
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,300
Yellow, blue, blue, green...

887
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,430
- It's over.
- It's over.

888
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,040
- Blue, green...
- What is he doing?

889
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,660
- He's hopeless.
- This is so funny.

890
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,400
- Yellow, yellow, green,
- I think...

891
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,610
- Could he develop dementia soon?
- green,

892
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,640
- red,
- What's wrong with him?

893
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,580
- black, yellow, yellow,
- How bad is his brain health?

894
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,940
- green,
- Could he develop dementia soon?

895
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,320
- Why is he doing this?
- green,

896
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,710
- red, green,
- Am I right?

897
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,320
- He's moving his hands like this.
- black,

898
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,820
- blue...
- I think...

899
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,650
- Suk Jin, please cheer up!
- You can do this!

900
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,220
- Black, blue...
- You can do this!

901
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,000
Good health, blessing,

902
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,420
- and luck.
- Black...

903
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,000
- Green.
- You're bad at this.

904
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,460
What on earth was that?

905
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,540
- Suk Jin...
- You guys made me laugh.

906
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,360
- He was terrible at it.
- Do this...

907
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,630
Do this in your free time.

908
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,340
- Or this.
- Do this in your free time.

909
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,460
Things like this.

910
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,310
- Do this in your free time.
- Or play cards.

911
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,900
- In the opposite direction.
- You guys made me laugh.

912
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,610
How could you be that terrible?

913
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,550
You should've at least
made it to the last line.

914
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,280
- Darn it.
- It wasn't bad though.

915
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,490
Sure.

916
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,910
You...

917
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,210
- It's important to stay focused.
- Did you see that just now?

918
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,880
- Did you see that?
- See what?

919
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,390
Suk Jin answered Haha's response...

920
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,650
with a fist bump, but he...

921
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,060
Show them.

922
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,500
(High five, fist bump)

923
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,240
- We don't click.
- You guys don't click at all.

924
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,740
(Suk Jin went for a fist bump
while Haha went for a high five.)

925
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,900
(They tried to match
the other person, but failed.)

926
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,170
- We don't click.
- You guys don't click at all.

927
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,110
You can say that again.

928
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,940
Don't be so considerate, okay?

929
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,470
(This is how it's like to click.)

930
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,710
They're both too sweet.

931
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,140
- I'll give it a go.
- Sure.

932
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,680
- Just look at the colors.
- Rambo,

933
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,990
- focus on the colors.
- But near the end...

934
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,350
Okay, I'll speed through them.

935
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,820
- You have 22 seconds left.
- See me fly through this.

936
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,450
- Let's do this!
- All right!

937
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,120
Red, black, green, yellow,

938
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,760
green, red, red,

939
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,860
yellow, blue, black,

940
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,360
yellow, black, yellow, black, blue.

941
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,960
- Then...
- His legs.

942
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,240
- Yellow, blue, green, green.
- What's with your legs?

943
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,960
- Black, red...
- Why are you all worked up?

944
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,070
- Blue, black, yellow.
- Hurry.

945
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,010
Red, yellow, blue,

946
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,540
green, no black.

947
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,940
Red, red, yellow.

948
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,280
- Wrong.
- Darn!

949
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,850
- You were almost there.
- It's difficult, you know.

950
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,910
- Focus only on the colors.
- It's not easy.

951
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,110
Only look at the colors.

952
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,590
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

953
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,950
Why were you stomping your feet?

954
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,150
Where were you off to?

955
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,330
- Hey. Be quiet.
- Why were you...

956
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,450
- Stay put, will you?
- Stop being so nervous?

957
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,060
- Who next?
- Kwang Soo.

958
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,860
- I'll give it a shot.
- You'll get 22 seconds.

959
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,890
I've tried it on the sidelines,

960
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,190
- and I got it right every time.
- Look at it from a distance.

961
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,860
Wish yourself good luck first.

962
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,040
- Go for it.
- Wish me luck!

963
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,100
Good luck.

964
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,200
- Let's go.
- Go!

965
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,810
Red, yellow, black, blue, yellow,

966
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,010
green, green, black, green, black.

967
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,510
- Yellow, blue, blue, yellow.
- He's good.

968
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,670
Red, red,

969
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,870
green, red, blue, black,

970
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:47,020
green, blue, black, green, yellow.

971
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,640
- You're almost there.
- Black, red, blue,

972
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,090
black, yellow,

973
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,880
black, red, blue,

974
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,860
black, red, green,

975
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,030
black, red, green, blue.

976
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,120
Red, green, blue!

977
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,830
- Okay!
- Nice!

978
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,530
- Good job.
- Nice.

979
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,600
Okay, let's move on.

980
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,390
Rambo, wait.

981
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,460
Wait.

982
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,040
- You were amazing.
- That was great.

983
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,540
- But why...
- Rambo.

984
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,130
- Didn't I do well?
- Step aside now.

985
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,340
- We have a game to play.
- Move.

986
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,610
Okay!

987
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,070
- Haha's next.
- Haha.

988
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,640
- Hey.
- You've got this.

989
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,370
- Let's go.
- You can do this.

990
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,450
You can do this.

991
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,180
Blue, yellow, red,

992
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,410
blue, black, blue,

993
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,280
red, yellow, red,

994
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,120
- yellow, green, green.
- Everyone has a routine.

995
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,490
- Blue...
- Are you a rapper?

996
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,820
- Are you a rapper?
- Blue, black,

997
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,450
- blue, blue.
- Are you in a rap contest?

998
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,820
- Black, blue...
- You look younger than your age.

999
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,930
Red, blue,

1000
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,590
yellow, green, green,

1001
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,990
red...

1002
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,140
- Wrong!
- Darn it.

1003
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,660
It reminded me of Z-KIRI.

1004
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
- Hey, Z-KIRI.
- You shed years off your age.

1005
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,300
You were Z-KIRI again.

1006
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
Why were you back as Z-KIRI?

1007
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,200
- His method though...
- Ji Hyo, go ahead.

1008
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,070
- Could you do this?
- You were in third place.

1009
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,050
- Go, Ji Hyo.
- Her brain could be healthier...

1010
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,450
since it hasn't been used much.

1011
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,240
- Like the brain of a newborn.
- Go ahead.

1012
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,590
Green, green, red, black, yellow,

1013
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,030
red, blue, yellow, red, blue.

1014
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,660
- You're out.
- That was black.

1015
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,530
- Which one?
- Ji Hyo, go ahead and take a break.

1016
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,360
Ji Hyo, go ahead and take a break.

1017
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,930
- Time out.
- Take a short break.

1018
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,430
- Wait.
- She's not done yet.

1019
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,590
- Take a short break.
- A brief one.

1020
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,760
- Ji Hyo wasn't ready.
- Steady your pace.

1021
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,530
- Calm down a little.
- She wasn't ready.

1022
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,010
- Well...
- Did she say "black"?

1023
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,800
- Ji Hyo wasn't ready.
- Good luck, Ji Hyo.

1024
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,570
I'll go.

1025
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,780
- Here I go.
- And go!

1026
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,450
- Good luck.
- Red, yellow, black,

1027
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,370
blue, yellow, green, green,

1028
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,220
black, green, black,

1029
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,180
yellow, blue, blue, yellow.

1030
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,220
- Stay focused!
- Blue, black, red.

1031
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,550
- You're almost there.
- You've got this.

1032
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,780
- Green.
- Go, Rambo!

1033
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,620
- Green, black, red, green.
- Go, Jong Kook.

1034
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,300
- Blue.
- Blue!

1035
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,200
(He did it this time.)

1036
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,390
Rambo.

1037
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,090
- You were swaying as well.
- Rambo.

1038
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,430
You were also moving side to side.

1039
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,200
I, Rambo...

1040
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,110
My heart started pounding
near the end.

1041
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,470
I, Rambo, was a nervous wreck.

1042
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,570
- Rambo...
- That was hilarious.

1043
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,840
Good job.

1044
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,950
- She's got this.
- Green, blue, red,

1045
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,720
- black, green, black.
- She'll make it.

1046
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,890
Red, blue, black!

1047
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,390
Nicely done.

1048
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,820
We should be happy too, right?

1049
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,780
Stepping to the rhythm is vital.

1050
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,950
- Right.
- It's necessary.

1051
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,760
I can see that this is needed.

1052
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,490
It helps the brain function.

1053
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,590
I'm amazed.

1054
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,220
Although it took you some time,

1055
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,700
you will now get to enter
the escape room.

1056
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,700
While the others head inside,

1057
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,510
the two of you
will be given a mission.

1058
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,300
There are different levels
of quizzes inside.

1059
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,780
What they'll be solving
depends on you two.

1060
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,910
- Then...
- Let's do this.

1061
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,610
Of course. Do well outside, okay?

1062
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,950
- We'll get going.
- See you.

1063
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,740
- What about us?
- Good luck.

1064
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,450
You need to make it easier
for us in there.

1065
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,220
Don't worry.
We'll have a mission to solve too.

1066
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,260
Ask if you need any help.

1067
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,660
- You're playing a big role too.
- Okay.

1068
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,990
Isn't it weird
how I'm going in there?

1069
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,160
Just because of some random test...

1070
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,590
- Get going.
- This makes no sense.

1071
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,030
Good luck.

1072
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,220
(The geniuses
enter the escape room.)

1073
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
That...

1074
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,990
(Time left: 05:09:55)

1075
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,890
(This is the escape room.)

1076
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,010
It's quite spacious.

1077
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,240
- What's this?
- Spacious, isn't it?

1078
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,610
(The escape room
that the geniuses just entered)

1079
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,800
What is this place?

1080
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,280
- What's this?
- Are these the levels?

1081
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,010
(3 quiz tables)

1082
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,090
(Firmly locked 3 locks)

1083
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,360
Choose One or the Other.

1084
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,280
The next one is Arrange in Order.

1085
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,390
(Celebrity Keyword)

1086
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,120
- They unlock the locks.
- Right.

1087
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,260
- There's a lot.
- This is for the third lock.

1088
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,090
Welcome to the escape room...

1089
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,160
that can only be accessed...

1090
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,390
- by geniuses.
- Good.

1091
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,390
The three locks behind you...

1092
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,140
only open to
the correct four-digit combination.

1093
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,010
It is one number per question.

1094
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,800
That's a total of 12 questions.

1095
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,010
That's what I said.
There are 12 questions.

1096
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,740
Each lock has questions
of a different category...

1097
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,780
that have different levels
of difficulty.

1098
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,740
If the dunces
complete their mission,

1099
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,950
the level of difficulty
will be lowered.

1100
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,820
Choose the lock
and the place of the number.

1101
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,620
We can always guess...

1102
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,220
- the last digit, right?
- Right.

1103
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,550
- There's no need to know them all.
- Just the first three.

1104
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,860
- We can always guess.
- Let's figure three out first.

1105
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,890
(They agree to guess
the last digit.)

1106
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,760
The amount of time
you'll be given...

1107
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,200
will always be five minutes.

1108
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,470
The siren will go off
when you have 30 seconds left.

1109
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,010
- I...
- One is the Celebrity Keyword.

1110
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,110
- Arrange in Order.
- How about Arrange in Order?

1111
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,700
There's also
Choose One or the Other.

1112
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,300
Choose One or the Other
sounds difficult.

1113
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,010
(They will only get 5 minutes
in the escape room each time.)

1114
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,620
- Which should we try first?
- Arrange in Order?

1115
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,780
- Arrange in Order.
- For the first one.

1116
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,340
- We have to do it anyway.
- Let's do this.

1117
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,840
Arrange them in chronological order.

1118
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,010
- This is easy.
- It's an easy one.

1119
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,320
- Here.
- It's like this.

1120
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,410
All right.

1121
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,760
Wait, it's not easy at all.

1122
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,220
- It's not easy.
- I only know Suk Jin's birthdate.

1123
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,300
Let's see.

1124
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,660
That goes here.

1125
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,860
- 1966.
- Right, 1966.

1126
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,700
- Saemaeul Movement?
- Well...

1127
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,390
This is a tough one.

1128
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,740
Was it in the late 60s?

1129
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,640
When did Patti Kim make her debut?

1130
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,010
- Didn't she debut at a young age?
- Right.

1131
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,110
Wouldn't it have been
after Suk Jin's birth?

1132
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,700
This probably goes here.

1133
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,180
We're all in the back...

1134
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,490
We're all in the back
and not contributing.

1135
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,890
- Then...
- What's this?

1136
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,590
What does this even mean?

1137
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,490
The five-year
economic development plan?

1138
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,590
A five-year...

1139
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,160
economic development plan
was announced.

1140
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,660
Wouldn't it have been after...

1141
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,760
Suk Jin's birth?

1142
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,030
Just go out there
and find us some clues.

1143
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,820
Like this.

1144
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,240
Don't you think this happened first?

1145
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,260
- What?
- But...

1146
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,010
No way. That makes no sense.

1147
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,280
Let's just give it a try.

1148
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,680
What about this then?

1149
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,180
Like this.

1150
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,240
Was the Saemaeul Movement
in the 60s?

1151
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,180
- Like this.
- I think that goes second too.

1152
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,340
- Wait.
- This goes second?

1153
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,070
Wouldn't this...

1154
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,280
Don't just copy what they're saying.

1155
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,590
(I'm warning you.)

1156
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,280
- Try this.
- Is Suk Jin...

1157
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,660
- that old?
- Have you reached a decision?

1158
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,620
Was Suk Jin born
before the Saemaeul Movement?

1159
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,990
This is it. I'm sure of it.

1160
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,660
This order...

1161
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,370
(This order...)

1162
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,570
is incorrect.

1163
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,930
- Really?
- The correct order is like so.

1164
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,010
Patti Kim's debut.

1165
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,510
- What?
- The Chang Myon administration.

1166
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,430
Suk Jin's birth and
Saemaeul Movement.

1167
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,870
What we had...
Was that the correct order?

1168
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,780
- Patti Kim.
- When did she make her debut?

1169
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,120
- In 1958.
- Really?

1170
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,950
Suk Jin was really born
before the Saemaeul Movement.

1171
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,660
- Patti Kim...
- When did she make her debut?

1172
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,720
Your mission...

1173
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,820
is to bounce the ping-pong ball...

1174
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,160
on the boxes
all the way down to the cup.

1175
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,220
It's too difficult though.

1176
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,800
It's not easy.

1177
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,990
Can we begin the game?

1178
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,870
I'll give it a try.

1179
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,160
Haha, go for it.

1180
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,970
(Them succeeding will lead to
easier questions.)

1181
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,410
How is this even possible?

1182
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,470
- Are you out to get us?
- This is super hard.

1183
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,780
Why are you torturing us?

1184
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,180
- How about the same category?
- Sounds good.

1185
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,550
Heo Jun, Jeong Yak Yong,
Jang Yeong Sil, Yi Hwang.

1186
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,320
Place their portraits in that order.

1187
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,640
Yi Hwang. Okay, got it.

1188
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,910
(Heo Jun, Jeong Yak Yong,
Jang Yeong Sil, Yi Hwang)

1189
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,530
(Place their portraits
in that order.)

1190
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,220
- I'm clueless.
- He's Yi Hwang.

1191
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,490
- He's Yi Hwang.
- That's right.

1192
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,220
Next...

1193
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,570
- We're all standing in the back.
- Is he Heo Jun?

1194
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,370
None of us are willing
to contribute.

1195
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,300
Where's actor Jeon Gwang Ryeol?

1196
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,970
I'm confused between
Jang Yeong Sil and...

1197
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,070
I wonder who this is.

1198
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,570
Isn't he Jang Yeong Sil?

1199
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,680
He's Jeong Yak Yong for sure.

1200
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,610
His portrait is on display
at Namyangju.

1201
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,010
- What?
- Really?

1202
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,870
Yes, because he rests there.

1203
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,050
- Really?
- Like this.

1204
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,590
Good. I think it's right.

1205
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,450
This order...

1206
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:08,030
(This order...)

1207
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,450
- It's correct.
- Nice!

1208
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,860
I told you it was right.

1209
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,030
Okay.

1210
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,590
- Okay.
- Nice.

1211
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,760
- Why weren't you contributing?
- I knew the answer.

1212
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,260
- Good job.
- They didn't need my help.

1213
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,590
Here's the first digit...

1214
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,800
to the second lock.

1215
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,950
Please choose the next question.

1216
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,780
The second digit
in Arrange in Order.

1217
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,950
Countries.

1218
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,320
- We've got this.
- Oh, no.

1219
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,510
- This...
- Of course.

1220
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,820
- Germany.
- That's Germany.

1221
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,240
I only know
since I enjoy soccer games.

1222
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,680
- The Netherlands.
- That's Germany.

1223
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,090
I only know
since I enjoy soccer games.

1224
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,550
- This is the Netherlands.
- Isn't it Argentina?

1225
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,720
This is the Netherlands.

1226
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,360
- This is the Russian flag.
- And this is the Hungarian flag.

1227
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,820
- This is it.
- Right. This is it.

1228
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,200
- This order...
- This is it.

1229
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,470
- is correct.
- Okay.

1230
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,160
I'll give you the second digit...

1231
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,390
of the second lock.

1232
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,760
(They earned the 2nd digit
of the 2nd lock.)

1233
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,200
- Please select your next quiz.
- Okay.

1234
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,840
- Let's choose the 3rd digit.
- We should pick the 3rd digit.

1235
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,140
- We should choose that.
- Let's pick the third digit.

1236
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,550
(Right then!)

1237
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,680
You have only 30 seconds
to use the escape room.

1238
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,120
We have only 30 seconds?

1239
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,990
This one's the leopard. Wait, no.

1240
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,280
That's not it.

1241
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,510
- Oh, gosh.
- I have no idea.

1242
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,660
They all look the same.

1243
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,450
(List them in this order.
Leopard, cheetah, jaguar, puma)

1244
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,120
- Gosh, this is...
- This is a cheetah.

1245
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,260
This is a cheetah?

1246
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,430
- This is a jaguar.
- Isn't this a puma?

1247
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,240
- Jae Suk, this is...
- This is a puma.

1248
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,590
Wait, this is a puma.

1249
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,740
- This is...
- This is a cheetah.

1250
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,910
Yes, it's a cheetah. Hang on.

1251
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,260
- This is a leopard.
- This is a jaguar.

1252
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,300
- This is a jaguar. We got it.
- Let's try it then.

1253
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,970
- I think this is correct.
- Jaguars are rather cute.

1254
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,200
- Their heads are big.
- This is a cheetah for sure.

1255
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,280
- No, it's not.
- Isn't this a leopard?

1256
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,510
- No, no.
- Jaguars' heads are big.

1257
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,010
This order...

1258
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,680
(Leopard, cheetah, jaguar, puma)

1259
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,840
- is not correct.
- It's not?

1260
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,490
- This is wrong?
- This is the answer.

1261
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,510
- This is a jaguar?
- This is a jaguar?

1262
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,910
But jaguars are supposed to be cute.

1263
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,490
So this is how jaguars look?

1264
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,590
This was too hard.

1265
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,530
(They failed to find the third digit
and finished their time...)

1266
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,700
(in the escape room.)

1267
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,260
Let's go now.

1268
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,300
- That was too hard. What was that?
- That was too hard.

1269
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,370
That was too hard.

1270
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,610
- We didn't get to say a word there.
- Hey.

1271
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,410
So Min and I couldn't do anything
in there.

1272
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,010
Try it. It doesn't bounce.

1273
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,410
They should give us a game
we could play.

1274
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,740
It doesn't bounce.

1275
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,510
- You couldn't do this?
- It doesn't work.

1276
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,510
I want to play something like this.

1277
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,590
It's time for the second mission.

1278
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,590
- The second mission...
- Yes.

1279
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,530
is a general knowledge test.

1280
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,430
The person trying for the answer
should put paint on their fingers.

1281
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,930
That thing will spin.

1282
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,640
You need to spin seven times
behind the starting line.

1283
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,640
Then you'll need to pick a country
and guess its capital city.

1284
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,970
Oh, the capital city?

1285
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,430
- It'd be hard to pick a country.
- I'm not good with capital cities.

1286
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,610
It's already hard to pick a country,
but we have to guess its capital?

1287
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,070
Choose a color for yourself,

1288
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,470
- and put them on your fingers.
- Okay.

1289
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,340
- Then you can go for it.
- Let's do this.

1290
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,780
Where is Russia's capital city?

1291
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,910
- What?
- What's the capital city of Russia?

1292
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:49,990
- Russia?
- Yes.

1293
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,280
Don't stall for time.

1294
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,220
It's Luxembourg.

1295
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,680
- The capital city of Australia...
- Russia...

1296
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,800
is Sydney, right?

1297
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,360
- No, it's Melbourne.
- Melbourne?

1298
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,800
- What about Russia?
- Gosh, these guys...

1299
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,870
- No, no. We need to let them pick.
- Pick the biggest country.

1300
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,890
- You need to pick China.
- Do you want to go first, Ji Hyo?

1301
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,300
- Let's go, Ji Hyo!
- You can do it!

1302
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,370
Spin seven times,
and we'll count to three.

1303
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,970
- Ready, go.
- Spin.

1304
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,700
- 1.
- 1.

1305
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,240
- 2.
- 2.

1306
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,280
She's spinning slowly.

1307
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,470
- Three.
- It's okay to spin slowly.

1308
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,640
- 4.
- 4.

1309
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,640
I think I'm spinning the wrong way.

1310
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,240
- Five.
- Is there a time limit?

1311
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,320
- Six.
- I don't think she can walk.

1312
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,390
- You need to spin faster than that.
- Seven.

1313
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,590
- That's seven. Go.
- Go.

1314
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,320
(She needs to pick a country
on the map within 3 seconds.)

1315
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,360
- Go.
- Hurry, Ji Hyo.

1316
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,620
2, 1.

1317
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,030
(She needs to pick a country
on the map within 3 seconds.)

1318
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,620
2, 1.

1319
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,320
Which country is it?
She did pick one.

1320
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,760
- Which country is it?
- Which country? She did pick one.

1321
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,370
It's in Asia. It's near Korea.

1322
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,930
- She did pick one.
- You need to stop it.

1323
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:39,990
It's the Philippines.

1324
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,740
- She picked the Philippines.
- It's not bad.

1325
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,470
- You can do it.
- Okay!

1326
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,870
- Three...
- You can do it.

1327
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,950
- Okay!
- Three...

1328
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,470
- Manila!
- That's correct.

1329
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,780
(Manila is correct.)

1330
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,820
- Great job.
- Gosh, Ji Hyo.

1331
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,740
- She picked the Philippines.
- That was great, Ji Hyo.

1332
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,950
- Of course she knows.
- How did she know?

1333
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,240
You're studying these days,
aren't you?

1334
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,390
You're dizzy, right?

1335
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,280
They say it's never too late
to learn things.

1336
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,820
Ji Hyo is on fire these days.

1337
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,950
I think Ji Hyo is getting tutored
these days.

1338
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,700
- Ji Hyo became...
- Are you getting tutored?

1339
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,200
- really smart.
- It was a difficult one.

1340
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,890
- Suk Jin, you're up next.
- It's your turn, Suk Jin.

1341
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,390
He can't stand being dizzy though.

1342
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,700
- I should endure it.
- Okay.

1343
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,760
Here he goes.

1344
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,110
- One.
- Faster, faster!

1345
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,200
- Two.
- My gosh, Suk Jin.

1346
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,370
- My gosh, Suk Jin.
- Three.

1347
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,700
- Stoop down more!
- Four.

1348
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,280
- Oh, no. I'm in trouble.
- Five.

1349
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,740
- Six.
- I'm in trouble.

1350
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,870
- Let's go.
- Seven.

1351
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,140
- 3, 2...
- Oh, gosh!

1352
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,180
- One.
- Pick a country!

1353
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,220
- It's over.
- My gosh.

1354
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,720
(His steps seem unstable already.)

1355
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,620
(He couldn't even pick a country.)

1356
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,260
- Come on.
- Seriously?

1357
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,780
You should've picked
an ocean at least.

1358
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,780
- An ocean!
- Suk Jin.

1359
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,620
- Anyone could tell...
- Seriously.

1360
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,970
he was trying to get more airtime.
Aren't I right?

1361
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:44,160
- You're so greedy.
- We've been too generous.

1362
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,590
- Suk Jin!
- We've been too generous.

1363
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:46,840
- No.
- We've been too generous.

1364
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,160
You should know when to stop.

1365
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,240
I was really dizzy.

1366
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,760
- Suk Jin.
- I was...

1367
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,200
- That was lousy.
- That was a little too much.

1368
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,840
I can guarantee you'll be dizzy too.
You try it.

1369
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,950
- Suk Jin.
- You won't be able to pick one.

1370
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,280
- You were too greedy.
- You can't pick one either!

1371
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,140
You can't take up airtime like this.

1372
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,050
That's not what I was after.
Go ahead and try it yourself.

1373
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,640
- His steps were too fake.
- Seriously.

1374
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,260
- He looked awkward.
- He did it like this.

1375
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,390
He was walking toward
the map like this.

1376
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,050
- The way he walked...
- I swear...

1377
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,860
- that I didn't fake any of it.
- The way he walked...

1378
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,090
- It's because...
- You should try it.

1379
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:15,200
You know walking like this
on a variety show...

1380
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,200
That's considered cheating.

1381
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,470
- You try it.
- I understand how you must've felt.

1382
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,390
You know what? I'll give it a try.

1383
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,840
He tried to make us laugh
with fake moves.

1384
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,970
He was greedy to get more airtime.

1385
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,180
This isn't right, Suk Jin.

1386
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,680
- But the thing is...
- What is it?

1387
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,240
You can't fake things
to get more airtime.

1388
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,700
- Don't do that.
- That's not right.

1389
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,450
- That's not right.
- It's because I'm cold.

1390
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:33,510
Okay, fine.

1391
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,720
This isn't fake, is it?

1392
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,090
Let's not make it unnatural.

1393
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,160
People hate fake things these days.

1394
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,220
Ready, go.

1395
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,360
- He doesn't get dizzy.
- One.

1396
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,620
Two.

1397
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,030
- 3, 4.
- People don't like fake things.

1398
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,390
- Five.
- People don't like fake things.

1399
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,800
- Six.
- Make us laugh genuinely.

1400
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,860
- Seven.
- Let's go.

1401
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,890
- That's good.
- Two...

1402
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:49,760
(He takes genuine steps
to make them laugh genuinely.)

1403
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,820
2, 1.

1404
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,030
- That's good!
- Nice!

1405
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,260
- Which country is it?
- China!

1406
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,700
Let's stop it.

1407
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,260
- It might not be China.
- I don't think it is.

1408
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,430
I think it's Mongolia.

1409
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,910
No, the red color covers China.

1410
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,140
- Isn't it Kazakhstan?
- No, it's not.

1411
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,010
- No, it's not.
- It is China!

1412
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,450
The land that got the pain the most.

1413
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,510
- It's China.
- It's China.

1414
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,620
1, 2, 3.

1415
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,840
- Beijing!
- Okay!

1416
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,720
- Good job.
- Isn't this too fake?

1417
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,720
- No, it's not? Why?
- Isn't this fake?

1418
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,720
- That doesn't look like snot.
- What's wrong with you?

1419
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,280
You must've spun so fast
to get snot like that.

1420
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,550
Could you turn down
the air conditioner?

1421
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,620
It's so cold.

1422
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,120
- Turn down the air conditioner?
- Yes.

1423
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,700
- We're going again?
- For extra time,

1424
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,070
those who haven't tried it
could give it a go.

1425
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,070
- Sure.
- Okay.

1426
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:23,530
- Extra time?
- Yes.

1427
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,300
- What are we doing again?
- For extra time...

1428
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,090
(Approaching)

1429
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,430
(Laughing)

1430
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,470
Why are we making things unnatural?

1431
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,780
(He prefers to
make people laugh genuinely.)

1432
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,950
- You said you won't do it.
- This is crazy.

1433
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,340
Guys, work harder!

1434
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,970
- Let's do this!
- Just like me!

1435
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,950
Work hard until your nose bleeds.

1436
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,410
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

1437
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:44,820
- Hey.
- How are we supposed to...

1438
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,860
You should take care
of your health, So Min.

1439
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,530
We're all doing this
because of Suk Jin.

1440
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,590
I'm so tired.

1441
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,300
- Let me see, Haha.
- Oh, my.

1442
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,800
- Aren't you tired?
- I am.

1443
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,030
Gosh, I'm so tired.

1444
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,390
Let's do this!

1445
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,930
Next is Kwang Soo.

1446
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,490
If you succeed,
you'll get extra time.

1447
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,530
(If he succeeds, they'll get
more time to use the escape room.)

1448
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,070
- Ready.
- Let's see how he does it.

1449
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,410
Set, go.

1450
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,800
- One.
- Come on.

1451
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,370
- 2, 3.
- Come on.

1452
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:08,800
- 4.
- 5, 6.

1453
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,470
Seven. You can go now.

1454
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,620
I'm so dizzy!

1455
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,910
- I'm so dizzy!
- You should still go for it.

1456
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,970
- 5, 6.
- Come on.

1457
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,510
(Rubbing)

1458
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,890
- Seven. You can go now.
- I'm so dizzy!

1459
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,550
(He has paint all over his face.)

1460
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,760
His face turned yellow.

1461
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,860
- He couldn't even pick a country.
- No, no.

1462
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,390
- His face turned yellow.
- I did pick a country!

1463
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,220
- He did pick one.
- I'm so dizzy!

1464
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,450
- You ran out of time.
- Hey.

1465
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:27,660
Your face turned yellow.

1466
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,870
My face is yellow?

1467
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,700
Everyone is going overboard
because of Suk Jin.

1468
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,890
- What's this?
- You should all act natural.

1469
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,240
- It's so awkward.
- What's wrong with you?

1470
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,140
You should've acted naturally.
Why did you put paint on your face?

1471
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,010
Wipe your nosebleed
before saying anything.

1472
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,870
You succeeded to enter
the escape room.

1473
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,340
- We'll give you a chance to enter.
- Okay!

1474
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,780
Please try a little harder.

1475
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,740
- You should do better here.
- I'm doing my best!

1476
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,010
The mission is difficult
inside the escape room too.

1477
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,720
You should succeed here
so it'd get easier for us.

1478
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,780
Can you bounce the ball
three times and make it go in?

1479
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,050
- Just do it, you punk!
- It's difficult.

1480
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,200
If you're not smart,
then use your body!

1481
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,260
(He can't refute that.)

1482
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,090
Let's go inside the escape room.

1483
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,430
We can do this, Suk Jin.

1484
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,370
- Let's do this!
- Let's do our best.

1485
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:07,970
Let's go, dunces!

1486
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,410
Are you solving questions in there?

1487
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,140
My gosh.

1488
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,340
- We should pick that one.
- So, the rules...

1489
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,180
- This is driving me crazy.
- Gosh, this isn't fun.

1490
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,280
- Let's try the third digit.
- Let's try this then.

1491
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,780
- Okay, but it's too hard.
- It's my turn again?

1492
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,180
- It's my turn.
- Let's give it a try.

1493
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,950
We should list them in the order
of the event that occurred first.

1494
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,450
- The launching of the Euro.
- They're economic events.

1495
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,590
- It's difficult.
- The September 11 attacks.

1496
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:23,720
- This isn't it.
- That happened in 2001.

1497
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,160
- September 11 attacks came later.
- That happened in 2001.

1498
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,260
- The IMF crisis.
- That happened in 1998.

1499
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,590
- Gaeseong Industrial Complex?
- The groundbreaking ceremony...

1500
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,590
of Gaeseong Industrial Complex?

1501
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,990
- I have no idea about this.
- This...

1502
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,490
Gaeseong Industrial Complex?

1503
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,760
What's the launching of "payment"?

1504
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,490
- The Euro.
- The currency of the EU.

1505
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,090
He thought it meant "payment".

1506
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,030
- It's the Euro, not "payment".
- It's the Euro.

1507
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,300
- I read it wrong.
- I'm so sorry.

1508
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,430
I read it wrong
because it was too far.

1509
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,510
We thought the Euro was...

1510
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,070
- The launching of the Euro?
- Hold on.

1511
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,410
I went to Europe to shoot a show
in 2002.

1512
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,470
I remember using the Euro.

1513
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,370
Isn't the construction of Gaeseong
Industrial Complex before that?

1514
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,950
Maybe it's earlier than we thought.

1515
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,410
Let's put them in this order then.

1516
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:58,990
Se Chan has been saying something,
but you're all ignoring him?

1517
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,010
Let's put them in this order.

1518
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,680
The launching of the Euro,
The September 11 attacks...

1519
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,120
I think Gaeseong Industrial Complex
was built before that.

1520
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,390
The IMF crisis,
the launching of the Euro,

1521
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,120
- The September 11 attacks...
- Hold on. I have no idea.

1522
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,800
This order...

1523
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,390
- is correct.
- It's correct!

1524
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,200
- It's correct!
- What did I tell you?

1525
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,300
- I was right. Go away.
- He's so smart.

1526
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,510
(IMF crisis, launching of the Euro,
September 11, Gaeseong Complex)

1527
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,870
I'll give you the 3rd digit
of the 2nd lock.

1528
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,010
It's zero.

1529
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,140
It's done.

1530
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,510
You should try the last digit.

1531
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:25,550
Try it.

1532
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:26,950
We need to know the rest of them.

1533
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:28,340
She got it. It's open.

1534
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,390
(They unlocked the second lock.)

1535
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:30,550
It's 5202.

1536
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,660
For the third lock,

1537
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,220
you'll play
a celebrity keyword quiz.

1538
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,930
Listen to the keyword,
and all of you need to say...

1539
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:38,930
different answers.

1540
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,760
All six of us?

1541
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,930
I don't think we can do it.

1542
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,200
- We'll take turns in this order?
- Let's do it.

1543
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,800
It must be something like guessing
the works Kwang Soo was in.

1544
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,570
I think that'd be
the most difficult one.

1545
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,240
- It's the most difficult one.
- Jong Kook.

1546
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
- Okay.
- I'm not that bad.

1547
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,280
Excuse me, Payment. Please get out.
This isn't a free show.

1548
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,910
And why did you put paint
on your face?

1549
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,570
Did you think it'd be funny?

1550
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,840
Wait. Didn't you draw a nosebleed?

1551
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,240
You drew a nosebleed
with the red paint.

1552
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,160
- Hurry.
- This is upsetting, you know!

1553
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,090
- Let's give it a try.
- We need to focus here!

1554
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,360
Let's give it a try.

1555
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,590
Is it difficult?

1556
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,490
Maybe they got something
on the outside.

1557
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:13,550
I think so.

1558
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,320
I mean...

1559
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,090
- Isn't there something else?
- We should keep trying.

1560
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,490
Let's do this.
Jae Suk did it earlier.

1561
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:21,410
- I think this is easier.
- It's difficult, Suk Jin.

1562
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,110
So we have to succeed five times
in a row, right?

1563
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:26,930
- Let's keep going. What's next?
- Let's play the next one.

1564
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,550
- Let's do it again.
- Oh, this is how it's played?

1565
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,300
- I think we can do it.
- Okay, let's do it.

1566
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,340
Name a celebrity
whose surname is Song.

1567
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,340
- 1, 2...
- Song Ji Hyo.

1568
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,780
- Song Il Kook.
- Song Hae.

1569
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,180
- Song Hye Kyo.
- Song Eun I.

1570
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,620
- Song Seung Heon.
- Okay!

1571
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,620
That was great.

1572
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,220
- We got it.
- Good job.

1573
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,550
We know everything about showbiz.

1574
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:44,930
Yes, we do.

1575
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:48,620
I'll give you the 1st digit
of the 3rd lock.

1576
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,430
- We don't have much time left.
- Let's hurry.

1577
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:51,840
- We can play one more time.
- Hurry up and give it to us.

1578
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,370
- We can play one more time.
- Hurry!

1579
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,410
Name a song that has "summer"
in its title.

1580
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,300
- "Summer Please".
- I was going to say that!

1581
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,470
- "Summer Story".
- Oh, no!

1582
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:00,870
(Summer, ice)

1583
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,300
(We should have
iced coffee in summer)

1584
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,450
(We should have
iced coffee in summer?)

1585
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,840
- That's a song in a commercial.
- Come on!

1586
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,180
- Why not?
- It's a song for Maxim.

1587
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,140
- It's Maxim's song.
- Why would you sing that song?

1588
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,860
- It has "summer" in it!
- The title has to have "summer".

1589
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,390
- That was so unnatural.
- Why not?

1590
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,550
- It has "summer" in it!
- That was funny, Ji Hyo.

1591
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,160
We were supposed to sing a song
with "summer" in its title.

1592
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,320
(An exciting...)

1593
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,930
(summer song)

1594
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,070
This doesn't work.

1595
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,970
- Maxim iced coffee.
- You still haven't succeeded it?

1596
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,140
- We did up to 1, but doing 3 is...
- What were you doing?

1597
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,240
You have a separate mission,
don't you?

1598
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,470
- You do, don't you?
- What do you mean?

1599
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,780
- You have another mission, no?
- No, we don't.

1600
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,470
- You did one?
- Haha.

1601
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,450
You have another mission, don't you?

1602
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:40,180
- It's written there.
- You're doing another mission, no?

1603
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,240
- What do you mean?
- Don't you have another mission?

1604
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,490
- We're only doing this.
- Oh, really?

1605
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,550
We've been playing this only.

1606
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,680
(We've been playing this only.)

1607
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,010
- Everyone.
- This doesn't work.

1608
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,010
(Se Chan finds
the dunces suspicious.)

1609
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,590
Now, you'll play the third mission.

1610
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,990
This time, it's One Heart, One Body.

1611
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,090
You'll hear a proverb...

1612
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,320
and make a gesture
you're reminded of.

1613
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:58,970
Everyone needs to
make the same gesture.

1614
00:52:58,970 --> 00:52:59,990
I think this is doable.

1615
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,740
It's a proverb, not a word,

1616
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,840
so making the same gesture
is extremely hard.

1617
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:06,870
Therefore, you'll roll dice
before the game begins...

1618
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:09,870
and only the given number of people
need to make the gesture.

1619
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,200
Okay, it sounds doable.

1620
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,620
There are 3 to 8 dots on the dice.

1621
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,410
The number on the dice
determines the number of people...

1622
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:17,450
- that need to make the gesture.
- It's doable.

1623
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,490
Who'll roll the dice?
Ji Hyo, you should do it.

1624
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,220
- You're the lucky one.
- She's lucky.

1625
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,820
- Lucky girl!
- Let's do this!

1626
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:24,890
The lower the number, the better.

1627
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,950
It'd be best to get three.

1628
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,260
1, 2...

1629
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,490
- Three!
- Throw it in a funny way.

1630
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:31,490
What was that?

1631
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:33,200
- It went over the wall.
- Hey!

1632
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,490
(The prankster couldn't help
but pull a prank.)

1633
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,760
(An out-of-the-set homerun)

1634
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,410
(The staff members were
on standby in the escape room.)

1635
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,680
(They were attacked
by the dice out of nowhere.)

1636
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,870
(Who did this?)

1637
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:47,840
(They're running out of time,
but the prankster had to kick it.)

1638
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,640
- Come here.
- What's wrong with you?

1639
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,390
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you listen to me?

1640
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:53,660
- What's wrong with you?
- I mean...

1641
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,320
- It fell right here.
- Why does he keep being playful?

1642
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,680
It fell right in front of me.

1643
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,550
- What's wrong with you?
- Why is he in such good condition?

1644
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:00,220
I thought it'd fall inside.

1645
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,590
He wanted to make it fun.

1646
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:03,570
Don't touch it! You're unlucky!

1647
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,660
- Don't touch it!
- Okay, okay.

1648
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,240
He's really excited.

1649
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,390
- He's excited every day.
- I'll throw it.

1650
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:08,660
Throw it gently.

1651
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,930
- There you go.
- Don't kick it.

1652
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,140
- Hey!
- Come on.

1653
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,300
(It went out to the other side
of the set this time.)

1654
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,510
- Gosh, they're not in a good mood.
- Suk Jin.

1655
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:18,280
- This isn't fun at all.
- Suk Jin...

1656
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,640
- You're ruining the mood.
- Jae Suk did it already.

1657
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,910
I'm quitting.

1658
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,050
- I quit. I'm quitting.
- Jong Kook.

1659
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,320
- Suk Jin, you ruined the mood.
- That's not it.

1660
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,490
- That's not it.
- Apologize to Bo Pil.

1661
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,910
- I will, but...
- Apologize now.

1662
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,660
- I'm sorry, but...
- What's this?

1663
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,660
- I'm sorry, but...
- Apologize to Chan Hee too.

1664
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,660
You can just edit it out
if it's not fun.

1665
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:34,760
But if you edit it nicely,
it could be fun.

1666
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,760
Chan Hee would've dropped
his camera in the old days.

1667
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,140
Chan Hee likes me a lot.
And I like him too.

1668
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:42,030
- It's gone.
- See? He dropped his camera.

1669
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,240
(He decided that it's not fun enough
to air.)

1670
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,640
- Chan Hee!
- He dropped his camera.

1671
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,970
- You see?
- Of course.

1672
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,570
- Ji Hyo.
- In the old days...

1673
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,070
- I'll throw it now.
- Let's go!

1674
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,220
You must get three.

1675
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,370
- The lower the number, the better.
- That's right!

1676
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,990
- Ji Hyo.
- Suk Jin,

1677
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,820
if you stick your foot out,
I'm going to kick it.

1678
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,840
Okay, okay.

1679
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,260
But when that thing is in the air,
you can't help but kick it.

1680
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,950
I get why he kicked it.

1681
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,890
- Honestly, I want to kick it too.
- You should kick it now.

1682
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:04,990
But when that thing is in the air,

1683
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,160
- you can't help but kick it.
- Let's make a promise.

1684
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,590
- Hold back yourself.
- I get why he kicked it.

1685
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:08,700
- I want to kick it too.
- I want to kick it too.

1686
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,390
- Hey, Kwang Soo.
- Right? I want to kick it too.

1687
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,870
- You should stand here.
- I want to kick it too.

1688
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,070
Stay here. This is the perfect spot.

1689
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:14,070
- I won't kick it.
- I want try kicking it.

1690
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,160
- You should hold yourself.
- I'm going to kill you if you do.

1691
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,410
I didn't want to kick it at all.

1692
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,030
But when it comes
right in front of you...

1693
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,680
(Boiling with anger)

1694
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,780
He's upset.

1695
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,240
Ji Hyo, can you throw it over here?

1696
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:27,410
- Don't do it.
- We never know.

1697
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,950
- All right, let's go.
- Rambo is really upset.

1698
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,660
- Hold it back.
- We never know.

1699
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,860
- Let's see.
- Hold it back, Kwang Soo.

1700
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,320
Hold it back. Hold it back.

1701
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,050
- All right.
- Hold it back, Kwang Soo.

1702
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,260
- Oh, no.
- You'll want to kick it.

1703
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,450
- Everyone is...
- Hold it back even if you want to.

1704
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:44,760
Throw it high.

1705
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,870
(The die is cast.)

1706
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:49,510
- He missed it.
- He missed it.

1707
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,700
What's the number?

1708
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,870
(The counterattack
of the short legs)

1709
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,870
(What's the number
on the dice that Haha kicked?)

1710
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,280
We're going to use the number
you got.

1711
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,840
It's 8! Gosh, it's 8!

1712
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,490
(Oh, no. I'm dead.)

1713
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,410
- Kwang Soo, why...
- Why did you get eight?

1714
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,510
You punk.

1715
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,450
How dare you kick the dice
when you're unlucky?

1716
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,050
- How did we get eight?
- It's okay. We can make it.

1717
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,160
- What are we getting?
- It's okay.

1718
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,360
It's okay as long as
we make the same gesture.

1719
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,700
- It'll be hard.
- We'll make the same gesture.

1720
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,660
When I count to three
after saying a proverb,

1721
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,720
make a gesture...

1722
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,660
- that describes this proverb.
- Okay.

1723
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,700
Let's focus on using our upper body.

1724
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,030
And let's base it on the last word.

1725
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:28,200
All right.
Please hold after making a gesture.

1726
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,740
Eight of you need to make
the same gesture...

1727
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,070
for the first proverb.

1728
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,840
A mad dog sees everything as a club.

1729
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,140
- Focus on using our upper body.
- 1, 2, 3.

1730
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,550
(They all made the same gesture
for "club" using their upper body.)

1731
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:39,910
- Let's base it on the last word.
- 1, 2, 3.

1732
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,660
(They made a gesture
for the last word, "club".)

1733
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,760
(A mad dog
sees everything as a club.)

1734
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,220
(Four of them made the same gesture.
Will they succeed?)

1735
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,820
(Here are two mad dogs.)

1736
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,470
(We have two more here.)

1737
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,570
- Darn it. Who's holding a club?
- A club.

1738
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,240
- You should've done the mad dog.
- It's better to use "dog".

1739
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,970
- She said focus on the last word.
- Yes, we decided to do that.

1740
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:57,970
- You should've done the mad dog.
- The last word is "club".

1741
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,610
- It's "club". It's the last word.
- We decided on using the last word.

1742
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:00,680
- The last word.
- The last word?

1743
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,450
The last word!

1744
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,180
Jae Suk, how come a mad dog
looks so gentle?

1745
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,450
That's why it's mad.

1746
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,120
- Right.
- Did you see his gesture?

1747
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,450
Make sure to do the gesture
for the last word.

1748
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,220
- The last word?
- Do the gesture for the last word.

1749
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,260
You should throw it.

1750
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,120
- Okay.
- Don't you kick it.

1751
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,430
I shouldn't be looking.

1752
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,450
(I shouldn't be looking.)

1753
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,450
- I really want to kick it though.
- Me too.

1754
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:21,490
Don't kick it.

1755
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:22,490
(Will they be adults
and hold themselves back?)

1756
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,390
(The die is cast.)

1757
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:26,870
(He couldn't hold it back
and kicks it hard.)

1758
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:27,930
All right. Let's just use that.

1759
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:28,930
It didn't go out!

1760
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:30,140
No, no. Wait.

1761
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,160
What's the number?

1762
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,930
- It's 4!
- It's 4!

1763
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,180
Only four of us
need to make the same gesture.

1764
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:36,800
Okay. We got this.

1765
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,620
(If they succeed this time,
they can enter the escape room.)

1766
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,220
- Just 4 of us need to get it.
- Just 4?

1767
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,240
Once startled by a turtle,
you'll also be startled...

1768
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,340
- by a cauldron lid.
- 1, 2, 3.

1769
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,600
Wrong!

1770
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,700
- We need to do the cauldron lid.
- The cauldron lid.

1771
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,290
You're supposed
to lift the cauldron lid.

1772
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:05,290
(2 of them did the "startled" part.)

1773
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:08,500
(4 of them did
whatever they wanted.)

1774
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,000
(Doing different gestures)

1775
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:16,870
(They've been together for 11 years,
but they have zero teamwork.)

1776
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:17,980
- The cauldron lid.
- I mean...

1777
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,370
- I did the "startled" part.
- The cauldron lid.

1778
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,310
- I made a gesture for the lid.
- This is a cauldron lid.

1779
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:23,480
- What's that?
- That's just a cauldron, you punk.

1780
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,250
That's just a cauldron!

1781
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,060
Don't you grill pork belly
on the cauldron lid?

1782
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,060
Hang on. Jae Suk,
what are you describing?

1783
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,180
- What's that?
- The "startled" part.

1784
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,890
- That's too cute though.
- Why does he keep acting cute?

1785
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,750
You made this gesture
for dog earlier.

1786
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:37,600
What did you do, Ji Hyo?

1787
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,600
The turtle.

1788
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,600
- Hey, that's...
- That's not a turtle.

1789
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,430
- How is that a turtle?
- You call that a turtle?

1790
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,770
Let's just not decide which word
to use beforehand.

1791
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,600
- Let's not decide anything.
- We need to do it spontaneously.

1792
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,330
- Let's not decide anything.
- Let's not decide anything.

1793
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,870
- Just do it spontaneously!
- Okay?

1794
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,210
- Let's not decide anything.
- Just do what comes to your mind.

1795
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,580
- So Min, you should throw it.
- Okay.

1796
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,850
Don't kick it.

1797
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,350
- But I want to kick it.
- If you kick it...

1798
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,980
- Just head it.
- I want to kick it so bad.

1799
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,560
- Just head it.
- Of course you want to kick it.

1800
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,060
We got it.

1801
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,060
Let's see. Let it be three.

1802
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:05,230
It's still rolling?

1803
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:06,850
Seven.

1804
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,290
You see? That's how she is.

1805
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,330
He said, "That's how she is."

1806
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,160
- But this time...
- She's never lucky.

1807
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,600
- It could be easy this time.
- Really?

1808
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,230
- Okay.
- Here we go.

1809
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,660
- Guys, do it spontaneously.
- Let's do whatever comes to mind.

1810
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,310
There are those who run
and those who fly above them.

1811
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:21,810
(There are those who run
and those who fly above them.)

1812
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:25,580
(More than 7 people
need to make the same gesture.)

1813
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,770
1, 2, 3.

1814
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,370
- We got it!
- We got it.

1815
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,370
We got it.

1816
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:30,910
(They all seem to be doing
the same gesture.)

1817
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,080
(Will they succeed this time?)

1818
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,210
All of us are flying.

1819
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,580
You succeeded.

1820
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,230
We did it.

1821
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:38,250
We succeeded
when we didn't plan ahead.

1822
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,930
- Yes!
- We did it.

1823
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:41,230
- Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

1824
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,390
We did it.

1825
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:45,430
Since the show is Running Man,
I thought of doing a running motion.

1826
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,870
- He said it might be easy.
- That's right.

1827
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,060
We could have done a running motion.

1828
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,330
Now, you will enter
the third escape room.

1829
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,080
- We will be back.
- Okay. Let's go.

1830
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,230
- Good luck.
- Let's go.

1831
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,580
Let's go.

1832
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,540
Give us the question.

1833
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,580
- This is hard.
- Give us the question.

1834
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:01,850
Let's begin.

1835
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:04,040
Name a zombie movie each.

1836
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,410
- This is hard.
- "Dawn Of The Dead".

1837
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:06,560
"Train to Busan".

1838
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,060
"Haeundae".

1839
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,250
- "Haeundae"?
- "Haeundae"?

1840
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,330
"Haeundae".

1841
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:13,350
- "Haeundae"?
- "Haeundae"?

1842
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,620
- You fixated on Busan.
- "Haeundae"?

1843
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,620
Wasn't "Haeundae"...

1844
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,460
- a zombie movie?
- It's a movie about a tsunami.

1845
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,770
Wasn't there a single zombie?

1846
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:20,140
There is "The King".

1847
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,370
- There is "Kingdom".
- "Kingdom".

1848
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:22,730
It's "Kingdom".

1849
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:24,270
- Oh, you are right.
- It's "Kingdom".

1850
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:25,500
- We should hurry up.
- I think...

1851
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,000
we should choose the order wisely.

1852
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,140
Hey, this is...

1853
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,140
This is impossible.

1854
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,310
It's so hard.

1855
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:32,680
This is ridiculous.

1856
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,750
Try it. Keep trying.

1857
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,250
(He bounces the ball halfheartedly.)

1858
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,680
How are we supposed to get three?

1859
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:41,120
(His loud voice sounds unnatural.)

1860
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,480
They must have
a secret mission, right?

1861
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,250
- I bet they do.
- Right?

1862
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,960
Jae Suk, I asked Suk Jin...

1863
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,160
if he was up to something.

1864
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,600
- He trembled.
- Seriously.

1865
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,430
In my opinion, the setup was...

1866
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,520
- too fake.
- That's right.

1867
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,730
- Do you know why?
- It was so messy.

1868
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:55,730
Two people wouldn't have used
that many ping pong balls.

1869
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:56,870
They were all over the floor.

1870
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,600
I asked Haha too.

1871
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,830
He behaved suspiciously.

1872
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:02,330
Things are going
too smoothly, right?

1873
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,580
- That's right.
- For us anyway.

1874
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,450
1, 2...

1875
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,540
This is impossible.

1876
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,750
(They have never succeeded
the mission.)

1877
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,750
We have to make sure
we don't succeed.

1878
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,250
Let's do another mission.

1879
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:14,580
I am worried.

1880
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,330
You should give us
a mission we can do.

1881
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:18,430
(Why do they need to make sure
they don't succeed?)

1882
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:21,020
(Why are they pointing?)

1883
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,120
Can't you throw better, Suk Jin?

1884
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:25,430
- Come on.
- Number two.

1885
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:30,210
(He checks the room number
and goes straight to the laptop.)

1886
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,310
I need to solve this.

1887
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,680
(He suddenly solves a question.)

1888
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,600
(The secret behind Empty Head Land)

1889
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,580
(The members were locked in a room.)

1890
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:45,910
(The 6 geniuses succeed in escaping
1 at a time.)

1891
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,020
How many people remain?

1892
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,460
(The 2 of them became dunces.)

1893
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:54,830
(The 6 geniuses were happy
to hear about the hidden rule.)

1894
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:59,120
(The dunces got a hidden rule
as well.)

1895
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:03,870
(Now, the two of you will receive
a hidden rule.)

1896
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:07,480
(Since the other 6 members
are watching through a monitor,)

1897
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,270
(continue to act like
you are solving questions.)

1898
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,370
(Since the geniuses were watching,)

1899
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:17,540
(they had to receive
the rule in secret.)

1900
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,710
This is Empty Head Land,
a place you can escape from...

1901
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,060
only when you're smart.

1902
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,060
It's a match
between 6 geniuses and 2 dunces.

1903
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,560
The team that succeeds
to escape first will win...

1904
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,750
and the team that fails
to escape will receive a penalty.

1905
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:33,290
The 6 geniuses already know
that it's a 2-on-6 match,

1906
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,960
but they will try to fool
the 2 dunces with fake rules.

1907
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,270
Thus, you need to pretend...

1908
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:41,080
to believe the fake rules.

1909
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:44,270
Today, all of you are a team.

1910
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,850
(The received the fake rule
about all members being a team.)

1911
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:53,180
(The 2 dunces pretended
to believe it.)

1912
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:59,560
(The dunces were doing the tricking,
not the geniuses.)

1913
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,870
You can escape Empty Head Land
only through the real exit.

1914
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:08,230
The real exit is hidden
behind the dresser in the main room.

1915
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,710
(The real exit is here!)

1916
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:13,870
(The real exit)

1917
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:18,580
However, the six geniuses believe
the exit is in the escape room.

1918
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,250
They mistakenly think
they will win...

1919
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,020
if they open the fake exit
in the escape room.

1920
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,850
(The 6 geniuses are trying to open
the fake exit!)

1921
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:27,290
Thus,

1922
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:30,180
while the six geniuses are
in the escape room,

1923
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:33,500
you must open the real exit
and escape first.

1924
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,350
Got it?

1925
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:37,390
- It's here.
- It's here.

1926
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:38,930
(The 2 dunces checked
the location of the real exit.)

1927
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,500
The password has
eight digits, right?

1928
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,290
- Eight digits.
- What do we have now?

1929
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:43,330
(The password has 8 digits.)

1930
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:45,910
The password of the real exit
has eight digits.

1931
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,640
You can get the digits
by entering the eight rooms...

1932
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,140
and solving questions.

1933
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:53,870
(Enter the 8 rooms and type in
"Empty Head" for the quiz.)

1934
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:54,980
For goodness' sake.

1935
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:58,890
(That's why Suk Jin tried
to solve the question!)

1936
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:01,290
(Each room gives a digit
from the 8-digit password.)

1937
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,890
Keep throwing the balls.
I will solve the questions.

1938
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:06,660
(Only Suk Jin gets to the quizzes
to avoid suspicions.)

1939
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,140
(Suk Jin went into Room 4.)

1940
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:18,660
(He plans to get the 4th digit.)

1941
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,770
This is the answer, right?

1942
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,730
(Mottled)

1943
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,480
(It's correct!)

1944
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,350
(The 4th digit of the password
is 2.)

1945
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:32,450
(They gained the 4th digit, 2.)

1946
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:38,080
(During the second escape room...)

1947
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:40,500
Is this the answer? I think it is.

1948
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,100
(He entered Room 3...)

1949
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,330
(and gained the 3rd digit.)

1950
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,460
It's correct.

1951
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:46,120
Did you hear me? The 4th digit is 2.

1952
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,660
The 4th digit, 2.

1953
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,830
Okay.

1954
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,910
But once the six geniuses open
the fake exit,

1955
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,100
they will learn about
the real exit...

1956
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,810
and the hidden rule.

1957
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:57,680
Hurry up and escape before that.

1958
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,040
(This is the fake exit.)

1959
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:01,980
This is hard.

1960
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,480
(To keep the difficulty level up,
they failed the mission on purpose.)

1961
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,040
I don't know what,
but they have a secret.

1962
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,390
- They have a secret.
- We should get out soon.

1963
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,960
- This is hard.
- Hurry up.

1964
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,560
Here is the password.

1965
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:11,980
- Hey.
- The third one.

1966
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,230
It was nine, right?

1967
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:14,460
The third one.

1968
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,520
- Hey, hey.
- What?

1969
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:17,960
I got another one right.

1970
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,330
(They already have
3 out of 8 digits.)

1971
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:22,640
- How many seconds?
- Do we have more time?

1972
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:23,830
We don't have more time, right?

1973
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,370
(The escape room will end
in 30 seconds.)

1974
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:27,910
How many digits do you know?

1975
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:29,640
I know three. They are coming out.

1976
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,680
- Keep going.
- They are coming out.

1977
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,810
- What are you doing?
- One.

1978
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,100
(The dunces pretend to do
the mission.)

1979
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,450
How are we supposed to do this?

1980
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:36,850
(Something is strange.)

1981
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,480
- They are suspicious, right?
- Yes, they are.

1982
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,290
This is impossible.
How are we supposed to get three?

1983
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:42,120
They are really suspicious.

1984
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,930
I didn't hear the ball bounce.

1985
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,160
- The mission is too shabby.
- I know. It's strange.

1986
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,430
It's too shabby.

1987
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,000
That's what I am saying.

1988
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,430
- You and Haha are suspicious.
- What's up with you guys?

1989
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:52,660
I am serious.

1990
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,430
- This is the mission.
- What does it involve.?

1991
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:56,330
What are you guys doing in there?

1992
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:57,640
We are trying...

1993
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,410
- to open the exit.
- Why are there so many?

1994
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,210
We played around earlier.

1995
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,410
- Is that so?
- That's right.

1996
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,250
They are really suspicious.

1997
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:08,750
- Something is strange.
- Why is there water?

1998
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,020
You are really strange.

1999
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:13,180
Why are you acting?

2000
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,660
(He laughs
because he is taken aback.)

2001
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:15,810
- Seriously.
- No, no.

2002
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:17,480
- Something is strange.
- Do you know what he did?

2003
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,520
"Something is strange."

2004
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:23,330
(Serious)

2005
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,730
- But...
- It sounded like...

2006
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,000
he was saying that for no reason.

2007
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,460
But something really is strange.

2008
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:28,640
- What's strange?
- What's strange?

2009
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,660
What are you doing in there?

2010
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:31,810
- We are playing a game.
- You know that.

2011
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:32,910
Couldn't you hear us?

2012
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,040
- Couldn't you hear us?
- I could hear you.

2013
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,910
- I am sure you heard everything.
- This is a group mission.

2014
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,850
- You have a secret mission, right?
- Can't we switch once?

2015
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,580
- You have our own mission.
- Can't we switch once?

2016
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,640
What mission is it?

2017
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,680
It's to help you.

2018
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,640
Then why aren't you doing it?

2019
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,140
- Try it.
- We had to choose.

2020
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:48,160
- Try it. Try it.
- Try it then.

2021
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,480
Try it.
How are we supposed to get three?

2022
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,750
Keep trying. All right. Okay.

2023
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,480
- Why are you getting angry?
- It's not like that.

2024
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,730
- We are trying.
- We are in this together.

2025
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:55,600
- You should know our pain.
- We are a team.

2026
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,330
- We are a team.
- We are a team.

2027
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:59,500
Unless you lower
the difficulty level,

2028
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,600
we won't be able to succeed.

2029
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,040
- The difficulty level goes up.
- Jong Kook.

2030
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,330
- We are getting better.
- He is acting.

2031
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:05,730
- We got two the last time.
- He is acting.

2032
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,870
- I can tell...
- It's hard.

2033
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:08,410
- if you are lying or not.
- How?

2034
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:11,810
(He uses a new type
of lie detector.)

2035
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:12,950
What are you doing?

2036
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:14,640
Aren't you just making fun of him?

2037
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,080
You are just making fun of him.

2038
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,180
Is he lying or not?

2039
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,680
Is he lying or not?

2040
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,850
You are just making fun of him.

2041
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:21,790
- I am so annoyed.
- You are just making fun of him.

2042
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:24,120
Suk Jin was waiting patiently too.

2043
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,330
Let's go.

2044
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:28,000
Suk Jin,
your palms are really sweaty.

2045
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,120
- He is hiding something.
- We need to hurry up.

2046
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,520
Let's hurry up.

2047
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,770
It's because I am nervous.

2048
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:34,830
Why are you so nervous?

2049
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:36,930
I am usually good at this.

2050
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:38,100
Let's go.

2051
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,270
Now comes the seventh test.

2052
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:42,080
It's the strength test.

2053
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,600
With one knee bent,

2054
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,480
hold the other ankle...

2055
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,950
and stand up without using the hands
to succeed.

2056
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,140
- Anyone can do it.
- What am I supposed to do?

2057
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,390
- Stand up.
- Stand up.

2058
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:54,160
- I can't stand up.
- I can't stand up.

2059
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,310
- Can't you do it?
- How did he do it?

2060
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,180
- It's impossible.
- You can do it.

2061
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:00,520
(I bet I can do it.)

2062
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,120
How did he do it?

2063
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,330
What am I going to do?

2064
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,700
Hold on. I got a cramp in my foot.

2065
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:07,870
- What's wrong?
- I got a cramp in my foot.

2066
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,430
- Why does that happen so often?
- What's wrong with you?

2067
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:10,870
Why don't you become a cheerleader?

2068
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:13,640
Why is your foot so hot?

2069
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,830
(He suggests that she changes
her position.)

2070
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,310
I am sorry.

2071
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:17,500
Thank you.

2072
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,680
I was so surprised
that I got a cramp in my foot.

2073
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:21,350
- Like this?
- Like that?

2074
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:22,910
- You succeeded right away.
- Like that?

2075
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,120
How many people need to do it?

2076
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:25,950
You succeed if four people do it.

2077
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:27,850
- Ji Hyo, try it.
- She would be good at it.

2078
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:29,290
All of us would be good at it.

2079
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,660
- Two,
- Ji Hyo always succeeds calmly.

2080
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,520
three. For goodness' sake.

2081
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,520
(She complains calmly.)

2082
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,870
It's a game.
It's okay even if you fail.

2083
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:41,730
You don't need to be
so disappointed.

2084
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,060
Like this?

2085
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,970
- Don't put your hand on the knee.
- Where?

2086
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,970
- Don't put your hand on the knee.
- Where?

2087
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:51,380
- Hold on.
- Don't do it halfheartedly.

2088
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,250
- All right.
- Don't put your hand on the knee.

2089
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,750
- So I can't hold anything.
- No.

2090
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:58,980
- I did it.
- Of course.

2091
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:01,120
- I can't do it.
- Let's see who else can do it.

2092
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,050
- I did it.
- I knew you could do it.

2093
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,830
You passed the seventh test.

2094
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:05,980
- Okay.
- Okay.

2095
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,800
- Let's go, let's go.
- Okay.

2096
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,960
You can enter the escape room.

2097
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,470
(With 22 minutes remaining,
it may be the last escape room.)

2098
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:13,200
They are hiding something, right?

2099
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,340
They are hiding something.

2100
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,370
- Quiz, quiz.
- Let's choose the quiz.

2101
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:20,580
We will have the quiz from earlier.

2102
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,930
(The geniuses continue
to suspect them.)

2103
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,750
We don't even need to hide
at this point, right?

2104
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:26,250
They suspect us anyway.

2105
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,420
Let's do what we need to do.

2106
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:30,250
I think they are hiding something.

2107
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,680
- They definitely are.
- Really?

2108
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,120
I think they are up to something.

2109
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:34,850
That's the vibe.

2110
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:35,880
They are too awkward.

2111
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,050
And the fact
that they are suspicious of us...

2112
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,660
All right. Quiet down.

2113
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:43,830
Once all the clues come out,

2114
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,370
you will see
that we lost because you cut me off.

2115
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,300
- That's absurd.
- This is why we will lose.

2116
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,430
For goodness' sake.

2117
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:50,670
That's absurd.

2118
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,540
The mission is too simple.

2119
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:55,430
They have been bouncing
those table tennis balls for hours.

2120
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:57,050
- They are up to something.
- It makes no sense.

2121
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:58,580
- We need to work fast and escape.
- We are missing something,

2122
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,380
- so we need to work fast.
- Let's go.

2123
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:02,310
- 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th digits.
- 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th digits.

2124
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:04,250
We need the 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th,
and 8th digits.

2125
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,640
- Let's get the quizzes.
- The quizzes.

2126
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,120
(The dunces work on the quizzes
without pretense.)

2127
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,830
Each name a movie
Yoo Hai Jin starred in.

2128
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,160
Let's begin. 1, 2, 3.

2129
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,800
"The Battle: Roar to Victory".

2130
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,050
- One...
- "Tazza".

2131
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,970
- One...
- "Space Sweepers".

2132
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:18,200
- 1, 2...
- "Moss".

2133
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,500
- "Luck-Key".
- "The Pirates".

2134
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,800
(Each name a movie
Yoo Hai Jin starred in.)

2135
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,800
(They acquire the 3rd number
of the 3rd lock.)

2136
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,870
- We are done.
- It's here.

2137
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:25,760
Try the numbers.

2138
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,010
Choose One or the Other.

2139
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,840
(The unlock it.)

2140
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,930
It's the last lock.

2141
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:31,170
We need to work fast.

2142
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:34,270
Three members will play
Choose One or the Other.

2143
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,550
- Me.
- Jong Kook.

2144
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,880
Kwang Soo, Jong Kook, and Jae Suk.

2145
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,180
Which is grammatically correct?

2146
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,290
(On Monday versus At Monday)

2147
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:43,420
- The first one.
- There you go.

2148
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:44,420
- Good job.
- Jong Kook.

2149
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,720
Who was the first person
to invent gunpowder in Korea?

2150
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,200
The second one. Okay.

2151
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,050
What's the unit for 20 squids?

2152
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,420
- The first one.
- Chuk.

2153
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,560
- Okay.
- We did it.

2154
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,340
- Okay.
- The next one.

2155
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,390
The second number.

2156
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:56,500
Give us the question.

2157
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,260
- You need 3 members.
- 6.

2158
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,800
We need two more numbers.

2159
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,340
Hold on.

2160
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,630
You know,

2161
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:04,970
I am so happy that I am included
in this trio.

2162
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,670
- Let's begin.
- We don't have a choice.

2163
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:08,840
- It means I am one of the smartest.
- We don't have a choice.

2164
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:09,970
Let's begin.

2165
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,250
This is Empty Head Land,
a place you can escape from...

2166
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,510
only when you're smart.

2167
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,120
18 minutes remain.

2168
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,120
- This is driving me crazy.
- We are running out of time.

2169
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,720
We don't have much time.

2170
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,590
We need to escape this time.

2171
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:21,890
(They need at least 3 more numbers.)

2172
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,050
We need to escape.

2173
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,720
- We need to hurry.
- Number one, Opportunity cost.

2174
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,500
- Correct.
- Okay.

2175
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,870
- Get the number on the lock.
- What is it? Two?

2176
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,560
- 2?
- 6, 2.

2177
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,970
Let's keep going.

2178
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:34,100
- We need one more number.
- Choose One or the Other.

2179
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,380
We need one more number.

2180
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,210
At which country
does the sun rise first?

2181
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:40,880
I know. Number one,
the Republic of Kiribati.

2182
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,470
Correct.

2183
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:43,840
It's correct.

2184
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,450
Why are you surprised?

2185
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,980
Which country had
the first female president?

2186
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,380
Number two, Argentina.

2187
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,050
- Okay. That's good.
- Okay.

2188
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:55,090
- That's good.
- This is the last one.

2189
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:57,470
(The big chance
falls on Jae Suk's shoulders.)

2190
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:00,260
(Only one question remains
until the last lock.)

2191
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,000
(What will be the fate
of the geniuses and dunces?)

2192
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,430
From the two...

2193
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,130
What's a marketing concept
that draws people's attention...

2194
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,670
and secures customers
in the beginning?

2195
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:09,710
(Purple ocean versus Purple cow)

2196
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:10,770
Purple cow.

2197
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:11,880
The answer is...

2198
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:17,420
(If it's correct,
they'll get to open the last lock.)

2199
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:18,790
number two, Purple cow.

2200
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:20,090
- Okay!
- We did it.

2201
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:21,980
You will receive the third number.

2202
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:22,980
It's over.

2203
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,130
It's over. It's over.

2204
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,260
Let's go.

2205
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:26,330
It's over.

2206
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:27,960
Let's hurry up and escape.

2207
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:30,330
- Done.
- Hurry up.

2208
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:32,090
- Let's go.
- What?

2209
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,560
(When they open the door...)

2210
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,540
(This is the fake exit.)

2211
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,970
(A sign shows them
that it's the fake exit.)

2212
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:40,100
The fake exit.

2213
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,270
(The real exit is behind the dresser
in the main room.)

2214
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:44,140
It's behind the dresser
in the main room.

2215
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,580
"The real exit is behind the dresser
in the main room."

2216
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:49,340
- The dunces knew this.
- I see.

2217
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,140
That's why they were in the rooms.

2218
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,480
They are trying to figure out
the password now.

2219
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,480
(You can get the digits
by entering the eight rooms...)

2220
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,480
(and solving questions.)

2221
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,290
This explains
their suspicious behaviors.

2222
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,980
That's why they were in the rooms.

2223
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,050
"Type in "Empty Head" on the laptop
and solve the questions."

2224
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:01,500
(Type in "Empty Head" on the laptop
and solve the questions.)

2225
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,800
- Let's go.
- Do we need to go now?

2226
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,890
Hurry up. We need to escape.

2227
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,760
We don't have much time.

2228
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,430
- I have the answer.
- The quizzes are hard.

2229
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:11,010
Okay.

2230
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:12,010
(It's correct. The 6th digit is 0.)

2231
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:13,370
Hurry up.

2232
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:14,600
(They have four digits.)

2233
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,670
The first digit.

2234
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:17,170
(They are leading.)

2235
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:19,250
(The geniuses enter.)

2236
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,550
- What are you up to?
- What were you doing?

2237
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,950
Okay.

2238
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:25,310
(The dunces got caught
while solving quizzes.)

2239
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:26,620
- It's a quiz.
- Why are you solving a quiz?

2240
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:27,810
What is that?

2241
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,510
Are you done?

2242
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,090
It's a number game.

2243
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:32,090
(The air turns frigid.)

2244
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:33,760
Gosh, this is... What is this?

2245
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,090
What is this?

2246
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,200
(Wary)

2247
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,220
- What is this?
- You used the chat room!

2248
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,300
What is this?

2249
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,560
(They finally see
the effort the dunces made.)

2250
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,170
You used the chat room.

2251
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,430
They were doing this
while we solved the questions.

2252
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,670
(They find the real exit
as it said on the sign.)

2253
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:50,800
Jae Suk!

2254
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,600
There is a door.

2255
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,140
(The geniuses found everything.)

2256
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,310
(The dunces become
more pressed for time.)

2257
01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:58,680
- Is there a lock?
- There is a lock.

2258
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,050
Here.

2259
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:01,380
(They find the real exit
with the 8-digit password.)

2260
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,920
There is a lock.

2261
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,260
(The geniuses need to figure out
all 8 digits.)

2262
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:05,480
Where should we begin?

2263
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:07,850
They figured it out.

2264
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,890
This is what they were doing.

2265
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:13,000
(The numbers the geniuses acquired)

2266
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,560
(The numbers the dunces acquired)

2267
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,540
(What's a word that was coined
by Thomas More...)

2268
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:22,410
(which means an ideal country
that doesn't exist in real life?)

2269
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:24,640
(Utopia)

2270
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,250
Okay.

2271
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,380
Is this the answer?

2272
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:29,810
Okay.

2273
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:32,090
Hurry up, Suk Jin. Hurry up.

2274
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:33,790
This is driving me crazy.

2275
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,550
I got it!

2276
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:38,090
Here is the answer.

2277
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,720
The fourth number.

2278
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:41,350
The fourth number.

2279
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,090
This is Empty Head Land,
a place you can escape from...

2280
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,090
only when you're smart.

2281
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:46,300
- 7 minutes remain.
- 7 minutes?

2282
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,760
Hurry up, Suk Jin. Hurry up.

2283
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,340
- Hold on.
- Hurry up.

2284
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:52,510
(Team Geniuses acquired 4 numbers.)

2285
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:55,010
(Team Dunces have 5 numbers.)

2286
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:56,340
We don't have much time.

2287
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:58,270
Get the question right.
Get the question right.

2288
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:00,250
This is driving me crazy.

2289
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,640
Other rooms...

2290
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:03,120
Hurry up.

2291
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,550
- The board.
- It's a new question.

2292
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:05,680
Is this right, So Min?

2293
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,790
Did you get it right?

2294
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,420
This is hard.

2295
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,020
(After wandering for a short while,
he enters a room.)

2296
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,500
(Then he stares at the sign.)

2297
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:19,000
(Then he checks the sign
at the fake exit.)

2298
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:22,000
(This is the fake exit.)

2299
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,170
(The real exit is behind the dresser
in the main room.)

2300
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:24,930
"Behind the dresser
in the main room"?

2301
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,910
(He walks back out
with a surprised look on his face.)

2302
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,510
1, 5, 7, 8.

2303
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,580
- 7 minutes remain.
- 1, 5, 7, 8.

2304
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,950
- Hey.
- We don't have much time. Hurry up.

2305
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,620
What is going on?

2306
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:38,790
It's five, right?

2307
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:41,310
(He checks all the signs
that are scattered in the place.)

2308
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:42,550
Jae Suk, we are going to lose.

2309
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:46,050
(He studies the exit
from different angles.)

2310
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:47,090
This is Empty Head Land,
a place you can escape from...

2311
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:49,330
only when you're smart.
Three minutes remain.

2312
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,870
(Knocking)

2313
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:55,800
Why are you knocking?

2314
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,540
What?

2315
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:01,470
You knocked.

2316
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,100
(When he knocked,)

2317
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,770
(the entire wall opened.)

2318
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:06,840
What?

2319
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,880
You knocked.

2320
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,810
- What?
- What?

2321
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:16,380
(What is going on?)

2322
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,260
- What?
- What?

2323
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,220
Did it open when you knocked?

2324
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,260
(Everyone is flustered for real.)

2325
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,350
- What?
- What?

2326
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,470
What happened?

2327
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,420
You knocked.

2328
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:30,090
(Jae Suk can't even react
because he is flustered.)

2329
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:33,470
(Only Jae Suk figured out
the secret of the race.)

2330
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,170
We need to go into the room
and solve some questions.

2331
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,550
(There were too many signs
around the place.)

2332
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:38,880
This is Empty Head Land,
a place you can escape from...

2333
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,550
only when you're smart.
Seven minutes remain.

2334
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,510
(Jae Suk studied the sign again.)

2335
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:48,660
(This is Empty Head Land,
a place you can escape from...)

2336
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,290
(only when you're smart.)

2337
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,880
(Then he noticed
the underlined part.)

2338
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,260
It's underlined.

2339
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:58,470
("Smart" is a homophone
for "Knock" in Korean.)

2340
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:02,130
(A place you can escape from
only when you knock)

2341
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,710
(The sentence was repeated
too many times from the opening.)

2342
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:10,950
(A place you can escape from
only when you're smart)

2343
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:15,950
(Jae Suk became suspicious
during the countdown.)

2344
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,480
(He knocked on the wall
with uncertainty.)

2345
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:24,020
(There were two ways to escape.)

2346
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:28,720
(You can escape by opening the lock
with the password.)

2347
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,430
(But you can also escape
by knocking.)

2348
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:37,430
- Hey!
- What happened?

2349
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:38,910
- I got goosebumps.
- Was it about knocking?

2350
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:40,370
I got goosebumps.
What just happened?

2351
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:41,670
Was it about knocking?

2352
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:43,210
I got goosebumps.

2353
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:45,970
So you could escape
by knocking on the door?

2354
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:47,220
- I got goosebumps.
- Is it over?

2355
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:48,310
But the questions...

2356
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:49,640
Is it over?

2357
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,790
- I got goosebumps.
- This is ridiculous.

2358
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:52,920
Did it open because he knocked?

2359
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,310
This is ridiculous.

2360
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:55,380
(The dunces were slow-witted too.)

2361
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,850
This is Empty Head Land,
a place you can escape from...

2362
01:17:56,850 --> 01:17:58,090
only when you're smart.

2363
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,050
("Smart" is a homophone
for "Knock" in Korean.)

2364
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,760
- We just needed to knock?
- It was "Knock", not "Smart".

2365
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,130
It was "Knock", not "Smart"?

2366
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:05,390
I just knocked without any thoughts.

2367
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,000
It was pointless to solve
the questions.

2368
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,870
It was pointless.

2369
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,170
My face suddenly turned red.

2370
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:11,730
I just got ridiculed.

2371
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:13,630
- What is this?
- What is this?

2372
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:16,380
- Team Geniuses with Jae Suk won.
- What is this?

2373
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,380
It was about knocking.

2374
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,380
(They have a ceremony
at the real exit.)

2375
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:19,710
Is that 3,000 dollars?

2376
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,120
- No way.
- Will we really get it?

2377
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,140
(The 6 geniuses will get
the prize money and medals.)

2378
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:24,640
Since this morning,
I said at least 20 times...

2379
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,880
that you can escape only
if you're smart or if you knock.

2380
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,260
I thought it meant "Smart".

2381
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,460
(Thanks to Jae Suk,
it didn't end as a quiz match.)

2382
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,130
I didn't think it meant "Knock".

2383
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,260
So the password
wouldn't have worked?

2384
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:35,760
It would have worked.

2385
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,420
That was one way to open the door.

2386
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:38,800
- You could open it by knocking.
- That's right.

2387
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,370
Would it have opened
if we knocked during the opening?

2388
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:43,870
- It would have opened.
- He repeated the line many times.

2389
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:46,510
Then the part was underlined
on the signs.

2390
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:47,880
- Really?
- So I thought, "No way."

2391
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,300
Since he repeated the line
many times,

2392
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:51,010
I knocked to check.

2393
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:52,970
He is the best
when it comes to tricks.

2394
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,450
When I walked over,
he was doing something to the door.

2395
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:58,510
He knocked on the door...

2396
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:00,290
and I thought,
"He is being an idiot."

2397
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:01,550
- Seriously.
- Then the door opened.

2398
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:03,480
"Look at him knocking.
What an idiot!"

2399
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,050
But the wall opened up.

2400
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,850
I didn't do it with certainty.

2401
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:08,760
You got many questions right.

2402
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,960
That's right.

2403
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,560
- That's right.
- Good job.

2404
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,700
You will receive cash
and a gold medal.

2405
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:17,230
Haha and Suk Jin will receive
the penalty.

2406
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:19,170
Here is the penalty.

2407
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:21,300
Recently, on the web,

2408
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,730
Se Chan's Empty Head meme
has become popular.

2409
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:25,910
Make a new Empty Head meme
that will become just as popular.

2410
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:26,970
Empty Head!

2411
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:29,380
Use wigs and makeup
to dress up as fools...

2412
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:32,980
and try the gesture
in many different versions.

2413
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,850
Did I become a popular meme?

2414
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,790
Gosh, I had no idea.

2415
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:40,800
Gosh, I hope this episode
won't be aired.

2416
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,850
This is really upsetting.

2417
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,170
(The two fathers are dressing up
like fools.)

2418
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,060
I don't want my kids
to watch this episode.

2419
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:48,500
Gosh, I can't make a foolish face.

2420
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,430
Stand here and look at the camera.

2421
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:52,230
This is what Se Chan did.

2422
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:53,560
But you can try
many different gestures.

2423
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,770
Let's do this separately.

2424
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,340
(New Empty Head Candidate 1)

2425
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,080
Empty Head.

2426
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:02,050
Go ahead.

2427
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,420
You don't know how to play a fool.

2428
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:04,590
I'm not good at this.

2429
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,220
You should smile to play a fool.

2430
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,680
(New Empty Head Candidate 2)

2431
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,680
Empty Head.

2432
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,260
(New Empty Head Candidate 2)

2433
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:13,420
Empty Head.

2434
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:15,800
Come here.

2435
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,050
(The middle-aged empty heads
are trying it together.)

2436
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:18,330
Empty Head.

2437
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,760
Empty Head.

2438
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:23,730
(They try hard to make a new meme
even though it seems useless.)

2439
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:25,540
Empty Head.

2440
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,870
(They try hard to make a new meme
even though it seems useless.)

2441
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,630
- It's done.
- My gosh.

2442
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:32,970
(Laughing)

2443
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,970
(He bears the shame
and runs the meme factory.)

2444
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:37,250
Empty Head.

2445
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,790
(Ha Dong Hoon, a dad of three kids
finally came to terms with himself.)

2446
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:40,850
Empty Head.

2447
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:42,260
(Ha Dong Hoon, a dad of three kids
finally came to terms with himself.)

2448
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,760
Gosh, I'm so upset.

2449
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,520
This is so upsetting. Darn it.

2450
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,350
I've worked so hard
to build a smart image.

2451
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:51,260
Hyun Woo’s Dad and Dream's Dad,
thank you so much.

2452
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:53,670
Turn off the TV.
Otherwise, you'll become like me.

2453
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:55,970
(Sleep is...)

2454
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:58,430
(a time just for myself
and for recharging my batteries.)

2455
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,130
(I want to meet a man
who respects me.)

2456
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,230
(The sleepyhead client, Song Ji Hyo)

2457
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:04,380
(I like to read.)

2458
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,950
(And I listen to music a lot.)

2459
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:08,670
(Is there anyone who will enjoy...)

2460
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:09,720
(those things with me?)

2461
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,050
(The client with many hobbies,
Jeon So Min)

2462
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:12,750
The two clients are
not easy to deal with.

2463
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,480
(The CEOs are here
to deal with the picky clients.)

2464
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,720
(CEO of Married Corporation,
Lee Yong Jin)

2465
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,720
(CEO of Single Dot-com,
Sung Si Kyung)

2466
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:19,420
(They start exploring the clients.)

2467
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,000
(A man who feels sorry.)

2468
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,890
(I'm sorry)

2469
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,970
(The CEOs seem somewhat peculiar.)

2470
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:27,560
(He's my type.)

2471
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:32,260
(Won Bin who belches out moths)

2472
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,430
(Won Bin is always good,
no matter what.)

2473
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:36,730
(Lee Kwang Soo
who is potty trained well)

2474
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:38,770
(They don't want to get married.)

2475
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,750
My goodness.

2476
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:43,140
(They have comprehensive
ideal types for the clients.)

2477
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,790
(Will the clients be able to find
their ideal types?)

2478
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:47,010
All men are the same.

2479
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,260
(We Will Find Spring For You)
