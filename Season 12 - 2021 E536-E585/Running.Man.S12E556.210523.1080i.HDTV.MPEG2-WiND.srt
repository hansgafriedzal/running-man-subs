1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,800
(One sunny day with a blue sky)

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,100
(The three members show up
dressed like office workers.)

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,380
The weather is nice.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,740
- It's really good.
- This place is nice.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,510
- Are you today's guest singer?
- No.

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,150
Go this way. This is where we work.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,860
- A guest singer should...
- Why are you laughing?

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,160
Why do you think...

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,750
an office worker should
be dressed like this?

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,290
I'm having a gathering
with my co-workers here.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,750
- I'm an office worker too.
- Are you...

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,090
- the manager of this restaurant?
- Come on, Assistant Manager Ha.

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,230
- Assistant Manager Ha.
- The shop manager.

15
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,830
- Are you the manager here?
- I'm your co-worker.

16
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,400
I'm Chief Ji.

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
- Chief Ji?
- Yes.

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,430
- Do you have a sore throat?
- No.

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,500
It's fashion.
Why are you being like this?

20
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,900
Did you bleach
the back of your pants?

21
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,040
No.

22
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,470
You keep making jokes.

23
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,540
You keep making fun of his costume.

24
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,580
- Like ten jokes.
- I should keep being like this...

25
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,610
- Excuse me.
- to make him pull himself together.

26
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,010
- He's...
- I'm in my right mind now.

27
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,750
so into young fashion trends
these days.

28
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,530
It's not like that.
How would I bleach...

29
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,550
the back of my pants like this?

30
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,500
They're coming. We're here.

31
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,790
- Hey.
- Hello.

32
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,620
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

33
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,930
Guys, we have
something funny to show you.

34
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,190
- My goodness.
- He's a guest singer.

35
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,190
(They all burst
into laughter right away.)

36
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,360
- He's our guest singer.
- Think outside the box.

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,570
Sing a song for us.

38
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,040
You should see outside the box.

39
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,830
This is what Tae Jin Ah would wear.

40
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,550
- No.
- Suk Jin, why...

41
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,550
I'm too frustrated
to work with them.

42
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,320
- I'm really frustrated too.
- Why?

43
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,190
When our crew members tell you
to dress like an office worker,

44
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,190
you should dress accordingly.

45
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,460
They didn't tell me though.

46
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,290
- What?
- They told my stylist.

47
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,290
- Why are you upset?
- Don't yell at us.

48
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,930
Don't be so worked up
from the opening.

49
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,250
- Why are you upset?
- They talked to my stylist.

50
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,630
We're just talking. Don't be upset.

51
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,990
- I'm not upset.
- You're yelling.

52
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,190
- I'm not.
- We can't say anything.

53
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,800
We're so daunted
that we can't say anything.

54
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Why are you so upset?

55
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,500
- It feels suffocating.
- I'm not upset.

56
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,460
Why are you putting your arms
around my shoulders?

57
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,470
He has no one...

58
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,710
- He has no one to count on.
- I need help.

59
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,470
- I need your help.
- Suk Jin.

60
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,270
He wants you to take his side.

61
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,940
- Good.
- Are you fighting again?

62
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,410
- I'm not fighting.
- Why do you keep fighting?

63
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,550
As you can see
from your employee cards,

64
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,290
you are employees...

65
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,790
of Married Corporation
and Single Dot-com.

66
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,290
We work at matchmaking companies.

67
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,020
Do I work with Suk Jin
at the same company?

68
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,520
This is crazy.

69
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,800
(For those who look for
their lifelong partner,)

70
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,300
(there are two
matchmaking companies.)

71
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,400
You guys are employees,
and your CEOs are on their way.

72
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,900
- Really?
- Really?

73
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,610
(And the 2 CEOs are coming
to meet them.)

74
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,180
(Who are the CEOs
in the neat suits?)

75
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,800
(The car is pulling over
with the two CEOs.)

76
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,840
Is someone coming?

77
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,020
Someone's here.

78
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,420
- What is this car?
- What?

79
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,180
- I bet it belongs to a top star.
- What?

80
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,580
- That looks fancy.
- Are they here?

81
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,080
The top star is getting off.

82
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,260
- It has a sleek design.
- Gosh, Kwang Soo.

83
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,180
- Who is he?
- He's...

84
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,390
(What? He is...)

85
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,120
Isn't that Yong Jin?

86
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,270
- Si Kyung?
- It's Si Kyung.

87
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,460
Hey, Si Kyung.

88
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,590
Yong Jin isn't a star.

89
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,930
- Hey, what is Si Kyung doing here?
- He's Sung Ballad.

90
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,930
What are Yong Jin
and Si Kyung doing here?

91
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,800
(His new album was released
after 10 years.)

92
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,810
(Sung Ballad is back with his sweet
dance song, "I Love U.")

93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
What is Si Kyung doing here?

94
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,870
- Si Kyung?
- Yong Jin is Petty.

95
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,080
Hey. Isn't Yong Jin a secretary?

96
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,710
He's a petty star.

97
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,890
He's a secretary.

98
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,620
- He should get married himself.
- It's Sung Ballad.

99
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,990
- Hello.
- It's Si Kyung and his secretary.

100
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,020
- He brought his secretary?
- Why were you in the car for stars?

101
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,300
- It's not like that.
- Why would a secretary...

102
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
I was behind the cameras,
but you attacked me eight times.

103
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,490
- Of course.
- We have to.

104
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,830
- I was even behind the camera.
- He says we attacked him.

105
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,900
- Gosh, Si Kyung is...
- Si Kyung.

106
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,180
- Hey, Si Kyung.
- My gosh.

107
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,710
Yong Jin.

108
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,110
How have you been?

109
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,010
- Hey, Yong Jin.
- Yong Jin.

110
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,370
Hello.

111
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,770
- Hey.
- I heard...

112
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,180
Si Kyung is the CEO
of Single Dot-com.

113
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,450
- Yes. And Married Corporation.
- You're from Married Corporation.

114
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,990
Yong Jin is married.
I can't believe this.

115
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,460
Are you the CEOs?

116
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,760
I married 5,000 couples last month.

117
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,080
- 5,000 couples?
- Yes.

118
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,590
Then why are you still single?

119
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,900
You married 5,000 couples,

120
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,670
- but why are you single?
- Seriously, why is he single?

121
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,490
I'm just waiting.

122
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,530
Waiting for what?

123
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,240
Well, I'm...

124
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,560
the CEO of Married Corporation,
Lee Yong Jin.

125
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,370
Nice to meet you.

126
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,300
He looks shrewd.

127
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,050
I bet you've seen
the advertisement on buses.

128
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,680
Something Duo.

129
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,050
They are below us.

130
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,810
Our company is bigger than that.

131
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,180
Our market capitalization is
about 500,000 dollars higher.

132
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,490
Market capitalization?

133
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,650
The market capitalization
of only 500,000 dollars?

134
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,890
I mean we're rivals.

135
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,930
I mean we are rivals.

136
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,260
Do you even know
what market capitalization is?

137
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,020
Well... Isn't that money?

138
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,370
He doesn't know anything.

139
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,640
Isn't Duo the company name?

140
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,000
- Hey.
- Just let it go.

141
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,100
- He doesn't know anything.
- Dancing Duo.

142
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,900
- He's just bluffing.
- Dancing Duo.

143
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,310
- It's like saying Samsung.
- Just say "Du something."

144
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,010
- Du something.
- I see.

145
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,770
He meant Dancing Duo.

146
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,340
- I see.
- Sure.

147
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,480
We haven't met Si Kyung
for a long time.

148
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,890
Is this your first time
on Running Man?

149
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,780
- No, it's his second time.
- I was here before.

150
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,720
By the way,
even the CEO dressed like this...

151
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,720
- Button up your shirt.
- Take your hands out.

152
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,520
You're not wearing a belt.

153
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,020
- He's the real CEO.
- Are you a gangster?

154
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,500
Who wears a belt these days?

155
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,520
- What?
- Why would I wear a belt?

156
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,660
He works in the field.

157
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,530
- Even the CEO...
- He works in the field.

158
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,090
What does he do in the field?

159
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,310
We can see people dressed like him
in political campaigns.

160
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,770
Are you a political gangster?

161
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,170
(Are you a political gangster?)

162
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,670
My gosh.

163
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,040
- We need an employee like me.
- What's that?

164
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,450
The CEOs of the two companies...

165
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,650
used to be the MCs
of relationship counseling TV shows.

166
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,280
- Oh, really?
- During the race today,

167
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,350
the CEOs can change
the positions of their employees...

168
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,760
using the position stickers
whenever they want.

169
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,790
- We have positions.
- I like stuff like this.

170
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,590
The CEOs may put the stickers
on each employee now.

171
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,030
- Then...
- My position?

172
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,400
When I watch a drama or a movie,
Lee Geung Young always plays...

173
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,370
the Senior Managing Director.

174
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,030
You're his age, aren't you?

175
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,170
No, I'm not.

176
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,310
They're friends from school.

177
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,580
He's about his age.

178
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,670
- Hey.
- Right.

179
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,820
- He's a lot older than me.
- They are similar in age.

180
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,880
"Move ahead with it."

181
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,520
First, the elite member should be...

182
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,280
- the Senior Managing Director.
- Right.

183
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,820
He's not an elite.

184
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,980
He didn't make his way up
through his connections.

185
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,890
I bet he did through his ability.

186
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,690
- You should be Manager.
- Manager?

187
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,790
I think that's perfect for you.

188
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,650
- Manager Ha sounds about right.
- I wanted to be an executive.

189
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,660
Just do it.

190
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,790
Think of Muhan Company.
You got promoted.

191
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,400
- What was your position?
- Back then,

192
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,940
you were just an employee.

193
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,570
That was a long time ago.

194
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,310
He says that again.

195
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,310
He's a manager now.

196
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,400
Haha was trying to do this.

197
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,670
He was doing this.
He didn't mean to shake hands.

198
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,470
He's not playing a game with you.
It's this hand gesture.

199
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,120
Why would you hold his hand?

200
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,670
Myung Soo keeps calling me.

201
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,020
He asks what is happening to us.

202
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,190
He feels nervous
since "How Do You Play?" is popular.

203
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,850
- The positions can change.
- I'm a manager. Okay.

204
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,000
You are supposed to wear a tie
with your shirt.

205
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
I just love fashion.

206
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,160
The jacket makes you
look like an intern.

207
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,000
Is this a fashion company?

208
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,770
- Hey, you...
- Is Suk Jin an intern?

209
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,010
There's a movie called
"The Intern," isn't there?

210
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,600
It features an old man.

211
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,900
It features a grandpa.

212
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,470
A grandpa works as an intern.

213
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,100
You're Robert De Niro.

214
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,540
- I'm not a grandpa.
- I like the movie.

215
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,710
Robert De Niro.

216
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,270
- But this is... Gosh.
- Old soldiers never die.

217
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,890
It's all right.
You can give us anything.

218
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,910
- You think?
- Anything would work.

219
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,910
- It's fun to go all the way up.
- Sure.

220
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,890
- It's fun to succeed.
- Give him the intern position.

221
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,980
- I'll...
- Gosh.

222
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,260
Assistant Manager?
It's a high position, right?

223
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,000
No, it's not high.

224
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,630
- It's right above employees.
- Really?

225
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,500
But Assistant Manager sounds
right for him.

226
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,200
- I agree.
- He's reckless, but he works hard.

227
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,030
He just can't get promoted.

228
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,030
Assistant Manager Lee.

229
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,100
- Kwang Soo, it's a good thing.
- Is it good?

230
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,400
He has the hairstyle of a manager.

231
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,100
- Gosh.
- Is Se Chan higher than me?

232
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,450
What's wrong with you?

233
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,770
- Why?
- It suits you.

234
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,620
You said we'd go up from the bottom.

235
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,390
You should use honorifics
when you speak to me, okay?

236
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,580
- It's not like that.
- Stay quiet. Use honorifics.

237
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,460
- Hey, he's an intern.
- He's an intern.

238
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,120
- An intern?
- Hey, he's an intern.

239
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,350
(Intern Kim Jong Kook)

240
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,720
An intern?

241
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,960
- Hey, you.
- Look at you.

242
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,000
- Come here.
- Be nice.

243
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,290
Now that I'm an intern,

244
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,730
I can just knock you down and quit.

245
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,290
Gosh, Jong Kook.

246
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,600
- Jong Kook, please.
- I'm just an intern.

247
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,030
You're right about that.

248
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,270
You should get promoted.

249
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,640
He's not dressed
like a full-time employee yet.

250
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,750
Today, you have two clients...

251
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,820
looking for their ideal types,
Song Ji Hyo and Jeon So Min.

252
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,980
(They will look for Ji Hyo
and So Min's ideal types.)

253
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,190
- I get it.
- Okay.

254
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,320
- They are our clients.
- I get it.

255
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,780
(Client Song Ji Hyo)

256
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,370
Sleep is a time just for myself
and for recharging my batteries.

257
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,790
(Sleep is a time just for myself
and for recharging my batteries.)

258
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,270
I had a good sleep.

259
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,290
(I had a good sleep.)

260
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,100
I'm feeling refreshed
after a good sleep.

261
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,400
(I'm feeling refreshed
after a good sleep.)

262
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,510
My ideal type?

263
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,470
My ideal type is... Well...

264
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,220
The shoot has begun.

265
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,720
We're starting now, Ji Hyo.

266
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,890
I want to meet a man who respects
and understands my lifestyle.

267
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,920
(I want to meet a man who respects
and understands my lifestyle.)

268
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,000
That's all I'm asking for.

269
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,020
(That's all I'm asking for.)

270
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,920
I like to read.

271
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,370
(I like to read.)

272
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,900
And I listen to music a lot.

273
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740
What I like to listen to...

274
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,240
is exciting music.

275
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,170
And...

276
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,310
I'm always writing when I'm alone.

277
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,910
I want a man who'll read my writing
and relate to them.

278
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,890
They say beautiful people
like flowers.

279
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,420
I like flowers too.

280
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,100
I'm looking for a man
who will enjoy those things with me.

281
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,100
Is there anyone...

282
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,160
who can do that?

283
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,430
(The two extraordinary clients
are looking for their soulmates.)

284
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,940
It will be important
for both companies...

285
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,300
to find out what the clients like.

286
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,440
The two clients are not easy
to deal with.

287
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,570
They are polar opposites.

288
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,120
They are quite unusual.

289
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,250
They are completely different.

290
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,620
The two clients will rate...

291
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,090
their level of satisfaction
after each mission.

292
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,360
And they will give points
to the company...

293
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,260
that offered better service.

294
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,500
- It will be hard.
- The company with higher points...

295
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,370
will be the winner.

296
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,740
And the three employees
in the highest positions...

297
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,900
will get 3.75g of gold each.

298
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,610
- It's about 10g in total.
- Really?

299
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,640
10g of gold?

300
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,880
- My gosh.
- 10g of gold...

301
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,530
- It's quite good.
- It's not bad.

302
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,140
- All right.
- So...

303
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,770
you will need to work hard...

304
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,650
- to get on your boss's good side.
- Okay.

305
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,350
We will move to the next venue
and start the mission.

306
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,180
(Which company will get
10g of gold after the race?)

307
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,910
Gosh, the setting is a little...

308
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,550
This is like "Hot Brothers."

309
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,020
(The employees are gathered
in the next venue for the mission.)

310
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,150
What is this?

311
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,190
- It's like an avatar.
- Everyone.

312
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,560
Before we start the mission,

313
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,160
you will play Avatar Date...

314
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,290
to find out
the two clients' tastes...

315
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,640
and evaluate
the two companies' competence.

316
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,840
That sounds fun.

317
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,900
- We haven't done this for long.
- It will be fun.

318
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,270
Is this serious?

319
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,750
- Are we doing this seriously?
- Well...

320
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,620
(The two clients are waiting
in a fancy restaurant.)

321
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,650
Well...

322
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,040
(The two clients are waiting
in a fancy restaurant.)

323
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,650
Do people usually eat at restaurants
like this?

324
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,450
Sure, on a blind date.

325
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,520
- Really?
- Yes.

326
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,280
I've never been
on a blind date before.

327
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,450
So what do people usually talk about
on a blind date?

328
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,150
- What do you talk about?
- First, they usually...

329
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,560
I usually ask
about his blood type...

330
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,840
and about food,
movies, or music that he likes.

331
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,470
That's what I ask.

332
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,110
As soon as I sat here,

333
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,140
I wanted to go home.

334
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,400
- You've never done this before?
- No.

335
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,610
(The two clients are
polar opposites.)

336
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,720
- Not even once?
- No.

337
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,250
It feels so uncomfortable...

338
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,620
to be on a date like this.

339
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,250
We're here to get
to know each other.

340
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,450
- Right.
- That's the purpose.

341
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,360
The CEOs of each company...

342
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,520
who are not well-acquainted
with the clients,

343
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,280
Sung Si Kyung and Lee Yong Jin...

344
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,320
will go on the virtual date
with Ji Hyo and So Min...

345
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,000
getting orders from the members
through the radio.

346
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,130
It's a double date.

347
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,000
Each company will try
many different things...

348
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,970
and check the clients' responses.

349
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,840
And they will figure out
their ideal types.

350
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,110
After the date,
the clients will rate...

351
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,010
- the level of their satisfaction.
- That's the good part.

352
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,540
And the team with a higher score
will get points.

353
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,980
But our team is...

354
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,440
Si Kyung is single,

355
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,590
but our CEO is married.

356
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,950
We're in a disadvantageous position.

357
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,950
Why do you think so?

358
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,410
He's just an avatar.

359
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,780
It doesn't matter.

360
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,920
His looks are a lot worse
than our CEO's anyway.

361
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,760
- Excuse me, Employee Yang.
- Yes.

362
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,920
What do you mean
his looks are worse?

363
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,100
He's not an employee.
He's a manager.

364
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,060
- I'm a manager.
- What?

365
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,770
- I'm a senior managing director.
- Senior Managing Director Yu.

366
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,190
We work at different companies!

367
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,930
(He just realizes that
he doesn't need to bow to him.)

368
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,900
- I shouldn't have bowed to him.
- Mister.

369
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,030
Hey, mister.

370
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,510
- Hey.
- Hey, Intern.

371
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,800
- Sit down.
- Don't talk down to me.

372
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,440
- You're just an intern.
- How could you...

373
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,220
- How dare you talk down to me?
- Hey.

374
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,520
You're not even my colleague.

375
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,490
- Get your hands out of your pocket.
- Excuse me.

376
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,620
He's a grandpa.

377
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,020
Be polite.

378
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,860
He can't beat us
using his brainpower,

379
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,020
so he's using his strength.

380
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,180
I can't use my brainpower,
but I can use my physical power.

381
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,630
Show him.

382
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,020
He's serious.

383
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,320
Why are you being so edgy?

384
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,770
He used to be a political gangster.

385
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,430
A political gangster?

386
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,270
That's what he used to do.

387
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,010
He was in the political world.

388
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,530
He was a political gangster.

389
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,070
I think it'll be important
to form a connection.

390
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,540
It's like, "I feel the same way."

391
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,770
He does sound like a CEO.

392
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,120
Mr. Lee, you know what?

393
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,780
You should do this right.

394
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,650
- You're blocking the camera.
- Right.

395
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,260
- We don't need it.
- Move over.

396
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,280
- Don't worry about the camera.
- Just move over.

397
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,490
He's just an intern,
so he can't even check the cameras.

398
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,650
Mr. Lee, let me talk.

399
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,690
- I'm sorry,
- Mr. Lee.

400
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,190
but get us a steak.

401
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,020
I'm not a waiter,
Senior Managing Director Yu.

402
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,030
- I want a steak.
- It's not like that.

403
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,140
I'm your employee.

404
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,270
Our CEO is married,

405
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,430
so he has some dating experience.

406
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,530
- Your wife's name Bo A, right?
- Yes, but...

407
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,900
Are you just blurting it out? Yes.

408
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
(Surprised)

409
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,110
- He knows everything.
- Right. She's Bo A.

410
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,440
His wife is Na Kyung Eun,
and his wife is Ryu Su Jung.

411
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,620
My wife is Kim Go Eun.

412
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,180
- His wife is Kim Go Eun.
- Right.

413
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,720
And his wife is Yoon Eun Hye.

414
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,310
(And his wife is Yoon Eun Hye.)

415
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,390
Not anymore.

416
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,720
(It's a name from his memory
from 15 years ago.)

417
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,990
That was so sudden.

418
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,180
My gosh.

419
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,520
She's not your wife anymore.

420
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,100
Out of nowhere...

421
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,160
It was silent for half a second.

422
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,100
That was a long time ago.

423
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,640
(My goodness.)

424
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,270
- Not anymore.
- It's been years.

425
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,430
(Closing his ears)

426
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,840
- "Of course."
- That's right.

427
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,070
The CEOs should leave now.

428
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,400
And you'll see the date
on the monitor.

429
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,070
Good luck, Mr. Lee.

430
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,510
- Why am I feeling nervous?
- Good luck.

431
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,770
You don't need to feel nervous.

432
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,350
- Just be comfortable.
- Mr. Sung.

433
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,940
We will make you a gentleman.

434
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,520
- You don't have to worry.
- Okay.

435
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,050
- I'll do the basic things my way.
- Okay.

436
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,230
The rest of you should wear
the in-ear earphones...

437
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,550
- and talk through the radio.
- Okay.

438
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,020
(The two avatars come out
and put on the earphones.)

439
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,260
This is so fun.

440
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,400
The game might end quickly.

441
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,840
In So Min's case,

442
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,970
once she finds a guy she likes,

443
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,110
she only cares about him.

444
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,270
- Right.
- That's true.

445
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,930
- The beginning part is important.
- Right.

446
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,640
Yong Jin is in trouble.

447
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,540
So Min won't care about him.

448
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,150
But Mr. Lee is...

449
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,250
I went on some group dates
with him before.

450
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,540
- He's good.
- He's popular with girls.

451
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,220
- Girls like him a lot.
- Mr. Lee is popular.

452
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,780
He's good. He's funny and witty.

453
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,910
He was very popular.

454
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,020
He is still popular.

455
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,090
And he looks friendly.

456
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,130
- He's easy to grow attached to.
- Exactly.

457
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,760
(How will the blind date go with
Sung Ballad and Popular Yong Jin?)

458
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,060
(Surprised)

459
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

460
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,530
Hello.

461
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,400
(Which avatar will captivate
the clients' hearts?)

462
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,530
Where should we sit?

463
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

464
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,650
Hello.

465
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,800
- Yes.
- Hello.

466
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,150
- Hello.
- Please have a seat.

467
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,380
He looks very confident.

468
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,520
- Look at his smile.
- Who's the petty guy behind him?

469
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,720
He's a smiling angel.

470
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,990
- That coward.
- Yong Jin looks...

471
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,650
- so pathetic.
- Yong Jin is really...

472
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,860
He looks so pathetic.

473
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,730
It's good that
our CEO came in first.

474
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,550
Please have a seat.

475
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,000
Did you hear that?

476
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,970
Our members would make a fuss.

477
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,290
But he said, "Please have a seat."

478
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,740
It sounded so calm.

479
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,270
It's something I've never heard.

480
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,400
- Please have a seat.
- Hello.

481
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,670
- Hello.
- Thank you.

482
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,510
(Laughing)

483
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,270
(She feels so excited
that she can't stop smiling.)

484
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,570
This feels strange.

485
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,090
It feels unfamiliar.

486
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,780
- It's strange.
- I know.

487
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,450
So Min is acting cute.

488
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,620
I hate that.

489
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,520
What's with her voice?

490
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,630
My gosh.

491
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,360
This is really nice, isn't it?

492
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,000
- Today, we're...
- You two are very beautiful.

493
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,320
Thank you.

494
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,240
So Min is serious. Look at her face.

495
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,660
- Look at So Min.
- Right?

496
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,900
But either So Min or Ji Hyo
could go out with him.

497
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,240
She's serious. Look at her face.

498
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,610
- You're right, Jong Kook.
- See?

499
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,380
Have you decided what to eat?

500
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,620
What should we eat?

501
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,170
Order whatever you want.

502
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,440
Isn't this a date?

503
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,650
You can do whatever you want.

504
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,520
What do you like to eat?

505
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,630
- Do you want to order one of each?
- Yes.

506
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,230
- That's good.
- One pasta.

507
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,630
- And one pizza.
- We can ask for a recommendation.

508
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,690
Excuse me.

509
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,870
Can we tell him what to do now?

510
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes, you can.

511
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,000
- Tenderloin.
- One salmon salad, please.

512
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,770
One salmon salad, please.

513
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,870
And...

514
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,300
One steak, please.

515
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,140
- One steak, please.
- A steak.

516
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,700
And give me some pocket money.

517
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,380
And...

518
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,540
give me some pocket money.

519
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,750
Give me some pocket money.

520
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,120
(Giggling)

521
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,220
I'm afraid I can't.

522
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,250
(He asks for money
with a sweet voice.)

523
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,550
It worked.

524
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,150
- It worked!
- They like it.

525
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,890
Are they smiling for real?

526
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,520
It worked. I knew it.

527
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,630
They're smiling.

528
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,530
By the way, the way you talk...

529
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,800
Si Kyung is really...

530
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,990
That's not the voice I usually hear.

531
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,600
It's something
we can never hear here.

532
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,110
You have a calm and warm voice.

533
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,610
The thing is,

534
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,340
I've seen you a lot on TV.

535
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,850
- I grew up listening to your songs.
- I know.

536
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,150
Saying I love you

537
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,590
Saying I love you

538
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,250
Why is she being like this
when she doesn't get any orders?

539
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,680
(So Min starts singing
without anyone's orders.)

540
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,920
I don't get any orders.

541
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,860
Look at So Min. This is crazy.

542
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,720
What's funny is...

543
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,530
Si Kyung is serious too.

544
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,300
He seems to enjoy this a lot.

545
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,610
Can you see what they're doing?

546
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
Look at So Min. Can you see that?

547
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,470
Mr. Sung, drink some water.

548
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,650
Gargle before you swallow the water.

549
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,470
You're right.

550
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,280
Then do you usually think...

551
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,880
(Gargling)

552
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,240
(The clear gargling sound
echoes through the room.)

553
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,890
He gargles all of a sudden.

554
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,060
(Oral hygiene is most important
in this day and age.)

555
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,980
Do you usually do that?

556
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,150
My father is
from Gyeongsang Province.

557
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,840
On his first date with Mom,
he had some coffee and...

558
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,900
Save your breath.

559
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,840
(What?)

560
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,200
(We didn't tell him to do that.)

561
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,400
He wasn't told to say that.

562
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,580
- Good.
- He wasn't even told to say that.

563
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,970
- Just say what you're told.
- That's what I'm told.

564
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,410
That's what I heard.
You'll see that on TV.

565
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,010
I'll watch it on TV.

566
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,180
(The mutinous AI
is working on its own.)

567
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,790
So what kind of man do you like?

568
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,250
- Me?
- Yes.

569
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,360
She likes to meet guys
in a natural way.

570
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,220
- Naturally?
- That's what she likes.

571
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,490
- This is her first time to do...
- Ji Hyo, do you need an ashtray?

572
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,800
Ji Hyo.

573
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,930
Do you need an ashtray?

574
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,300
(Ji Hyo, do you need an ashtray?)

575
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,810
Can you tell Kwang Soo
that I'm going to kill him?

576
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,000
She said she'll kill Kwang Soo.

577
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,230
What? She didn't laugh?

578
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,380
It was just a joke.

579
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,310
I thought she would respond
in a witty way.

580
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,620
Pretend that you're looking
for a cigarette in your pocket.

581
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,910
(The orders are
getting more difficult.)

582
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,080
Do you smoke cigars?

583
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,150
(He's doing as he was told.)

584
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,590
Give me one.

585
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,290
Oh, I'm sorry. I left my cigars
at home.

586
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,450
It was being charged.

587
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,950
I can't believe
that Ji Hyo played along with that.

588
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,150
She seems to like that joke.

589
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,300
- You must like jokes.
- You seem a little uncomfortable.

590
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,830
Yes, I feel uncomfortable
in a situation like this.

591
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,690
- Right?
- Yes. I feel so awkward...

592
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,730
If this was an actual blind date,

593
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,460
it would likely fail.

594
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,760
- I can tell you don't like this.
- Shut your dirty mouth.

595
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,110
Hey, shut your dirty mouth.

596
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,110
Don't do anything
you're not told to do.

597
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,240
That's not the case. I just...

598
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,850
- I might punch you.
- It wasn't like that.

599
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,120
(Si Kyung got mad
because of the rude comment.)

600
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,180
Si Kyung...

601
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,450
- looks so upset.
- Si Kyung is angry.

602
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,320
- He suddenly got upset.
- Why would he get upset?

603
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,450
He's getting angry at Yong Jin.

604
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,830
(The avatars have
a clear rank order.)

605
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,920
- Don't think...
- I just take orders.

606
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,460
Don't think that Jong Kook is
the only one who can hit you.

607
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,030
I just take orders. It's true.

608
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,420
That was so funny.

609
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,190
What are your hobbies?

610
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,700
I play tennis. I like sports.

611
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,170
But what I like to do most is
having a drink...

612
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,340
- with the people I like.
- Right. That's really fun.

613
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,740
- Having a glass with my friends.
- Of course.

614
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,050
- I got hooked on makgeolli.
- Makgeolli?

615
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,010
- I'm back on makgeolli too.
- You're back on it?

616
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,380
- So Min...
- She doesn't care about Yong Jin...

617
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,290
- only looks at Si Kyung.
- at all.

618
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,120
She won't give him a chance
to talk to her.

619
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,820
Yong Jin seems sulky.

620
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,120
I'd like to tell you something
about me. I also...

621
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,180
Si Kyung, eat the bread
without using your hand.

622
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,030
(Eat the bread
without using your hand.)

623
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,460
Let's eat. Shall we?

624
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,030
Flower petals...

625
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,100
Flower petals...

626
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,610
(Biting)

627
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,700
(The ballad king's
hands-free eating habit)

628
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,810
(Well...)

629
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,820
That was too...

630
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,410
Hey, that was...

631
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,620
(Being an avatar is an extreme job.)

632
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,980
That's hilarious.

633
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,290
- The bread is warm and tasty.
- That's...

634
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,060
Yong Jin, say your catchphrase.

635
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,530
While giving the bread,
say, "You catch it and eat it."

636
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,750
Here. You can eat mine too.

637
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,290
You should catch it.

638
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,300
You can't catch it, can you?

639
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,600
Bread, bread.

640
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,720
(Looking serious again)

641
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,460
Nicely done. That was good.

642
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,310
- Great job.
- He made Ji Hyo laugh.

643
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,780
- Ji Hyo is laughing.
- I knew it.

644
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,400
That was funny.

645
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,310
You fool, you fool.

646
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,050
Ji Hyo doesn't know what that is.

647
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,620
She doesn't know his catchphrase.

648
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,290
If she doesn't know,
he must look like a crazy person.

649
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,480
(He only looks like a talented crook
to Ji Hyo.)

650
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,120
I didn't know that I would do this
after releasing a new album.

651
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,060
Yong Jin, you released a song album
with Se Chan, right?

652
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,630
- Yes, I did.
- I saw you rap in the music video.

653
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,920
(It would be nice)

654
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,060
(Breathing in)

655
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,490
(He's showing off his singing skills
in front of the original singer.)

656
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,600
That's good.

657
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,140
(If I was walking with you
along this street)

658
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,460
(Sniffling)

659
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,000
(He's eating snot and bread
at the same time.)

660
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,670
I used to listen to this song
very often especially in spring.

661
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,700
(Si Kyung is staying calm
while pouring everyone a glass.)

662
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,880
- "Thought It Would Be Nice."
- Do you...

663
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,650
Pour it on your bread and eat it.

664
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,620
(Pour it on your bread and eat it.)

665
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,620
(Sighing)

666
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,720
- Are you serious?
- Europeans do this these days.

667
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,260
(Ballad Sung, the king of mentality,
Europeans do this these days.)

668
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,420
Italians eat bread...

669
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,730
- soaked in a drink like this.
- Oh, my.

670
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,840
(Biting)

671
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,970
(The great ballad singer is
showcasing a great eating habit.)

672
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,620
- What's that?
- Look at Ji Hyo's face.

673
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,710
- Look at her face.
- Ji Hyo genuinely hates it.

674
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,550
- That's so funny.
- Thank you.

675
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,710
By the way, you both look great
in light colors.

676
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,290
You look even prettier
from this angle.

677
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,290
I like your hairstyle,
especially the color.

678
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,990
- My hair color? Thank you.
- Yes.

679
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,420
- Good. That's a necessary comment.
- Absolutely.

680
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,600
What are your thoughts on marriage?

681
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,830
(Serious)

682
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,460
I believe that marriage is not
just about romance, but reality.

683
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,610
People have high expectations
from their partners at first.

684
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,110
I think that most people
around my age have such thoughts.

685
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,610
Some of my friends are married,

686
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,410
and it's not like I have
no dating experience.

687
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,210
(No, no, no,
what's wrong with your age?)

688
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,090
(No, no, no)

689
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,650
(What's wrong with your age?)

690
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,560
He always sings like that.

691
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,220
(Here comes
the technically skilled singer.)

692
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,870
(He can sing any given songs
with great techniques.)

693
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,760
You're right. Age doesn't matter.

694
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,430
Age doesn't matter.

695
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,730
You did it so well. Great job.

696
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,730
- He even clinked glasses with her.
- He did a great job.

697
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,230
- He did really well.
- Indeed.

698
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,170
I have one more question.
You don't want...

699
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,110
a long-term relationship
before marriage, right?

700
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,880
Do you want to get married
soon after you meet someone?

701
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,120
No, I don't want marriage
to be my purpose of dating a man.

702
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,480
How would you two describe
a good man?

703
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,900
I want a man who knows
when to apologize.

704
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,300
Of course. That's important.

705
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,570
- I see.
- I'm so sorry

706
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,990
(I'm so sorry)

707
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
(I'm so sorry)

708
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,400
I like his singing voice.

709
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,670
(He started singing
as soon as he got inspiration.)

710
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,900
You're such a great singer.

711
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,310
- He's really good at singing.
- He has an attractive voice.

712
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,780
I like how he sang it.
That was good.

713
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,910
- He's so good at singing.
- Indeed.

714
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,010
(Meanwhile, the main dishes came!)

715
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,320
My, that looks delicious.

716
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,560
Hooray! The food is here.

717
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,360
Hooray! The food is here.

718
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,300
(He sounds like a sly man
in front of someone higher in rank.)

719
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,650
I'm sorry. That came out wrong.

720
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,190
(Everyone is satisfied with the tone
that doesn't suit Si Kyung.)

721
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Before you start eating,
say, "Hooray! It's pasta."

722
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,230
Hooray, it's pasta.

723
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,580
(Si Kyung is improving
his sly tone of voice.)

724
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,670
I guess you say "hooray" often.

725
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,670
Yes.

726
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,120
(Slurping)

727
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,510
(The advanced skill
of eating noodles without cutlery)

728
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,440
The way he eats pasta seems...

729
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,650
- I'll try it too.
- so fun.

730
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,890
It tastes better as it all comes
into my mouth at once.

731
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,950
I see.

732
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,300
- Ji Hyo is trying it too?
- They're both trying it.

733
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,490
When no one told her to do so.

734
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,960
Both of them are eating it that way.

735
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,400
(They're gobbling down the food
with their heads down.)

736
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
My, it's good.

737
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,570
(She does look adorable though.)

738
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,260
This is not a blind date.

739
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,840
This is a zoo tour,
not a blind date.

740
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,670
What do you find attractive
in women?

741
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,820
I like the type of woman
like my wife.

742
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,290
What do you like about her?

743
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,530
There must be things about her
that you found attractive.

744
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,720
First of all, she's much prettier
than you girls.

745
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,330
- First of all, my wife is...
- It's delicious.

746
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,460
much prettier than you girls.

747
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,830
(My wife is much prettier
than you girls.)

748
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,430
(He brags about his wife
regardless of the time and place.)

749
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,500
Why did he even go on a blind date
if he was going to be like that?

750
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,660
Hey, are you...

751
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,500
Are you trying to ruin everything?

752
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,840
That's so funny.

753
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,080
Hey, just do what you're told to do.

754
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,470
I was told to say it.

755
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,880
I'm having such a hard time
following their orders.

756
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,010
- Were you really told to say it?
- Yes, I was. Believe me.

757
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,480
Which one do you two prefer?
A good singer...

758
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,590
or a good dancer?

759
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,180
Which one do you two prefer?
A good singer...

760
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,180
or a good dancer?

761
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,950
- A good singer.
- Yong Jin is good at both.

762
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,750
I'm good at both
if I had to brag about myself.

763
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,030
- Being good at both is the best.
- Why don't I show you?

764
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,990
Why don't I show you?

765
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,960
- May I show you?
- Yes, please.

766
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,540
(How well could Yong Jin
sing and dance?)

767
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,580
I like singing rock songs,
but I like dancing to dance songs.

768
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,150
One day, I saw you

769
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,050
One day, I saw you

770
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,910
Crying

771
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,820
(He's the type that uses techniques
when dancing as well.)

772
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,710
I wanted to run to you

773
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,060
(Imitating a horse)

774
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,390
That's good.

775
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,790
(He imitated a horse neighing
at the end for no reason.)

776
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,450
Good job. That was really good.

777
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,990
You definitely impressed them.

778
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,300
(Yong Jin impressed
the girls greatly.)

779
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,800
- So Min, aren't you a good dancer?
- If there's something...

780
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,760
So Min, aren't you a good dancer?

781
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
- I do like dancing, but...
- I see.

782
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,470
If it's not too much to ask,
can you show us a little?

783
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,040
What kind of dance?

784
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,080
Or I can dance with you.

785
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,850
Without music?

786
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,650
I'll dance along with you.

787
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,590
1, 2, 3, 4.

788
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,850
(They started dancing without music
on a blind date.)

789
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,560
(The breathtaking couple dance)

790
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,890
- That's not a blind date.
- I'm impressed.

791
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,480
- What kind of blind date is this?
- Yong Jin is doing so well.

792
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,650
Yong Jin is doing so well.

793
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,030
Yong Jin is doing so well.

794
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,030
Sing a song, Yong Jin.

795
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,030
(She dances in her own style,
and he dances with techniques.)

796
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,070
Yong Jin, sing a song.

797
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,930
(Scatting)

798
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,160
Look at Si Kyung's face.

799
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,280
What kind of blind date is this?

800
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,580
That was really great.

801
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,740
Ji Hyo, come out.

802
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,200
Next, Ji Hyo, can you come out?

803
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,400
(Ji Hyo, come out.)

804
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,650
(Me?)

805
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,710
There she comes.

806
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,940
- She's coming out.
- She's coming out.

807
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,980
I might have an upset stomach.

808
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,410
(What?)

809
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,720
- Sing a song.
- Yo, let's go

810
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,990
(Singing gibberish)

811
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,150
What was that?

812
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,760
(Ji Hyo started dancing
to the gibberish song.)

813
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,400
I really like Yong Jin's boldness.

814
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,600
That's one of my favorite songs.

815
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,840
(Standing up)

816
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,200
That's not a blind date.

817
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,280
(The natural-born dancer got excited
and joined them.)

818
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,640
You don't call that blind date.

819
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,310
(I don't want to hang out
with them.)

820
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,550
- That's okay.
- Si Kyung, come out.

821
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,850
Si Kyung, can you come out?

822
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,620
(The active dance singer has been
called out.)

823
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,090
All right! That's perfect!

824
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,480
That's great.

825
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,630
This is so fun to watch.

826
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,480
(Hesitating)

827
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,150
(I wanted to run to you)

828
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,760
(Sighing)

829
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,300
(They don't know how to react
unlike usual.)

830
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,640
(The employees of Single Dot-com are
satisfied.)

831
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,040
Si Kyung is upset. He's upset now.

832
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,310
I'd like to hear you sing too.

833
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,970
I released a song recently.

834
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,080
- Did you?
- Really?

835
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,410
- But it's a sad song. Is it okay?
- Of course.

836
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,670
(So Min collaborated with a singer
as a lyricist and a vocalist.)

837
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,790
("Reasons for Not Cutting Long Hair"
by Choi Botton and Jeon So Min)

838
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,030
(Love is the same)

839
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,720
(Love is like a poison)

840
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,990
Doze off. Doze off.

841
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,630
Love is like a flower

842
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,830
(Entering REM sleep)

843
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,640
Yong Jin, lie down and sleep.

844
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,140
Lie down on the floor and sleep.

845
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,310
(Yong Jin, lie down on the floor
and sleep.)

846
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,610
(The avatars are drunk
by the lullaby.)

847
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,470
What's going on? Where am I?

848
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,510
(So Min's singing voice is the best
for putting avatars to sleep.)

849
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,010
(Jeon So Min, the queen of lullaby)

850
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,180
(That's hilarious.)

851
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,920
Where am I?

852
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,990
(Where am I?)

853
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,400
That was good.

854
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,900
Apologize to her. Apologize first.

855
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,900
Apologize to her first.

856
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,190
- You should apologize to her.
- I'm sorry.

857
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,370
- I'm sorry.
- You should keep good manners.

858
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,500
I haven't slept so soundly
in the past three years. Thank you.

859
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,140
- I'm sorry. And thank you.
- I know that it's... Yes?

860
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,740
I haven't slept so soundly
in the past three years. Thank you.

861
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,470
Seeing how quickly we fell asleep,
I think it's a great song.

862
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,970
Indeed. I was surprised.

863
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,550
I slept as if
I was under anesthesia.

864
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,090
As if you were under anesthesia?

865
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,090
(The song can make you feel like
you're under anesthesia.)

866
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,120
The song is not that boring.

867
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,090
I'm sorry to ask you for this,
but if it's not too much to ask,

868
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,900
can you sing your new song for us?

869
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,490
The song title "I Love U,"
which may sound cheesy.

870
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,690
"I Love U?"

871
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,260
(Si Kyung gladly sings his new song
upon the request of his client.)

872
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,310
It took me too long

873
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,430
- to tell you how I feel
- Doze off.

874
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,940
(He went under anesthesia
for the 2nd time.)

875
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,510
My gosh. What's going on?

876
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,440
- Just do what you're told to do.
- My gosh.

877
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,890
Oh, dear. My goodness.

878
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,120
Thank you so much.

879
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,420
Look at Si Kyung's face.

880
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,090
Look at Si Kyung's face.

881
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,690
- Thank you so much.
- It's a great song.

882
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,920
I slept well thanks to you.

883
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,930
(Polite)

884
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,730
It's time to say goodbye.
You did a good job.

885
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,140
Yong Jin, be a gentleman
when you say goodbye to them.

886
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,970
Also, I'd like to thank you both...

887
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,700
for such a great time.

888
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,700
Although I did some rude things,

889
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,620
I did those only to figure out
your characteristics.

890
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,740
That's why I did those things.

891
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,790
- It was sort of a test.
- I had so much fun.

892
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,980
Although we were here as avatars,

893
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,150
I think we got to know you a little.
Like the different types you like,

894
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,800
your personalities,

895
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,190
and what you want from a man.

896
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,160
We'll split the bill, right?

897
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,760
How shall we pay for the food?

898
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,900
- Let's split the bill.
- What?

899
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,230
It's on me.

900
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,730
Hooray, I can save money.

901
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,780
Hooray, I can save money.

902
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,810
(Hooray! I can save money!)

903
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,900
(The blind date ended
with the sly tone of his voice.)

904
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,470
"Hooray, I can save money."

905
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,510
Good job, you both.

906
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,820
Good job, Si Kyung and Yong Jin.

907
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,050
- That was so funny.
- Great job.

908
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,180
Good job, you guys.

909
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,890
- Sir.
- Good job, So Min.

910
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,360
- Please come in.
- Good job, Ji Hyo.

911
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,680
So Min, Si Kyung went on
about how cute you are.

912
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,830
- He's crazy about you.
- Yes, he is.

913
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,990
Have a seat, So Min.

914
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,130
(Stop it.)

915
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,260
Look at her.

916
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,660
- Jong Kook is not a detective.
- Come to the center.

917
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,900
The two clients, Ji Hyo and So Min,
finished evaluating...

918
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,430
both companies' services
based on the blind date.

919
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,400
Let's start with So Min.
So Min, please put a sticker...

920
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,500
on the board of the team
that you're more satisfied with.

921
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,150
- I evaluated objectively.
- You should be objective.

922
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,650
Of course. Since Yong Jin is
a very funny man...

923
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,790
When I was dancing,

924
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,890
- You seemed excited.
- to be honest,

925
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,290
I thought I could hear music.

926
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,650
- Really?
- Yes, he was so good...

927
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,490
I want to do it again. Can't you
do it again for me? Please?

928
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,100
Of course. No problem at all.

929
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,100
(He started singing right away.)

930
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,900
(She's dancing to the song
automatically.)

931
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,500
(Her body reacted first
to the familiar singing voice.)

932
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,470
- That was so good.
- What song was that?

933
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,880
- I can do an EDM song too.
- She's one cheery girl.

934
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,900
- An EDM song?
- Please do that.

935
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,410
(The human jukebox sings
an EDM song as well.)

936
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,710
(Let's dance to the EDM song!)

937
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,740
Scream!

938
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,480
(Scream!)

939
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,750
(They have perfect teamwork
as if they prepared this.)

940
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,130
(It was a successful collaboration.)

941
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,720
He's amazing.
He's as good as Jeong Jong Chul.

942
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,030
- That was so much fun.
- He's amazing.

943
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,600
- I really liked it so much.
- He has such a great voice.

944
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,800
- I liked it so much.
- He has a great voice.

945
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,870
I knew that Yong Jin was funny,

946
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,610
- but Si Kyung was so funny too.
- Really?

947
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,110
- When he ate the bread...
- I see why she liked it.

948
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,640
- That's what I like.
- Right.

949
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,610
It's because you didn't expect
to see him act like that.

950
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,880
(He lowered his head
with a little smile...)

951
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,210
(and had a bite.)

952
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,120
(She liked it so much.)

953
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,590
It's because I didn't expect him
to act like that.

954
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,010
- It was an unexpected charm.
- It really was unexpected.

955
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,090
And he said with his sweet voice
that I never hear on Running Man,

956
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,490
"Please have a seat.
What shall we order?"

957
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,630
I gave 13 points to this team
and 10 points to the other.

958
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,800
Great. We got three more points.

959
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,190
13 to 10.

960
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,460
- You can put it on here. Thank you.
- Ji Hyo might give us her sticker.

961
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,140
Thank you!

962
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,760
He was as funny as Yong Jin.

963
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,000
What I liked about Si Kyung was...

964
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,670
I liked how he kept looking me
in the eyes while talking to me.

965
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,880
Eye contact is important.

966
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,410
I liked it so much,
and I gave the team five points.

967
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,880
- We won.
- We won again.

968
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,940
We won again.

969
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,410
We won, we won again

970
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,620
- We won.
- Hooray! We won again.

971
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,910
- We lost.
- We won again.

972
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,390
- They got more points.
- We won

973
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,220
Then we'll move
to the next location.

974
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,100
- Yes!
- Okay.

975
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,760
The weather is so nice.
The weather is really nice.

976
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,570
(Under the clear blue sky,
food is served on the table.)

977
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,930
You can bond
with your team members...

978
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,040
and learn more about the ladies
while enjoying the food freely.

979
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,200
- Okay.
- Really?

980
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
- They ordered catering.
- We can just eat it?

981
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,470
We haven't eaten outside like this
in a long time, right?

982
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,120
- Oh, dear.
- They prepared delicious food.

983
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,650
- I'll drink a beverage later.
- Since we're all tired...

984
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,090
- I see a lot of chicken breasts.
- I should eat some Korean food.

985
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,380
I feel like I'm on a picnic.

986
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,860
- Look at that.
- It looks delicious.

987
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,590
Intern Ji, enjoy your meal.

988
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,280
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

989
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,430
- Enjoy your meal.
- Oh, I see. Thank you.

990
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,800
- Let's talk later.
- Oh, that?

991
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,200
Intern Ji, enjoy your meal.

992
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,340
- What did you just say?
- It's chili powder.

993
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,030
(He's an assistant manager
and Se Chan is a manager.)

994
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,630
- "What did you just say?"
- Oh, I see.

995
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,110
- I'm sorry.
- Who do you think you are?

996
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,010
- I'm sorry.
- Let's talk later.

997
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,300
Two CEOs can change their
employees' positions at any time.

998
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,340
- Okay.
- Got it.

999
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,680
- By the way, Suk Jin,
- Yes.

1000
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,410
I think I should change yours
as you have great passion.

1001
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,590
Really?

1002
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,590
- Yes.
- CEO Lee.

1003
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,820
Thank you so much.

1004
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,820
I'll change your sticker
with a new one.

1005
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,630
- Is he still an intern?
- Yes.

1006
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,490
You can put the new one
on top of it.

1007
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,490
(He gave him a new sticker.)

1008
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,860
- It does look shiny and nice.
- It looks nice.

1009
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,070
- CEO Lee is so funny.
- CEO Lee.

1010
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,470
- He has a good personality.
- Yes.

1011
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,660
He's friendly too.
And I also found out...

1012
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,340
- that he has no criminal records.
- Right.

1013
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,740
- That's true.
- So...

1014
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,910
- I have no criminal records.
- I'll promote you to an employee.

1015
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,820
- Thank you. Okay!
- This is really nice.

1016
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,820
(The thug got a promotion.)

1017
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,150
Jong Kook is an employee now.
We're in trouble. He got promoted.

1018
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,990
What? Jong Kook got promoted?

1019
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,280
You should butter CEO Sung up
to make our company successful.

1020
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,090
Don't you want to get a promotion,
Assistant Manager Lee?

1021
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,090
(Assistant Manager Lee made up
his mind following his advice.)

1022
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,400
- with strawberries in it.
- Go and butter him up.

1023
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
CEO Sung, do you need anything more?

1024
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,800
That's okay. I've eaten enough.

1025
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,400
(- Do you need anything more?
- That's okay. I've eaten enough.)

1026
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,130
- You don't have to do that.
- Pardon?

1027
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,470
- Is there anything...
- Don't make him uncomfortable.

1028
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,630
- It's not like that.
- Sir.

1029
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,240
- You're trying to get a promotion.
- What's wrong with you?

1030
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,570
- Sir.
- Yes?

1031
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,570
- Can I talk to you briefly?
- Yes.

1032
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,610
- Are you an assistant manager?
- Yes.

1033
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,910
- It's rice cake.
- Can you drive my car...

1034
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
Pardon me?

1035
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,090
Can you drive my car to my house...

1036
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,860
I'm not a chauffeur.

1037
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,880
- I don't do things like that.
- You don't?

1038
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,360
Sir, this is how people treat me
because I'm an assistant manager.

1039
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,630
- You don't do that?
- They ask me to be their chauffeur.

1040
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,820
I'm being mistreated.

1041
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,820
- Work a little harder.
- I'm sorry.

1042
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,900
- That's okay. That happens.
- Okay.

1043
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,340
- I was mistaken.
- You're very tall.

1044
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,590
- Yes.
- You're so tall.

1045
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,300
Can you put that light bulb
in your mouth?

1046
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,360
(Can you put that light bulb
in your mouth?)

1047
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,780
- I'm just curious.
- He's ridiculous.

1048
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,910
(Can you put that light bulb
in your mouth?)

1049
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,010
(I'm just curious
since you're tall.)

1050
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,680
- He's the CEO of my company.
- I'm just curious since you are...

1051
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,680
- really tall.
- I mean...

1052
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,950
- He's my company's CEO.
- Why would I put it in my mouth?

1053
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,340
- Try it, Mr. Lee.
- Don't be upset.

1054
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,780
- It's understandable.
- I was just curious.

1055
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,990
Can he put that light bulb
in his mouth?

1056
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,260
- Wasn't that a ridiculous question?
- I think he can do it.

1057
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,680
Here are some more.

1058
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,490
(Oh, no!)

1059
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,090
- Oh, no.
- I like rice cake.

1060
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,090
- I know. Right? It's good.
- I think...

1061
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,030
- I just spilled the juice.
- I like rice cake too...

1062
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,990
But you didn't ask if I was okay
or try to help me.

1063
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,840
Is this how you treat your clients?

1064
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,300
- The glass made a loud noise,
- It wasn't like that.

1065
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,340
but you were too busy
eating that rice cake...

1066
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,610
Would you like one?

1067
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,740
For that piece of rice cake...

1068
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,570
You're pulling a power trip
because you're our client.

1069
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,610
How could you say that?
I can't work with you.

1070
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,410
He works at Yong Jin's company,
right?

1071
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,090
- Married Corporation.
- You shouldn't raise your voice...

1072
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,280
- at our client.
- Right.

1073
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,380
- Yes.
- He's right.

1074
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,820
Get on the ground
and do some push-ups.

1075
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,090
(Get on the ground
and do some push-ups.)

1076
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,990
- Do it.
- Do it now.

1077
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,820
- Do it.
- Do as CEO Lee says.

1078
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,630
- It's a company rule.
- Gosh, seriously.

1079
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,660
- You should do it.
- You should do it.

1080
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,900
He might actually...

1081
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,300
Right. Go on and do as he said.

1082
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,860
Do it unless you want to get fired.

1083
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,030
CEO Lee, if you really want me
to do it, I would...

1084
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,110
- No, I didn't mean it like that.
- Are you sure?

1085
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,010
I'm just saying
that you should be more careful.

1086
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,300
I see. Of course, I'll be careful.

1087
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,740
- That was so funny.
- That's too much.

1088
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,880
- Did someone eat my rice cake?
- Yes.

1089
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,410
Was it you?

1090
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,360
What is this?

1091
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,590
(At the next location...)

1092
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,030
- I recognize this. The green light.
- What's this?

1093
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,700
I saw it on the show
where CEO Sung...

1094
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,990
- Quiet down, everyone!
- Okay.

1095
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,470
My gosh.

1096
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,030
- Don't you think...
- Well...

1097
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,900
it was related to the context?

1098
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,030
I really wanted to see that face.

1099
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,360
I mean, where this red light...

1100
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,010
Through this mission,

1101
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,110
you can see what the clients think
about different situations.

1102
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,570
- It's Turn on the Red Light.
- Turn on the Red Light.

1103
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,110
As those who checked
our social media must know,

1104
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,010
we received many love stories
from our viewers...

1105
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,510
for four days through social media.

1106
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,450
Among the 833 stories we received,

1107
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,450
- we selected a few.
- Sounds great.

1108
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,090
- Among so many stories...
- How did you select them?

1109
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,590
Listen to the story...

1110
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,200
and decide whether or not to turn on
the red light.

1111
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,260
After a debate on all those stories,
Ji Hyo and So Min...

1112
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,200
will give the members whose opinions
you agree with the most...

1113
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,010
with three stars just as they want.

1114
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,260
- We can get 3 stars?
- 3 stars?

1115
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,470
- I'm confident.
- That's not all.

1116
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,470
- Jong Kook is good at this game.
- They can give all 3 to 1 person...

1117
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,150
or give each to a different member.
It's up to them.

1118
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,510
I'm sure you guys know us well...

1119
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,410
- Of course, we know you well.
- Of course.

1120
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,910
By the way, Se Chan and Kwang Soo...

1121
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,090
don't know much about dating.
Don't you think so?

1122
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,010
- Exactly.
- But we all have experience.

1123
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,360
- Kwang Soo is dating someone.
- I see.

1124
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,680
But he doesn't seem to have
a girlfriend now.

1125
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,720
- You mean Se Chan? Right.
- CEO Lee...

1126
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,660
- knows all my dating history.
- You know him well.

1127
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,090
- He could be dating someone.
- He's the type...

1128
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,590
that lets his girlfriend control him
while crying like a baby.

1129
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,200
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

1130
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,260
You're one to talk.

1131
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,660
Should I tell them about you?

1132
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,160
- What about you?
- I'll talk, you know.

1133
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,200
I'll tell them about you too.

1134
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,380
- I will, you know.
- That's enough.

1135
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,510
- I might even name names.
- Guys, that's enough.

1136
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,340
I haven't so far
for your wife's sake.

1137
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,150
CEO Sung, will you
read the first one?

1138
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,110
His voice. I love his voice.

1139
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,240
- You know...
- Right?

1140
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,990
- CEO Sung.
- Yes?

1141
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,010
Due to your last name being "Sung,"

1142
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,450
it makes you sound
like the sex expert.

1143
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,530
That's right, the sex expert.

1144
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,050
- Right.
- You seem like one...

1145
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,800
who is certified in that area.

1146
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,300
CEO Sung, the sex expert.

1147
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,300
The sex expert?

1148
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,860
I did host a show
by the name of "Witch Hunt."

1149
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,030
Yes, of course.

1150
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,360
That's right.

1151
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,070
He's the sex expert
among balladeers.

1152
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,130
- It seems that way.
- Ballad Sung.

1153
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,380
(The sex expert reads
the first one.)

1154
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,970
Title. "Is That All I Meant to You?"

1155
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,320
"Hello, I'm a 36-year-old woman
with a corporate job."

1156
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,260
"I've been dating a man
3 years my senior for 100 days now."

1157
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,910
I see.

1158
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,590
They're in the honeymoon phase then.

1159
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,680
"I'm one of those people
who need to see her boyfriend..."

1160
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,820
"at least once a day
even if it's only for a minute."

1161
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,400
"However, since we both
have corporate jobs..."

1162
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,760
"and live about an hour apart,"

1163
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,200
"we can't dream of
going out on a weekday."

1164
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,430
"Since I missed him so much,"

1165
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,300
"I suggested that we..."

1166
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,130
"spend both Saturday
and Sunday together."

1167
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,930
("Is That All I Meant to You?")

1168
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,240
But for men...

1169
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,510
- My gosh.
- She cut off his air supply.

1170
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,550
I already feel smothered too.

1171
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,160
- I hate it.
- "My boyfriend agreed to it,"

1172
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,180
"and for three weeks..."

1173
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,820
"on the weekend..."

1174
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,090
Get me an oxygen tank!

1175
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,050
It's like this.

1176
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,320
(The air is being sucked
out of him.)

1177
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,490
Don't!

1178
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,160
Just don't.

1179
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,320
Don't come any closer.

1180
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,630
- Get over here.
- Don't come any closer.

1181
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,300
(Spending the weekend together
is brutal for some people.)

1182
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,910
- It's only been 100 days.
- Right, that's true.

1183
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,340
- Yes, 100 days.
- Not 2 years,

1184
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,010
- but 100 days.
- Yes, that's the honeymoon phase.

1185
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,070
He's right.

1186
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,700
"For three weeks,
we spent our weekends together."

1187
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,820
"It washed away
the longing I'd been feeling."

1188
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,650
"But as time went by,
my boyfriend started..."

1189
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,050
"to push back the time we'd meet."

1190
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,780
"From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m."

1191
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,910
- "And then to 2 p.m."
- Of course.

1192
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,360
"I first thought
it had to do with his work."

1193
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,950
"But then,"

1194
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,200
"after trying to find
the right moment, he said this."

1195
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,470
"He didn't mind
being with me all weekend,"

1196
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,130
"but he wanted at least
a day to himself too."

1197
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,510
He got caught in the trap.

1198
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,200
Oh, no.

1199
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,470
(We all know deep down
what'll happen next.)

1200
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,570
I don't know why I'm in tears.

1201
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,240
You can relate to the story.

1202
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,410
I'm in tears.

1203
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,200
"I'd understand
if we were an old couple in a rut,"

1204
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,970
"but we've only been dating
for about 100 days."

1205
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,650
"Meeting other friends
and enjoying your time alone..."

1206
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,680
"is something you can do
on a weekday after work."

1207
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,450
Must you say it in that tone?

1208
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,660
And what tone is that?

1209
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,050
- I was trying to sound annoyed.
- It showed.

1210
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,400
(Annoyed)

1211
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,070
(He sounds exactly like
an annoyed girlfriend.)

1212
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,660
(Professor Sung
can not only sing but also act.)

1213
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,660
I'm in tears over here.

1214
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,740
"Ever since then, we've been
meeting up only once a week."

1215
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,200
"However, I still feel like
it's not enough."

1216
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,300
"Would it be okay to ask..."

1217
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,340
"that we spend
the entire weekend together again?"

1218
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,380
"Or should I just accept
and respect his wishes?"

1219
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,950
(More dating time versus
at least a day to himself)

1220
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,050
Once a week
doesn't seem like enough though.

1221
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,410
- They're a new couple.
- It's only been 100 days,

1222
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,260
so a date once a week isn't enough.

1223
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,820
- It's too short.
- But since it's the weekend...

1224
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,660
The boyfriend being 39
should be considered too.

1225
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,130
You see,

1226
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,700
he's at an age where he needs
to focus on getting ahead in life.

1227
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,160
- And he needs rest.
- Right.

1228
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,070
- I'd like to say something too.
- Go ahead.

1229
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,110
The girlfriend wouldn't
have written about it...

1230
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,680
if this hadn't been
stressing her out.

1231
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,680
The boyfriend should
understand that.

1232
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,050
Of course.

1233
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,010
This is how I see it.

1234
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,050
If he truly loves his girlfriend,
he'll change his mind.

1235
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,380
- Of course.
- He must be well past that stage.

1236
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,110
How can you be so
emotionally stunted?

1237
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,660
- What?
- What?

1238
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,550
- Are you challenging us?
- I'd love nothing more.

1239
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,050
Sounds good to me.

1240
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,400
It brings joy to my ears.

1241
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,860
- Hey.
- Sounds good.

1242
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,300
(The CEO tries
to calm his employee.)

1243
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,530
- You two...
- Why are you on your feet?

1244
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,530
Are you his minions?

1245
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,070
How about a fight
between minions then?

1246
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,610
I see you're quite tall.

1247
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,570
- I see you're quite tall.
- Right.

1248
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,970
Can you stuff that projector
in your mouth?

1249
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,950
Why do you keep asking me that?

1250
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,220
Because you're tall, that's all.

1251
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,340
(CEO Lee is the curious type.)

1252
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,180
Why would one
shove that in his mouth?

1253
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,380
- You see...
- Are you good?

1254
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,680
This might sound drastic, but still.

1255
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,430
What if the boyfriend
gives himself a nosebleed...

1256
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,780
during one of their dates?

1257
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,860
- On purpose?
- It's not like that.

1258
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,700
Don't think of it as a hoax.

1259
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,760
It'll benefit both of them.

1260
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,070
What if he got sick?

1261
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,470
- He could get sick.
- You know,

1262
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,660
like this.

1263
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,840
In my opinion, this isn't about
the number of dates,

1264
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,380
but how they express
their feelings for one another.

1265
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,510
Even though
they're not physically together,

1266
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,550
saying things like
"I miss you and I love you..."

1267
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,550
could comfort the girlfriend...

1268
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,410
- and fill the obvious void.
- Right.

1269
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,910
So what you're saying is this.

1270
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,990
Whether they go on
one or two dates a week,

1271
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,260
she needs to know that he loves her.

1272
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,860
- He needs to express it.
- That's what you're saying.

1273
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,200
In my opinion though,

1274
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,820
one should be more attentive
during the early stages.

1275
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,030
- He's right.
- Right.

1276
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,570
In my case,

1277
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,570
when I first started
to date my wife,

1278
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,160
I was busy with work.

1279
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,360
But I still went to see her
even though it was for five minutes.

1280
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,130
- And that would be enough.
- But for how long?

1281
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,880
- How sweet of you.
- It's enough to fill the void.

1282
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,180
During the early stages,

1283
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,880
I'd go running to her...

1284
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,910
- on rainy days.
- Of course.

1285
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,340
Whom did you go running to?

1286
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,950
My current wife.

1287
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,220
- We lived close by.
- When was it?

1288
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,910
- What? Whom?
- We lived...

1289
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,240
Take that, you jerk.

1290
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,010
Your wife used to live close by?

1291
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,220
What?

1292
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,380
- You lived...
- That wasn't the case.

1293
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,550
Were you lying?

1294
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,450
She lived in Gangnam,
which was nowhere near your house.

1295
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,360
I'm a guest on your show, you jerk.

1296
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,220
- Help a brother out.
- What?

1297
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,430
Why must you nitpick everything?

1298
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,970
Your wife would be startled,
that's why.

1299
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,470
So here's my suggestion.

1300
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,240
- On a non-date day...
- A nosebleed?

1301
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,200
"What are you up to?
I'm outside your house."

1302
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,610
- "Can I see you?"
- An unexpected visit.

1303
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,880
Show up with an IV drip...

1304
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,150
(Outside the window)

1305
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,450
(The nosebleed guy
now has an IV drip.)

1306
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,610
An IV drip?

1307
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,570
Just think about it.

1308
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,680
With an IV drip...

1309
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,090
(With an IV drip stuck to him,
he can greet her with a big smile.)

1310
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,660
Look at it go back out.

1311
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,660
(He makes himself look even sicker.)

1312
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,760
- "I love you."
- Jae Suk, it's an act of love.

1313
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,360
- Right?
- Totally.

1314
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,070
"I'm good now!"

1315
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,860
- "We can be apart for a month."
- Exactly.

1316
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,470
- That's...
- Those actions are most important.

1317
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,970
It's most important.

1318
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,300
The people of that company...

1319
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,470
What? What about us?

1320
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,910
The losers are more...

1321
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,070
- Losers?
- Losers?

1322
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,740
- Seriously?
- Hold on.

1323
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,820
- Must you speak so cruelly?
- I spoke cruelly?

1324
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,280
How about I be cruel
in another way then?

1325
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,280
Wait.

1326
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,550
No, don't.

1327
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,590
Get on your feet.

1328
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,280
How about I make
something else go red?

1329
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,630
(The political thug
shows his true colors.)

1330
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,030
How old are you guys anyway?

1331
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,490
- Should we get reinforcements?
- How old are you?

1332
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,800
Should we get reinforcements?

1333
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,660
Look. He's taller than
the air conditioner.

1334
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,260
He's taller than
the air conditioner.

1335
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,760
Wait a second.

1336
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,200
Why does he keep
mentioning my height?

1337
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,070
He's taller than
the air conditioner.

1338
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,260
Why does he keep...

1339
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,740
- mentioning my height?
- You're right.

1340
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,410
You really are taller
than the air conditioner.

1341
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,800
How can he be taller than that?

1342
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,180
I was taken aback.

1343
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,380
Anyway, what's important...

1344
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,510
is that he shouldn't
make his girlfriend...

1345
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,110
question his love...

1346
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:59,410
- or their relationship.
- From what I can tell,

1347
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,820
he probably didn't call often...

1348
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,680
- and became different in a way.
- Exactly.

1349
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,130
- It's why she's upset.
- Of course.

1350
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,490
We also...

1351
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,360
can't ignore their age.

1352
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,530
- Absolutely.
- You see,

1353
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,160
when you're in your 20s,

1354
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,360
you use a joint bank account
for dating expenses,

1355
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,530
- but when you're over 30...
- A bank account?

1356
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,660
Did you have one
with your girlfriend?

1357
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,530
- I mean...
- With which girlfriend?

1358
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:16,930
- The one I know, right?
- Hey!

1359
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:18,240
Take that! Stop it, will you?

1360
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,970
- What did I do?
- Stop it already.

1361
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:21,410
The girlfriends of yours I know...

1362
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,610
I know a few.

1363
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,840
- The one...
- It's the same as singing.

1364
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,070
(CEO Lee becomes a different person
in Se Chan's presence.)

1365
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,280
From what I can tell,

1366
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,050
couples argue
even though they're compatible.

1367
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,260
Right?

1368
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,090
- Do you and your wife argue too?
- Of course.

1369
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,880
- It doesn't seem that way.
- What?

1370
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,660
- That doesn't seem like the case.
- We argue.

1371
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,660
Let's say I want to open a window...

1372
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,400
to cool down, but my wife is cold.

1373
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,900
What should I do, right?

1374
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,740
I suggest turning on the AC,

1375
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,910
but she'd say
it's too early for that.

1376
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,070
That's a possible scenario.

1377
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,910
- How does it end though?
- What?

1378
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:52,910
How does it end?

1379
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,050
I'd open the door
and step outside...

1380
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,240
to get some fresh air.

1381
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,570
(He steps outside to enjoy
the right kind of temperature.)

1382
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,340
So that's why
a lot of husbands and fathers...

1383
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,050
can be seen
outside apartment buildings.

1384
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,280
"Darn household."

1385
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,660
That must be the reason.

1386
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,490
In this case,
my wife is the boss of the house,

1387
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,050
which is why I step outside.

1388
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,200
- Right.
- That's why...

1389
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,260
- And now...
- Should she bring it up or not?

1390
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,760
Press the button if you think
she should bring it up again.

1391
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,030
I don't think she should.

1392
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,470
- Same here.
- But then they'd break up.

1393
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:19,700
(They are to press the button...)

1394
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,930
(if they think
she should bring it up again.)

1395
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,610
1, 2, 3.

1396
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,160
- No one.
- Not even one of us.

1397
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,410
I think it's best
not to bring it back up.

1398
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,610
She wants to though.

1399
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,340
- Right.
- She must want to.

1400
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,340
- I can relate to both parties.
- Me too.

1401
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,550
Same here.

1402
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:37,010
Now that you've heard
the two companies debate,

1403
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,110
please give out the three stars...

1404
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,360
to anyone you want.

1405
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,660
It'll be a tough call.

1406
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,400
(A total of 6 stars
are on the line.)

1407
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,130
- They...
- To be honest,

1408
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,130
I'd like to give the IV drip
all of my three stars.

1409
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,760
Because seeing that IV drip...

1410
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,430
would make me want to
give him a month off.

1411
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,610
So here you go.

1412
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,430
- Thank you.
- It's for the IV drip.

1413
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,840
We finally scored a point.

1414
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:01,610
Someone else also scratched
the necessary places.

1415
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,650
It's Jong Kook.

1416
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:04,450
Thank you.

1417
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,880
This next one is a pity star.

1418
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,070
Nice!

1419
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,150
It sure is nice to be pitied.

1420
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,320
A pity star.

1421
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
(Ji Hyo's up next.)

1422
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:12,590
The IV drip and nosebleed.

1423
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,050
(The IV drip wins 2 stars.)

1424
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,860
The IV drip and nosebleed
were solid ideas.

1425
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,030
- This...
- It was the best.

1426
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,630
Did he win two in total?

1427
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:19,900
Two stars?

1428
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,130
I'll lead my people better.

1429
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,400
I'll encourage that with a star.

1430
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,990
- That was close.
- We almost tanked this round.

1431
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,990
We're neck and neck now.

1432
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,430
Mr. Sung, good going.

1433
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,260
- We're now tied.
- It's a tie.

1434
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,410
- We're tied.
- We have the same score.

1435
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,430
You were able to figure out...

1436
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,650
the type of relationships
your clients prefer.

1437
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,680
- Right.
- Okay.

1438
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,550
In this next round,
you'll get to find out...

1439
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,380
what they look for in an ideal man.

1440
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,280
This is
the Relationship Balance Game.

1441
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,380
The Relationship Balance Game.

1442
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,180
In front of me...

1443
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,050
are the names of men...

1444
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,220
Ji Hyo and So Min
mentioned as their type...

1445
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,050
along with the eight of your names.

1446
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,360
When did they ever
mention those names?

1447
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,160
- Quite often in So Min's case.
- Ji Hyo doesn't have one.

1448
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,720
Ji Hyo doesn't have an ideal type.

1449
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,090
She barely managed
to come up with one,

1450
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:00,630
and we guessed some.

1451
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:02,930
- She barely managed?
- She had to come up with one.

1452
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,570
So you'll pick two balls
from the box...

1453
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,950
and add all sorts of modifiers...

1454
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,410
to the two people you picked.

1455
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,340
Your job is to make it hard
for your client...

1456
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,410
to pick one person by making
their conditions equally attractive.

1457
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,180
I totally got it.

1458
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,320
- For example...
- I get it.

1459
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,030
Let's say Jae Suk impresses
his partner with surprise events.

1460
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:24,450
But his opponent, Park Bo Gum,

1461
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:25,950
forgets all the anniversaries
and makes his partner treat a meal.

1462
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:26,990
It's something like this.

1463
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,260
I get it.

1464
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,260
- So that they can contemplate.
- Your job is...

1465
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,300
to make their conditions balanced
so that your client...

1466
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,740
can pick the person you want.

1467
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,800
(Their job is to balance out
the conditions.)

1468
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,930
You got it, right?
We'll pick the candidates...

1469
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,200
for So Min first.

1470
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,840
Let me tell you whom she picked...

1471
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,910
aside from the eight people here.

1472
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,550
Gong Myoung, Ahn Jae Hong,

1473
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,550
- Kim Dong Jun, Lee Je Hoon,
- She's not shy about it.

1474
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,780
Woo Do Hwan, Jinyoung of GOT7,

1475
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,590
Did she mention
all the guests we had?

1476
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,660
Ahn Bo Hyun, and Ha Suk Jin.

1477
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,820
And the eight people here.

1478
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,930
Those are the guys
that So Min likes.

1479
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,630
- There's more, right?
- Did she mention Gong Myoung?

1480
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,860
- There must be more.
- She did mention Gong Myoung.

1481
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,090
- There must be more.
- We need one of them to come.

1482
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,570
Let me reveal Ji Hyo's list.

1483
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,340
- Tom Hardy.
- Yes, Tom Hardy.

1484
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,470
- Brad Pitt.
- She likes foreign actors.

1485
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,110
So she likes foreign guys.

1486
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,280
Optimus Prime.

1487
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,010
- What?
- Optimus Prime?

1488
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,110
("Song Ji Hyo's Ideal Type is
Optimus Prime of 'Transformers'")

1489
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,110
- Come on!
- Really?

1490
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:18,970
- Come on! That's nonsense.
- The robot?

1491
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,070
- That's nonsense.
- Hey.

1492
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,110
But it's easy to make modifiers
for Optimus Prime.

1493
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,320
We could come up with something
like rusty Optimus Prime.

1494
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,180
Optimus Prime that smells
like gasoline.

1495
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,660
Let's start with So Min's.

1496
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,360
We have a few experts on our team.

1497
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,450
- We're experts.
- Let's start with So Min's.

1498
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,400
(Who is the first person
to compete against her ideal type?)

1499
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,990
The first one is Lee Je Hoon.

1500
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,130
We know how to deal with him.

1501
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,570
(The 1st candidate is Lee Je Hoon.)

1502
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,130
- That's a strong candidate.
- We can write whatever we want.

1503
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,430
Next is Se Chan.

1504
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,070
(It's Se Chan.)

1505
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,380
(Oh, gosh.)

1506
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,380
You should describe Je Hoon
on one board,

1507
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,070
and describe Se Chan
on the other one.

1508
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,590
(Which modifiers
will they come up with?)

1509
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,450
We should make something nice
for Se Chan.

1510
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,380
How about just ordinary Je Hoon...

1511
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,360
and Se Chan
who has ten million dollars?

1512
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,380
Actually, I don't really care
about that.

1513
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,490
- Really?
- Yes.

1514
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,700
Do you want us
to make it more instinctive?

1515
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,630
Se Chan who has one billion dollars.

1516
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,490
(Hesitating)

1517
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:11,630
That'd be more convincing.

1518
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,160
Then why should I see So Min?

1519
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,110
I wouldn't see her
if I had a billion dollars.

1520
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,410
- I wouldn't see her.
- Oh, really? This isn't right.

1521
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,700
How about a jobless Je Hoon
versus the head judge Se Chan?

1522
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,450
You need to make him jobless now?

1523
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,780
That's infuriating.

1524
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,840
They're going
for something materialistic.

1525
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,180
- We should...
- We need a different approach.

1526
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,240
We're different.
We're going after So Min's emotions.

1527
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,450
- Is that so?
- We're after her emotions.

1528
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,450
Shall we check out the modifiers
that Single Dot-com wrote?

1529
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,450
So Min, you should think through...

1530
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,030
and choose the company that came up
with more difficult choices.

1531
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,200
- Hey, hey!
- I'm so happy though.

1532
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,800
Just the thought of it
makes me happy.

1533
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,530
We'll reveal ours now.

1534
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:44,930
- All right.
- First.

1535
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,740
Se Chan who only loves So Min
all his life.

1536
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,740
He doesn't love anyone else
all his life.

1537
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,410
- Never.
- That already makes my heart beat.

1538
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,650
- What's with you?
- That one's okay.

1539
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,010
- He has no one else.
- No one at all.

1540
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,150
- And...
- This is driving me crazy.

1541
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,820
It's time to describe Je Hoon.

1542
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,680
- You're not exclusive with him.
- You don't know how it'll turn out.

1543
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,820
You're seeing him nonexclusively.

1544
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,880
- Hold on.
- It's not exclusive.

1545
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,180
(Devoted Se Chan
versus nonexclusive Je Hoon)

1546
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,820
I'm seeing Je Hoon?

1547
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,160
- Yes, you're seeing him.
- But you'll only love me.

1548
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,160
That's right.

1549
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:13,400
- Wow, this is hard.
- She's actually contemplating.

1550
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,450
I think I would too.

1551
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,660
But you can lose Je Hoon anytime.

1552
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,470
He could be seeing someone else
at the same time...

1553
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,930
- since it's not exclusive.
- Let's be more specific.

1554
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,240
He's dating you.

1555
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,510
Does he pat me
on the head sometimes?

1556
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,510
- Of course he does.
- Does he pat my head?

1557
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,050
- And we text each other every hour?
- Totally.

1558
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,150
- Of course.
- But you guys aren't exclusive.

1559
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,010
- No, they're not.
- They're not.

1560
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,740
This is actually hard.

1561
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,090
Think about this.
Even when we're shooting this,

1562
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,590
Je Hoon is constantly texting you.

1563
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,490
(What are you up to, So Min?)

1564
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:44,090
- Right now. "When does it end?"
- But Je Hoon is not guaranteed.

1565
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,930
Se Chan is guaranteed
to love you all your life.

1566
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:47,950
- He's guaranteed.
- He is.

1567
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,900
So Min.
So Min, you're the love of my life.

1568
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,990
Don't talk like a fool!

1569
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,360
(He's used to acting like a fool.)

1570
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,470
(This is not what we want!)

1571
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:58,430
- That's not what we're going for.
- Don't talk like a fool!

1572
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:59,740
This isn't what we want!

1573
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,280
- That's not how you should talk.
- I'm rich too.

1574
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,550
- Talk like a man.
- Okay.

1575
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,340
Se Chan,
you can't change how you talk.

1576
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,780
You shouldn't talk like that.

1577
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,610
All right. Remember how you felt.

1578
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:09,780
Now let's check out
Married Corporation's.

1579
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,990
- Ours was intense.
- That was great.

1580
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,360
So Min thought a lot.

1581
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,590
I'm good at this.

1582
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,990
We also prepared 2 options.
Let's check out the 1st one.

1583
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,160
- Here.
- I'll cover it.

1584
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,660
You're dating Je Hoon,

1585
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,320
- but you can't meet him.
- You can't meet him.

1586
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,300
He has to live
in Europe all his life.

1587
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,160
You're dating Se Chan,
but you can't touch him.

1588
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,700
But you can't touch him.

1589
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,510
- How does it sound?
- She can't touch me?

1590
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,840
- What do you think?
- It's hard to pick one, right?

1591
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,650
- You're...
- Of course she'd pick Je Hoon.

1592
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,800
They can't touch each other?

1593
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,280
It's like Adam the cyber singer.

1594
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,280
Of course she'd pick Je Hoon.

1595
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,610
- But she can't meet him for life.
- Never in her life.

1596
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:43,610
- Still...
- But they're seeing each other.

1597
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:44,880
But they can't meet each other.

1598
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,220
- Hang on.
- She can't touch him?

1599
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,450
Then can I video chat with him?

1600
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,530
- Yes, you can.
- You can do everything.

1601
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,990
- He tells you he loves you.
- For all his life.

1602
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,030
Je Hoon is crazy about you.

1603
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,800
- He really loves you.
- But you can't meet him.

1604
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,030
- He only loves you.
- What's this?

1605
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,160
- He only loves you.
- You can't even eat with him.

1606
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,030
Everyone in Korea knows
that you're his girlfriend.

1607
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,860
- But they can't meet each other.
- That's right.

1608
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,860
Let us give you an easier option.

1609
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,200
- How's this?
- Je Hoon who is half animal...

1610
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,380
- versus human Se Chan.
- You jerks!

1611
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,800
(Half-animal Je Hoon...)

1612
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,340
(versus human Se Chan)

1613
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,470
- Are you kidding me?
- Je Hoon is half animal.

1614
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,050
How could you compare an animal...

1615
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,010
- So Min!
- to a human?

1616
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:17,010
A centaur. He's a centaur.

1617
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,510
- He walks like this.
- So Min.

1618
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,010
- So the upper body...
- He's a centaur.

1619
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,780
The upper body is Je Hoon,

1620
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,320
but the lower body is a horse.

1621
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,360
And he lives in a stable.

1622
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,530
- And I'm a human?
- Yes, you are.

1623
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,720
Why would you even think about it?

1624
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,760
(Contemplating)

1625
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,760
But Je Hoon calls So Min like this.

1626
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,570
He calls her like this.

1627
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,630
(He has to neigh
when he talks to So Min.)

1628
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,510
- His lower body could be fish.
- That's possible.

1629
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,570
- That's nonsense.
- I'll leave it to your imagination.

1630
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:39,970
All right.

1631
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,280
- I've made up my mind.
- Have you?

1632
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,410
Pick a team that gave you
more difficult options.

1633
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,380
Both teams gave me
difficult options,

1634
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,320
but this team's options
were more difficult.

1635
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,340
Yes!

1636
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,820
(She picks Single Dot-com.)

1637
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,450
- Yes, we were more convincing.
- They're trying too hard.

1638
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,360
- This is not fair.
- It wasn't fun.

1639
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,160
You should've made it
more realistic.

1640
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,800
I'll pick Se Chan
from their options.

1641
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,200
- What?
- I'd pick Se Chan.

1642
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,220
- You'd pick Se Chan?
- Yes, I'd definitely pick Se Chan.

1643
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,430
Of course you have to meet
each other.

1644
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,740
You turned the innocent Je Hoon...

1645
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,200
into a centaur.

1646
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:10,070
- Come on.
- Who would you pick?

1647
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:11,630
Seriously...

1648
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,070
(Giving a point to Single Dot-com)

1649
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:14,970
Next is Ji Hyo.

1650
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,150
Ji Hyo.

1651
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,650
- It'll be fun.
- We need to know what she's after.

1652
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,610
(Who will be the first
to be picked?)

1653
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,240
- It's Jong Kook.
- That's great.

1654
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,280
(Jong Kook is picked.)

1655
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,610
- That's great.
- It's me?

1656
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:25,910
- Jong Kook...
- That's great news.

1657
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,660
They'll come up
with all sorts of horrible ideas.

1658
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,630
It's Won Bin.

1659
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,130
Jong Kook and Won Bin?

1660
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,260
- We got this.
- It's worth trying.

1661
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,070
- It's worth trying.
- Let's just write down everything.

1662
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,660
I suddenly got a surge of ideas.

1663
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,840
- Won Bin.
- You need to know what exactly...

1664
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,240
Ji Hyo wants in men.

1665
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,840
- Right.
- But it must be a little difficult.

1666
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,970
- I know.
- Right. She's difficult to guess.

1667
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,550
Won Bin is too perfect...

1668
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:49,800
to compare to anyone.

1669
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,570
The Won Bin that we invented...

1670
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,610
- can't be loved by anyone.
- Is that so?

1671
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,090
- It's perfect for Ji Hyo.
- It's actually possible.

1672
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,220
Ji Hyo would never meet this version
of Won Bin no matter what.

1673
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,030
What could it be?
I can't wait to find out.

1674
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,720
Shall we check out theirs first
this time?

1675
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,860
- Married Corporation.
- Married Corporation.

1676
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,490
Here are our options.

1677
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,490
A 60-year-old Jong Kook
who only loves Ji Hyo,

1678
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,130
but he's a mama's boy.

1679
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,660
He needs to get his mom's permission
for everything.

1680
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,340
"Mom, can I eat?"

1681
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,030
- He asks everything.
- "Mom, can I go to the bathroom?"

1682
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:19,280
- When he's 60?
- But he loves Ji Hyo dearly.

1683
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,740
And a pure 11-year-old boy
Won Bin...

1684
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,700
- who only loves Ji Hyo.
- He's only 11 years old.

1685
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,880
He's a baby. She needs to raise him.

1686
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,010
She's supposed
to see an 11-year-old boy?

1687
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,880
- But he only loves you.
- He's 11 years old?

1688
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,340
That makes him a little kid.

1689
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,760
- He's only in third grade.
- Yes, he's a kid.

1690
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:36,130
But Jong Kook is really young
compared to his age.

1691
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,160
He's really young,

1692
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,160
- but he asks his mom everything.
- He's a mama's boy.

1693
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,450
- He's a mama's boy.
- "Mom, can I kiss Ji Hyo?"

1694
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,930
- That's right.
- "Can I have pork cutlet with her?"

1695
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:43,930
- This is...
- I ask her permission to kiss?

1696
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,070
Yes, you do.

1697
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,700
When he's about to kiss her,
he'd call his mom and ask,

1698
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,570
"Mom, can I kiss Ji Hyo?"

1699
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:50,860
- "Would that be okay?"
- "I think it's time I kiss her."

1700
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,280
- When I'm 60?
- "Mom."

1701
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,930
- Yes, you are.
- I'm 60.

1702
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,650
That's just not right.

1703
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,650
Then Won Bin is a better option.

1704
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:01,840
He's so much better.

1705
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,490
Okay, it seems like
you don't like it.

1706
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,260
We have another option here.

1707
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,280
- All right. Here it comes.
- Yes.

1708
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,630
Jong Kook who only wears
a sleeveless shirt and slippers...

1709
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,900
despite the weather and occasion,

1710
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,900
versus Won Bin who is half animal.

1711
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,090
(Jong Kook who only wears
a sleeveless shirt and slippers...)

1712
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,430
(versus half-animal Won Bin)

1713
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,400
- Why do you love centaurs so much?
- Why do you keep bringing that up?

1714
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,990
- You're just...
- But that keeps the balance.

1715
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,430
That's the only option
that keeps the balance.

1716
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:22,470
- That keeps the balance.
- That keeps the balance.

1717
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,410
Why do you compare us with centaurs?

1718
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,680
We tried to use several options,

1719
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,240
- And he's even faster than Je Hoon.
- but this is only right.

1720
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,840
Why do they
keep bringing up centaurs?

1721
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,910
Of course Jong Kook is better.

1722
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,510
How dare you compare me to that?

1723
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:34,950
I know it's Won Bin,
but it's still mean.

1724
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:36,990
He's a centaur, but you can't tell
if he's seated.

1725
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,880
- You won't be able to tell.
- Even if he's seated...

1726
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,590
- You'd never know.
- What if he stands up?

1727
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:41,590
What if he stands up?

1728
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,090
And Won Bin cares for Ji Hyo a lot.

1729
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:45,660
Why would you call it even
by making the centaur seated?

1730
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,530
- That's not true.
- Don't be so serious.

1731
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,470
- He looked so serious.
- How can he be always seated?

1732
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,490
His lower body can turn into
any animals he wants.

1733
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,590
- The upper body is Won Bin,
- That's right.

1734
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,240
but the lower body is a bear.
That'd be really cool.

1735
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,130
- That's not cool at all.
- You think a bear is cool?

1736
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,700
He'd have no problem
being on social media.

1737
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,700
On top of that, he's even faster
than cars when he runs.

1738
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:05,010
That could be his strength.

1739
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,240
Let's hear from Single Dot-com.

1740
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,720
- I can't wait.
- We reflected...

1741
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,550
- what Ji Hyo wants in men.
- Is that so?

1742
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,660
We thought about what she despises.

1743
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,180
- Won Bin...
- Here we go.

1744
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,930
Won Bin who has a mouth
where moths keep coming out.

1745
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,130
(Won Bin who has a mouth
where moths keep coming out?)

1746
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,090
- From his mouth...
- Hey, hey!

1747
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,090
- That's Sha Wujing.
- Hey.

1748
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:25,990
(She shudders as she hates insects.)

1749
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:27,800
Every time he talks, moths come out.

1750
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,470
- "I'll destroy you all!"
- That's too much.

1751
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,570
- "I'll destroy you all!"
- That's too much.

1752
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,700
Ji Hyo, when he sneezes...

1753
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:38,820
(When he opens his mouth,
an eclipse of moths comes out.)

1754
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,380
- That's too much.
- "I'll destroy you all!"

1755
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,450
You know the powder
from moths, right?

1756
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,450
The moth powder.

1757
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,260
You need to vacuum constantly.

1758
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,720
- Moths come out of his mouth?
- They keep coming out.

1759
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,160
- And?
- Next is Jong Kook.

1760
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:53,200
Jong Kook who eats
cockroach protein every day.

1761
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:54,900
Cockroach protein?

1762
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,930
He eats it every day.

1763
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,530
- That's not bad.
- It's not a bad thing.

1764
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,990
It's not like he eats cockroaches.
He eats the protein.

1765
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:02,010
- He eats cockroaches.
- He needs to grind them.

1766
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,840
- He needs to grind cockroaches?
- He eats the ground cockroaches.

1767
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,180
- That's right.
- And you can see their legs.

1768
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:08,610
But you can still see the legs
between his teeth.

1769
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,280
Ji Hyo hates insects.

1770
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,110
- That's why you chose that.
- Right. She hates insects.

1771
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:13,570
Even when Won Bin is sleeping...

1772
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,650
(Moths come out of his mouth
even when he's sleeping.)

1773
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,490
For Jong Kook...
When you're on a date with him,

1774
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:19,950
- he'd go, "The feelers got stuck."
- Gross!

1775
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,050
That's the worst.

1776
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,550
I don't think she can choose one.

1777
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:24,820
- It's too hard.
- And he only loves you.

1778
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,490
A forever pure Won Bin
who is still a child.

1779
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,090
How can she see him when he has
moths coming out of his mouth?

1780
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:32,160
- Yes, moths come out of his mouth.
- Our options are more difficult.

1781
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,260
They're both difficult.

1782
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,970
- And he constantly...
- Cockroaches?

1783
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:35,970
(Which team will she pick?)

1784
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:37,160
I'll pick...

1785
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,070
- Single Dot-com.
- All right!

1786
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,070
(Won Bin with moths coming out
of his mouth)

1787
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:42,470
(Single Dot-com
wins twice in a row.)

1788
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:44,680
Yes. We know Ji Hyo so well.

1789
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,880
- I knew it.
- It's So Min's turn again.

1790
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,010
- It's Gong Myoung.
- This is...

1791
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:52,450
Actually, the guy that So Min likes
the most...

1792
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:53,550
She must like him the most.

1793
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,110
- is Gong Myoung.
- Gong Myoung.

1794
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,950
Gong Myoung goes to my gym.

1795
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,260
Let me see.

1796
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,260
- It's Jae Suk.
- We got this. All right.

1797
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,820
- We got this.
- It's Jae Suk.

1798
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:03,160
(Exclaiming)

1799
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,240
- We got this.
- Let's make him a centaur.

1800
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,570
Let's make him a centaur.

1801
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,070
- Let's make him a centaur.
- We got this.

1802
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:10,110
Let's make him a centaur.

1803
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,410
Let's say Jong Kook has eight...

1804
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,240
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

1805
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,280
- Isn't this...
- Show it to us. What is it?

1806
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,740
- Isn't this too mean?
- I haven't made up my mind yet.

1807
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,450
An ordinary grasshopper Jae Suk
who lives in a rice paddy.

1808
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,550
(They can't make it a competition
between humans.)

1809
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:23,450
- That's...
- Come on, Mr. Lee.

1810
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,360
- But you look so kindhearted.
- Right next to marsh snails.

1811
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,360
In peace.

1812
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,820
- We...
- We came up with...

1813
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,630
They both love So Min dearly.

1814
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,260
- That's nice.
- They love her so much.

1815
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,900
- She's finally found her love?
- He doesn't have moths either.

1816
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:33,950
- That's good.
- We made it realistic.

1817
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,660
- All right.
- Oh, gosh.

1818
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,700
Gong Myoung is so busy
that you can only meet once a year.

1819
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,630
But he loves So Min so much.

1820
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:42,840
- That's nice.
- You can see him only once.

1821
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,860
- Only once a year.
- Only once a year.

1822
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,070
- Next is...
- It's not that bad.

1823
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:49,010
You meet him every day,
but he nags you a lot.

1824
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,570
- Jobless Jae Suk.
- He's jobless.

1825
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:51,780
- He has no job?
- No, he doesn't.

1826
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,380
- But this is...
- He's jobless.

1827
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,680
- You don't know which she'll pick.
- I'd pick...

1828
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,990
- Of course she'd pick Jae Suk.
- It's...

1829
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:56,990
But...

1830
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,320
But So Min hates it
when someone nags her.

1831
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,660
But he doesn't work.

1832
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,050
If Jae Suk is jobless...

1833
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:05,430
- That's right.
- It's not the Jae Suk we know.

1834
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,950
- It's not.
- He'd go, "Back in my heyday,"

1835
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,860
- "I used to be on so many shows."
- Oh, gosh.

1836
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:10,860
(She's tired of him already.)

1837
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,990
"If you think back..."

1838
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,070
What do you know about me?

1839
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,800
You can't get mad.

1840
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,530
- "Back in my day..."
- "You shouldn't live like this."

1841
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:20,800
You're getting headaches, right?
Do you want to hear ours?

1842
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,380
All right. Ours is very simple.
It's very intuitive.

1843
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,380
- All right.
- We...

1844
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,450
Jae Suk who has nipples
right next to his belly button,

1845
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,450
My goodness.

1846
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,840
versus Gong Myoung
who has eight nipples.

1847
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,050
(Jae Suk who has nipples
right next to his belly button...)

1848
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:35,050
(versus Gong Myoung
who has eight nipples)

1849
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,260
- It's better to have 8 nipples!
- It's better to have 8 nipples!

1850
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,320
- It's better to have eight nipples!
- Of course.

1851
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,590
It's better to have more
than having them in the wrong place!

1852
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:42,630
Of course it's better
to have eight nipples.

1853
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,760
- Wait. His belly button...
- It's better to have eight nipples!

1854
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:46,590
- But...
- Next to his belly button?

1855
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:48,300
They're around here.

1856
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,070
So they're a little lower
than where they are right now.

1857
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,630
- You can't even see them.
- Then Gong Myoung is way better.

1858
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,280
- No, it's because...
- Are they lined up in a row?

1859
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,970
I think it'll be like this.

1860
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:56,650
When I hug him like this,
he'd stop me.

1861
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,180
He'd stop me
whenever I try to hug him...

1862
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,970
because his nipples
are all over the place.

1863
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,110
So Min, please pick one.

1864
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:04,410
You can get them removed
with a laser.

1865
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,050
Actually, they're both very hard
to choose from.

1866
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,720
The one that's more difficult...

1867
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,950
(Married Corporation's options)

1868
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:13,050
(Jae Suk versus Gong Myoung
with 8 nipples)

1869
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,860
(Single Dot-com's options)

1870
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,630
(Gong Myoung she can meet only once
versus jobless and nagging Jae Suk)

1871
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:20,070
The one that's more difficult...

1872
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,470
- is Married Corporation's.
- Right?

1873
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,360
(Married Corporation gets
their first win.)

1874
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,700
- Right? It's hard, right?
- It's really hard.

1875
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,970
It's definitely difficult to pick.

1876
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,450
I think I can pick one
from their options.

1877
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:31,780
- Nice.
- It's Ji Hyo's turn.

1878
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:33,570
It's Brad Pitt.

1879
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:37,240
- That's a strong opponent.
- It's hard.

1880
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,320
(Who's going up against Brad Pitt?)

1881
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,990
- He's a playboy.
- It's Kwang Soo.

1882
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,320
(Kwang Soo got picked.)

1883
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,360
(Bitter)

1884
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,720
- What is it?
- Hold on.

1885
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,820
- We don't need to...
- We already have an answer.

1886
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,090
I'm sorry, but are you going to
make him a centaur again?

1887
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,320
- No, we won't.
- You can't use that option again!

1888
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,340
Wait. Isn't he already half-animal?

1889
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,970
Are you calling me half-animal?

1890
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,360
Aren't those giraffe legs?

1891
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,800
- No, they're mine.
- Oh, really?

1892
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,910
(Laughing)

1893
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,180
This is the most difficult one
we've come up with.

1894
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,740
- It's so funny.
- It's difficult?

1895
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,450
- It's really difficult.
- It's really hard.

1896
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:09,880
- This time...
- Let's see theirs first.

1897
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,510
- Okay, we'll show ours first.
- It's too difficult.

1898
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:12,910
- It's really difficult.
- Please help her pick one.

1899
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:13,990
It's very difficult.

1900
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,750
- It's Brad Pitt versus Kwang Soo.
- Okay.

1901
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,230
- Brad Pitt who is 30cm tall.
- 30cm?

1902
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:23,930
(Brad Pitt who is 30cm tall.)

1903
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:26,060
- Brad Pitt.
- Then he's only this big.

1904
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,620
- He's like an action figure.
- He's really cute.

1905
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:28,790
- He's cute.
- He needs to be alive too.

1906
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:31,040
He's small but really handsome.

1907
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,060
Just as good-looking as he is.

1908
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,730
He learned to speak Korean,

1909
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,830
so you can communicate with him.

1910
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:39,870
- And he's as rich as now.
- Next is...

1911
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,600
- Kwang Soo.
- How tall will he be?

1912
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,080
Kwang Soo who is 30m tall.

1913
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,310
(A giant who is 30m tall)

1914
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:47,440
(Brad Pitt who's 30cm tall
versus Kwang Soo who's 30m tall)

1915
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,660
Why does he keep
exaggerating my height?

1916
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,480
- What's wrong with it?
- Is he a skyscraper or something?

1917
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,120
- What is he, a skyscraper?
- This is nonsense.

1918
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,660
- He's 30m tall.
- Does that even make sense?

1919
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:58,930
He'd get caught
between electric wires!

1920
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:01,500
- I don't care about that.
- We don't care!

1921
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,830
I don't care about that.

1922
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,640
- Wow, this is really difficult.
- Right.

1923
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,810
- Brad Pitt...
- Then Brad would be way better...

1924
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:07,940
since he's only 30cm tall.

1925
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,310
What use will he be
if he's 30m tall?

1926
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:10,980
What? We don't care about that.

1927
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,230
If he's 30cm tall,
you can at least talk to him.

1928
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,310
We don't care about that.

1929
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,310
I mean,
he can live on the first floor...

1930
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,180
and hang his laundry on the rooftop.

1931
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:19,040
Why would I hang my laundry
on the rooftop?

1932
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,120
- Yes.
- This is really difficult.

1933
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,850
- It is, right?
- You'll definitely pick us.

1934
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,210
- All right.
- 30m?

1935
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:26,520
He developed a symptom...

1936
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,730
where he loses control at night.

1937
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,230
Brad Pitt who wets his bed
every night.

1938
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:33,330
But he pees a lot.

1939
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:35,770
- Okay.
- It can't be covered with a diaper.

1940
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:39,040
And Kwang Soo who is potty-trained.

1941
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,960
(Brad Pitt who wets his bed
versus potty-trained Kwang Soo)

1942
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,140
He's really well-trained.

1943
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:46,540
I was going to make it
difficult for her to choose.

1944
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,600
- But it's Kwang Soo.
- But this is...

1945
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,040
This is me. I am well potty-trained.

1946
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,040
I still don't like him.

1947
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,690
- Bedwetter Brad Pitt.
- Yes, he's a bedwetter.

1948
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,390
- But this is...
- Versus potty-trained Kwang Soo.

1949
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:57,020
- I think we got an answer.
- It's really easy.

1950
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,060
- I'd definitely pick Brad Pitt.
- And he's super rich.

1951
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,430
I'd definitely pick Brad Pitt.

1952
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:01,430
It's really easy.

1953
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,890
But he wets his bed every day.

1954
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:06,120
- He can wear diapers every day.
- He wets it twice a day.

1955
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,160
Let's say he dozes off
while in the movies.

1956
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,600
He doesn't fail to wet his pants.

1957
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:12,040
- It doesn't matter where he is.
- Right.

1958
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,540
- Once he falls asleep.
- He just wets his pants anywhere.

1959
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:14,870
- Once he closes his eyes.
- That's right.

1960
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:17,600
- I'm sure she'll still pick Brad.
- Of course.

1961
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,850
When Kwang Soo is potty-trained?

1962
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,910
He's normal. He's himself.

1963
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,080
It's so offensive
that they even mentioned this.

1964
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,620
It doesn't matter
whether you're potty-trained or not.

1965
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:29,020
Ji Hyo, give it a serious thought.

1966
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:30,350
- Be serious.
- Yes.

1967
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,250
- Ours is difficult too.
- It's difficult.

1968
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,520
- I know you contemplated.
- That's not hard at all.

1969
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,850
Brat Pitt who's 30cm tall
and Kwang Soo who's 30m tall.

1970
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:37,430
Being 30m tall doesn't make sense.

1971
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:39,060
Don't our options
make you contemplate?

1972
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,060
Right.

1973
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,230
Ours is more difficult.

1974
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,330
- You can't pick one.
- I've made up my mind.

1975
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,290
I made up my mind
as soon as I saw their options

1976
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:46,960
(Brad Pitt who wets his bed
versus potty-trained Kwang Soo)

1977
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,540
(Brad Pitt who's 30cm tall
versus Kwang Soo who's 30m tall)

1978
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:50,770
I'd pick Married Corporation.

1979
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:51,770
(She picked Married Corporation.)

1980
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:54,540
- Yes!
- Of course!

1981
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,580
It made you contemplate, right?

1982
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,750
- Really?
- Tell us why.

1983
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:58,750
It made you contemplate?

1984
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,410
She'd definitely pick Brad Pitt
for your options.

1985
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:01,440
- She'd pick Brad Pitt.
- She'd pick Brad Pitt.

1986
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,480
It's really easy.

1987
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,710
Of course I'd pick Brad Pitt.

1988
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,520
But it's against Kwang Soo
who is normal.

1989
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,730
Brad Pitt pees a lot.

1990
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:08,930
- Still...
- Are you looking down on Kwang Soo?

1991
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:10,430
Brad Pitt is rich,

1992
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:11,520
- so he can take care of himself.
- Of course.

1993
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,870
I make enough money too!

1994
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,120
- But Kwang Soo is normal.
- So what if he's a bedwetter?

1995
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,040
But is Kwang Soo
really potty-trained?

1996
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,910
- What is he talking about?
- It leaks a little, actually.

1997
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:20,940
Hey!

1998
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,830
- It's true.
- It leaks a little.

1999
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,310
Your underwear is a bit wet.

2000
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,270
I don't have residual urine.

2001
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,080
Are you saying
I have residual urine?

2002
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,940
- Poor you.
- I'm not kidding.

2003
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,940
- The normal Kwang Soo lost.
- She must really not like you.

2004
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:32,980
The normal Kwang Soo lost.

2005
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,710
When I'm well potty-trained.

2006
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:36,310
No, Kwang Soo. I love you.

2007
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:37,310
(Current number of stickers)

2008
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,350
You're going to play
the final mission.

2009
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:40,960
Here's how you'll choose
the company.

2010
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,480
The clients have given situations...

2011
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,600
where they determine
their ideal types.

2012
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:46,270
You will have two minutes.

2013
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:49,870
For two minutes,
become a client's ideal type.

2014
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:53,160
A representative from each team
will play the role.

2015
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,770
- It's about playing a role.
- That's right.

2016
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:57,410
- Can it be any member of the team?
- From each team,

2017
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:59,600
there should be 1 for So Min
and 1 for Ji Hyo.

2018
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,540
That team has
both Si Kyung and Se Chan.

2019
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,790
I will explain So Min's situation
for an ideal type.

2020
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:09,960
You will go to a female friend
who is drinking after a breakup...

2021
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,850
and confess your love.

2022
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,230
In other words,
So Min is drinking...

2023
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,000
after breaking up
with her boyfriend.

2024
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,600
You will play a man who goes to her
and confesses his love.

2025
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,600
- So the man is confessing to me?
- That's right.

2026
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,330
You only saw him as a friend,

2027
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,100
but he will confess his love
as an ideal type.

2028
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,540
- So suddenly?
- So...

2029
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,330
So Min is feeling sad...

2030
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:32,370
when a friend visits,

2031
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,480
and he confesses his love.

2032
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,520
- Si Kyung should go.
- Okay.

2033
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,680
All right.

2034
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:39,210
Who will represent the team?

2035
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:40,480
Yong Jin.

2036
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,710
Please go in there...

2037
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,390
and change into an outfit.

2038
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:45,120
(What kind of a male friend
will they play?)

2039
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,190
(They change into the outfit
the stylists prepared.)

2040
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:49,020
We need to get changed...

2041
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,100
for the date.

2042
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:53,790
I would have gone, "Gosh, you fool."

2043
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,500
"Why did you take a detour
before coming to me?"

2044
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,540
Seriously.

2045
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,440
Saying I love you

2046
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,410
Seriously.

2047
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,830
"Why did you take a detour?"

2048
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,140
(Se Chan thinks about confessing
with background music.)

2049
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,370
One sentence is enough.

2050
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:09,270
One sentence is enough.
He will look at me...

2051
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:11,180
while I am drunk and go,

2052
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:12,350
"Hey,"

2053
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,640
"can I kiss you?"

2054
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:15,890
(Kissing)

2055
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:17,890
So Min, I am sorry,

2056
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,190
- but...
- Should I stop?

2057
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:21,580
don't live vicariously through us.

2058
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,400
- "Don't live vicariously."
- I am happy.

2059
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,990
- Are you happy?
- I am happy.

2060
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,320
I like this segment.

2061
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:28,960
(The male friends arrive to make
So Min's heart flutter even more.)

2062
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,600
Please stand over there.

2063
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,140
Is that the boyfriend look?

2064
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:33,160
(The male friends arrive to make
So Min's heart flutter even more.)

2065
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,660
- That's the boyfriend look.
- The boyfriend look.

2066
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,640
- They look different.
- They really dressed up.

2067
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,810
(Her excitement level is
at its max already.)

2068
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:44,110
(After a breakup,
So Min drinks alone at a cart bar.)

2069
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:48,280
(Her male friend comes to her.)

2070
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,060
So Min, you are here.

2071
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,750
Hey,

2072
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:55,060
why are you drinking alone?
Let's drink together.

2073
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:56,860
- I don't even know.
- Hey.

2074
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:58,400
- What? Give it to me.
- Give it to me.

2075
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,900
- Gosh.
- I will pour it.

2076
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,200
- What?
- What's wrong this time?

2077
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:04,100
Did things end badly with him?

2078
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:11,070
(The cringe-worthy drama
draws everyone in.)

2079
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:12,530
You can tell me anything.

2080
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,040
- Drink slowly.
- I mean...

2081
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,810
Drink slowly.
I will pour it for you.

2082
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,650
Why are you acting strange?
What's up with you?

2083
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:18,820
What's up with you today?

2084
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:22,580
You will get drunk.
Don't get drunk so quickly.

2085
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,450
(Impressed)

2086
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:27,450
(The cringe-worthy line is perfect
for So Min!)

2087
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:29,280
It's like a youth drama.

2088
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:32,320
(The cringe-worthy line
makes her grin from ear to ear.)

2089
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:34,230
(Si Kyung feels pressured
about going next.)

2090
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:35,930
It's not like that.

2091
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,900
I want to get drunk today.

2092
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,100
You shouldn't drink
on an empty stomach.

2093
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,860
Please bring us
some tropical fruits.

2094
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,700
(He picks tropical fruits
as a drinking snack.)

2095
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:46,870
Hold on.

2096
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,070
Where are they?

2097
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:51,150
- Are they at a nightclub?
- Tropical fruits.

2098
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:53,320
Why are you interrupting?

2099
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,540
This is my style.

2100
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:57,060
Tropical fruits.

2101
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:58,520
My goodness.

2102
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,690
He didn't ask
for some dried drinking snacks.

2103
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:01,150
- Where are they?
- Tropical fruits.

2104
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:03,490
(They try
to get back into character.)

2105
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,750
- Well...
- Yong Jin.

2106
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,100
- Tell me.
- Yong Jin is so funny.

2107
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,320
- What's up with you?
- I am fine.

2108
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,770
- What's up with you?
- Seeing you so upset...

2109
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:10,490
- makes me upset.
- You weren't like this.

2110
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:12,270
Why are you overreacting today?

2111
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:14,110
- Tell me.
- What's up with you?

2112
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,200
What happened?

2113
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,330
Why did you guys break up?

2114
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,850
He said he can't date me anymore
because we are too different.

2115
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:23,910
So Min is so funny.

2116
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,180
So Min is so into it.

2117
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,450
So Min is so into it.

2118
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,740
I told you that there are
only a few people in the world...

2119
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,250
who can deal with you.

2120
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:33,730
It makes no sense
because we get along so well.

2121
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,060
Hey, I think...

2122
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,860
it would be great if we...

2123
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,030
What?

2124
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,570
It would be great if we...

2125
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,160
(His confession of love
is barely heard.)

2126
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,740
- What?
- What is he doing?

2127
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,570
It would be great if we go out.

2128
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,780
(He ventriloquizes
to confess his love shyly.)

2129
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,480
I like it.

2130
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,180
- It isn't half bad.
- It's nice.

2131
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:58,520
- It's cute.
- It's nice.

2132
01:10:58,710 --> 01:10:59,990
I mean...

2133
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,110
Forget it. Keep drinking.

2134
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:02,150
- Drink.
- Did you say "make ramyeon?"

2135
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:03,190
No!

2136
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:04,750
- It would be great if we...
- What is up with you?

2137
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:07,280
He is spilling water
all over his chin.

2138
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,320
- You are acting strange.
- Do you regret it?

2139
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,650
Are you going to call him?

2140
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,120
I called him, but he didn't pick up.

2141
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,400
Then don't call him from now on.

2142
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,290
How could I not? I miss him.

2143
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,140
- I want us to get back together.
- Listen.

2144
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,640
Whenever you miss someone...

2145
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,770
or feel sad,

2146
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:21,830
call me.

2147
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:23,030
(Call me.)

2148
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:26,810
(He delivers his sincerity
with half air and half sound.)

2149
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,400
There are people just like him!

2150
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:31,450
It's so true.

2151
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:32,820
(The man who is going next
simply feels anxious.)

2152
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,190
This is nice.

2153
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,520
- What did you say?
- To be honest...

2154
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,820
Call you?

2155
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,580
Be quiet. I will do the talking now.

2156
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,230
What are you saying?
What is up with you?

2157
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,530
He is pretending to be manly.

2158
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,730
What is up with you?

2159
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:45,230
Now that he gained confidence,
he is pretending to be manly.

2160
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:47,430
So Min likes it.

2161
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:48,990
- I told you this before.
- What?

2162
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:52,160
I am the one
who understands you the best...

2163
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,570
- since childhood.
- I know that, but...

2164
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:57,310
- I watched over you for 20 years.
- I know that.

2165
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,680
You dated countless men,

2166
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,950
but I waited for you
without dating anyone.

2167
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,070
Don't be ridiculous.
You dated Ji Hyo.

2168
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:05,370
You dated Ji Hyo for three years.

2169
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:07,990
Someday in the future

2170
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,490
You dated Ji Hyo for three years.

2171
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:11,710
(The singer
with incredible techniques is back.)

2172
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:12,890
What?

2173
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,030
What is going on?

2174
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:17,030
He didn't answer her.

2175
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:20,200
- He is like a robot.
- If I wait endlessly

2176
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,940
(His confession of love is strange,
but she is drawn to it.)

2177
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,360
- There are words I haven't said
- It's nice.

2178
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,530
- Yong Jin is doing well.
- In my heart

2179
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,940
I love you

2180
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,650
- What?
- I told you how I feel...

2181
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,520
through a song.

2182
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,110
I am not in the mood for a laugh.

2183
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:41,850
It's not like that. How about me?

2184
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:43,410
He is a lunatic.

2185
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:44,560
A lunatic?

2186
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,080
- He is a lunatic.
- A lunatic!

2187
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:47,490
- Why? He was cool.
- Listen.

2188
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:49,780
- He was cool.
- He is a lunatic.

2189
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:52,650
- She was about to throw water.
- Good job. Yong Jin, it's over.

2190
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:53,900
- He is a lunatic.
- He was cool.

2191
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,120
- He is a lunatic.
- I showed my charismatic side.

2192
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,290
- You were cool.
- He is a lunatic.

2193
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:58,140
I would have found that charming.

2194
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,160
I loved it.

2195
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,240
I almost died when he sang.

2196
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,740
- Right?
- It's Si Kyung's turn.

2197
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,500
- I loved it.
- Here comes the real deal.

2198
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,900
He will show you how it's done.

2199
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,370
Yong Jin did everything funny.

2200
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,980
My goodness.

2201
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:09,370
You should keep it simple.

2202
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:11,070
- You should keep it simple.
- Okay.

2203
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:12,240
Keep it simple.

2204
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,320
- You don't need to be funny.
- Keep it simple.

2205
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,410
(Si Kyung visits her friend,
So Min.)

2206
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:17,690
- Hey.
- Hey, you're here.

2207
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:18,860
Why are you drinking alone?

2208
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:20,430
I'm in a bad mood today.

2209
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,320
Why? Did something happen?

2210
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,270
My boyfriend and I broke up.

2211
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,100
(He keeps his facial expression
utterly simple.)

2212
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,660
(She becomes overly absorbed.)

2213
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,830
She is absorbed.

2214
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:36,000
All right.

2215
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,240
I need a drink too. This won't do.

2216
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,610
Why do you need a drink?

2217
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,680
I am going to get drunk today,
so drop me off at home, okay?

2218
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:44,040
Let me think after a drink.

2219
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:53,750
(The talented balladeer shows
a luxurious way of drinking.)

2220
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:55,580
(Kudos)

2221
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:56,650
I can't believe...

2222
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:58,120
I can't believe he did that.

2223
01:13:58,450 --> 01:13:59,700
You can't beat that.

2224
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:02,120
You laughed!

2225
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:04,900
You laughed!

2226
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,240
(He succeeded to make her laugh.)

2227
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,460
You can't beat
the repetition of the opening.

2228
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:10,810
- I was forgetting it.
- He repeated it.

2229
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:12,530
You can't beat
the repetition of the opening.

2230
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:15,180
- Comedy is all about repetition.
- He is a professional.

2231
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,540
That was...

2232
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:17,650
You are the prettiest
when you smile.

2233
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:19,610
What was that? Seriously.

2234
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:21,690
Hey, why did you do that?
You made me laugh.

2235
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,080
You made me laugh.
Seriously, you did.

2236
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,320
- You made me laugh.
- Get started, Si Kyung.

2237
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,030
I should have listened to you.

2238
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,750
Get started, Si Kyung.

2239
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:33,200
Someday in the future

2240
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,120
You will look back at me

2241
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:40,700
(His song knocks her out
right away.)

2242
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,440
- If I wait endlessly
- Si Kyung, you're a good singer.

2243
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,870
- Behind you
- It's nice.

2244
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:48,540
- Gosh, he is good. It's game over.
- If I wait endlessly

2245
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,150
(The married men are speechless.)

2246
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:52,210
My goodness.

2247
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,710
Today, I will sing for you...

2248
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,580
and do other things.

2249
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,210
So feel better.

2250
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:01,360
Why didn't you stop me
when I began dating him?

2251
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,900
That's because
you really seemed to like him.

2252
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,600
It's a drama.

2253
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,120
You should date someone you like.

2254
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,620
Kiss her.

2255
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,200
You should date someone you like.

2256
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,740
Kiss her.

2257
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:18,030
Don't interrupt! For goodness' sake!

2258
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,680
- Don't get too into it!
- What?

2259
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,850
This is the climax!

2260
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,150
It was getting interesting!
Why did you do that?

2261
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:25,570
- Are you insane?
- It's just that...

2262
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:26,950
You got too into it, didn't you?

2263
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:28,580
"Kiss her?"

2264
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:30,150
- Let's end it here.
- Okay.

2265
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,860
Si Kyung did pretty well too.

2266
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,190
Si Kyung repeated a moment
from the opening.

2267
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:36,790
There were a few great moments.

2268
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:38,100
Seriously.

2269
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,320
(How will So Min's heart decide?)

2270
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,070
Firstly, Si Kyung...

2271
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,990
really felt like a friend.

2272
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,240
But Yong Jin's performance
was funny and sad.

2273
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,660
It was funny and sad.

2274
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:50,400
I almost became sad...

2275
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,640
before I laughed.

2276
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:53,900
- I have regrets now that it's over.
- It was embarrassing.

2277
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:54,900
You are getting more ideas, right?

2278
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:55,950
I should have acted drunk.

2279
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:57,850
I should have drunk more.

2280
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:59,680
Now comes Ji Hyo's situation.

2281
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,240
She is sitting at a cafe...

2282
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,750
when a man approaches
and makes a move on her.

2283
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,490
- I know who will go.
- We have the perfect member.

2284
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:06,650
We have...

2285
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:07,990
a member...

2286
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,690
who is like a secret weapon.

2287
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,430
- I see.
- Suk Jin will go.

2288
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,860
Suk Jin.

2289
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,740
(Who will go against Suk Jin,
the cool married man?)

2290
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,290
Who is it? Is it you?

2291
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:20,860
(It's Se Chan, a single man.)

2292
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,480
In this situation,

2293
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,110
I would approach the woman
more playfully.

2294
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,850
I wouldn't go,

2295
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,540
"Excuse me.
You are exactly my type."

2296
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,020
"Hey, what are you doing?"

2297
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,820
"Hey, what are you doing?"

2298
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:34,350
What?

2299
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:35,990
- Hey.
- I hate it.

2300
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,250
It's the worst.

2301
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,490
Isn't that a thug?

2302
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:39,910
I mean...

2303
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:41,360
"What a pretty picture you make!"

2304
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,490
(He should be thankful
if she doesn't call the police.)

2305
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:46,320
- Wouldn't that ease the tension?
- Se Chan, you will go first.

2306
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,570
- Will Se Chan go first?
- Begin as soon as you enter.

2307
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:49,570
Good luck.

2308
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:51,330
- I am excited about this.
- This is a cafe, right?

2309
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:52,830
- I am excited about this.
- Se Chan.

2310
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:56,810
(Ji Hyo is drinking coffee
at a cafe.)

2311
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:59,980
Things like this don't happen
very often.

2312
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,610
It depends on the person.

2313
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:02,680
(A man musters up his courage
and approaches the beauty.)

2314
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,040
Gosh.

2315
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:10,320
(He has a clear concept.)

2316
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,780
Gosh, the air is nice.

2317
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,690
My goodness.

2318
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,250
(His strong first impression
makes them look away.)

2319
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,390
What are you looking at?

2320
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:18,150
Am I a spectacle?

2321
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:21,400
- Gosh, this is...
- Am I a spectacle?

2322
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,230
You can't use a character like that.

2323
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:24,640
Bring me a glass of beer.

2324
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:28,240
Gosh, who is this?

2325
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,830
This is insane.

2326
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:32,900
I shouldn't have bought this.

2327
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,310
(He means that she is more beautiful
than flowers.)

2328
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,240
Take this.

2329
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,280
(The straightforward man
hands over a bouquet right away.)

2330
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,610
I fell for you at first sight.

2331
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,350
Seriously.

2332
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:45,210
Are you going to ignore my hand?

2333
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:47,190
Take it.

2334
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,450
Go ahead and take it. My goodness.

2335
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,430
Ji Hyo looks a bit annoyed.

2336
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,730
Is the seat empty?

2337
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:58,740
- "Is the seat empty?"
- Yes.

2338
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,110
Hurry up and bring me
a glass of beer!

2339
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,700
Where is he from?
What is up with that accent?

2340
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,740
(He has accents
from all over the nation.)

2341
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:05,740
It's nice to meet you, gal.

2342
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,450
(He is mixing up
all the accents he knows.)

2343
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,350
- "Gal?"
- It's nice to meet you.

2344
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,480
Why are you here alone?

2345
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:15,350
I just felt like being alone today.

2346
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:16,950
Do you have a boyfriend?

2347
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:17,950
(Straightforward)

2348
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:19,360
A boyfriend? Not yet.

2349
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:22,780
Then you should have
a drink with me today.

2350
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,730
That's the worst.

2351
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:27,070
- What do you think?
- That's so rude.

2352
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:28,360
- That's the worst.
- That's just wrong.

2353
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,570
That's the worst.

2354
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:32,270
- What do you think?
- I am becoming absorbed.

2355
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:35,140
How can I drink with you
when I saw you for the first time?

2356
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,240
- Seriously.
- I am a good man.

2357
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,330
Here is the beer you ordered.

2358
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:39,370
(A tall employee brings beer.)

2359
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:40,810
Hold on.

2360
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:43,350
Take this.

2361
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:44,850
(He slaps him as a tip.)

2362
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:46,990
(What?)

2363
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,190
(The employee is confused
by the tip.)

2364
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:49,240
There you go.

2365
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:50,910
That's it.

2366
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:51,990
(He succeeded to captivate
Ji Hyo's heart.)

2367
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:53,560
That's the way to do it.

2368
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:54,890
That's the way to do it.

2369
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:57,450
- Why is his hand wet?
- Go on your way.

2370
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,950
- Why is his hand wet?
- Go on your way, okay?

2371
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:02,460
That's it. That's the way to do it.

2372
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:03,770
That's the way to do it.

2373
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:04,830
(The tall employee gets scolded
for no reason.)

2374
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:06,360
(He is still confused
by the shocking tip.)

2375
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,640
- Look at his face.
- Let's have a drink.

2376
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,660
- Look at his face.
- The end.

2377
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,240
Ji Hyo didn't say anything.

2378
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:13,540
- It was hard.
- Good job.

2379
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,150
It was fitting.

2380
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,240
It was time for comedy.

2381
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,680
- Kwang Soo went along with it.
- It was so funny.

2382
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,150
- It was a comedy skit.
- Thank you.

2383
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:21,740
It was a difficult fight.

2384
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,560
It's too much.

2385
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:25,560
Is Se Chan done?

2386
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,150
(Will he be able to captivate
Ji Hyo's heart?)

2387
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:29,820
- Is it my turn?
- Suk Jin has experience.

2388
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:30,900
That's right.

2389
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,930
Suk Jin
will probably keep it gentle.

2390
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:34,460
It was so funny.

2391
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,290
(Seok Sam appears.)

2392
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:37,400
My goodness.

2393
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:38,900
(What is that?)

2394
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,860
- Oh, my goodness.
- He even has a tattoo.

2395
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,110
It's a work of art.

2396
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,610
Mom.

2397
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:44,680
(Mama's boy, Seok Sam)

2398
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,000
I am about to go crazy.

2399
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,570
He started off wrong.

2400
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:49,870
I had this thought.

2401
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,370
"I will make a move
if I see someone I like."

2402
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:53,850
He changed the concept.

2403
01:19:53,850 --> 01:19:54,910
(Laughing)

2404
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:56,190
Seriously.

2405
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:57,650
You like me, right?

2406
01:19:57,650 --> 01:19:58,710
(Charismatic man, Seok Sam)

2407
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,910
- What?
- You like me, right?

2408
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:01,430
"You like me, right?"

2409
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:02,890
Ji Hyo, you are here.

2410
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:03,930
(Se Chan comes to salvage
the situation.)

2411
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:05,820
- Who are you?
- Who are you, you punk?

2412
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:09,460
I should give you a tip.

2413
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,270
(Happy ending)

2414
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:13,440
(From a youth drama
to a comedy skit,)

2415
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,900
(they tried various genres.)

2416
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,110
It's time to announce
the final result.

2417
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:19,240
You never know
what the result will be.

2418
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,950
The score before this round was
6 to 6.

2419
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:22,950
- Yes.
- 6 to 6.

2420
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:25,980
This round will determine
the result,

2421
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,520
so please talk among yourselves
and pick a team.

2422
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,520
- All right.
- Okay.

2423
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,520
Then put a sticker on the CEO.

2424
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:35,230
As for me, both were the worst.

2425
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:37,750
(Ji Hyo refuses to pick one.)

2426
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,150
Which team should I pick?

2427
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:41,660
(The team So Min chooses will win!)

2428
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,140
(CEO Sung was like a real friend.)

2429
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,400
(CEO Lee was funny and sad.)

2430
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:49,440
We made up our minds.

2431
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:51,780
You never know
what the result will be.

2432
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:53,310
You never know.

2433
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:55,570
- 6 to 6.
- Okay.

2434
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:56,850
It's okay even if we lose.

2435
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,890
- We choose this team.
- What?

2436
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,610
(Their final choice is
Married Corporation.)

2437
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:05,190
(Married Corporation wins!)

2438
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,560
- We won.
- They didn't disappoint.

2439
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,250
- Thank you.
- We did a good job.

2440
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,150
I told you.

2441
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,660
(He stayed by her side
like a friend...)

2442
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:18,100
(and confessed his love
in a way that wasn't pushy.)

2443
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:22,830
(He has enough good cheer
to dance with her without music.)

2444
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:27,350
(He even showed his funny side
by using his vocal cords.)

2445
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:31,870
(He is an eccentric man
with a charismatic side.)

2446
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:33,910
- They didn't disappoint.
- Thank you.

2447
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,240
- All right.
- I am disappointed.

2448
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,250
(Ji Hyo couldn't find
her ideal type.)

2449
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,520
I am so disappointed.

2450
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:43,120
Thus, they finished their journey
of finding the ideal type.

2451
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,790
Three people from the winning team
will receive 3.75g of gold each.

2452
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,360
Thank you.

2453
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:49,100
(CEO, Senior Managing Director,
and Director win the gold.)

2454
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,240
(Manager Haha doesn't get any gold.)

2455
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,640
How was it today?

2456
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,830
It was my 1st time in 11 years
to be on Running Man.

2457
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,200
So it was very meaningful.

2458
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,940
Being an avatar was hard,

2459
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,740
but I will be satisfied
if you laughed a lot. Thank you.

2460
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:03,780
Thank you for your hard work.

2461
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,870
- Thank you.
- Okay.

2462
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:07,150
(We thank Lee Yong Jin
and Sung Si Kyung.)

2463
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:11,410
(10:08 a.m., Chinese restaurant)

2464
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:12,860
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

2465
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:16,060
(10:13 a.m., Korean restaurant)

2466
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,100
I lost.

2467
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,320
(10:26 a.m., Chinese restaurant again)

2468
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,320
You will receive five coins.

2469
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,700
- Really?
- Why?

2470
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:23,960
- Really?
- Why?

2471
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,290
(10:27 a.m., Korean restaurant again)

2472
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:27,660
You can go home right away.

2473
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:31,500
(27 minutes into the shoot,
Suk Jin goes home.)

2474
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,350
(11:04 a.m., In the car)

2475
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,610
You can go home.

2476
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,850
(Kwang Soo goes home
after 1 hour and 4 minutes.)

2477
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:39,870
Is this for real?

2478
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:43,390
(Some members get sent home
for real!)

2479
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:44,650
- Come on.
- For real?

2480
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:47,120
(11:10 a.m.)

2481
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,750
(10:31 a.m.)

2482
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,100
(11:24 a.m.)

2483
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:52,950
(10:48 a.m.)

2484
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:54,570
(11:31 a.m.)

2485
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:56,100
(11:19 a.m.)

2486
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,140
(11:44 a.m.)

2487
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,940
(11:27 a.m.)

2488
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,400
I will really go home. Bye.

2489
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,700
(For the first time
in the history of Running Man,)

2490
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,070
(some members go home for real
for no particular reason.)

2491
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:08,150
(Going Home Race, Read the Room)
