1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,960
(The fresh air of May
with the smell of summer)

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,390
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,500
Hello.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,670
- Hello, Se Chan.
- Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,690
Hello, Kwang Soo.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,840
I was enjoying a hot iced...
I mean...

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,980
I was reading an English newspaper
with a hot Americano.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,320
Good morning.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
(The English newspaper reader
with poor language ability)

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,480
- Hello.
- Hello. Good morning.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,640
Good morning.

13
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,690
Jae Suk,
do you think you are quick-witted?

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,930
I don't think I have quick wits.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,970
I'd rather say I'm slow-witted.

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,490
Then I have bad news for you.

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,510
Today, the members with quick wits
will get more coins.

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,230
It's called the Read the Room Race.

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,010
The Read the Room Race?

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,150
"The" is spelled T-H-E.

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,680
Are you kidding me?
Of course I know how it's spelled.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
(The English newspaper reader
just learned a new word.)

23
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,340
In today's race,

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,050
the coins are as important
as quick wits.

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,120
And the number of coins you get
will decide the time you go home.

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,130
(The number of coins they get
will decide the time they go home.)

27
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,020
If I win,
will I get to go home early?

28
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,230
If it ends quickly,

29
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,100
you might be able to go home
right away.

30
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,660
Oh, it's about what time we go home.

31
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,160
I'm serious now.

32
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,070
We'll now begin
the preliminary mission...

33
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,660
to get your first coins.

34
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,930
We have two restaurants
where you can have breakfast.

35
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,380
You can go to a restaurant you like
and have a satisfying breakfast.

36
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,070
I already had breakfast.
Why would I eat again?

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,020
- That means you're slow-witted.
- Gosh.

38
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,880
- I'm serious.
- What?

39
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,290
But the number of coins you can get
in each restaurant is different.

40
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,350
Is it different?

41
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,490
30 coins for the Chinese restaurant
and 80 coins for the Korean one.

42
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,490
(Chinese 30 coins,
Korean 80 coins)

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,320
My goodness.

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,570
You will split the coins evenly
with the members...

45
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,570
who come to the same restaurant
as you.

46
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,600
So you should go to the restaurant
that you think will be chosen...

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,840
by fewer members.

48
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,100
This is complicated.

49
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,040
I should go to the place
with fewer members...

50
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,380
in order to get more coins, right?

51
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,570
That's right.

52
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,680
I understand so quickly.
That means I'm quick-witted.

53
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,180
You can say I have quick wits.

54
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,960
I'll give you the information
on the restaurants...

55
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,280
and ten coins first.

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,180
- Do we start with ten coins?
- Yes.

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,860
(He's calling Se Chan.)

58
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,300
I should decide where to go.

59
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,150
- Hello?
- Hey.

60
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,220
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,090
You're going to
the Japanese restaurant, right?

62
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,060
(You're going to
the Japanese restaurant, right?)

63
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,300
(The options only include
Chinese and Korean restaurants.)

64
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,430
- Hello?
- Yes.

65
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,900
- Hey. You...
- Hey, what about the Vietnamese...

66
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,840
- Yes?
- Seriously,

67
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,270
you might jinx me.
You're the first one I called.

68
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,370
Don't be like that.

69
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,310
- Okay.
- Why would you say Japanese?

70
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,080
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

71
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,390
What did you eat yesterday?

72
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,360
I barely ate yesterday.

73
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,590
Why?

74
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,490
Did you have nothing to eat?
Did you have no appetite?

75
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,990
(Did you have no appetite?)

76
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,800
- Hey.
- Are you all right, Kwang Soo?

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Don't make me feel timid
from the beginning.

78
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,400
Are you okay, Kwang Soo?

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,990
(He wants to cheer up
Long Legs for no reason.)

80
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,800
I'll go to the Chinese restaurant.
I'm leaving now.

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,930
- I'll go to the Chinese one.
- Let's choose what sounds good.

82
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,960
Okay.

83
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,180
Call Kwang Soo Is Not a Fool.

84
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,740
Calling Kwang Soo Is Not a Fool.

85
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,770
(Calling Kwang Soo Is Not a Fool.)

86
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,150
- Is that how you saved his number?
- Yes, it is.

87
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,740
(He's always serious
about teasing Kwang Soo.)

88
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
- Hello?
- Where are you, Kwang Soo?

89
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,150
I'm now...

90
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,650
(Thinking of petty tricks)

91
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,180
I'm somewhere in the middle.

92
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,550
By the way,
I heard you're leaving our show.

93
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,330
(As if he didn't know before)

94
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,830
Why are you saying that
all of a sudden?

95
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,300
We were trying to decide
between Chinese or Korean food.

96
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,900
- Why?
- What are you talking about?

97
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,060
What's wrong?

98
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,670
- Why are you...
- I read the articles.

99
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,430
This isn't about the articles.

100
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,110
- I always have breakfast at home.
- I know.

101
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,470
I'll have to go
to the Chinese restaurant.

102
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,650
(Jae Suk threatens that he'll go
to the Chinese restaurant.)

103
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,050
Please go to the Chinese restaurant.

104
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,310
(Kwang Soo has decided to go
to the Chinese restaurant.)

105
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,310
Hello?

106
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,920
I heard you're leaving Running Man.

107
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,710
This is crazy.

108
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,050
- Are you all right?
- Why are you doing this?

109
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,860
Are you going to have your last meal
at a Korean restaurant or Chinese?

110
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,200
I mean...
You can just ask me that right away.

111
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
My gosh.

112
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,870
How do you feel
about leaving our show?

113
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,770
My goodness.

114
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,370
Kwang Soo.

115
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,080
I can't lie to you
when you're being like this.

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,270
(I can't lie to you
when you're being like this.)

117
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,900
(Kwang Soo, the guy who's leaving,
still has a grain of conscience.)

118
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,050
Now that you're leaving,
you should work even harder.

119
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,120
Gosh, I'm going
to the Chinese restaurant.

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,650
I'm going to the Chinese one.

121
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,480
Why is everyone being like this?

122
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,890
You're supposed to choose
between Korean and Chinese.

123
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,420
You're leaving our show.
Behave yourself.

124
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,850
(Kwang Soo arrives somewhere.)

125
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,570
(The restaurant he chose is...)

126
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,140
(The Chinese restaurant)

127
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,960
No one's here.

128
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,580
- Hey, you punk!
- No one's here.

129
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,010
(That's when he hears the roar.)

130
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,400
Jong Kook, did you really pick
the Chinese restaurant?

131
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,210
Hey, you must be out of your mind.

132
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,770
Jong Kook, no one else is here.

133
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,280
- What do you mean?
- No one else is in there.

134
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,910
Did you have breakfast?

135
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,060
I didn't.

136
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,420
You didn't?
You can't eat Chinese dishes...

137
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,560
on an empty stomach!

138
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,690
(You can't eat Chinese dishes
on an empty stomach!)

139
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,060
You should eat...

140
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,400
Korean food on an empty stomach.

141
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,920
I'll go to
the Korean restaurant then.

142
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,400
Okay. Start the day
with Korean food.

143
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,900
- Gosh, you...
- No one's here.

144
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,730
- I already told you.
- Jong Kook. It's just you and me.

145
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,440
Why would you have Chinese food
on an empty stomach?

146
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,900
You should eat some rice instead.

147
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,150
- I can't believe this.
- I'll have fried rice then.

148
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,170
Fried rice? That's too greasy.

149
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,980
Why are you here?
Let's just go in anyway.

150
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,110
(They go into the Chinese restaurant
with some scolding.)

151
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,260
Look. No one's in here.

152
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,650
Hello.

153
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,980
(However...)

154
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Kwang Soo.

155
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,390
I wanted to eat with you.

156
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,960
Hey, why did you...

157
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,130
- Hello.
- Come here. Stand in line.

158
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,200
Come over here.

159
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,840
- Jong Kook. I'm...
- Kwang Soo and...

160
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,770
- Jong Kook.
- Hang on. Kwang Soo,

161
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,570
now that you're leaving,
you're just doing whatever you want.

162
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,640
You never listen to me.

163
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,810
Gosh, it's not like that.

164
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,140
- Hey.
- Why is everyone...

165
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,340
Aren't you going to see me again?

166
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,670
Gosh, Jong Kook. No.

167
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,100
- It's nothing like that.
- Hang on.

168
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,410
- Kwang Soo.
- I'm just having Chinese food.

169
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,770
You know what?

170
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,890
It seems like...

171
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,750
you're trying to look sad
about leaving our show.

172
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,480
- You're growing a mustache.
- No.

173
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,890
That's not why.

174
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,960
- It's not like that.
- Look.

175
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,060
- It's like...
- No.

176
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,400
- You want to look distressed.
- That's not why.

177
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,900
- I know what you're up to.
- Hey.

178
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,220
- This is for a movie.
- You know what I mean.

179
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,400
Is anyone in there? Darn it!

180
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,960
- Darn it!
- I can't believe this.

181
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,710
- Why did you...
- I told you not to come!

182
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,340
I told these two not to come
earlier today.

183
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,730
I told you not to come.

184
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,310
- Why are you growing your mustache?
- No.

185
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,540
This is too contrived.

186
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,750
- My gosh.
- I just had to.

187
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,110
This isn't about my agony
or anything.

188
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,610
You pretend to be in anguish.

189
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,750
It's not like that.

190
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,850
- This is really annoying.
- I said no.

191
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,560
Hey, this isn't a drama.

192
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,610
Get me a razor.

193
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,850
This isn't anything like that.

194
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,130
- My gosh.
- Let's just sit.

195
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,960
I guess it's the four of us.

196
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,770
- I hope so.
- We don't know that.

197
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,410
And the thing is...

198
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,100
- Bo Pil.
- Yes?

199
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,780
Don't let Kwang Soo
pay for his meal.

200
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,170
Why not?

201
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,970
- I'll pay.
- You don't have to pay.

202
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,470
You don't have to.

203
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,540
(They're being generous to Kwang Soo
who's stingy about money.)

204
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,590
Well...

205
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,610
- This is crazy.
- Kwang Soo is...

206
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,610
I'll give all my coins to Kwang Soo.

207
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
You can keep all my coins.

208
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,050
- Don't do that.
- Keep the coins.

209
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,620
- Just take them.
- Why are you doing this?

210
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,850
Seriously, just take them.

211
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,620
- Why would you give me the coins?
- Let's give the coins to him.

212
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,990
- Let's give them to him at the end.
- I don't need them.

213
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,200
Why are you being like this?

214
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,070
- I don't need these.
- Don't do that.

215
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,470
Kwang Soo,
these coins mean nothing to me.

216
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,510
- Why are you being like this?
- Just take them.

217
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,010
Jae Suk!

218
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,910
(Giggling)

219
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,300
- You punk.
- Give those to him.

220
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,740
You silly brat.

221
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,540
He just slapped you in the face.

222
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,850
Jae Suk knows
he can't do it anymore.

223
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,240
So he slapped Kwang Soo in the face.

224
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,480
He should.

225
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,090
I'll slap him like 100 times
before he leaves.

226
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,820
- That's your mission for today.
- 100 times?

227
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,350
- That's his mission.
- That's my plan.

228
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,260
- Make sure to do that.
- He slapped him once already.

229
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,660
- Why would you...
- Someone's here.

230
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,290
Darn it!

231
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,070
- My gosh.
- I told you.

232
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,770
(There are 5 members.)

233
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,270
I told you I'd come here.

234
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,100
- Why did you come here? Why?
- I'm not even angry anymore.

235
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,100
- Did you have breakfast?
- Yes.

236
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,730
You must've eaten Korean food.

237
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,170
No, I just ate...

238
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,470
What? Didn't you leave our show?

239
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,800
(Didn't you leave our show?)

240
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,870
It hasn't happened yet.

241
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,910
Not yet?

242
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,320
Why would you say that?

243
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,480
Is this your last day?

244
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,540
You're making me sad.

245
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,020
- When are you leaving?
- I'm not leaving yet.

246
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,760
- I still have some time.
- You do?

247
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,050
Is this it?

248
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
- I guess.
- I think this is it.

249
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,390
But this is... Gosh.

250
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,760
All right. It's the five of you.

251
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,720
So you get six coins each.

252
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,920
It's okay. We can take our time.

253
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,490
There are five of us.

254
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,970
In the preliminary mission,

255
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,910
only three members chose
the Korean restaurant...

256
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,070
where you get 80 coins.

257
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,140
(They divide 80 coins among the 3.)

258
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,150
- I can't believe this.
- This is amazing.

259
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,470
This is great.

260
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,540
(The 3 members get 26 coins each.)

261
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,580
Seriously?

262
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,720
- Only three of us?
- This is unbelievable.

263
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,450
I never imagined this.
I thought there would be about six.

264
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,450
Me too.

265
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,150
- How many?
- Six each.

266
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,350
Six each.

267
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,120
- I'll give mine to Kwang Soo.
- Then they got 80 coins.

268
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,290
- Here.
- They got 26 coins each.

269
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,520
- Kwang Soo.
- You take them all.

270
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,960
Don't do this.

271
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,300
We should divide them evenly.

272
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,670
- Just take them.
- Thank you for everything.

273
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,200
Just keep them with you.

274
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,470
No. Take six coins each.

275
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,340
- Just take them.
- Here. Take six coins each.

276
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,810
Jae Suk took his share
in the middle of everything.

277
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,180
(Jae Suk took his share
right away.)

278
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,310
- This is disappointing though.
- You know what?

279
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,810
He will tease you all day.

280
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,140
- I feel disappointed either way.
- Why are you disappointed?

281
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,950
I need one more.

282
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,220
Six coins.

283
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,640
- 3, 4, 5...
- 3, 4...

284
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,950
Six.

285
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,880
- Kwang Soo, did you take one more?
- No.

286
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,060
I only have five.

287
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,250
He's at it again.

288
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,560
(He's at it again.)

289
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,990
Look at him.

290
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,350
- He's smiling.
- My gosh.

291
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,360
- His face shows everything.
- He's smiling.

292
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,490
- His eyes are smiling.
- I'm sorry I suspected you.

293
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,600
He couldn't hold back his laughter.

294
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,040
I thought it was you.

295
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,400
(They all got 6 coins each.)

296
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,770
Gosh, the coins don't matter.

297
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,470
All my favorite people are here.

298
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,640
Right.

299
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,500
All right. Let's do this.

300
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,820
(He's trying to create
a touching moment.)

301
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,350
- Go ahead and cry.
- What?

302
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,450
Just cry.

303
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,690
Why would I cry?

304
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,450
Shed some tears.

305
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,480
Get him some soju.
It'll look good with his mustache.

306
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,330
- Hey.
- Kaoliang liquor would work.

307
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,330
- Why would I drink kaoliang liquor?
- Drink some strong liquor.

308
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,560
No, it's okay.

309
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,750
All right. Let's watch
some of his best performances.

310
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,330
- Hey!
- Let's watch.

311
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,860
What are you looking at?

312
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,100
It's playing here.

313
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,990
- There aren't any.
- There aren't any?

314
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,360
Why would you say that?

315
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,970
(Watching Kwang Soo's performances
ends in a second.)

316
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,100
There aren't any.

317
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,340
All right.
Now, I will tell you the rules...

318
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,000
of the Read the Room Race.

319
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,080
I told you
the coins are very important today.

320
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,350
Anytime throughout the race,

321
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,740
once you collect 50 R coins,

322
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,190
you can go home right away.

323
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,420
(The members who collect
50 R coins go home right away.)

324
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,350
(As soon as they get 50 coins,
they get to leave immediately.)

325
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,650
Right away?

326
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,430
And the rest of the members
must continue with the race.

327
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,990
That's the rule for today.

328
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,860
Those who fail to collect 50 coins
can't go home.

329
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,600
Just in case,

330
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,230
we had all the missions
and venues ready...

331
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,100
so we could continue the shoot
until midnight.

332
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,100
You can get the coins
during each mission,

333
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,270
but you can also get extra coins...

334
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,920
according to the results
of how you act in Games of Wits.

335
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,090
Is that so?

336
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
For your information,
the actions you must carry out...

337
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,560
in the Games of Wits
are decided by specific conditions.

338
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,990
It's not like the crew members
decide them randomly.

339
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,700
You'll try to figure out
what the specific conditions are.

340
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,940
Now, you will order your breakfast.
I'll ask the waitress to come in.

341
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,970
How many coins do they have?

342
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,210
They got 26 coins.

343
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,600
They would go home soon.

344
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,270
So there are specific conditions.

345
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,870
It might be offering food to others.

346
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,640
- It might be something like that.
- I think so.

347
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,970
(They earn or lose coins
according to the specific actions.)

348
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,140
- We'd like to order.
- Right, we have to order.

349
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,950
- Hello.
- Hello.

350
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,350
Would you like to order?

351
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,110
- Thank you.
- They have 36 coins in total.

352
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,650
- Right.
- This is...

353
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,460
They have this famous dish.

354
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,190
There's jjajangmyeon...

355
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,720
- with cuttlefish.
- Is there something like that?

356
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,360
Jjajangmyeon with cuttlefish.

357
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,670
- Cuttlefish sounds good.
- I like that.

358
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,340
I think the waitress has something.

359
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,900
Can I order soybean noodle soup?

360
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,210
No. It's available only in summer.

361
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,230
- It's the seasonal menu.
- Right.

362
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,000
Ma'am, I heard this restaurant
is really famous.

363
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,680
I've wanted to come.

364
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Ma'am.

365
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,870
For the main dish,
we have jjamppong or fried rice.

366
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,320
Hang on. What should I eat?

367
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,090
I think the jjajangmyeon with cuttle
sounds good.

368
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,920
- What?
- These are famous.

369
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,150
- Is this famous?
- Do they have this?

370
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,250
It's a non-recommended menu.

371
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,830
I'll have the abalone rice porridge.

372
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,460
- It's not recommended.
- I want something spicy.

373
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,100
- Is the porridge not recommended?
- No.

374
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,360
How bad is it?

375
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,170
That's not what we usually offer.

376
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,360
Really?

377
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,170
- There's something.
- Non-recommended?

378
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,730
- I'll also have the porridge.
- This is a Game of Wits.

379
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,600
- This is it.
- The non-recommended menu?

380
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,040
Can I order a double helping
of abalone rice porridge?

381
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,550
I'll have five servings
of abalone rice porridge.

382
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,970
Gosh, this is...

383
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,140
I think I should order
something on the menu.

384
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,350
The non-recommended one.

385
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,920
- This is a Game of Wits.
- I know.

386
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,550
But we all can't order it.

387
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,190
Kwang Soo, you should try it alone.

388
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,790
- That's a good idea.
- We will eat something else.

389
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,850
She says it's a good idea.

390
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,930
- Ma'am.
- Kwang Soo.

391
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,350
Why are you being like this?

392
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,430
I'm fine.

393
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,620
She says you should try it.

394
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,700
Just listen to her.

395
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
She's looking out for you.

396
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,070
Kwang Soo, what about this?

397
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,040
- What?
- The other dishes taste better.

398
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,400
Gosh, why are you slapping me?

399
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,680
- What was that? Why is he...
- All right, that's two points.

400
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,970
- Why...
- Two points.

401
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,370
He's quick-witted.

402
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,000
That's two points.

403
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,270
He's got two points.

404
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,640
I'll have
the jjajangmyeon with cuttlefish.

405
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,140
- I already had breakfast,
- Thank you.

406
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,640
so I will have...

407
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,720
the jjamppong with seafood.

408
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,920
I'll have rice with japchae.

409
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,880
So only one of you will have
the abalone rice porridge?

410
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,590
- I think it's a good thing.
- Hang on. Abalone rice porridge?

411
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,150
I bet abalone rice porridge
would taste good.

412
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,890
- It's not recommended.
- Is it a bad thing?

413
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,330
I bet we will get coins.

414
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,490
It's not recommended.

415
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,070
I'll have rice
with spinach and pork.

416
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,360
Hang on.
Should I order the porridge?

417
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,440
- Kwang Soo.
- With fried eggs?

418
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,900
You should order
the abalone rice porridge.

419
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,310
- I'll have the porridge.
- Abalone rice porridge?

420
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,370
Yes.

421
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,550
I'll have the dishes ready for you.

422
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,100
Do you offer any tea?

423
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,370
We have jasmine tea.

424
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,450
Please get him some quitting tea.

425
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,450
Jong Kook!

426
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,420
- Hey.
- I want jasmine tea.

427
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,560
That's enough.

428
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,350
- This is crazy.
- What's wrong?

429
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,590
All right.

430
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,790
Are you the only one
who ordered abalone rice porridge?

431
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,250
I bet you will
have to turn in 10 coins.

432
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,460
I think so.

433
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,650
It's ridiculous that they have
a non-recommended menu.

434
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,120
But the thing is,

435
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,330
only they know the conditions.

436
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,860
They might take and give back
the coins as they want.

437
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,100
They will tell us
the conditions later.

438
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,470
- They will?
- Yes, why we get or lose coins.

439
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,730
How do you know that?

440
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,500
I guess he's the protagonist today.

441
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,100
Did you shoot something
before we started?

442
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,950
No, that's what we just heard.

443
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,050
That's what you did when you said
you had something to shoot.

444
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,050
You had another shoot.

445
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,420
- And you grew a mustache.
- It has nothing to do with this.

446
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,220
It's not like that.

447
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,920
Jong Kook. Is this perhaps...

448
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,290
Do you think
we will get five coins...

449
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,220
- if we shave his mustache?
- What are you talking about?

450
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,350
You...

451
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,470
When he says things like that,
he always talks to Jong Kook.

452
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,940
There must be something. I'm sure.

453
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,760
My goodness.

454
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,040
(Staring)

455
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,170
What?

456
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,340
- Did you figure something out?
- Do you have any idea?

457
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,630
- I don't know.
- Why are you crying?

458
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,900
What would you do
after going home early?

459
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,680
Are you sad? Haha is crying.

460
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,640
It's because he keeps staring at me.

461
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,370
Stop it. Don't cry, Haha.

462
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,850
It's just the beginning
of today's show.

463
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,140
- Hey.
- That's not it.

464
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,640
- Don't cry.
- He knows what's going on.

465
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,850
No, that's not why he's doing this.

466
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,090
Did you get any sleep?

467
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,090
(Did you get any sleep?)

468
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,300
He's wrinkling his nose.

469
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,620
That's so annoying.

470
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,990
(He's putting on a contrived frown
to create a touching moment.)

471
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,540
Which one would you like to use?

472
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,130
- Thank you.
- What?

473
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,360
- What is this?
- It's a Game of Wits.

474
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,100
We don't usually use forks.

475
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,740
- I'll use a fork.
- I'll use a fork as well.

476
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,100
I'm sure this is a Game of Wits.

477
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,870
- They have five forks.
- Why else would there be forks?

478
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,970
It's a Game of Wits.

479
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,950
We should have quick wits.

480
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,350
- Look.
- I'll use chopsticks.

481
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,090
(Jae Suk and Haha
choose chopsticks.)

482
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,460
We're done making our choices.

483
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,150
Hang on.

484
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,590
Is this about the forks?

485
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,620
- Right.
- Exactly.

486
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,120
Maybe we'll share some coins again.

487
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,020
- Everyone.
- I guess I'm right.

488
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,670
Which of you chose a fork?

489
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,990
- Me.
- I did.

490
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,230
The 3 of you have to give us
5 coins.

491
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,340
Okay!

492
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,500
(You'll lose 5 coins.)

493
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,680
(Those who choose a fork lose
5 coins.)

494
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,940
I hate you!

495
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,680
I wasn't going to choose a fork.

496
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,850
(Kwang Soo chose it
as Jae Suk recommended.)

497
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,220
He put this fork in my hand.

498
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,640
Give five coins to Hyeong Gu.

499
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,420
We do have reasons
for making the rules.

500
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,550
Is that so?

501
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,750
(The staff members are checking
their moves according to the rules.)

502
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,720
- I was so tactless.
- Okay!

503
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,460
People use chopsticks
at a Chinese restaurant.

504
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,720
Of course.

505
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,150
Then I guess the underlined items
didn't mean anything.

506
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,670
Kwang Soo, you gave me four coins.

507
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,360
- Gosh, seriously.
- Oh, okay.

508
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,230
- It wasn't intentional.
- He's playing dirty to the end.

509
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,390
Why would you play dirty to the end?

510
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,340
- That's so pathetic.
- I just wasn't sure.

511
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,810
That's enough, you punk.

512
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,730
I mean, there will be no one
to tease like this.

513
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,870
What is wrong with him?

514
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,740
Stop wrinkling your nose, Haha.

515
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,770
- Stop it already.
- He keeps wrinkling his nose.

516
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,350
- We'll see him for two more weeks.
- We'll have more chances.

517
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,220
- Let's make the most of the time.
- Let's make acrostic poems.

518
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,640
- With what word?
- With "stepping down."

519
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,720
Say the initials.

520
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,880
- S.
- Select one person to cast.

521
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,330
- D.
- Definitely Cha Eun Woo.

522
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,700
What kind of acrostic poem is that?

523
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,570
- I'll do it.
- S.

524
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,260
- Select one more person to cast.
- Who would that be?

525
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,730
- D.
- Definitely Cha Tae Hyun.

526
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,210
S. Select one more person.

527
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,470
- D.
- Definitely Cha In Pyo.

528
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,100
- Please join our show!
- That's funny.

529
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,970
(They're discussing
the new member already.)

530
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,000
- Hit me.
- S.

531
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,500
- Shut it!
- D.

532
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,770
Dudes!

533
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,610
- Nice. It lightened up the mood.
- Yes, it did.

534
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,850
- The acrostic poems made us laugh.
- Oh, gosh. Kwang Soo...

535
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,850
We'll give five coins
to those who chose chopsticks.

536
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,980
You'll give five coins to them?

537
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,380
- Really?
- This is awesome.

538
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,480
I wonder how they made the rules.

539
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,060
We could go home quite early
if we keep this up.

540
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,500
- The other team earned more coins.
- There's a big difference.

541
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,270
We do have reasons
for making these rules.

542
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,270
- Is that so?
- Yes.

543
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,270
I suppose you'll reveal
the reasons later on.

544
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,080
It'd be weird
if Kwang Soo leaves early today.

545
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,280
- Indeed.
- Yes.

546
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,200
We should help him stay
as long as he can.

547
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,670
I think they already set up
the rules.

548
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,940
- Of course.
- Then let's do this.

549
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,410
Since many people are sad
that you're leaving this show,

550
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,350
you stay.
We'll leave the show instead.

551
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,560
Gosh. Stop it!

552
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,420
(You stay.
We'll leave the show instead.)

553
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,450
What would I do all by myself?
Don't be ridiculous.

554
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,460
- Jae Suk.
- What is he talking about?

555
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,040
Do you mean Kwang Soo should be
on the show alone?

556
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,300
That's ridiculous.

557
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,630
I go solo on a Saturday show,
so you do it on a Sunday show.

558
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,510
- Come on. Don't be ridiculous.
- Right.

559
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,080
- That's so funny.
- Call it "Step Down with Lee."

560
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,580
- That's a good idea.
- "Step Down with Lee"?

561
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,870
- I like the title.
- That's a great idea.

562
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,090
After two weeks of being teased,
Kwang Soo might say,

563
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,620
"Fine. I'll stay!"

564
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,620
"I'll stay."

565
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,530
"You win."

566
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,500
"You win."

567
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,600
(They're saying goodbye to him
in their own style.)

568
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,690
Someone at the other place might
go home now.

569
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,240
- No, not yet.
- Not so fast.

570
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,310
If he or she earned coins
twice in a row.

571
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,100
- They wouldn't let it happen.
- That's right.

572
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,930
I think that's possible.

573
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,010
No, never.

574
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,850
The two of you seem so close
these days.

575
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,250
- You're not making any sense.
- Of course, we're close.

576
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,880
I'm close with Trainer Kook.

577
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,090
Suk Jin would refuse to leave
even if he can go home.

578
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,110
I think so too.

579
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,450
- It's So Min.
- What?

580
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,790
(Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, and So Min were
doing the same mission.)

581
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,880
Hi, So Min.

582
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,000
Haha, Suk Jin will go home
very soon.

583
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,770
Suk Jin will go home soon?

584
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,540
- We were just talking about it.
- Really?

585
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,340
- Really?
- Tell him to go home.

586
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,460
Suk Jin, why do you look so sad
when you can go home early?

587
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,480
Suk Jin, that means
the staff threw you away.

588
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,850
Hey, I have 48 coins right now.

589
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,980
- He needs only two coins.
- Really?

590
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,410
(Big Nose is only 2 coins short.)

591
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,750
(This is how he became rich.)

592
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,320
The total number is three.

593
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,520
(He chose the Korean cuisine
and earned 26 coins.)

594
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,790
(Suk Jin continued
collecting a lot of coins.)

595
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,990
I choose chopsticks.

596
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,230
See?

597
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,150
- You'll give me?
- Yes. Those who chose chopsticks...

598
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,390
- See? I was right.
- will receive five coins.

599
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,860
But why?
Why would you give this to me?

600
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,690
Hey, why are you trying
to send me home?

601
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,770
That's not true.

602
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,040
- Why are you trying to let me go?
- That's not true.

603
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,160
Rock-paper-scissors

604
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,430
I lost.

605
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,130
Rock-paper-scissors

606
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,670
(He defeated
both Ji Hyo and So Min.)

607
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,080
Let's play it just one more time.

608
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,350
- No.
- Please. Just one more time.

609
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,140
- I'll be going home soon.
- How many coins do you have now?

610
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,250
Me?

611
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,380
I have 48 coins now.

612
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,520
He'll probably leave while eating.

613
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,880
- Suk Jin will...
- I don't think I'll see you guys.

614
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,180
- He'll go home soon.
- I'll probably go home from here.

615
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,650
By the way, I realized...

616
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,100
- that they'll get more airtime.
- I know, right?

617
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,570
Ji Hyo, I noticed something
while talking on the phone.

618
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,360
Suk Jin seemed disappointed
when he saw them, right?

619
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,900
- He wanted to be with Kwang Soo.
- I wish I was with them.

620
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,460
They'll get a lot of airtime.

621
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,010
You want to join them, right?

622
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,080
- Yes.
- They'll get more airtime than us.

623
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,510
- Short rib soup is here.
- Here's your food.

624
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,810
- That's for Suk Jin.
- Short rib soup with Korean beef.

625
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,700
(Meanwhile, the food
that Suk Jin ordered came!)

626
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,870
It looks delicious.

627
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,980
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

628
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,520
You should always say thanks
before eating.

629
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,710
(Whistle blowing)

630
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,880
- That startled me.
- Suk Jin, turn in your coins.

631
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,060
- Is he leaving now?
- What?

632
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,800
(Turn in his coins?)

633
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,850
Is he going home now?

634
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,890
(Why?)

635
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,630
Congratulations, Suk Jin.

636
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,740
You have collected 50 coins
that you need to leave for the day.

637
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,460
The car is ready.

638
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,100
- You can go home right now.
- Really?

639
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,400
Really? Really?

640
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,280
- But why?
- Why? Why?

641
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,710
- How did he earn two more coins?
- Why should I leave?

642
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,480
Kwang Soo just sent two coins
to him.

643
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,290
So he can leave for the day now.

644
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,950
Wait. Are you serious?
Should I leave now?

645
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,450
Are you serious?

646
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,180
- Go home, Suk Jin.
- Bye.

647
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,000
We're not allowed to give our coins
to someone else, right?

648
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,120
Of course, you can do that.

649
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,330
Then let's give Suk Jin two coins,
so he can go home.

650
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's do that. That's a good idea.

651
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
Let's just send him two coins.

652
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,860
I'll give him mine
since I have the most.

653
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,810
- Right. Give him two coins.
- Yes, give him yours.

654
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,200
- It'll be so funny.
- Think of it as the last gift.

655
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,670
(Kwang Soo volunteered to give
Suk Jin a perfect gift.)

656
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,080
- Suk Jin sounded...
- Two coins.

657
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,310
- worried about going home early.
- He sounded anxious.

658
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,210
Suk Jin, I haven't done anything
for you until now.

659
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,020
It's not much,
but I'm giving you two coins.

660
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,410
This is a token of my gratitude
and respect toward you.

661
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,950
Suk Jin, thank you for everything.
I love you.

662
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,730
You can go home now.

663
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,730
Hold on. Do I really have to leave?

664
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,300
Are you serious?

665
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,840
- You're joking, right?
- No.

666
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,540
You can actually leave for the day.

667
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,900
(Suk Jin is about to cry again.)

668
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,740
I'm actually going home now?

669
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,080
Kwang Soo, that punk.
But am I really going home?

670
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,980
I'm just taken aback. I mean...

671
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,910
We started the shoot
a little after 10 a.m.

672
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,170
What's going on?

673
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,550
And I'm going home already?

674
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,290
Yes. We'll also film you leaving
as well.

675
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,290
Will you guys be okay?

676
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,180
- Will you be okay?
- Of course, we'll be fine.

677
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,530
You'll need me to make things work.

678
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,260
- You did a great job today.
- See you later.

679
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,620
- I'm glad you talked to the others.
- But I haven't finished the food.

680
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,620
- It's okay. You can go. It's over.
- Should I just leave?

681
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,360
He looks sad and disappointed.

682
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,070
I'm a little sad indeed.
You see, I like...

683
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,770
- shooting this show with you guys.
- Go on.

684
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,130
- Bye.
- Then don't call me, okay?

685
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,540
- Okay.
- I won't pick up.

686
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,780
I'm off.

687
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,610
- Bye, Suk Jin.
- Bye. See you later.

688
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,640
I'm leaving. I'm actually leaving.

689
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,380
- You did great today.
- Don't regret it later.

690
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,020
- He's actually leaving.
- What's going on? This is weird.

691
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,150
(He's walking slowly
hoping that someone will stop him.)

692
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,610
I can't believe I'm going home
so early.

693
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,490
I didn't intend to leave this early,

694
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,230
but it happened that way.

695
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm off.

696
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,270
I can't believe this.
I'm actually leaving.

697
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,270
(It's the 1st time in 11 years,
so it's hard to believe.)

698
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,390
It doesn't make sense.

699
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,510
Can I really go?

700
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,070
(A staff member will drive him home
as his manager is not here.)

701
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,540
You left unexpectedly early.

702
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,100
- I'm not actually leaving, right?
- Yes, you are leaving.

703
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,940
- Really?
- Yes, you can get some rest today.

704
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,490
(1 of the cast members left
only in 1 hour.)

705
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,380
- It's here.
- The food is here.

706
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,590
(Meanwhile,
at the Chinese restaurant...)

707
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,760
It looks good.

708
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,110
(Both stir-fried noodles
and jjamppong with seafood came.)

709
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,380
- Tangsuyuk.
- It looks so delicious.

710
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,590
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

711
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,920
Kwang Soo who ordered
the non-recommended menu...

712
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,830
(Kwang Soo who ordered
the non-recommended menu...)

713
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,630
- What's a non-recommended menu?
- Look here.

714
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,360
(Was it a good choice?)

715
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,510
You should give us five coins.

716
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,200
I knew it.

717
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,050
- Of course.
- That's Kwang Soo.

718
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,140
Of course.

719
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,170
Kwang Soo, you're back
to your old self.

720
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,440
But he didn't lose that many.

721
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,940
- You had 15 coins before.
- Guys, try some of mine.

722
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
Okay.

723
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,410
(He's turning in 5 coins
just as he was told to.)

724
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,490
This is a healthy meal.

725
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,560
(Looking around nervously)

726
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
(Se Chan is looking around
nervously too.)

727
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,830
Why are you looking at us like that?

728
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,380
- Pardon?
- Why are you looking at us?

729
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,190
I was just wondering
if there would be something else.

730
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,300
(They can't let their guard down.)

731
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,860
I gave up on leaving early.

732
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,070
I'd rather spend
one more hour with Kwang Soo.

733
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,510
Let's have a toast.

734
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,510
I'll say the toast.

735
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,250
(The toast for only 1 person)

736
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,600
To my endless success!

737
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,440
(He's celebrating his own future.)

738
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,750
Cheers!

739
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,020
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

740
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,020
(He was too excited about teasing
Kwang Soo to pronounce properly.)

741
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,560
He won't stop making jokes.

742
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,820
All the pranksters on the show
gathered here.

743
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,850
(They're so cheeky.)

744
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,420
I think Jae Suk is determined
to joke around with you.

745
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,850
He wants to do it
as many times as he can...

746
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,360
because he won't get to do it again.
He'll make 500 jokes at least.

747
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,270
I think I'll lose some weight.

748
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,010
- What? Hey.
- What?

749
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,240
- What?
- What brings you here?

750
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,600
They told me to actually leave.

751
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,340
(The man in a colorful shirt
who left for the day appeared.)

752
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,580
- I thought it was a joke.
- Why are you here?

753
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,520
- Go home now.
- I just wanted to say hi to you.

754
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,050
- I didn't expect...
- Why did you come here?

755
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,850
I'm so confused.

756
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,940
Let's meet up later.

757
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,990
I asked them many times,
but I was told to leave.

758
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,590
- You didn't even get to eat?
- They told me to go home.

759
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,350
Why did you give me two coins?

760
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,760
I haven't given you anything
until now.

761
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,060
- Hey.
- Say the chant with him at least.

762
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,600
- "Feeling! Intuition! Cross!"
- What?

763
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,770
Why would we do that?

764
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,660
- Do it so we can send him home.
- Let's do it.

765
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,190
- Let's say the chant together.
- I don't think I can watch it.

766
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,630
- Let's do it.
- Come on.

767
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,510
- Kwang Soo.
- What is this?

768
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,510
- Stop it. I said, stop it.
- Come on.

769
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,010
- Why should I do that?
- Just do it.

770
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,810
Honestly, when Se Chan suggested it,
I got a little emotional.

771
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,780
- Come on. Do it for him.
- Gosh.

772
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,080
Suk Jin is going home now.

773
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,520
- Do it for him just this once.
- Why would we say the chant?

774
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,260
Let's do it once in every episode
until you leave the show.

775
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,090
- Starting today.
- He said he'd slap me every week.

776
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,090
Why would you add this?

777
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,530
- Just once in every episode.
- Do it for him...

778
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,590
just for the next two weeks.

779
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,300
(Since the beginning
of Running Man,)

780
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,160
(the weakest duo has been together
with their feelings and intuition.)

781
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,460
(Lee Ji Brothers formed
the Feeling Intuition Alliance.)

782
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,900
(They must've shouted the chant
so many times in the past 11 years.)

783
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,840
How many times do we have left?
Three times, right?

784
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,850
We can say this three more times.

785
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,250
Let's do it right here today.
Feeling!

786
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,820
- Intuition! Cross!
- Cross!

787
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,410
This will be remembered
for a long time. Haha.

788
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,710
(Touched)

789
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,680
Don't wrinkle your nose.

790
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,830
- Don't cry, Haha.
- Stop faking it.

791
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,350
Stop wrinkling your nose.

792
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,350
Jae Suk, I'll get going now.
Jong Kook.

793
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,830
- I'm off now.
- See you later.

794
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,270
- See you later.
- I'm really leaving this time.

795
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,690
- Bye.
- Bye, Suk Jin.

796
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,690
Go home and practice singing.

797
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,890
Okay. I'll do that.

798
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,630
Why would you bring that up here?

799
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,040
(After Suk Jin left...)

800
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,430
I'm planning a new show.

801
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,010
- I'm not sure when I can start.
- I see.

802
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,350
I haven't told anyone about this
until now.

803
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,810
The show is about people I like...

804
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,610
Well... There's a lot of people
I'm grateful to, you know.

805
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,850
Including Cho Sae Ho
and all of you here.

806
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,450
In the first episode,
I'll be with Suk Jin,

807
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,420
Kwang Soo, and Sae Ho.

808
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,730
We'll go to a remote area,

809
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,730
and they'll prepare all three meals
for the day for me.

810
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,690
We'll cook for you?
Why should we cook for you?

811
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,740
That's what this show is about.

812
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,340
You three prepare breakfast, lunch,
and dinner for me.

813
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,630
Why should we do that?

814
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,700
- That sounds so interesting.
- Yes.

815
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,430
We'll all wear hanbok.

816
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,080
I'll dress as a nobleman.

817
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,980
- And the other three...
- Why would you dress as a nobleman?

818
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,980
Will the other three be your slaves?

819
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,050
Will you eat with them or alone?

820
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,440
- I'll eat alone.
- Oh, I see.

821
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,680
They'll cook for you and then leave?

822
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,910
There will be a small table
for the three of them.

823
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,850
Why would he not eat with us?

824
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,000
- I don't get it.
- Of course, he'll eat alone.

825
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,530
- He won't eat with the others.
- Why?

826
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,730
- It's "Three Meals for Jae Suk."
- I see.

827
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,030
That sounds interesting.

828
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,430
(Could Jae Suk's dream come true?)

829
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,690
Do you need anything else?

830
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,540
- Can we get small plates, please?
- Of course.

831
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,740
Kwang Soo just came out
to get plates.

832
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,900
Did he?

833
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,540
He came out to get plates.

834
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,580
(The waitress suddenly dropped
a pouch.)

835
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,310
(What?)

836
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,520
You dropped this.

837
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,710
- Can we get scissors as well?
- You dropped this.

838
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,550
(A pouch full of coins?)

839
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,610
(Looking at the staff nervously)

840
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,180
(Surprised)

841
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,230
Can I have this?

842
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,420
Hey, wait.

843
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,330
(Have it.)

844
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,300
- I saw... Yes.
- She dropped this?

845
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,230
Am I supposed to give it back
to her?

846
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,830
- How many coins are there?
- Well...

847
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,130
- Let me see.
- Why is it so complicated?

848
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,810
- Is it a test?
- Maybe.

849
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,340
(Whether he'll have it or not
is his choice.)

850
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,630
I'll give it back to her.

851
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,580
- Oh, he'll give it back.
- I'll give it back to her.

852
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,210
The waitress dropped this
in our room.

853
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,050
I want to give it back to her.

854
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,250
Se Chan who found the coins
that the waitress dropped...

855
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,610
and gave the coins back to her...

856
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,620
(Se Chan who gave the coins back
to the owner...)

857
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,830
It's all yours.

858
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,290
(It's all yours.)

859
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,570
(Se Chan gets all the coins.)

860
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,360
- Are you serious?
- Can you go home now?

861
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,190
- No, I don't have enough coins.
- How many do you have?

862
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,240
How many coins are in here?

863
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,810
- 20...
- Count them by yourself.

864
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,840
(5 coins were deducted for choosing
the non-recommended menu.)

865
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,480
(5 coins were deducted for a fork.
5 coins were added for chopsticks.)

866
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,250
I'm so taken aback.

867
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,250
This is...

868
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,870
To be honest, whenever we heard...

869
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,550
that we could go home early,

870
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,990
we lost some points intentionally
not to go home early.

871
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,260
We should stop doing that.

872
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,120
We should always wrap up
and go home on time.

873
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,190
That'd be the true variety show.

874
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,450
Wouldn't you agree?

875
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,160
I'm going home.
I'm really going home.

876
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,300
Okay.

877
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,190
You did great today.
I'll see you next week.

878
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,930
I still can't believe this.

879
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,340
Get some rest.

880
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,640
- It's a shame. I love your shirt.
- I know, right? It's a nice shirt.

881
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,480
- Bye.
- See you later.

882
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,870
(Suk Jin arrived home.)

883
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,820
(So the 1st one to leave went home.)

884
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,610
Let's move to the next location.

885
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,180
- Hey, Se Chan, Se Chan.
- Yes, yes.

886
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,420
Where are we going?

887
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,730
- We're going for the next mission.
- Okay.

888
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,800
Before that,
we need to settle things.

889
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,830
- What?
- What is it?

890
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,190
- What's there to settle?
- Wasn't it all settled?

891
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,890
Kwang Soo and Haha get 10 coins.

892
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,420
- What?
- Why?

893
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,690
- Why?
- Is it the order of leaving?

894
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,740
Is it?

895
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,540
And Kwang Soo gets 10 more coins.

896
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,570
- Why?
- What's going on?

897
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,200
Kwang Soo, you should give me
two coins.

898
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,310
Kwang Soo, can you go home now?
You don't have enough yet, right?

899
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,080
- I got 10 more coins.
- What's going on?

900
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,550
- Why did I get the coins?
- Why...

901
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,670
It's a result of your behaviors
when you left the restaurant...

902
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,180
and got in the vehicle.

903
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,610
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

904
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,680
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

905
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,880
(Those who said they'll come back
earned 10 coins.)

906
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,610
- Goodbye. I'll come again.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

907
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,150
- Thank you.
- Please come again.

908
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

909
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,230
- I'll come again.
- Look.

910
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,120
- I promise.
- They're still filming us.

911
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,300
- They're filming us.
- Right.

912
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,230
Is it? I'll lift it up for you.

913
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,740
(And the mission
that only Kwang Soo succeeded in...)

914
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,070
Hello.

915
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,100
(Hello.)

916
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,740
(The one who said hello
to the driver got 10 coins.)

917
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,430
Oh, I think I didn't say hello
to the driver.

918
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,810
I think... Hold on a second.
I think...

919
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,080
that someone predicted in advance...

920
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,980
- That's right.
- how we would behave.

921
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,140
I don't think so.

922
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,520
(Kwang Soo got much closer
to 50 coins in an instant.)

923
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,880
- By the way,
- There are things we should say.

924
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,680
- when we didn't get to go home,
- Is that the case?

925
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,420
we got excited to receive coins.

926
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,730
- It's a little baffling.
- But now...

927
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,620
- We don't get excited about it.
- It makes us feel uncomfortable.

928
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,830
- "What did I do wrong?"
- Exactly.

929
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,690
Haha just said quietly,
"Gosh, I got more coins."

930
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,300
I regret greeting the driver.

931
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,010
- You see,
- I collected almost all the coins.

932
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,200
I haven't gotten any coins so far.

933
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,270
So I feel so calm.

934
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,310
- Jong Kook must feel relaxed.
- I won't do anything from now on.

935
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,040
- Because I didn't get any coins...
- What did I do...

936
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,640
It feels like getting coins is
a penalty.

937
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,080
I wonder where we're going.

938
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,320
Me too.

939
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,910
(They're going to a mysterious place
for the next mission.)

940
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,090
The weather is so nice.

941
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,210
Wait. Kwang Soo.

942
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,210
What did you just say?

943
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,830
(Wait. Kwang Soo.
What did you just say?)

944
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,880
I said I was...

945
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,990
(Murmuring)

946
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,350
Didn't you say
that the weather was nice?

947
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,350
- He said that.
- Yes, he did.

948
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,920
(Didn't you say
that the weather was nice?)

949
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,300
Kwang Soo, you got five coins.

950
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
- What?
- What was that?

951
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,000
- Kwang Soo might go home soon.
- Don't lie to me.

952
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,890
- If you say...
- Bo Pil.

953
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,130
Are you trying to send
Kwang Soo home?

954
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,930
No, I'm not. It's written here.

955
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,170
- Oh, no.
- Really?

956
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,100
He said the exact words.

957
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,170
Hey, are you not joking?

958
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,850
Hey, I think you have 50 coins now.

959
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,050
How many coins do you have now?

960
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,410
I think I have 50 coins now.

961
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,410
- It's weird.
- I'll count the coins for you.

962
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,790
I think he collected all 50 coins.
Go home, Kwang Soo.

963
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,520
- Kwang Soo must have 50 coins.
- Kwang Soo always liked coins.

964
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,420
- But today...
- I didn't expect this. Gosh.

965
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,890
You don't like coins today, do you?

966
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,060
What? Hey, you're done.

967
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,360
Do you have one more coin
than I do? No, I have more.

968
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,530
It's right here.

969
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,530
Kwang Soo.

970
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,540
- He's going home.
- You can go home now.

971
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,540
Oh, my goodness.

972
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,300
You're sending me home
because I talked about the weather?

973
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,540
Please pull over here.

974
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,600
Here?

975
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,130
Hey! How can you...

976
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,580
At least let me go
to our destination!

977
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,640
My gosh. Poor Kwang Soo.

978
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,370
How can you drop me off here?

979
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,610
- Hey. Then...
- Hannam Bridge is near here.

980
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,110
Guys, try to stop him.

981
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,910
(He'll end up on the street
about 2 hours after he left home.)

982
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,880
At least let me go
to our destination!

983
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,110
My gosh. Poor Kwang Soo.

984
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,020
(He'll go home alone
carrying the mission bag.)

985
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,530
Guys, try to stop him.

986
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,730
- What could we do about it?
- It's not far from your house.

987
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,120
Is he actually leaving?

988
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,150
- Kwang Soo, see you later.
- Congratulations, Kwang Soo.

989
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,920
How can I go home
if you drop me off here?

990
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,570
- Congratulations, Kwang Soo.
- We'll give you a ride.

991
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,190
- Congratulations.
- You should get out to the right.

992
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,240
- You should get out to the right.
- I don't even have my wallet!

993
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,630
I know, Kwang Soo. See you later.

994
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,200
Hey, you can use those coins.

995
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,740
- Kwang Soo.
- You mean these R coins?

996
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,170
- Kwang Soo, get out of the car now.
- Go home.

997
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,170
- Bye.
- Get out of the car.

998
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,440
(Hyeong Gu and a cameraman are
running to help Kwang Soo leave.)

999
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,820
- This is driving me nuts.
- Go to Suk Jin's house.

1000
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,610
- He's actually leaving.
- Call us later.

1001
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,090
- But...
- Just get out of the car.

1002
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,910
- Go home.
- Okay.

1003
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,230
- Okay.
- I'll get going.

1004
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,830
- Bye. Get going now.
- Bye.

1005
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,150
- I'm off.
- See you.

1006
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,890
- I'll call you later.
- Okay. Bye.

1007
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,530
- Am I actually leaving?
- Yes, you are. Go.

1008
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,160
- What is going on?
- Go on.

1009
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,330
I don't believe this.

1010
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,430
(He's going home in broad daylight.)

1011
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,740
You can go home.

1012
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,010
- What is going on?
- Go on.

1013
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,160
- It's so weird.
- What is this?

1014
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,630
What are you going to do
if we don't get enough airtime?

1015
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,980
- Someone is controlling this.
- Could this be...

1016
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,170
some kind of practice?

1017
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,480
(Could this be
some kind of practice?)

1018
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,710
- Saying goodbye to Kwang Soo?
- Yes.

1019
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,320
- They want to see if we can...
- Before he leaves the show.

1020
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
- do well without him.
- Right.

1021
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,790
We should do well.

1022
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,150
(As Kwang Soo leaves early,
they think of it as a rehearsal.)

1023
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,820
- Can I really go?
- Yes.

1024
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,420
(The car where the casts are in
is leaving.)

1025
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,800
(Kwang Soo is left alone.)

1026
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,070
I mean, is this...

1027
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,570
(He's leaving with staff members
just as Suk Jin did.)

1028
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,070
- Is this it?
- Yes, this is it.

1029
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,240
You can go home now.

1030
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,740
(He's leaving with staff members
just as Suk Jin did.)

1031
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,900
Let me stay a little longer.
What is this? Are you serious?

1032
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,340
It feels weird.

1033
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,080
(He's never left for the day
in 2 hours in the past 11 years.)

1034
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,400
- Hello?
- Suk Jin.

1035
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,820
- Hi.
- I'm going home.

1036
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,440
What is this?

1037
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,990
(Laughing)

1038
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,490
Suk Jin, I didn't even get to see
Ji Hyo and So Min.

1039
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,990
Exactly.

1040
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,920
But it doesn't feel so good.

1041
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,060
- I know. It's disappointing, right?
- I mean...

1042
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,060
Besides...

1043
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,330
You will leave the show soon.

1044
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,890
I can't believe...

1045
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,010
They can't do this.
This is driving me nuts.

1046
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,460
Oh, Suk Jin is actually at home.

1047
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,700
I'm at home.

1048
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,700
Are you really going home?

1049
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,750
Suk Jin, I'm feeling so weird.

1050
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,020
I shouldn't have chanted
"Feeling! Intuition! Cross!"

1051
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,790
I got a little emotional
when we chanted together.

1052
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,380
Me too. I got emotional too.

1053
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,690
- Right?
- I genuinely felt sad.

1054
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,690
I genuinely felt sad too.
I didn't expect that.

1055
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,190
It's okay. We'll get to chant
two more times.

1056
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,460
That's right.

1057
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,100
(It's okay. We'll get to chant
2 more times.)

1058
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,830
- See you later.
- See you. I'll call you again.

1059
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,000
Okay.

1060
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,000
Can you make a little detour?

1061
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,560
(Can you make a little detour?)

1062
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,830
This isn't right.

1063
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,230
- Can't I be around the set?
- No.

1064
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,750
Let me just watch.
I don't mind if I won't be filmed.

1065
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,850
- Can't I just watch?
- No. You should go home.

1066
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,110
Thank you.

1067
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:49,190
(At 12:10 p.m., he finally got home
after a meaningless detour.)

1068
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,560
Did I do something wrong?

1069
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,980
(Did I do something wrong?)

1070
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,790
Go on in. Why aren't you going in?

1071
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Go home.

1072
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
(At 12:11 p.m., the 2nd member to leave
arrived home.)

1073
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,000
Okay. Goodbye.

1074
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,630
(Bowing)

1075
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,290
(The staff members are going back
to the filming set afterward.)

1076
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,000
Why are you sitting there
instead of going home?

1077
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,380
- Are you serious?
- Yes. We should go now.

1078
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,750
(His body refuses to go home.)

1079
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,900
We can leave now, sir.

1080
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,920
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1081
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,080
Go home now. We're not joking.

1082
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,350
(The staff members left him
on the street.)

1083
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,980
We've arrived at the location.

1084
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,380
- Yes!
- Great.

1085
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,790
- What is that?
- What is it?

1086
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,920
We should try, you punk.

1087
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,060
The Read the Room Race.

1088
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,420
The first Read the Room Race.

1089
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,860
Could the race have an architect?

1090
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,920
Of course.

1091
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,190
Maybe someone made the rules.

1092
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,690
Ji Hyo's here.

1093
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,460
- Hello.
- Ginger hair Ji Hyo.

1094
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,830
Suk Jin went home.

1095
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,560
- He was given two on our end.
- Thanks.

1096
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,130
Kwang Soo also went home.

1097
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,330
Kwang Soo went home.

1098
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,730
- In the van.
- Did you pick up the pouch?

1099
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,380
This is where the first
Read the Room Race will be hosted.

1100
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,170
Surprisingly enough,

1101
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,540
Suk Jin and Kwang Soo
already went home...

1102
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,080
- after collecting 50 coins.
- Exactly.

1103
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,350
- I'm jealous.
- That was fast.

1104
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,810
- I envy them.
- Lucky them.

1105
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,920
Here's your first mission
of the day.

1106
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,080
You must pop the balloons
with all your might...

1107
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,860
in this game of Pop the Balloon.

1108
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,790
You'll pop the 20 balloons
with your fist in the given time...

1109
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,290
and win coins afterward.

1110
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,810
- Really?
- The order you play is up to you.

1111
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,940
With our fist?

1112
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,330
- Balloons...
- This I can't do.

1113
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,380
Maybe the colors mean something.

1114
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,710
- We need to read the game.
- Just a second.

1115
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,020
They're all the same size.

1116
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,710
Do you need any help?

1117
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,750
Maybe it's this.

1118
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,020
No?

1119
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,480
Are you trying to receive coins?

1120
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,420
I just want to know
how you can get more.

1121
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,750
How do you get more coins?

1122
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,150
- It's random.
- Let me help.

1123
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,360
Gosh, let me help.

1124
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,020
I'll take that. Let me.

1125
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,790
(Is this not it either?)

1126
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,830
Why are the water bottles
only half full?

1127
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:51,270
(Detective Kook notices the bottles
that are only half full.)

1128
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,670
- There's no need for that.
- And this game...

1129
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,110
- Why can't they be full?
- Don't you think...

1130
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,350
that this game lacks finesse?

1131
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,080
- It's odd.
- Hold on.

1132
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,150
- I find this weird.
- Me too.

1133
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,520
Something's odd about this game.

1134
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,020
A lot about this game feels odd.

1135
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,150
Maybe it was Suk Jin
and Kwang Soo...

1136
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,080
who designed this game?

1137
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,130
If you think about it...

1138
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,020
Let me see. I'll check it out.

1139
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,360
Things felt odd
the moment I stepped inside.

1140
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,560
The moment I stepped inside.

1141
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,360
(Jong Kook heads toward the staff
where the water bottles are.)

1142
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,500
What's going on?

1143
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,330
- It's weird.
- This is odd.

1144
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,500
- This feels odd.
- Just odd.

1145
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,770
(Out of the bottles
in front of the staff,)

1146
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,580
(only one has a red sticker
on the cap.)

1147
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,710
- These...
- But...

1148
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,850
It won't pop.

1149
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,850
(Jong Kook heads back
with questions looming in his head.)

1150
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,440
- It won't pop.
- Let us begin.

1151
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,210
Should we be filling up the bottles?

1152
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,480
Wait, check this out.

1153
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,360
This game must have
its own set of rules.

1154
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,150
- I think so.
- Right.

1155
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,830
Kwang Soo earned five coins...

1156
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,400
just by mentioning the nice weather.

1157
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,560
Let's try Kwang Soo.

1158
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,600
- The nice weather?
- Call Kwang Soo.

1159
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,670
Hold on. What could this be?

1160
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,690
(Hold on. What's going on?)

1161
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,440
(Is there something in the bottle?)

1162
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,940
Kwang Soo earned five coins...

1163
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,440
just by mentioning the nice weather.

1164
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,710
(The bottle with the red sticker
on the cap.)

1165
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,150
Hold on. What could this be?

1166
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,750
(Just then, the whistle blows.)

1167
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,810
What's going on?

1168
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,650
(The sudden whistle...)

1169
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,420
(Jong Kook freezes
with the bottle in his hand.)

1170
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,150
- What's going on?
- Jong Kook...

1171
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,290
(Jong Kook...)

1172
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,460
Jong Kook declared
the end of the race.

1173
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,500
(The end of the race?)

1174
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,170
- What?
- The first...

1175
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,270
- Read the Room Race is now over.
- What?

1176
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,860
What are you talking about?

1177
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,900
(The first Read the Room Race
is over.)

1178
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,580
(It ended just because
Jong Kook picked up a water bottle.)

1179
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,110
What are you talking about?

1180
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,540
Out of all the water bottles,

1181
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,650
only one of them
had a red sticker on the cap.

1182
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,980
(Only one of the bottles
had a red sticker on the cap.)

1183
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,020
(Picking up that bottle...)

1184
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,790
It would declare
the end of the race.

1185
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,360
What?

1186
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,650
Thanks to Jong Kook figuring it out,

1187
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
the first Read the Room Race
has come to an end.

1188
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,830
(Jong Kook picked up the bottle
which ended the race.)

1189
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,860
- What?
- The episode ended?

1190
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,670
- What?
- Do we go home then?

1191
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,940
I only reacted
when I saw the red sticker.

1192
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,770
The first Read the Room Race
is over.

1193
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,270
And now, the quick-witted
will get to earn more coins...

1194
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:11,920
in the second Read the Room Race.

1195
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,170
(The 2nd Read the Room Race)

1196
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,110
(The 1st race is over,
and now the 2nd race begins.)

1197
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,750
Are you kidding me?

1198
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,420
Are you all right up there?

1199
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,080
- Look.
- Seriously?

1200
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,380
- What's going on?
- What is this?

1201
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,460
- What is all this?
- What are you playing at?

1202
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,630
I mean... Hold on.

1203
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,630
(A new banner is hung
to celebrate the 2nd race.)

1204
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,520
(Flapping)

1205
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,500
We're moving to
a specific rule today.

1206
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,730
(The race has been designed
to follow a specific rule.)

1207
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,040
What is all this?

1208
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,000
The second race has begun.

1209
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,170
You've got to be kidding me.

1210
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,670
Suk Jin and Kwang Soo
are running late,

1211
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,150
so we'll begin the race
when they get here.

1212
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,020
They have to come back!

1213
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,790
(They couldn't fully comprehend
what was going on.)

1214
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,060
(A revelation)

1215
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,330
I see.

1216
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,150
Please call them over.

1217
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,690
- Is this the second race?
- They must come back.

1218
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,230
The 1st race is over,
and now it's the 2nd race.

1219
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,330
Is this the second race?

1220
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,560
Call them over here.

1221
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,860
- I'll call them.
- The first race is over.

1222
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,230
I didn't quite get it.

1223
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,730
Why are they running so late?

1224
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,310
- Do a video call.
- Sure.

1225
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,900
- Here.
- The two are resting at home,

1226
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,540
- but they must...
- Suk Jin!

1227
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,110
Change this to a video call.

1228
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,540
- A video call?
- I thought...

1229
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,920
that we should only be popping
the red balloons.

1230
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,210
Suk Jin,
you have to come back here.

1231
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,290
- You're lying.
- We're not.

1232
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,130
The 1st race ended,
and now we must begin the 2nd race.

1233
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,060
- The second race!
- This isn't a joke.

1234
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,650
Take a look yourself.

1235
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,150
We've been waiting around for you.

1236
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,730
This isn't a joke?

1237
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,900
A second race?

1238
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,360
He already changed into home wear.

1239
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,230
He changed already.

1240
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,400
The second race has begun,
and you must get here.

1241
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,360
This is no joke.

1242
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,810
You must be deadly serious.

1243
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,040
(Calling Suk Jin back
finally makes it real.)

1244
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,880
You... You do know...

1245
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,440
that you're not right
in the head, right?

1246
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,650
- Are you kidding me?
- Hurry over here.

1247
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,310
Suk Jin, are you crazy?

1248
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,110
Why are you still home
when it's the day of filming?

1249
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,150
Suk Jin, hurry.
We're all waiting for you here.

1250
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,580
Hurry over here!

1251
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,920
Is this for real?

1252
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,210
Hurry back here!

1253
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,880
I knew something like this
would happen!

1254
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,650
Are you kidding me?

1255
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,060
Hurry on over.
This is the second race.

1256
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,420
(Suk Jin gets angry
when he's the one running late.)

1257
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,830
My wife and I were about
to go to a food court.

1258
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,230
A food court?

1259
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,230
Now's not the time for that.

1260
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,500
Bring your wife with you.

1261
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,860
Text me the address.
My manager's in Songpa-gu.

1262
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,310
(Text me the address.
My manager's in Songpa-gu.)

1263
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,380
- What?
- Hyung In is downstairs.

1264
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,770
Hyung In is downstairs,
so hurry on down.

1265
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,350
Is this for real?

1266
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,940
- Yes, Hyung In is downstairs.
- It's for real.

1267
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,170
Are you kidding me?

1268
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,880
Hurry on over.
Get here in 30 minutes.

1269
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,110
(Se Chan calls Kwang Soo
who's also late to the set.)

1270
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,750
- Check out Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo.

1271
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,380
- What are you up to?
- What are you doing?

1272
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,150
Filming will begin once again.

1273
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,560
Get over here!

1274
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,830
- What do you think you're doing?
- That was the first face.

1275
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,790
- The second race.
- The second race has begun.

1276
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,270
- The filming for it has begun.
- Hurry over here.

1277
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,000
- Where do I go?
- The first race is over.

1278
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,360
Just get over here.

1279
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,400
(He is being told to hurry
to an unknown location.)

1280
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,830
What are you doing
on the day of filming?

1281
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,670
Honestly, you should shave.

1282
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,270
It's a weird look on you.

1283
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,440
You look like Woong's Father.

1284
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,580
- Why is the camera at an odd angle?
- Hurry over!

1285
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,080
You're drunk, aren't you?

1286
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,210
Hey!

1287
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,020
Are you kidding me?

1288
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,250
The rest of the members await you.

1289
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,810
- What?
- You shouldn't be late to work.

1290
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,750
You've got to be kidding me.

1291
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,750
I was told to relax for the day,

1292
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,860
and I almost took a shower.

1293
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,130
You must've been waiting for me
ever since you dropped me off.

1294
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,730
You guys are unbelievable.

1295
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,210
My wife and I were about
to go out for lunch.

1296
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,830
(Suk Jin gets in the van
instead of going to the food court.)

1297
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,440
(Kwang Soo heads to work too.)

1298
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,610
Hello.

1299
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,770
(He's leaving the house
an hour after coming home.)

1300
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,850
Shouldn't you be at work today?

1301
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,150
(He gets himself a weapon.)

1302
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,580
The others are all gathered.

1303
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,750
(The others are all gathered.)

1304
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,170
The first Read the Room Race
has ended,

1305
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,630
and the second Read the Room Race
has begun.

1306
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,670
(An angry slap)

1307
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,150
What the...

1308
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,980
(Mr. Lee, are you heading to work?)

1309
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,440
Yes, but this isn't
my first time today.

1310
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,150
- Was this planned?
- No.

1311
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,380
She's asking for real?

1312
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,580
It's my second time
going to work today.

1313
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,630
Bye.

1314
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,860
Goodness.

1315
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,600
All right.

1316
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,400
In the second Read the Room Race,

1317
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,830
you will also play games
to win coins.

1318
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:27,230
Win 70,
and you'll head home for the day.

1319
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,500
- 70 coins?
- 70.

1320
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,860
They're trying to keep us here.

1321
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,060
Do we start with the coins we have?

1322
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,630
I don't want to go
since we'll have to come back.

1323
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,000
Right. It's better to stay here.

1324
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,110
- It's better to stay here.
- Exactly.

1325
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,380
- There could be a third race.
- I'm guessing...

1326
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,310
Is there an end
to this series of races?

1327
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,670
You have
an ending planned out, right?

1328
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,440
A certain move will unlock that.

1329
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,750
How many races do you have planned?

1330
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,210
I can't tell you that.

1331
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,150
Why not? How long will this go on?

1332
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,690
For the second race,
you'll change into...

1333
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,360
the team uniforms from our sponsor.

1334
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,690
- He must be crazy.
- This is reckless.

1335
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,690
- He...
- What is he doing?

1336
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,020
We have team uniforms?

1337
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,330
Please go and change.

1338
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,290
Chan Hee, I'll get going then.

1339
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,540
What was that?

1340
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,130
Good job, everyone.

1341
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,360
- Good job, guys.
- You're the best.

1342
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,460
We'll be right back.

1343
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,940
- Good job on the first race.
- Thank you.

1344
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,380
- We'll be right back.
- Should we clean this up?

1345
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,500
(Those who were on time
go to change into team uniforms.)

1346
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,980
This is where
you'll keep your coins.

1347
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,480
Am I out of coins?

1348
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,940
You used them all earlier...

1349
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,480
to excuse yourself
from the first race.

1350
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,360
Seriously?

1351
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,630
I want to comment on that,

1352
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,920
but all I can think of
are profanities.

1353
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,020
I knew something was up
which is why I kept asking,

1354
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,290
but you said it was for real.

1355
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,690
How can one think
that there will be a new race?

1356
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,460
Suk Jin's here!

1357
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,600
He's here!

1358
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:37,830
- He's in his own clothes.
- He's wearing his own clothes.

1359
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,770
Isn't he the worst dresser?

1360
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,080
- Is he a carrot?
- A carrot?

1361
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,710
Turn him upside down.

1362
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:44,810
- You're right.
- An orange.

1363
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,610
You should've known better
than to have gone home.

1364
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,920
Why did you go home?

1365
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,110
You have no idea
how many times I asked.

1366
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,210
I asked numerous times,
but I was told it was okay.

1367
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,690
Did you cancel your reservation
at the food court?

1368
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,060
Who makes reservations
at a food court?

1369
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,630
- You just go to one.
- Is that so?

1370
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,000
My wife was changing when...

1371
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,100
(He was summoned back to work
without eating a proper meal.)

1372
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Do you know
what was more surprising?

1373
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,920
My cameraman must not have known...

1374
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,330
because he was beaming...

1375
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,940
when I told him to have a good day.

1376
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,960
- Because he was heading home?
- He was like this.

1377
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,400
Later on, I asked...

1378
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:12,880
if he didn't know.

1379
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,630
(Nodding)

1380
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,350
How can you fool my cameraman too?

1381
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,250
We had to keep it confidential.

1382
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,650
Kwang Soo's here.

1383
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,190
Kwang Soo, you can't lose
your focus on set like this.

1384
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,940
- What?
- Where was your focus?

1385
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,020
- It's not over until it's over.
- How can you be this dense?

1386
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,520
How can you be this dense?

1387
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,980
What's happening?

1388
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,520
- I actually talked to him...
- What's going on?

1389
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,130
on the phone earlier. I said,

1390
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,790
"Kwang Soo,
you'll be quitting the show soon,"

1391
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,230
"so I don't think this is right."

1392
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,600
When I told him that,

1393
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:42,770
he said,
"I know. I was a little upset."

1394
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:44,400
They won't just let you go
like that.

1395
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,980
This is the second race.

1396
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,350
- I need to get changed again.
- Go and put on our uniform.

1397
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,250
- I'll give you the first mission.
- What is it?

1398
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,480
It's called Foot Volleyball of Wits.

1399
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,350
- Foot Volleyball of Wits?
- We're playing foot volleyball?

1400
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,580
We'll let you choose
one or the other...

1401
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,690
based on your preference.

1402
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,690
Those who choose the same option
will be on the same team.

1403
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,360
Then you'll play a game
of foot volleyball for five points.

1404
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,420
Each player will earn points
through the game.

1405
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,420
You'll then change the team.

1406
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,420
(They'll play another game
of foot volleyball...)

1407
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,440
(after changing the team.)

1408
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,460
If someone reaches 15 points,
then the mission will be over.

1409
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,110
Coins will be given to three people
with the highest points.

1410
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,850
If you choose your team well,
you can earn many points.

1411
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,310
- Okay!
- Okay, got it.

1412
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:28,170
- It's a random game.
- Let's move to the court now.

1413
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,020
You'll win
if you have good teammates.

1414
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,960
Let's divide into teams
after the practice round.

1415
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,080
- Okay!
- Yes!

1416
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,480
You can do it. You can really do it.

1417
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,790
Wait for it. There. It's here.

1418
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,460
It's here. So Min, kick it softly.

1419
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,730
There you go.

1420
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:44,830
(She walks to the ball
looking determined,)

1421
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:47,900
(but she ends up hurting herself.)

1422
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,670
(So Min's slapstick comedy
makes the guys burst into laughter.)

1423
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,710
Hey!

1424
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,500
Hey, that was
a typical slapstick comedy.

1425
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,080
- Well done.
- A fool's slapstick comedy.

1426
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,080
- That was funny.
- It's...

1427
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,610
It's not easy to pull off.

1428
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,290
- Everyone, please gather around.
- Okay.

1429
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,920
Listen to the options I give you,

1430
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,150
and you'll be split into teams
by sitting or standing.

1431
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,420
- Okay!
- Okay!

1432
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,230
You can't study the room
and pick the option accordingly.

1433
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:11,750
- Of course not!
- No, we won't!

1434
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,000
If anyone hesitates,
then we should do it again.

1435
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,060
Stand in a line.

1436
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,060
- Director.
- Yes?

1437
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,420
What if we're divided into
teams of 5 and 3?

1438
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,830
- We'll just play with those teams.
- Oh, really?

1439
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,290
- Really?
- Even if it's 6 to 2?

1440
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,730
Yes, we'll just go with the result.

1441
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:21,960
Don't read the room and copy others.

1442
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,310
- We should turn around randomly.
- Okay, let's do that.

1443
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,770
- Okay, then you should turn around.
- You should turn around.

1444
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,080
- Okay. Turn around.
- Do we have to go this far?

1445
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,210
Se Chan, you should turn around.

1446
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:31,750
Choose the person you want to visit
on your day off.

1447
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,520
Sit down if you want to go
to Jong Kook's place...

1448
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,980
and remain standing
if you want to go to Jae Suk's.

1449
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,580
(Sit down if you want to go to
Jong Kook's place.)

1450
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,440
(Remain standing
if you want to go to Jae Suk's.)

1451
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,460
- 1, 2, 3.
- What about me and Jae Suk?

1452
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,480
The same goes for you two.

1453
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,150
All right,
the teams have been decided.

1454
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,020
- Okay!
- All right!

1455
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,730
- Okay!
- All right! Who's on our team?

1456
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,460
Jong Kook, Suk Jin, Haha,
and Se Chan are on one team.

1457
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,230
What's this?

1458
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:53,790
It's because he lives alone,
but Jae Suk has a family.

1459
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,360
So it'd be uncomfortable
to hang out there.

1460
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,400
That's right.

1461
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,000
- My place is more comfortable.
- We can drink at his place.

1462
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,400
My place is more comfortable.

1463
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,400
Thank you for choosing
to come to my place though.

1464
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,980
It's uncomfortable
because Jae Suk has a family.

1465
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,610
Thank you for choosing
to come to my place.

1466
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,480
(The host takes care
of the visitors.)

1467
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,190
I actually wanted to choose
Jong Kook's place.

1468
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,520
But it's your place.

1469
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,310
All right! Let's do this!

1470
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,290
How are we supposed to play
against them?

1471
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,060
Ji Hyo and So Min
can use your hands.

1472
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,130
Okay. Let's do this.

1473
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,630
- Do we serve first?
- Yes.

1474
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,900
Okay. I'll kick it.

1475
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,860
(Kwang Soo serves first.)

1476
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,500
- Has it started?
- Are you going to kick it?

1477
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Okay, there you go.

1478
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,440
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- All right!

1479
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,440
(The ball doesn't go over the net.)

1480
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,040
(Se Chan makes an absurd mistake.)

1481
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,110
You don't know who'll win!

1482
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,210
- We got it!
- You don't know who'll win!

1483
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,440
Everyone on Team Jae Suk
gets a point.

1484
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,810
No, we need to decide
who serves first!

1485
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,440
- We need to decide who serves!
- We need to decide who serves!

1486
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,770
- But you agreed to it earlier.
- We need to decide on it first!

1487
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,540
- Mister, you agreed to it earlier.
- You can't do that!

1488
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,020
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- You agreed to it earlier.

1489
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,150
We'll let them serve first.

1490
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:44,480
- Mister, you agreed to it earlier.
- No, we need to decide first.

1491
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,520
- Why did you serve first?
- You agreed to it earlier!

1492
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,880
- Why did you serve first?
- Then why did you agree to it?

1493
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,420
Explain it to me.
Tell me the reason.

1494
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,650
They chose to hang out at my place!

1495
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,360
What about these guys?

1496
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,520
These kids chose
to hang out at my place!

1497
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,520
- Yes, you're one of us.
- They chose my place!

1498
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,560
- "These kids"?
- Yes, you're one of us.

1499
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,170
- Did he just refer to me as a kid?
- Hey, we...

1500
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,460
I'll let it go
since we're on the same team.

1501
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:03,730
- Let's play.
- You can play with your hands too,

1502
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,730
so don't get flustered.

1503
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,610
- Just hit it with your hand!
- Don't try to use your foot.

1504
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,400
My ball!

1505
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,580
- That's good!
- You called for it! Hurry!

1506
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,710
That's good!

1507
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,080
- He just passed it over the net.
- Take it easy.

1508
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,690
- Here it is.
- He just passed it over the net.

1509
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,020
- Take it easy.
- Here it is.

1510
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,920
- Should I kick it?
- No. Good job.

1511
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,920
- My ball!
- Take it easy.

1512
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,360
- Take it easy.
- My ball!

1513
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:24,130
My ball!

1514
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,400
- Okay, good job.
- Kick it.

1515
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,150
- Wait, wait.
- Just pass it over.

1516
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,170
- Just pass it over!
- No!

1517
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,860
- Nice. It's out!
- Out!

1518
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,630
- I told you to just pass it over.
- It was an easy ball though.

1519
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,400
- You could've just passed it over.
- I could've done it.

1520
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,060
- You never know who'll win!
- All right!

1521
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:37,960
Kwang Soo, good job!

1522
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,730
- It's okay.
- Let's do this!

1523
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,900
- They're nothing.
- Let's smile now.

1524
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,150
Hold on! Haha.

1525
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,270
Those who say "Let's smile"
get three coins.

1526
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,520
- Why?
- Really?

1527
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,250
The one who says "Let's smile"
gets three coins.

1528
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,650
(Really?)

1529
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:51,920
- Let's smile.
- Let's smile.

1530
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,290
What did he say?

1531
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,730
(The one who says "Let's smile"
or "This is fun" first...)

1532
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,130
(gets 3 coins.)

1533
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,520
Let's smile!

1534
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,560
(Laughing)

1535
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,650
- What was that?
- Look at him.

1536
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,020
- Let's cheer up!
- Let's do this!

1537
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,020
Let's cheer up!

1538
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,130
- Let's beat them all!
- What was that?

1539
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,460
Let's bet our lives on it!

1540
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,860
- We can do this.
- Let's cheer up.

1541
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,170
- It's okay. It's okay.
- We got this.

1542
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,630
- Let's do our best!
- Hey, it's okay.

1543
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:15,500
Let's play until the end
even if we lose!

1544
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,670
- Hey!
- Pump it up! Pump it up!

1545
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,040
- Hey!
- That was incredible.

1546
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,750
Hey! You're like ginseng!

1547
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,420
"Ginseng"?

1548
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,110
What do you mean?

1549
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,290
You're like ginseng to me.

1550
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,020
- You're like ginseng.
- Let's cheer up.

1551
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,020
There was a rule to give
three coins to the one who says...

1552
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,100
- "Let's smile" or "This is fun."
- This is driving me crazy.

1553
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,630
This is driving me crazy.

1554
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,830
- 8012!
- Let's play.

1555
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,630
We're winning by two points.

1556
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:41,040
- Let's play!
- 8012! We're one!

1557
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,360
- Yes, we are!
- Okay.

1558
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,770
- Let's smile!
- Let's smile!

1559
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,380
8012, 8012.

1560
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,380
(The game resumes
with Kwang Soo's serve.)

1561
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,170
- That was good.
- Suk Jin, it's yours.

1562
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,440
- Well done, Kwang Soo.
- That's good.

1563
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,500
- Nice!
- All right!

1564
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,520
(They make another absurd mistake.)

1565
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,810
- Nice!
- All right!

1566
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:55,440
- You're good!
- You never know who'll win.

1567
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,940
- I'm so happy...
- All right!

1568
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,060
I'm so happy to have you on my team.

1569
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,110
I'm so happy too!

1570
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:01,150
- I love it.
- I'm so happy.

1571
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,460
- You're indispensable.
- You're the best!

1572
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,960
- We're going to smile for real now.
- You're the best player.

1573
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,400
- Let's smile for real.
- You're so good.

1574
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,290
- Let's smile.
- He's the best player.

1575
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,900
- He's the best player.
- It's okay.

1576
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,790
- He's an indispensable player.
- Suk Jin!

1577
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,730
It's okay. It's really okay.

1578
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:13,960
- That can happen.
- There's no winner or loser...

1579
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,960
in this game.

1580
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,960
- Let's do this!
- We can do it.

1581
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,130
- We can do it.
- Okay!

1582
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,230
(They play for the match point
without getting extra coins.)

1583
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,310
That was a good one, Kwang Soo.

1584
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,440
Nice serve.

1585
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,850
- Get it. There you go.
- Okay.

1586
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,350
- Pass it to Suk Jin.
- Pass it to Suk Jin.

1587
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,770
- Take it easy.
- Use your head.

1588
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,520
- What was that?
- I said use your head!

1589
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,610
- Use your head.
- Use your head.

1590
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:31,540
(He kicks it straight in the net.)

1591
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,750
- I said use your head!
- What was that?

1592
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:35,520
- What's wrong with him?
- It's okay.

1593
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,520
It's okay.

1594
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,520
How come they're so bad at it?

1595
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,460
- Well done, everyone!
- It's over!

1596
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,400
- All right!
- I can't believe our team won.

1597
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,230
The members on Team Jae Suk
win four points,

1598
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,540
and the members on Team Jong Kook
win one point.

1599
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,000
- All right!
- I told you to use your head.

1600
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,330
- I told you to use your head.
- My head?

1601
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,540
We kept shouting to you.

1602
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,900
- Sorry about that.
- Let me massage you.

1603
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,610
I'll remember these members!

1604
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,770
- That was great!
- Let's play one more time.

1605
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:54,980
We'll play another round.
Please line up.

1606
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,170
- Okay.
- It's okay.

1607
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,080
- Half of you should turn around.
- Okay.

1608
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,110
You should turn around.

1609
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,440
Pick the person
you'll hang out with...

1610
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,110
after the shoot.

1611
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,520
Sit down if you want to hang out
with Ji Hyo,

1612
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,020
and remain standing if it's So Min.

1613
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,150
1, 2, 3!

1614
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,460
Oh, no.

1615
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,060
(Everyone chose Ji Hyo.)

1616
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,060
This is crazy.

1617
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,060
(Disappointed)

1618
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,900
All right.
It'll be a game of 6 against 2.

1619
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,170
I have no idea how it turned out.
How did it go?

1620
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,770
I sat down.

1621
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:25,130
6 against 2?

1622
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,710
It's 6 against 2?
She took off her microphone.

1623
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,000
- Ji Hyo.
- She took off her microphone.

1624
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,650
(She takes off her microphone
to protest.)

1625
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,270
- She took off her microphone.
- I'll quit the show.

1626
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,150
- Goodbye.
- That's not it!

1627
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:39,750
- I really contemplated.
- Please come back, So Min!

1628
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,980
What's worse is that no one
is stopping her from leaving.

1629
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,920
- I didn't know.
- It'd be too tiring, that's why.

1630
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,060
- Let's smile! This is fun!
- Let's smile!

1631
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,170
- Let's smile!
- This is so therapeutic!

1632
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,500
So Min, this isn't...

1633
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,130
This is so therapeutic and nice.

1634
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,230
So Min,
please don't get the wrong idea.

1635
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,830
Okay? Okay.

1636
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,730
- Okay, okay.
- It's after the shoot.

1637
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,730
- Right? You get me, right?
- It'd be too tiring.

1638
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,810
Everyone!

1639
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,270
We'll give 3 coins to the 6 of you.

1640
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:04,580
- Why?
- Why? What was it about?

1641
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,250
- Why are you giving them to us?
- Why?

1642
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,770
- Why are you giving them to us?
- Why not us?

1643
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,520
Why aren't you giving us any?
Why can't we get coins?

1644
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,580
- Why? What's the reason?
- What about Ji Hyo and me?

1645
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,060
- What's the reason?
- We can't tell you the reason.

1646
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,210
Are we getting the coins
because we have more members?

1647
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:15,480
But you didn't give them
to us earlier.

1648
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,420
- It was 4 to 4.
- Oh, so it's different.

1649
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,580
That was another mission.

1650
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,520
What about Ji Hyo and me?
Why aren't we getting one?

1651
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,270
There's a reason for giving them,
so we'll tell you that later.

1652
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,520
- Why? What is this about?
- What's the reason?

1653
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,860
- What could it be?
- Let's just enjoy it.

1654
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,600
Let's go, let's go!

1655
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,330
- Ji Hyo, Let's do this.
- We can do this.

1656
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,630
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

1657
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,610
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

1658
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,610
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

1659
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,310
This is exciting! This is fun!

1660
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,380
Hey, hey.

1661
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,440
All right. Let's go!

1662
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,110
- Let's huddle up!
- All right!

1663
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,110
(Cheering)

1664
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,750
- Let's do this.
- Let's go!

1665
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,190
Why is he suddenly dancing?

1666
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,250
- We'll only use our heads.
- Let's do that.

1667
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,860
Let's win all five points.

1668
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,420
- Let's do that.
- Let's win all five points.

1669
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,020
- I can do it! Bring it on!
- Let's go!

1670
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,330
Bring it on!

1671
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,460
- Here it goes.
- Okay.

1672
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,790
(The game starts
with Ji Hyo's serve.)

1673
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,440
- All right!
- All right!

1674
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,710
- We got one point.
- All right!

1675
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,710
- All right!
- We got one point!

1676
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,480
- It's okay, it's okay.
- It's okay.

1677
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,610
- You did well.
- Get the ball.

1678
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:08,710
We can do this.

1679
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,850
(Kwang Soo serves next.)

1680
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,350
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing?

1681
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,350
(Another absurd serve)

1682
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,520
- Hey, what was that about?
- Give me your coins.

1683
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,250
- The ground...
- What's wrong with him?

1684
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,790
It's okay, Kwang Soo.

1685
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,750
8012, 8012!

1686
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,230
Well done, Kwang Soo. Well done.

1687
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,330
(Two of them cheer Kwang Soo up
without even looking at him,)

1688
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,690
(and this guy is serious
about the game.)

1689
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:31,560
He's just playing as he pleases
now that he's quitting.

1690
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,130
- Jong Kook...
- You're doing as you please!

1691
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,290
Did you hear him? He said...

1692
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,610
Kwang Soo is playing as he pleases
now that he's quitting.

1693
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,330
- It wasn't like that.
- You should think about us!

1694
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:39,810
We're okay!

1695
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,170
Kwang Soo, you're so cool!
You did well!

1696
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,170
- That was good.
- You can throw it.

1697
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,270
Just throw it.

1698
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,350
(She changes her strategy
and throws the ball.)

1699
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,580
- She's stepping way over the line.
- That was a good throw.

1700
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,880
- Hey. Darn it!
- Hey!

1701
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,880
- All right!
- What's wrong with you?

1702
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,880
(This time, he makes a mistake
in receiving the ball.)

1703
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:54,310
(The ball falls helplessly
in front of the net.)

1704
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,080
- What's wrong with you?
- It's just that...

1705
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,360
You're so cool!

1706
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,130
- Hey!
- This can happen, you know?

1707
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,330
Are you an attention seeker?

1708
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,190
- What's wrong with him?
- This happens a lot, doesn't it?

1709
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,060
- What's wrong with you, Kwang Soo?
- Are you an attention seeker?

1710
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,540
- You should pass the ball to us.
- What was that about?

1711
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,830
- What's wrong with you?
- Well done, Kwang Soo.

1712
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,460
- It's okay, Kwang Soo.
- What's wrong with him?

1713
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,580
- You don't mean it.
- Kwang Soo, well done.

1714
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,480
I'll never do that again.
I'll do better from now on.

1715
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:18,440
(The game turned around
because of Kwang Soo.)

1716
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,810
- You can serve now.
- Here it goes.

1717
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,810
You need to go behind that line.

1718
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,080
He won't go easy on her anymore.

1719
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,520
He won't go easy on her anymore
because we're losing.

1720
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,960
- It's okay. You can do it!
- Think positively!

1721
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,020
Think positively!

1722
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,020
You should think positively
just like me.

1723
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,330
- He won't go easy on her for real.
- Okay, okay.

1724
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:32,360
There you go.

1725
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,100
- Let's play!
- You can't throw it, can you?

1726
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,500
- It's out.
- Okay!

1727
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,790
- It's out, Ji Hyo.
- It's out.

1728
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:39,060
Okay, we got two points!

1729
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,790
(Kim Positive became positive again
after earning a point.)

1730
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:41,790
- This is...
- Move!

1731
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,500
Here it comes! Kick the ball.

1732
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,500
- It's out.
- What do you mean?

1733
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,310
Ji Hyo! Hit it!

1734
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,900
(She received it!)

1735
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,900
- Hit it!
- Okay!

1736
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,850
- Two! You should hit it!
- Okay, we won!

1737
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,210
(But they end up
letting their chance go to waste.)

1738
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,480
(Okay, we won!)

1739
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:00,860
- All right!
- All right!

1740
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,690
Darn it!
This is not foot volleyball!

1741
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:06,250
- What is this?
- Hey! This is not foot volleyball!

1742
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,130
(They don't care.)

1743
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:10,190
(They're fully enjoying their win.)

1744
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,790
(They're ecstatic when they won
against them with 6 members.)

1745
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:16,170
- I'm sorry, but we won!
- I feel bad for them.

1746
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,810
(Thud)

1747
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,270
Why would you throw that at me?

1748
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,330
So now...

1749
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,110
Kwang Soo and Jae Suk
are in first place.

1750
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:23,210
All right!

1751
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,080
- Please line up again.
- Okay.

1752
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,210
I'll start while I'm seated.

1753
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,310
You need to choose one penalty.

1754
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:32,860
If you want Se Chan's finger flick,
please sit down.

1755
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,560
If you want to be flogged
by Kwang Soo, remain standing.

1756
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,730
1, 2, 3.

1757
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
(Jong Kook, Haha, and So Min
chose to sit down.)

1758
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,770
Jong Kook, Haha, and So Min
are in one team.

1759
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,000
- Oh, no.
- All right!

1760
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,170
- That's good!
- It's worth a try.

1761
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,330
Yes, it's worth a try.

1762
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,770
We'll win for sure.

1763
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,330
- Yes, we can win this.
- Let's win.

1764
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,440
You and I will play freely.

1765
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,440
Everyone!

1766
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,270
We'll give three coins
to this team's members.

1767
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,710
- Why is that?
- Did they practice?

1768
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,170
- We'll give you three each.
- Why?

1769
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:58,580
Hey, it must be related
to the court.

1770
00:56:58,650 --> 00:56:59,650
Teams on this side of the court
get the coins.

1771
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,670
Oh, you're right.

1772
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:02,880
- That must be it.
- Oh, really?

1773
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,940
- But we didn't get it the 1st time.
- We didn't get it the 1st time.

1774
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:05,960
Is it because
they're being considerate of So Min?

1775
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,080
Are they being considerate
of So Min?

1776
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,580
But we were considerate
of Ji Hyo too.

1777
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:11,080
(So it was because
we were considerate of So Min?)

1778
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,130
So Min.

1779
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,290
(Forcing himself to pat her)

1780
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,520
- So Min.
- Don't do it.

1781
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,770
- Are you sweating?
- Don't do it.

1782
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:17,790
- Don't do it.
- Here, wipe your sweat.

1783
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,960
- Ji Hyo, get on my back.
- But just now...

1784
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,860
Get on my back, Ji Hyo.

1785
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,710
She's on his back now.

1786
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:26,610
Ji Hyo said her legs hurt.

1787
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,170
- So we... Are you okay, Ji Hyo?
- Let's rub her shoulders.

1788
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,080
- Ji Hyo, are you okay?
- Yes, Jae Suk.

1789
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,350
Thank you, Jae Suk.

1790
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,080
Blow your nose, Ji Hyo. Blow it!

1791
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,110
It's okay.

1792
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:37,650
- There you go.
- Relax your body.

1793
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,380
Ji Hyo, you're so light.

1794
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,750
Did something happen?

1795
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:41,860
Don't you lie.

1796
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,520
Your face is so red.

1797
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,230
Your legs are shaking.
What are you talking about?

1798
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,500
I'm serious.
Why did you lose so much weight?

1799
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,500
No, Jae Suk.

1800
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,500
(While they're pretending
to be nice to each other...)

1801
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,290
Gosh, this is so funny.

1802
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,600
(He found something.)

1803
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,500
(He found makeup tools
on the table.)

1804
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,770
- Hey, come here.
- I have no idea.

1805
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,860
If you draw something...

1806
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,480
- Will they give us more coins?
- Draw something on your face.

1807
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,880
- Really?
- Do you want me to draw for you?

1808
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,670
(They catch on fast
and quickly put on makeup.)

1809
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:05,810
Are you sure about it?

1810
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:07,380
(What are they doing?)

1811
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:10,250
- Bo Pil!
- Let's do this!

1812
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,110
- We can do it!
- Bo Pil, will you look at us?

1813
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,880
(Will they give us coins
if we put on makeup?)

1814
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,690
There were some tools there,
so I drew something...

1815
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,060
as an entertainer!

1816
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,400
They are giving him coins.

1817
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,900
- They're giving out coins for real?
- Okay!

1818
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,040
They're giving them out for real?

1819
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,940
We got five coins each!

1820
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,400
How many did they give you?

1821
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,400
(They get busy after seeing Haha
and So Min getting coins.)

1822
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,540
- This is...
- Wow.

1823
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,730
- They got five coins?
- Bo Pil!

1824
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,350
"Bo Pil".

1825
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,210
(How do I look?)

1826
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:42,420
Bo Pil. Thank you.

1827
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,650
- Bo Pil!
- Isn't this too normal?

1828
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,650
- It's not good enough.
- Is it?

1829
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:49,650
(He gets rejected.)

1830
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,250
They'll reject you
if it's not good enough.

1831
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,330
You need to draw more!

1832
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,520
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo set out.)

1833
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,960
No, that's mine!

1834
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,060
(Title,
Looking dejected with dark circles)

1835
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,000
Gosh, I'm so tired.

1836
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,060
Let's smile!

1837
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,540
(She earns coins
for excellent makeup and acting.)

1838
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,770
- Thank you.
- Let's smile!

1839
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,540
Let's smile.

1840
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:08,900
(Kwang Soo looks like
the cymbal-banging monkey.)

1841
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,900
Let's smile!

1842
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,440
Bo Pil!

1843
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,020
(He gives it another try
after drawing on some glasses.)

1844
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,440
How's this? Do you not like it?

1845
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:15,770
Tell me fast!

1846
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:17,380
The first five people...

1847
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,420
who put on makeup
using the makeup tools on site...

1848
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,690
earn five coins.

1849
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,790
- They only give up to 5 people.
- 5 people?

1850
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:26,420
- You're the 6th. That was so close.
- I almost didn't get them.

1851
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,500
I even drew on glasses.

1852
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,020
- It's for five people only?
- I even drew snot.

1853
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,000
We talked fiercely
about what to draw there.

1854
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,100
It's over.

1855
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,540
- It's over.
- It's okay!

1856
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,600
- Darn it.
- Let's smile.

1857
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,400
- Let's try smiling.
- Who's going to serve first?

1858
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,630
- You can serve first.
- Rock-paper-scissors?

1859
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,040
- Shall we serve first?
- No.

1860
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,610
- No, you can't.
- Sorry?

1861
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,000
- We'll serve first.
- Why?

1862
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,150
You can serve first.

1863
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,310
- No, you can serve first.
- You can serve first.

1864
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:46,710
- You can serve first.
- No, you can serve first.

1865
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:47,980
Oh, no. Are you okay?

1866
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,250
No, you can serve first.

1867
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,380
(Hitting the target)

1868
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,880
(The ball hits him
right on the back of his head.)

1869
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,560
- Are you okay?
- Jong Kook.

1870
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,520
Wait a minute. Jong Kook.

1871
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,520
I swear! I swear to the Almighty.

1872
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,900
- I didn't throw it at you.
- Hey.

1873
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,190
Jong Kook, I saw your eyes.

1874
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,230
No, no.

1875
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,790
- I saw your eyes.
- That's not true.

1876
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,270
- Jong Kook...
- It's okay.

1877
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,770
- It can't be helped.
- You just need to win against him.

1878
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,130
We can do it. It's okay.

1879
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,270
- Your eyes...
- I can't...

1880
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:14,540
I can't throw the ball like this
and hit the back of his head.

1881
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,110
I turned around
because I heard a loud thud.

1882
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:19,000
But it really hit the spot.

1883
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,150
- It hit right on his head.
- I swear.

1884
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,250
You know, right?
I really didn't mean it.

1885
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,880
- It was a mistake, right?
- Yes, it was.

1886
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,110
- Right. It's okay.
- I didn't mean to hit you.

1887
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,790
- Of course.
- I could never hit you like that.

1888
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,960
- Suk Jin, just laugh it off!
- Okay.

1889
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,080
- Who are you talking to?
- Let's smile!

1890
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,060
- Let's smile!
- Who are you saying that to?

1891
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,290
- Give them the ball.
- I think this is how you get coins.

1892
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,460
- Let's play!
- Okay.

1893
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,100
- Nice serve!
- I got it.

1894
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,790
- Haha. Haha.
- That was a stable serve.

1895
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,100
- Jong Kook.
- Give it to her.

1896
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,810
- Head.
- Use your hand!

1897
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:43,960
(Smashing)

1898
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:45,400
- There you go!
- Wait.

1899
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,710
- There you go.
- You can hit harder than that,

1900
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:47,810
- So Min.
- Pass the ball.

1901
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,270
- Ji Hyo! Use your hand!
- Ji Hyo!

1902
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,400
Pass it over.

1903
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,810
There you go!

1904
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:52,880
No, we won.

1905
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,420
- No, it was correct.
- No, we won, didn't we?

1906
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,750
- No!
- How many times did they bounce it?

1907
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,850
- Four times.
- It doesn't matter.

1908
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,580
That's not it!

1909
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,310
There's a rule
we need to follow, right?

1910
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:02,380
(Suddenly becoming gentle)

1911
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,750
Haha, do you want your coins
taken away?

1912
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:06,100
- Take his coins!
- Do you want your coins taken away?

1913
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,400
- No. Listen.
- No, that's not it.

1914
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,690
- Do you want to go home?
- They bounced it more than 3 times.

1915
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:10,100
- Are you upset?
- Do you want to go home?

1916
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,500
- Did you get mad?
- No, no.

1917
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,270
They bounced the ball
more than three times!

1918
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,130
It's okay if they bounce it
more than three times...

1919
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,310
- on a variety show.
- He said it's okay.

1920
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,110
- But you didn't tell us that.
- They should've told us before.

1921
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,110
Then this shouldn't count.

1922
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,500
- It's a rule. Let's not count it.
- Let's not count this.

1923
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:23,850
- Come on. You can't count this.
- You should've told us.

1924
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,110
(Acting cute)

1925
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:26,110
- So...
- Bo Pil, listen.

1926
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:27,750
Okay, since we didn't know,

1927
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,380
- let's not count it.
- Thank you.

1928
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,650
You should say thank you.

1929
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,190
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1930
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,210
It's so nice
to have everyone smile a lot.

1931
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:35,380
It's a therapeutic show.

1932
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,230
Jong Kook, kick it now. Kick it now.

1933
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,830
- Hey, hey.
- Suk Jin!

1934
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,000
- We got this.
- Suk Jin!

1935
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,830
Darn it.

1936
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:53,000
Suk Jin!

1937
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,520
(He kicks the ball wrong
and hits his own hand.)

1938
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,170
That was so funny.

1939
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,730
- It's over, right?
- This is so fun!

1940
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:00,400
- It's over, right? 5 to 1.
- It is fun, actually.

1941
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,560
Isn't it 4 to 1?

1942
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:04,270
- It's the last round.
- It could be the last round.

1943
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,250
Sit down if you want to be reborn
with Jae Suk's looks.

1944
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,150
Remain standing if you want
to be reborn with Se Chan's looks.

1945
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:10,670
Sit down if you choose Jae Suk.
Keep standing if you choose Se Chan.

1946
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,810
I don't want to play it.

1947
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,380
It's only about their looks. One...

1948
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,250
- If we choose Jae Suk, we sit.
- You should sit down.

1949
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,360
- This is crazy. I can't pick one.
- 1, 2, 3.

1950
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,790
(Only 2 people chose Jae Suk.)

1951
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,150
All right. Six people for Se Chan.

1952
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:24,630
Obviously!

1953
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:26,460
- How can you live with this face?
- Ji Hyo.

1954
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,590
I can't live with his face.

1955
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,270
Se Chan looks okay with his mask on.

1956
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,940
This is nonsense.
I can't believe it.

1957
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,000
- I chose you.
- I'm sorry, Jae Suk.

1958
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,210
(I'm sorry, Jae Suk.)

1959
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,770
- I can't believe it.
- I'm sorry, Jae Suk.

1960
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:38,310
Ji Hyo,
did you misunderstand the rules?

1961
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,150
Ji Hyo, come to my team.

1962
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,210
Oh, right.

1963
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,770
- Why would you follow them?
- Ji Hyo.

1964
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:44,380
You sat down because you thought
you were choosing Se Chan, right?

1965
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:47,090
- Yes.
- You had to remain standing.

1966
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,480
- Come here.
- We could've made Jae Suk...

1967
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,980
play by himself.

1968
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,110
We need to earn at least one point.
We're in trouble.

1969
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:53,830
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

1970
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:56,000
You can do it!

1971
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,920
- Haha!
- Use your head.

1972
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,460
- Haha.
- Use your head.

1973
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,730
(After barely receiving
the ball with his head...)

1974
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,860
- This isn't allowed.
- Why not? It's a variety show!

1975
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,040
(This isn't allowed.)

1976
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,040
(Why not? It's a variety show!)

1977
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,000
- This isn't allowed.
- Why not? It's a variety show.

1978
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,110
Don't get upset!

1979
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,380
But it's a variety show.
Why isn't it allowed?

1980
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,580
(He reads the room
and manages to come to his senses.)

1981
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,270
- Why not? It's a variety show.
- That's allowed, but this isn't?

1982
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:14,540
- Please!
- It'd be funny...

1983
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,940
if I head the ball 100 times.

1984
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,750
- It didn't fall on the ground.
- That's allowed, but this isn't?

1985
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:19,790
- Bo Pil, this is a variety show.
- Are the rules up to you?

1986
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:20,880
When is it allowed?

1987
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,310
You should give us the rules
in advance.

1988
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,020
- Aren't you Ms. Kim Ok Jung?
- I mean...

1989
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:25,610
Ms. Kim Ok Jung.

1990
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:26,730
"Get lucky this year."

1991
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:28,590
- Can't we hit the ball twice?
- Of course not.

1992
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:29,920
- Why not?
- This is a variety show.

1993
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,520
- This is a variety show.
- I thought it was allowed.

1994
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,830
- Seriously.
- What isn't allowed?

1995
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,630
Give us a list
of what is or isn't allowed.

1996
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,500
Are you complaining?

1997
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,230
You shouldn't have touched
that ball.

1998
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,440
(Jae Suk's team wins despite having
only 2 members!)

1999
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,730
Why did you touch it?

2000
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:44,270
You shouldn't have touched
that ball.

2001
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,000
We won!

2002
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,170
(They gathered points diligently.)

2003
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,150
- Jae Suk is 1st place.
- I got 15 points, right?

2004
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,610
- Yes, you did.
- He won.

2005
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,020
The results are out.

2006
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,040
The first place is Jae Suk.

2007
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,090
(The 1st place, Jae Suk)

2008
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:56,590
Really?

2009
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,210
In second place...

2010
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,230
are Kwang Soo and Se Chan.

2011
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,330
- Am I second place?
- Yes.

2012
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:04,860
In third place are Ji Hyo,

2013
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,230
So Min, and Jong Kook.

2014
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:07,270
All right.

2015
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:09,630
How many coins do you need now?

2016
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,400
I think I will go home
after this game.

2017
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,840
I know. I think you will go home.

2018
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,400
(Will they be able to go home
for real this time?)

2019
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,980
In the second mission,

2020
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:22,110
you need to hinder the others
in order to go home.

2021
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,880
The game is
Bend Over and Touch with Your Mouth.

2022
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,580
(Bend Over
and Touch with Your Mouth)

2023
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,420
There will be 1-on-1 matches.

2024
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:29,690
Sit facing each other
with your hands behind your back.

2025
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:33,020
Bend over and move the snacks
with your mouth only.

2026
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,690
The winners will receive coins.

2027
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,250
(The ones who move more snacks
will receive coins.)

2028
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,560
You need to move the snacks
to your tray.

2029
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,770
You don't eat them.

2030
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,540
There are people
who are close to going home.

2031
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,730
- You are right.
- Right?

2032
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,960
Let's wrap things up.

2033
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:47,770
How will we decide on
the list of matches?

2034
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,380
Suk Jin and I will go
against each other.

2035
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,250
- Otherwise,
- This is...

2036
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,810
Kwang Soo could decide...

2037
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,840
- since he will leave the show soon.
- What are you talking about?

2038
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,980
Kwang Soo,
decide the matches one last time.

2039
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,440
- What are you talking about?
- That's a good idea.

2040
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,840
- I am for it.
- One last time?

2041
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,560
- He will leave the show soon,
- I feel sad.

2042
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,810
so we should give him that choice.

2043
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:07,420
- It's time for us
- It's time for us

2044
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:10,650
- To say goodbye
- To say goodbye

2045
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:11,860
What are you doing?

2046
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,090
(They repeatedly prepare
for a parting.)

2047
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:15,420
- Why are you singing that song?
- Bye.

2048
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:18,270
I will go against Suk Jin.

2049
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,710
Let's go.

2050
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:20,900
Shall we start
with Haha and Se Chan?

2051
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:21,940
- Okay.
- Okay.

2052
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,000
All right.

2053
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,770
- Let's put our heads together.
- Get ready.

2054
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:26,810
- What are they doing?
- Set...

2055
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,000
(They support each other
by putting their heads together.)

2056
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,110
- Set,
- Are they working together?

2057
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,520
go.

2058
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:32,650
- It's not a bad idea.
- I know.

2059
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:34,210
- That won't work.
- They are sharing the weight.

2060
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:36,110
- What?
- I knew it wouldn't work.

2061
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:37,710
- It's not a bad idea.
- I know.

2062
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:38,790
- That won't work.
- They are sharing the weight.

2063
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,480
What?

2064
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,250
I can't do it. I can't do it.

2065
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,520
What was that?

2066
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,460
Hey.

2067
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:47,190
He is bad at it.

2068
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,420
Se Chan is bad at it.

2069
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,730
I see that there is something
Se Chan is bad at.

2070
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:51,840
I can't do it.

2071
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:54,230
- Haha is good at it.
- How is he so good at it?

2072
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:56,230
Hey, how will you win that way?

2073
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,610
My goodness.

2074
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,000
Se Chan,
why are you putting your face in it?

2075
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,480
Hey.

2076
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,110
I can't do it.

2077
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:04,810
Se Chan, you got cream
all over your face.

2078
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:05,810
(He is putting it on his skin.)

2079
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:07,250
Se Chan, hold yourself back.

2080
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,090
- Hold yourself back.
- Se Chan has thick legs.

2081
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,520
- That's why he can't do it.
- You are right.

2082
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,860
- I can't do it.
- What is going on?

2083
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,190
I can't do it.

2084
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,880
I can't move any snacks.

2085
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,900
Time's up.

2086
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,750
- He can't do it.
- I can't do it.

2087
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,360
Haha got five snacks.

2088
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,670
Okay!

2089
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,000
- He will go home soon.
- I can't do it.

2090
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:25,590
The second match is...

2091
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,400
- between Jong Kook and Jae Suk.
- Really?

2092
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:29,710
Get ready. Set, go.

2093
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,210
Jae Suk only needs ten coins
to go home.

2094
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:34,400
My goodness. My goodness.

2095
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,650
Set, go.

2096
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:37,170
Jae Suk only needs ten coins
to go home.

2097
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,020
(Here is another man
with a protruding mouth.)

2098
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:40,520
He is bowing nicely.

2099
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,020
My goodness.

2100
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:44,920
(It isn't easy
for Jong Kook either.)

2101
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,980
Hold on. Hold on.

2102
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:48,980
This is impossible.

2103
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,920
- How did Haha do it?
- How did he do it?

2104
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,920
Jong Kook can't reach it.

2105
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,420
My goodness.

2106
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,060
- Come on.
- He is leaning.

2107
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:56,270
Jong Kook is holding out.

2108
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:58,440
How did Haha do it?

2109
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,610
(Jong Kook holds out with his legs,
but he fails soon.)

2110
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:01,730
How did Haha do it?

2111
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,500
(There is something
Jong Kook can't do with his body.)

2112
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,130
Even Jong Kook can't do it.

2113
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:06,270
How did I do it?

2114
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:07,270
- This is fun.
- How am I good at it?

2115
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,480
How are you good at it?

2116
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,420
- You must be flexible.
- How did you do this?

2117
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,340
The one in the middle
is easier to get.

2118
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:14,690
Let's do this.
I will win if I get one.

2119
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,310
Jae Suk will plant his face again.

2120
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,610
He will plant his face again.

2121
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,460
Dear viewers, hello.

2122
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,330
(Pressing)

2123
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:23,830
Dear viewers, hello.

2124
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,690
He is using Jae Suk's head.

2125
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,020
For goodness' sake.

2126
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,190
He is using his head for support.

2127
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,540
For goodness' sake.

2128
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,340
(Biting)

2129
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:34,460
(While Jae Suk was enjoying
the sweetness,)

2130
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,900
(Jong Kook spotted the snack
on his forehead.)

2131
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,840
(He quickly stole it.)

2132
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,000
He stole the snack
that was on your forehead.

2133
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:45,580
Time's up. Jong Kook won.

2134
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:47,920
Jong Kook did it.

2135
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,790
I am so annoyed.

2136
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:50,810
(He only showed politeness.)

2137
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,420
Jong Kook,
you will receive the coins.

2138
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:54,590
Let's go.
You need to wipe your face.

2139
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:56,690
Thank you.

2140
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:57,900
I have a long way to go.

2141
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:00,190
Here.

2142
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:03,400
We should wipe each other's faces.

2143
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,500
Hey!

2144
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:06,060
Why did you take out
so many wet wipes?

2145
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,440
Se Chan, you will get five coins.

2146
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,540
- Why?
- Why?

2147
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,730
- Se Chan, you will get five coins.
- Why?

2148
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:11,840
Why?

2149
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,880
(Did I need to read the room again?)

2150
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,170
You got wet wipes
for your colleagues.

2151
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:18,920
(Five coins)

2152
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:20,880
You got wet wipes
for your colleagues.

2153
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,920
Listen.

2154
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:23,310
Thank you.

2155
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:24,920
I am the one
who is covered in cream.

2156
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:28,090
Didn't you see me...

2157
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:30,000
give him a snack?

2158
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,100
(He feels victimized.)

2159
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,970
You shouldn't use
too many wet wipes.

2160
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,190
Don't we get coins for frugality?

2161
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:36,190
- What?
- Frugality.

2162
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:37,760
- Frugality.
- Stop it.

2163
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,230
(Suk Jin belatedly tries
to help him.)

2164
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:41,300
- What is wrong with you?
- Wipe your face.

2165
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,880
My goodness.

2166
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,880
Jae Suk.

2167
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,140
For goodness' sake.

2168
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,400
(They care a lot about each other
at times like this.)

2169
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,800
For goodness' sake.

2170
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,550
Se Chan, how many coins do you have?

2171
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,350
Hold on. I have close to 70 coins.

2172
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:53,980
- Did Se Chan get 5 coins?
- You have 70 coins.

2173
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:55,220
Se Chan, how many coins do you have?

2174
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:57,460
Will Se Chan go home?

2175
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,050
I think there will be a third race.

2176
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,760
- The second race won't be the last.
- No way.

2177
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,220
You are set. Give them the coins.

2178
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,390
(He turns in the coins
despite people's jealousy.)

2179
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:05,020
You are set.
You have more than 70 coins.

2180
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,000
- I think you are set, Se Chan.
- I think I am set.

2181
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:08,470
Will Se Chan go home?

2182
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,640
- He needs 70 coins.
- Will Se Chan go home?

2183
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,800
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...
- Will Se Chan go home?

2184
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,340
How many coins do I have?
Can I go home?

2185
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:15,640
Se Chan has...

2186
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,140
- 73 coins.
- He can go home.

2187
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:20,900
Se Chan, the second
Read the Room Race is over for you.

2188
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,180
- You can go home.
- Thank you.

2189
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:24,310
- That's incredible.
- Is it over?

2190
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:27,090
There might be a third race.

2191
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:28,180
This is the second race.

2192
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:30,090
Since this is the 2nd race,
there might be a 3rd race.

2193
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:31,110
No, it's over.

2194
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:32,180
(Will he really get to go home
this time?)

2195
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:33,390
- That's incredible.
- Is it over?

2196
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:34,550
I think I will go home for real.

2197
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,390
- I doubt he will get called back.
- There might be a third race.

2198
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,800
Se Chan, congratulations.
Please go home.

2199
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,170
- Thank you.
- Bye.

2200
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,020
- That's incredible.
- I think this is real.

2201
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,730
I will go home without looking back.

2202
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:45,100
See you soon.
I bet you will come back.

2203
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,340
No, this is real.

2204
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,540
Work hard. Bye.

2205
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,670
See you soon.

2206
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:50,580
(Will Se Chan go home for real?)

2207
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,380
Can I really go home?

2208
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:53,680
I should go and wash up.

2209
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:55,600
Hye Jin, let's go.

2210
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:57,470
Mi Rae, let's go.

2211
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:59,050
Turn off your phones.

2212
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:01,220
Turn off your phones.

2213
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,420
I will go home.

2214
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,110
(There is a van
that will take him home.)

2215
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,430
Se Chan left.

2216
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:08,180
The third match.

2217
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,720
It's So Min versus Ji Hyo.

2218
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,550
Set...

2219
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,390
Set, go.

2220
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,930
(As soon as they begin,
they succeed.)

2221
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:16,430
- What?
- What?

2222
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,230
- They are good.
- They can do it.

2223
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:19,300
Why is that?

2224
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,540
They can do it so easily.

2225
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,140
- They can do it so easily.
- Why is that?

2226
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:24,340
- I don't know.
- What's the reason?

2227
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,340
- Is it easy?
- I don't understand.

2228
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:29,100
- So Min.
- She was good at foot volleyball.

2229
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,180
Stop it. Stop it.

2230
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,310
Will she take two at a time?

2231
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:34,850
- Are you comfortable?
- You will save time that way.

2232
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,390
My goodness.

2233
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,720
You will save time that way.

2234
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:41,150
- My goodness.
- She pushed So Min.

2235
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:42,390
She headbutted So Min.

2236
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:44,520
- That's it.
- The match began in earnest.

2237
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,690
Time's up.

2238
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:47,630
Who has more snacks?

2239
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:48,860
So Min does.

2240
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,300
So Min won.

2241
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:52,140
- She got so many snacks.
- Is she close to going home?

2242
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,840
- I don't feel good.
- She has a long way to go.

2243
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:55,670
- So this is meaningless.
- I am nearly done.

2244
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:56,710
What?

2245
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,270
I have 65 or 67 coins.

2246
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:00,350
So Min.

2247
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:01,970
(Covered in cream,
So Min receives the coins!)

2248
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:03,110
Let me wipe your hair.

2249
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,270
(Running over)

2250
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:05,380
Are you okay?

2251
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,720
(Fake good-doers
smelled a chance to earn coins.)

2252
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,250
- All right.
- I will wipe your face.

2253
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,350
Haha.

2254
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:10,790
- Gosh.
- Why?

2255
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:13,260
- It was planned.
- You helped your colleague first.

2256
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,720
That wasn't my intention.

2257
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,850
I didn't do it for the coins.

2258
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:18,350
I helped too.

2259
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,860
- You were late.
- My goodness.

2260
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:21,300
- You were late.
- Listen.

2261
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,890
- You were late.
- You should give me a memo...

2262
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:24,000
- in advance.
- Listen.

2263
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,140
I had everything set up.

2264
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,340
How could you award Haha...

2265
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,730
when he snatched the wet wipe
from me?

2266
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:30,640
Everyone.

2267
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:32,640
We counted Haha's coins.

2268
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,250
- He has exactly 70 coins.
- Really?

2269
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:36,770
That means he can go home.

2270
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:38,440
However...

2271
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,980
However,

2272
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,250
at this point,

2273
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:45,420
we will wrap up
the second Read the Room Race.

2274
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,890
- What?
- Is there another one?

2275
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,090
- The second Read the Room Race.
- What?

2276
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:50,260
Is there another one?

2277
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,800
We will reveal the secrets
of this race.

2278
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,800
- What?
- They will reveal the secrets.

2279
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,360
- What happens to me?
- What are the secrets?

2280
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,170
You will find out
once we reveal them.

2281
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,360
- Are there secrets?
- What are they?

2282
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,470
What are they?

2283
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:02,710
(They will reveal the secrets
of the Read the Room Race.)

2284
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:05,430
For your information,
the actions you must carry out...

2285
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:09,380
in the Games of Wits
are decided by specific conditions.

2286
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:13,480
(The specific conditions
weren't revealed.)

2287
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:17,090
(They had to choose
between forks and chopsticks.)

2288
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:21,480
(A comment about smiling
got them R coins.)

2289
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:27,260
(Everyone was curious about
the conditions.)

2290
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,800
They're giving them out for real?

2291
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,540
(There must be secrets
behind the conditions!)

2292
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:35,670
(Se Chan thought
someone could be behind this.)

2293
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:38,640
("Specific conditions"
were stressed.)

2294
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,600
(The secrets behind the conditions
will be revealed now!)

2295
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,140
You gave coins to people
who said that the weather is nice.

2296
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:46,750
We will introduce
the hero of the day...

2297
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,550
who came up with the conditions.

2298
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:50,760
- What?
- Is there a hero?

2299
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,350
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

2300
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:55,050
Who came up with the conditions?

2301
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:56,260
Is it Se Chan?

2302
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,150
I don't think
it's one of the members.

2303
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:01,260
Who is it? It must be Se Chan.

2304
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,600
It must be Se Chan.

2305
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,640
- Is it Se Chan?
- It's a gift-wrapped car.

2306
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,930
It can't be Se Chan.

2307
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:08,360
If Se Chan gets out of the car,
it won't be a gift.

2308
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,010
Is Se Chan the architect?

2309
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,400
(Se Chan went home the fastest.)

2310
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,750
It isn't Se Chan, is it?

2311
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:16,810
- Is it Se Chan?
- No way.

2312
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:18,470
It would be funny if it's Se Chan.

2313
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:19,980
No. That's not Se Chan's hand.

2314
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,420
- Isn't it Ms. Choi Young In?
- What?

2315
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,720
Ms. Choi?

2316
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:25,420
- Someone is getting out.
- No. That's not Se Chan's hand.

2317
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:26,590
Who is that?

2318
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:27,680
(A young boy gets out of the car.)

2319
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,720
Who came up with the conditions?

2320
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,720
Dream!

2321
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:30,850
Dad!

2322
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:33,360
(Dream?)

2323
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:35,600
What? Ms. Choi?

2324
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,890
(Dream, what are you doing here?)

2325
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:38,500
- Is that Dream?
- Really?

2326
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,470
- Dream!
- What are you doing here?

2327
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,710
(Haha's oldest son, Dream?)

2328
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:45,180
Dream!

2329
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:46,600
Is that Dream?

2330
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,970
(Is Dream the architect?)

2331
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,880
- What is Dream doing here?
- Dream.

2332
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,480
I got goosebumps. What is going on?

2333
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:56,890
Dream, what are you doing here?

2334
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,610
What is going on?

2335
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,630
You should have told me.
Hold on. How... Dream.

2336
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:04,850
(1 day before the shoot)

2337
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,720
(The production crew had a meeting
with the architect secretly.)

2338
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,840
Hello. I am Ha Dream.

2339
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,400
(Ha Dream,
the representative of young viewers)

2340
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:19,230
- Ha Dream, it's nice to meet you.
- Thanks.

2341
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:23,970
We asked to see you
because we need help from you,

2342
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:25,680
an avid fan of Running Man.

2343
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,790
The race we prepared
for the shoot is...

2344
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:29,890
the Read the Room Race.

2345
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:33,020
You will be the architect
of the Games of Wits.

2346
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:37,500
You will decide
which actions of the members...

2347
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,130
will give or take the coins.

2348
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,600
The person with the fewest coins
can't go home right away.

2349
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,230
He or she will go home
after carrying out the penalty.

2350
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:52,710
If they order a dish
that isn't on the menu,

2351
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:55,080
they should lose five coins.

2352
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:59,180
Is there a dish you don't like?

2353
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:01,110
I don't like abalone rice porridge.

2354
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:03,180
(The dish Dream dislikes,
abalone rice porridge)

2355
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,180
I will have abalone rice porridge.

2356
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,850
(That was why the 3 who ordered
abalone rice porridge...)

2357
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:09,850
(got 5 coins taken away.)

2358
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,390
(The reason why they had to choose
the chopsticks...)

2359
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:13,970
(instead of the forks...)

2360
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:15,360
If they choose chopsticks,

2361
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,930
they should earn coins.

2362
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,670
(When someone dropped coins)

2363
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:22,170
If they keep the coins
someone dropped,

2364
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,900
they should return them.

2365
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,880
If they return them to the producer,

2366
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:29,300
they should get to keep them.

2367
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,050
(Dream designed the game
so that honesty could earn coins.)

2368
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:35,850
But I think Dad, Uncle Se Chan,

2369
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,760
Uncle Jae Suk,
and Uncle Kwang Soo...

2370
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,130
will charge at the coins...

2371
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:45,460
like a pack of hyenas
no matter what.

2372
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:47,260
- Are you including your dad?
- Yes.

2373
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:48,630
(Dream knows his dad well.)

2374
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:51,760
Give coins to people...

2375
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,400
who team up with Dad.

2376
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:56,800
(Haha is Dream's favorite person.)

2377
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,340
(That was the reason why
Haha's teammates received coins!)

2378
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:01,140
Dream,
what should happen to those...

2379
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,350
who politely greet others
at the restaurant?

2380
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:06,010
Let's give them five coins.

2381
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,140
Shall we do that?

2382
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,720
- Goodbye. I'll come again.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

2383
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:11,590
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2384
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:17,830
If they tell the others
to put on the seatbelt in the car,

2385
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,860
they should get five coins.

2386
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:23,360
Let's say
the R coins that are smaller...

2387
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:27,760
than the regular R coins
are worth ten.

2388
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:31,080
Can't we make my dad win...

2389
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,380
even if he does badly?

2390
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,550
(This architect has
so much filial love.)

2391
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,140
Do you want him to win
even if he doesn't have coins?

2392
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,220
Yes.

2393
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,640
(Dream wants to see his dad win.)

2394
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:46,850
Thank you for choosing me
to represent the young viewers.

2395
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,460
Eun Jae, are you watching this?

2396
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,500
I am on SBS' Running Man.

2397
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,970
(Dream kept it a secret
even from his dad.)

2398
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:02,800
Dream, what happened?

2399
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:04,770
Dream is here.

2400
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,800
- Dream.
- Dream, hello.

2401
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,080
Dream.

2402
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,270
- What brings you here?
- What happened?

2403
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:12,920
- Dream, you are polite.
- What happened?

2404
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,640
Dream, what brings you here?

2405
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,850
- Dream, what brings you here?
- Dream.

2406
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:18,220
- He is cute.
- What happened?

2407
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:19,980
- He is cute.
- Dream, what happened?

2408
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,650
I had a preliminary shoot on Sunday.

2409
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:25,100
You had a preliminary shoot
on Sunday.

2410
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,100
- With today's shoot,
- What?

2411
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,170
we celebrated Children's Day,
which is the day after tomorrow.

2412
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,510
An avid viewer of Running Man,
Ha Dream came up...

2413
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,230
with the conditions
of the Games of Wits.

2414
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:39,540
All the coin-related missions
of the day...

2415
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,970
- came from us and Ha Dream.
- That's incredible.

2416
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:43,470
Dream.

2417
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,920
Haha had no idea.

2418
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:50,460
Dream, did you come up
with the chopsticks and forks?

2419
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,720
He picked them.

2420
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,130
I wondered why we had to choose
between the forks and chopsticks.

2421
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:55,130
Seriously.

2422
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,130
- Did you keep it a secret from Dad?
- Yes.

2423
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:59,460
- Gosh, you are tight-lipped.
- How could you do that to me?

2424
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,470
You made the shoot interesting.

2425
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:03,500
Dream, will you replace
Uncle Kwang Soo?

2426
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,600
Jae Suk!

2427
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,300
(He tries to recruit a new member.)

2428
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,710
That would be nice.

2429
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:09,840
He grew up a lot.

2430
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,470
- He grew up a lot, right?
- Yes.

2431
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:12,770
Dream said
on Haha's YouTube channel...

2432
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:14,350
that he wants to design the games
for Running Man.

2433
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:15,680
That's right.

2434
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,470
- He said that once.
- He did well.

2435
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:20,510
You were little when we met,
so you might not recognize me.

2436
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:22,140
- I was so flustered.
- Dream, take this.

2437
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:24,480
- I was so flustered.
- Dream, take this.

2438
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,390
What are you doing?

2439
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:28,480
- Kids like R coins.
- For goodness' sake.

2440
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,850
- It's not even real money.
- Gosh,

2441
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:31,650
- you are too much.
- Seriously.

2442
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,520
You are too much.

2443
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,340
Dream, you wanted to try ripping off
the name tags.

2444
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,560
- Yes.
- Do you want to try it?

2445
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,560
- Yes.
- Whose name tag?

2446
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,010
Whose name tag
do you want to rip off?

2447
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:42,730
I heard that there is an uncle
Dream is scared of.

2448
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:43,970
- Who is that?
- Among us?

2449
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:46,880
(Which uncle is he scared of?)

2450
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,270
No way.

2451
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:53,140
(Dream is too polite
to voice his thoughts.)

2452
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:55,550
- No way.
- The uncle Dream is scared of.

2453
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:56,890
There is no way he is scared of me.

2454
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:58,480
Do some action moves
before you let him rip it off.

2455
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,930
Hold on. I guess he doesn't know
that I bought him many toys.

2456
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:03,720
- What should I do, Dream?
- Let's go.

2457
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:04,800
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2458
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,800
(It's Dream's dream to rip off
the scary uncle's name tag.)

2459
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,560
- It's your last chance.
- Dream, let's go!

2460
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,830
(Despite being scared,
Dream approaches him.)

2461
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,890
- It's your last chance.
- Dream, let's go!

2462
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:14,040
- Dream, a bit more.
- Dream, you can do it!

2463
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:16,560
(After a fierce struggle,)

2464
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,100
(his hand touches the name tag.)

2465
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,510
- Dream, a bit more.
- Dream, you can do it!

2466
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:21,600
A bit more.

2467
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,440
(Who will be the winner?)

2468
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,720
Okay.

2469
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,980
(Dream ripped off the name tag!)

2470
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:31,810
(Jong Kook is out!)

2471
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,330
(The scary uncle lost!)

2472
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,830
You are good.

2473
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:38,520
- He is cute.
- Dream.

2474
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,800
Okay.

2475
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,500
We have presents for Dream.

2476
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,800
- These are...
- Are those games?

2477
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,470
game packs.

2478
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:48,300
Dream, here are your presents.

2479
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,430
(Dream loves game packs.)

2480
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:53,080
- Say, "Thank you." Bow.
- Thank you.

2481
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:57,580
Dream didn't get to see
Uncle Se Chan.

2482
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,610
- Seriously.
- Did Se Chan just go home?

2483
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:00,680
I guess so.

2484
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,310
We are still filming him.
He is doubtful.

2485
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:03,390
- He doesn't know about this.
- Really?

2486
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:04,680
- He doesn't know about this.
- No.

2487
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,150
He will watch the episode
when it airs.

2488
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,130
Sir, where are you taking me?

2489
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:10,050
Please stop the car.

2490
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:13,020
I don't want to go back and forth.

2491
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,560
You are going home.

2492
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:17,560
Thus, we will now finish the race
that Ha Dream designed,

2493
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,230
the Read the Room Race.

2494
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,510
All right.

2495
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,270
- There is something I want to say.
- What?

2496
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:25,470
There is something he wants to say.

2497
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,270
- I will whisper it.
- Go ahead.

2498
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:28,900
(Whispering)

2499
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,610
(What does Dream want to say?)

2500
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,090
- I see.
- What did he say?

2501
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,610
Kwang Soo will leave the show soon,

2502
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:39,150
so he wants me
to cut other members off...

2503
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:40,760
as I did with Kwang Soo.

2504
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:43,600
You like it
when I cut Kwang Soo off.

2505
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,800
He likes it.

2506
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,720
- Who will be the next one?
- All right, Dream.

2507
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:48,330
- I will do it.
- All right.

2508
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:50,300
Don't worry. It's my specialty.

2509
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,890
You should do it to Suk Jin.

2510
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:55,170
Dream, I will continue
to cut people off.

2511
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:56,970
- Hold the name tag like this.
- That's right.

2512
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,800
1, 2, 3.

2513
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:03,380
(We thank Ha Dream
for designing a fun race.)

2514
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:05,920
(I'm planning a new show.)

2515
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,350
(They'll prepare all three meals
of the day for me.)

2516
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:11,110
(Three Meals for Jae Suk)

2517
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,110
Hey, it's 12 o'clock.

2518
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:16,150
(Make three meals
for Lord Jae Suk!)

2519
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:20,020
(He enjoys his favorite dish.)

2520
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,560
Let's go out.

2521
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,970
(As he pleases,)

2522
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:27,640
(he brandishes his power
over the servants.)

2523
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,640
(The servants take action.)

2524
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:32,970
(Let's turn things upside down.)

2525
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:34,180
(I can't live in a world like this.)

2526
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,080
Hear our words, Lord Yu.

2527
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,610
(Did the servants revolt?)

2528
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,480
(A match between those
who want to be a nobleman...)

2529
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,610
(and a man
who wants to defend his position)

2530
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:45,480
(What will be the fate
