1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,050
(A tile-roofed house
with the charm of a Hanok)

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,430
All right. Let's go.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,430
- Oh, dear.
- Hello.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,020
- Hello.
- Hello, guys.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,000
- Hello.
- All right.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,090
Good morning.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,290
Hello.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,000
- We're...
- Where's Lord Yu?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,840
Why won't Lord Yoo pay us
our salaries?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,870
- Actually,
- Salaries?

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,910
everyone feels pressure
for different reasons.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,640
My gosh.
We all have different reasons.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,350
Let's get it started.

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,570
(Running Man prepared
a coffee truck...)

15
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,110
(to celebrate the 30th anniversary
of Jae Suk's debut.)

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,990
(And the message on the cup sleeve
caught people's eyes.)

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Jae Suk.

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,180
A few decades ago,

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,930
I was just like an immature child.

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,070
But now, we're already middle-aged.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,360
And he...

22
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,890
(But he suddenly burst into tears.)

23
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,600
He seemed so happy.

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,810
(And he cited famous sayings
out of the blue.)

25
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,970
Actually, everyone feels pressure
for different reasons.

26
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,310
(This is where Haha quoted it from.)

27
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,410
(Actually, everyone feels pressure
for different reasons.)

28
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,240
I bet everyone does.

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,820
(Pressure ASMR)

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,410
(Big Nose celebrated
Jae Suk's 30th year with tears.)

31
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,930
(Deeply ashamed)

32
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,380
- I'm under a lot of pressure.
- Hey.

33
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,460
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,470
What's that thing on your forehead?

35
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,470
I needed something to cover my hair.

36
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,300
- Hey, why did you put it on there?
- What's wrong?

37
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,990
Suk Jin, what did your tears mean?

38
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,360
- I've thought about it,
- It's not like that.

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,910
and I should stop
making fun of him now.

40
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,240
- No, that's not it. It's okay.
- He might burst into tears.

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,110
- He's such a crybaby.
- No, I'm not.

42
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,110
- What a crybaby.
- What was with your glasses?

43
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,720
You kept touching your glasses
trying to hold back tears.

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,880
He was trying to hold it back.

45
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,140
He stared at the camera crying.

46
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,910
Actually, I didn't want to say
anything when they asked me to.

47
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,130
We've had a lot of sad occasions
on Running Man so far.

48
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,490
You didn't even cry
when Gary left our show.

49
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,270
(The last episode
that featured Gary)

50
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,970
(Calm and impassive)

51
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,300
You will have to wail
when Kwang Soo leaves.

52
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,770
- You should weep aloud.
- It's not like that.

53
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,360
Are you ready to wail?

54
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,300
- I got goosebumps.
- It's not something I can prepare.

55
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,800
I was just in tears
before I knew it.

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,240
- What's that car?
- That's a car only for big stars.

57
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,270
- Really?
- Gosh, what's that?

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,310
The car looks so pretty.

59
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,310
(A car pulls into the old house,
transcending space and time.)

60
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,140
- It's really pretty.
- That's a car only for big stars.

61
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,610
- What?
- Today's guest must be a big star.

62
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,290
- This is really cool.
- It's so pretty.

63
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,180
- Look at the car.
- It looks comfortable.

64
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,460
(Bling-bling)

65
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,730
- This is something you can find...
- He's a big star.

66
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,860
at a motor show.

67
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,120
- Right.
- Look at the color.

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,740
- I bet the trunk is spacious.
- It will make you a star.

69
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,800
There's a star.

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,740
- There's a big star.
- Lord Yu.

71
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,830
(The servants are
crawling to Lord Yu.)

72
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,300
Oh, dear.

73
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,580
Please get off.

74
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,370
- Yoo Yaho.
- Why are you in the car?

75
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,810
Okay. I'm here.

76
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,810
Be careful.

77
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,450
- Star Yu.
- Jae Suk is the lord.

78
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,950
- Right.
- Why did you make him cry?

79
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,650
Please step on her back.

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,180
Hey, the time has changed.
Move over.

81
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,230
- Is that So Min?
- She's So Min.

82
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,230
- Move over.
- I thought it was Kwang Soo.

83
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,200
- Me too.
- I also thought it was me.

84
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,020
- Thank you for coming so early.
- Lord Yu.

85
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,890
- You need a shave.
- My gosh.

86
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,270
- Hello.
- All right.

87
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,640
Hey. Good morning.

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,710
What's that thing on your head?

89
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,900
- I decorated it a little.
- Okay.

90
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,540
Aren't you going to pay us?

91
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,140
- What did you say?
- We haven't been paid for months.

92
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,710
You will lose your teeth.

93
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,140
Don't do that.

94
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,140
Don't be like that to Suk Jin.

95
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,210
- He might cry.
- Why did you make him cry?

96
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,520
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

97
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,860
- Don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

98
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,390
Why would you make a scene
at my workplace?

99
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,860
I didn't mean it.

100
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,990
Why... Why did you weep?

101
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,270
- It's not like that.
- Why did you do that?

102
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,270
- I tried to hold it back.
- Why did he weep there?

103
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,200
- He's a crybaby.
- No, I'm not.

104
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,430
Don't be like that.

105
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,640
Actually, everyone feels pressure
for different reasons.

106
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,270
Stop it!

107
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,140
- That's enough.
- Stop saying that.

108
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,900
Enough is enough.

109
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,740
I can't take this anymore.

110
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,020
- I mean...
- I can't stand it.

111
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,020
He says he has no tears.

112
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,840
- That's black tears.
- Crocodile tears.

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,550
- Crocodile tears.
- Crocodile tears. It's fake.

114
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,460
- It's fake.
- I know.

115
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,460
- So what are we doing today?
- Why are we dressed like this?

116
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,730
Why am I a lord?

117
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,360
Is this to celebrate
the 30th anniversary of his debut?

118
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,700
This is
the Three Meals for Jae Suk Race.

119
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,930
(Three Meals for Jae Suk)

120
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,740
- Three Meals for Jae Suk?
- That's...

121
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,930
Jae Suk talked about it before.

122
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,740
- They're doing it for real.
- Right. Three Meals for Jae Suk.

123
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,840
That's what I said.
Why are we doing it here?

124
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,180
That's right.
It's the Three Meals for Jae Suk.

125
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,300
(I'm planning a new show.)

126
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,940
(Jae Suk talked about the show
with some sauce on his lips.)

127
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,750
(It's a show where his close friends
cook three meals for Jae Suk.)

128
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,490
(Jae Suk will be the only one
to dress as a nobleman.)

129
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,820
(The crew members carried out
his plan right away.)

130
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,930
I said I was planning a show,
and they carried it out.

131
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,320
I thought we should do it
before your favorite servant leaves.

132
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,760
Oh, right. Kwang Soo is leaving.

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,200
Gosh, this is a mess.

134
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,360
He cried on another show,
and he's leaving our show.

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,870
- This is a mess.
- It's a total disaster.

136
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,150
I can't believe
how things are going here.

137
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,680
Don't be like that. Actually,

138
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,550
everyone feels pressure
for different reasons.

139
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,090
He tried his best.

140
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,550
- Right.
- My goodness.

141
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,790
He was under a lot of pressure.

142
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,660
By the way, Servant Se Chan is...

143
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,680
He's a mere servant,

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,030
but he made a hole in one.

145
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,900
Why would you say that now?

146
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,230
Why would you bring that up?

147
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,230
- A hole in one?
- That's amazing.

148
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,190
- On a real golf course?
- And you should stop...

149
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,740
hanging out with the members
of "2 Days and 1 Night 4."

150
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,470
Members of "2 Days and 1 Night 4?"
You mean DinDin.

151
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,610
Right.

152
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,130
- Hey.
- How dare you...

153
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,930
Just make sure to take
care of JinJin.

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,700
(JinJin, a servant with 12 years
of experience)

155
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,940
Take good care of JinJin.

156
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,240
I'm sorry.

157
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,650
Stop worrying about DinDin...

158
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,370
- and take good care of JinJin.
- Excuse me.

159
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,920
- Okay?
- You can call me JinJin,

160
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,380
but I'm not Jing Jing.

161
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,420
- Just care about JinJin.
- I will take good care of him.

162
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,360
So this is
the Three Meals for Jae Suk Race.

163
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,360
The servants should cook
three meals for Lord Yu.

164
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,930
Once Lord Yoo finishes
his three meals,

165
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,230
the race is over.

166
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,760
- Really?
- He's not doing anything today.

167
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,900
However,

168
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,130
each servant has a penalty stick...

169
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,110
that has their names on it.

170
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,870
A stick will be drawn
at the end of the race,

171
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,410
and the member whose name
is on the stick will get a penalty.

172
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,780
Only one member
will get a penalty for now.

173
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,810
And regardless of the penalty,

174
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,950
Lord Yoo can pick one member
to get a prize with.

175
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,550
(Lord Yoo can pick a member
to get a prize.)

176
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,660
- Lord Yoo will pick one?
- Yes.

177
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,820
I'm sure...

178
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,730
he will pick Suk Jin.

179
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,160
So you will need to get
more sticks for other members...

180
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,320
to reduce your chance
of getting picked for a penalty.

181
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,970
I'll tell you how you can get
more penalty sticks.

182
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,930
Lord Yoo will start the race
with 100 nyang.

183
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,260
- 100 nyang?
- Yes.

184
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,630
With the coins,

185
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,570
you can make servants...

186
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,370
buy ingredients...

187
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,850
or pay them for their labor.

188
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,920
- I can pay them.
- And the servants...

189
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,940
should save the coins.

190
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,860
You can buy a penalty stick
for another member with five nyang.

191
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,950
With 15 nyang, you can buy
a penalty stick for Lord Yu.

192
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,180
We can buy one for Lord Yu.

193
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,990
But we can't do that to Lord Yu.

194
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,250
And...

195
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,190
Lord Yoo can't buy anything himself.

196
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,740
- Really?
- If he wants to buy something,

197
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,490
he should find a servant
whom he can trust...

198
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,560
and make the servant buy
what he needs.

199
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,340
And if Lord Yoo gets
three penalty sticks,

200
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,980
you will elect a new lord.

201
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,570
- A new lord?
- That's nice.

202
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,510
(If Lord Yoo gets 3 penalty sticks,
there will be a new lord.)

203
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,550
(There's a glimmer of hope
for the servants.)

204
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,510
- Jae Suk's eyes are shaking.
- Seriously?

205
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,680
- He's nervous.
- Jae Suk's eyes are shaking.

206
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,790
We should get a new lord.

207
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,550
- I'll survive no matter what.
- That's not bad.

208
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,090
So if two members each pay
15 nyang...

209
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,490
to buy two penalty sticks
for Lord Yu,

210
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,470
one of you will become
the new lord by drawing lots.

211
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,670
Gosh, this is serious.

212
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,470
- I have to stay a lord.
- We can change the lord.

213
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,200
- We can do this.
- It will be tough.

214
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,560
But every time the lord changes,

215
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,040
the number of members to get
the penalty will increase by one.

216
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,570
So you will need
to make careful decisions.

217
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,680
(Every time the lord changes,
more members get the penalty.)

218
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,800
So we can change the lord.

219
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,610
- But 15 nyang is a lot.
- We can't do that to Lord Yu.

220
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,280
- It's three times as much.
- If we do that to Lord Yu,

221
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,010
- Suk Jin will blame us.
- He will cry.

222
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,750
- Oh dear.
- My gosh.

223
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,090
- This year...
- He's like Jae Suk's right hand.

224
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,380
I'll give him a hard time.

225
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,120
- We should do it behind his back.
- You'll see.

226
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,050
So this is the first meal
Lord Yoo will have today.

227
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,800
Should we cook it for him?

228
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,400
- Do we have to?
- Of course.

229
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
How would we do that?

230
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,360
Why are your toes sticking out?

231
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,670
I'm not wearing socks.

232
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,430
- Is this...
- Galbijjim and jeon?

233
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,200
(The first meal, galbijjim and jeon)

234
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,500
- Are we supposed to make it?
- Are we cooking?

235
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,070
To make the dishes,

236
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,570
you should get coins from Lord Yu
to buy ingredients...

237
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,240
and cook as much as you want.

238
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Really?

239
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,590
Prices are high here.

240
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,660
Lord Yoo has a lot of money.

241
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,050
- I bet he's rich.
- Right.

242
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,950
Gosh, Lord Yu.

243
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,590
Please be generous.

244
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,850
All right then. I appreciate...

245
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,830
that you're working hard for me
so early in the morning.

246
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,670
- Lord Yoo is the best.
- I see.

247
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,270
- He's so sweet.
- So...

248
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,510
- He's open-minded.
- It was inconceivable...

249
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,570
in the Joseon Dynasty.

250
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,470
- He's a real nobleman.
- I'm...

251
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,300
We don't need a new lord.

252
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,250
I'm not like other lords.
You guys...

253
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,750
- Hang on.
- Yes, Lord Yu.

254
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,480
How dare a servant sit...

255
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,810
- with his legs crossed?
- Who?

256
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,020
Who's the disrespectful...

257
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,160
I straightened out my legs.

258
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,390
- My gosh.
- It's not like that.

259
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,950
I didn't know we started the shoot.

260
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,290
- You crossed your legs?
- This isn't about the shoot.

261
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,450
We're in a hierarchical society now.

262
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,500
Exactly.

263
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,560
Do you not know what it is like
to be in the Joseon Dynasty?

264
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,900
Not really.

265
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,640
I can't believe this.

266
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
- He needs a good scolding.
- Hang on a second.

267
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,300
- Wait. I can't take this anymore.
- Coins.

268
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm not so strict.

269
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,780
(He takes out his 100 nyang.)

270
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,380
Gosh, Lord Yu.

271
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,120
- Coins...
- He's being generous.

272
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,280
- Here.
- Thank you.

273
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,340
Thank you.

274
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,650
- Coins...
- He's being generous.

275
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,650
(What about me?)

276
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,210
You'd need some money...

277
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,390
- My gosh.
- to do your job.

278
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,660
Thank you.

279
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,450
- I mean, this is...
- Thank you.

280
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,530
- You can't work for nothing.
- Thank you, sir.

281
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,130
You should get paid.

282
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,130
Will you keep discriminating
against me?

283
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,870
- You're the best, Lord Yu.
- Hang on.

284
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,170
What did you just say, Seok Sam?

285
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,700
"Will you keep discriminating
against me?"

286
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,300
- What was that?
- How could you...

287
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,280
- Why would you say that?
- I was flustered.

288
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,150
He just learned the Korean alphabet.

289
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,600
- But why am I...
- I told you.

290
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,520
That's because
you're being disrespectful.

291
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,550
He's disrespectful indeed.

292
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,310
- My gosh.
- I told you.

293
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,850
Unlike the other servants,
you're just nasty.

294
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,820
- You're being ridiculous.
- Ridiculous?

295
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,130
I can't take this anymore.

296
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,760
- He can't stand it.
- All right.

297
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,000
Show him some respect.

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
- Hey.
- I mean...

299
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,060
- Here.
- Again? Thank you.

300
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,170
- All right.
- Thank you, sir!

301
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,230
All right.

302
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,690
- You should be...
- How dare you...

303
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,200
Hey, that's enough.

304
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,540
Stop it.

305
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,200
Anyway,

306
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,840
you guys should cook my first meal.

307
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,050
- Count off.
- One.

308
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,050
- 2.
- 3.

309
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,050
- 4.
- 5.

310
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,180
- 6.
- 7. End of count.

311
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,390
Are we soldiers or what?

312
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,710
- I mean...
- I don't think...

313
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,850
they did this in the Joseon Dynasty.

314
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,950
- Just stay quiet.
- This is ridiculous.

315
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,450
- What's wrong with you?
- This is ridiculous.

316
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,660
Do you want to work lying down?

317
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,680
(He's a loyal servant.)

318
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,190
(Servant Kim is serious
about being a servant.)

319
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,350
- Hey.
- Do you pay him a lot?

320
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,500
- Jong Kook.
- How much do you pay him?

321
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,930
I appreciate your loyalty,

322
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,500
but he needs to work.
So don't hit his legs.

323
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,540
- Okay. I won't hit his legs.
- Okay?

324
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,560
- Can we get married?
- What?

325
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,060
Can servants get married?

326
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,180
- With each other?
- Yes.

327
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,250
- In-house romance is forbidden.
- Okay.

328
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,650
Do you understand?

329
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,210
But I'm married.

330
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,470
- What did you say?
- I have a wife at home.

331
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,790
She shouldn't stay at home.
Bring her!

332
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,050
She has to work.

333
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,790
- No.
- Why would she stay at home?

334
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,210
- It's not like that.
- Bring her.

335
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,480
You should bring your wife.

336
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,630
- Your whole family should work.
- We're not a double-income family.

337
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,930
Where's your punk son?

338
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,450
- His punk son?
- Bring him as well.

339
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,760
How dare you...

340
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,690
- Jong Kook.
- He's a slave.

341
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,900
My punk son?

342
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,190
- You should bring your punk son.
- Gosh, this is scary.

343
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,460
Am I supposed to let this slide?

344
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,040
You should bring
your punk kid as well.

345
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,430
- Listen.
- I don't think JinJin knows...

346
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,230
what things are like here.
Have a seat.

347
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,800
- JinJin.
- Yes?

348
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,700
It was a hierarchical society
in the Joseon Dynasty.

349
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,180
- This isn't about hierarchy.
- And it is passed down.

350
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,520
It's passed down the family line.

351
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,080
If you're married,

352
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,210
Ms. Ryu Su Jung should be here
as well.

353
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,480
- Sure.
- For me...

354
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,760
She should sweep the yard.

355
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,930
You know him. He's a slave hunter.

356
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,430
I go after runaway slaves...

357
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,720
as a side job.

358
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,270
- He's a famous slave hunter.
- Really?

359
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,770
- My friend...
- Servant Kim...

360
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,430
- is just happy to be here.
- Exactly.

361
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,140
- Anyway, I need to eat breakfast.
- Okay.

362
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,680
You should go to the market...

363
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,230
and buy ingredients
for galbijjim and jeon.

364
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,340
Okay.

365
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,880
(Lord Yoo can't buy things himself.)

366
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,180
(He should give money
to a servant he can trust.)

367
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,120
(And servants can pocket the money.)

368
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,790
Like I said before,

369
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,160
you don't have to spend
a lot of money.

370
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,500
Make sure to buy things
at reasonable prices.

371
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,450
We will be sure to do that.

372
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,550
Like I said before,

373
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,090
I want Jong Kook to do this.

374
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,430
- Do you want me to go? Okay.
- Jong Kook, you're on it.

375
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,690
- And Long Legs.
- Yes, sir.

376
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,640
- I want to go.
- Okay. Ji Hyo, you're going too.

377
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,600
Okay. We're leaving now.

378
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
- Let's go.
- We should check the prices.

379
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,280
We didn't get the money.

380
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,840
We just need to check the prices.

381
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,940
- The servants...
- We can just take it.

382
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,650
The two meals...

383
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,620
- My gosh.
- He found one.

384
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,580
(The servants are picking up
lucky bags.)

385
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,980
There are...

386
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,090
coins and penalty sticks
hidden everywhere.

387
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,760
If you find one, you can keep it.

388
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,670
All right. Hurry and make a fire.

389
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,560
The weather is cool today.

390
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,770
Yes, sir.

391
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,200
(Wielding an ax)

392
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,510
Hey, what are you doing?

393
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,470
- Are you hammering or what?
- This is strange.

394
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,840
- Why is this...
- What was that?

395
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,920
Are you carving in your name?

396
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,710
This is... Watch out.

397
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,810
Hit it in the middle.

398
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,890
Move over.

399
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,080
I don't think I'll get hurt.

400
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,260
You did it. It worked.

401
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,420
See?

402
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,130
My goodness.

403
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,450
(Servant Ji hasn't gotten
any better for the past 11 years.)

404
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,170
- This is it.
- My gosh.

405
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,170
(It's the Ingredient Store
that sells cooking ingredients.)

406
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,770
(They don't have fixed prices.)

407
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

408
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,230
- They have all the ingredients.
- This place looks nice.

409
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,280
- How much are these?
- Let's see.

410
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,250
The meat is five nyang.

411
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,280
And a squid is three nyang.

412
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,480
Scallions are one nyang.

413
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,810
(They need about 15 to 20 nyang
to cook galbijjim and jeon.)

414
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,080
My gosh.

415
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,550
It's three nyang.

416
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,030
(They can save some money
if they give up ingredients.)

417
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,760
We should pocket some money.

418
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,000
We should pocket some money.

419
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,460
(The slave hunter has decided
to embezzle some money.)

420
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,690
Gosh, what should we do now?

421
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,500
(The three servants have decided
to cheat Lord Yoo out of his money.)

422
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,300
15?

423
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,510
- 10.
- 10?

424
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,540
(They go back home
discussing the fake prices.)

425
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,070
How much is the meat?

426
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,100
Meat is 10 nyang.

427
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,880
Meat is 10 nyang. And...

428
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,100
the other ingredients
cost three nyang each.

429
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,380
And squid is five nyang.

430
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,680
Do they have squid?

431
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,790
Then you should give them the money.

432
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,840
Right.

433
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,790
- Once you give us the money...
- We can't cook without the money.

434
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,130
So the meat is...

435
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,350
What do we need? Meat is 10 nyang.

436
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,450
10 nyang.

437
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,050
We need 13 nyang.

438
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,460
So we need about 30 nyang in total.

439
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,730
In total.
For the flour to make jeon...

440
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,540
(Kwang Soo inflated the prices
even more to 30 nyang.)

441
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,010
Tell me the prices again.

442
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,040
(He sensed that
something's not right.)

443
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,280
So the meat is 10 nyang.

444
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,570
10 nyang.

445
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,910
- And?
- Squid is five nyang.

446
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,600
- And the other ingredients...
- Squid is five nyang.

447
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,680
- are all 3 nyang.
- All the others are 3 nyang.

448
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,750
Then I guess 20 nyang should be
enough for all ingredients we need.

449
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,810
I agree.

450
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,420
- But you asked me for 30 nyang.
- Right.

451
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,710
- What I'm saying is...
- Hey.

452
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:16,050
Hey, he said 18 nyang is enough.
Why did you ask me for 30 nyang?

453
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,260
I mean, we need
some other ingredients as well.

454
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,630
- Like what?
- Like green onion...

455
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,560
- They sell vegetables there too.
- Oh, right.

456
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,830
But we'll make jeon as well,
so we need more than 25 nyang...

457
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,870
Here's 20 nyang.

458
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,140
- 20 nyang? Okay then.
- 20 nyang?

459
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,470
Let's shop within our budget.

460
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,800
- You should do that.
- Green onion... And what else?

461
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,340
- Ji Hyo, take 20 nyang...
- Yes? 20 nyang.

462
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,940
- With that money...
- We'll spend it wisely.

463
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,550
- Spend it wisely.
- We'll make it work.

464
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,620
Good.

465
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,280
Let's make it work.
Let's do our best.

466
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,940
- But 20 nyang is...
- Hey, let's make it work.

467
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,420
- Wait. Hey, Long Legs, stay here.
- Let's make it work.

468
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,260
(Pardon?)

469
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,820
Okay. Long Legs will stay.

470
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,720
Let's go without Long Legs.

471
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
(Heartless)

472
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,960
It's not like that.

473
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,820
- You made the right decision.
- Let's go without Long Legs.

474
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,270
- Why?
- He always tries to pocket money.

475
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,870
- Why?
- No, I mean...

476
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,410
We still received more money
than we actually need.

477
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,070
We should ask for a discount.

478
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,100
Then we can save some more money.

479
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,150
(They're going
to the store cheerfully.)

480
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,340
You can find dishware
on the way to the vegetable garden.

481
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,980
Oh, right. We have to pay
for the dishware too.

482
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,390
No, it's provided free.

483
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,350
- Gosh, you punk.
- Hey.

484
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,760
Why would you tell such a lie
when we were all informed?

485
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,930
Lord Yu! Lord Yu!

486
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,030
(Servant Ha is entering hastily.)

487
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,030
I found this...

488
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,630
- at the vegetable garden.
- What is it?

489
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,190
That punk...

490
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,560
(Servant Ha tries to frame Kwang Soo
with the pouch he found.)

491
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,930
- Search his bag.
- No. Don't do that.

492
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,770
- I didn't do that!
- How dare you?

493
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,830
- For each coin...
- You filthy jerk!

494
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,430
- This punk did it.
- I found another one.

495
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,970
- He had these pouches.
- Look at that.

496
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,840
- How dare you?
- It's not like that.

497
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,440
- Get on your knees, you punk.
- How dare you?

498
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,550
This isn't fair!

499
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,210
- My gosh.
- You were supposed to work.

500
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,480
- Trust me. I didn't do anything.
- Punish him right now.

501
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,160
- No! It wasn't me!
- You punk.

502
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,950
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Bring it here.

503
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,080
- You must know...
- It's not true. Ouch!

504
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,350
It hurts so much.

505
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,350
- You must know...
- It's not true. Ouch!

506
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,760
(Ouch! It hurts so much!)

507
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,320
What was that?

508
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,170
How could you
actually twist my legs?

509
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,220
- Why did you do that?
- That sly jerk...

510
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,000
How dare you to try to ruin
everything...

511
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,770
- before you leave the show?
- It's true.

512
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,040
My lord, I've been working for you
like a loyal dog...

513
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,030
for more than 43 years.

514
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,840
Please give me just one nyang.

515
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,150
I can't give you any more than that.
Understood?

516
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,350
But hey, I brought you the evidence.

517
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,650
- Hang on. Did you just say, "hey?"
- Right?

518
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,360
- Let's punish him.
- How dare you...

519
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,920
- talk down to him?
- Come with us.

520
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,780
- How could you...
- You shouldn't do that.

521
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,950
- I didn't mean to.
- Let's punish him.

522
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,330
- Hey.
- Let go of me, you punks!

523
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,660
Hey. Hey.

524
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,370
He and I worked together
for 20 years as slaves.

525
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,670
(Double punishment)

526
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,930
Stop it! Stop!

527
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,610
(Both of them were punished
at the same time unintentionally.)

528
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,810
Why did you sit there?

529
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,770
- You fool.
- You should have avoided my legs.

530
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,310
You should've twisted only his legs.

531
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,940
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
came back from the store.)

532
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,970
- They're back.
- Oh, gosh.

533
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,180
- Look at this.
- Did you get meat?

534
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,180
Listen. We got all this...

535
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,180
- at a big discount.
- Really?

536
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,130
- I thought of beating him up too.
- I see.

537
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,220
Then there won't be much money
left for us.

538
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,830
We'll buy some more food later.

539
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,020
You get to live.
Wouldn't that matter?

540
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,830
- I got a discount eventually.
- You negotiated the price.

541
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,100
- Good job.
- Thank goodness you didn't hit him.

542
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,870
- Hey, by the way,
- Yes, I negotiated the price. Yes?

543
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,530
Stop fighting with others.

544
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,700
- Okay?
- Understood.

545
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,200
Hurry up and start cooking.

546
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,040
- How should we cook pork ribs?
- Exactly.

547
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,970
- Hey, Long Legs.
- Yes, my lord.

548
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,320
- Come and fan the fire.
- Yes, my lord.

549
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,980
- Where are the vegetables?
- Come on. Move faster.

550
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,820
It's almost noon.

551
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,250
I need to eat something!

552
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,680
- We have to cook...
- He's upset.

553
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,060
Lord Yoo is angry!

554
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,060
(Lord Yoo yelled in a vulgar manner.)

555
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,720
- What's with his tone?
- Hey!

556
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,100
Let's change the lord
as soon as we can. This is too much.

557
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,370
Green onion jeon.

558
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,170
(The discontent among the servants
is growing.)

559
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,190
There's a frying pan, and there are
all sorts of condiments.

560
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,370
- Wait. Hold on.
- We should start...

561
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,030
- Seok Sam,
- Yes?

562
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,270
- Ssaebssaeb,
- Yes?

563
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,850
and the two of you
including Long Legs,

564
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,920
carry my litter,
so I can go downtown.

565
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,420
Hang on a second.

566
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,780
- My lord.
- Didn't you just get here?

567
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,620
Why do you keep giving me
physically taxing jobs?

568
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,390
Why would you ride a litter?

569
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,430
- Do we actually have a litter?
- Do we? What's that?

570
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,660
All right.

571
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,590
- We should carry this?
- I mean...

572
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,060
- Now...
- Where did you say you're going?

573
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,060
(The 100 percent
human-powered vehicle)

574
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,570
- All right.
- It'll be easier to carry the back.

575
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,630
Haha.

576
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,670
- It's better to carry the back.
- I think it's carried by two men.

577
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,930
Lift the front.

578
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,730
2 in the front and 2 at the back.

579
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,730
- Can't you just walk?
- How dare you?

580
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,470
- It's right there.
- Both of your legs are fine.

581
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,200
- Why must we carry this?
- It's only five steps away.

582
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,350
(As the servants are complaining...)

583
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,310
- It's right in front of the house.
- Lift me up now!

584
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,380
- This is too harsh.
- Come on.

585
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,040
1, 2, 3.

586
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,420
- Oh, gosh.
- Good.

587
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,980
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Yes?

588
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,210
- It's slanted!
- That's weird. Why is it slanted?

589
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,980
It's tilting toward Haha. Seriously.

590
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,660
I think I shouldn't carry this.

591
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,780
- It's because I'm taller than them.
- Put me down.

592
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,520
- It's hard to balance it.
- The positions may be wrong.

593
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,630
- Hey.
- You go to the front.

594
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,790
- Hold it properly, will you?
- To the front.

595
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,020
- Okay.
- Come here.

596
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,730
- Hey, hold it properly, will you?
- I did, but I couldn't help it.

597
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,140
- Listen to me.
- Come over here.

598
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,530
Do you want to be in trouble
right before you leave the show?

599
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,760
- No. I held it properly.
- Do you? Hey.

600
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,340
- Hey, hey.
- You stand here.

601
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,530
Gosh, seriously.

602
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,970
- Hey, stop complaining!
- Let's lift it up.

603
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,850
Wait. Hold on.

604
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,970
Move the litter as smoothly as
the car we were provided with...

605
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,510
for the indirect advertisement,
okay?

606
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,980
- Yes, my lord.
- That elegantly?

607
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,180
Exactly.

608
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,480
- That's impossible.
- You should move it...

609
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,680
as elegantly and safely as the car.

610
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,060
By any chance, will you ride it
with your entire family?

611
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,930
- Okay.
- On the count of three. Get ready.

612
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,430
You look like a top star
on the litter.

613
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,930
- Let's go.
- Hold it.

614
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,400
Lift it up. 1, 2, 3.

615
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,730
- Okay. Let's go.
- That's good.

616
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,030
- That was smooth.
- Move forward.

617
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,070
- Move forward.
- Okay.

618
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,410
- Let's go.
- 1, 2.

619
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,930
- Let's have a tour.
- 1, 2.

620
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,340
- Hey, move aside.
- What's that?

621
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,650
We're almost there already.

622
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,110
- Keep going.
- This is ridiculous.

623
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,580
Hey, you can just walk there.

624
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,180
- "Hey?" How dare you?
- It's right over there.

625
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,890
- Keep going. I'm a nobleman.
- Why would you...

626
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,710
This is what a nobleman does.

627
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,560
It caught fire so quickly.

628
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Really?

629
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,780
- Well...
- How is galbijjim usually made?

630
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,280
Since it's pork, not beef,
I think we can just add that sauce,

631
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,060
and put in some vegetables...

632
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,430
Put everything in the pot
and boil them together. That'll do.

633
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,290
(Ji Hyo started preparing
the ingredients for galbijjim.)

634
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,290
I must say, Ji Hyo works really hard
and does it well.

635
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,460
- I do my work quietly.
- Yes, you're good at that.

636
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,430
Se Chan, yalbijjim...
I mean, galbijjim...

637
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,380
So Min is a great cook.

638
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,540
I should make green onion jeon.

639
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,540
(So Min is preparing the ingredients
for green onion jeon.)

640
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,650
- Is it for green onion jeon?
- Yes.

641
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,980
Marinate the meat
with the sauce first.

642
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,390
Okay.

643
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,220
Jong Kook is unexpectedly good
at cooking.

644
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,950
We can't ruin any piece.

645
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,290
Shall I bring another one?
We have one more spatula.

646
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,690
To make jeon.

647
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,290
It's so nice
to watch you guys working.

648
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,290
- We'll have a party, my lord.
- That's great.

649
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,790
- All the dishes look quite good.
- Ji Hyo.

650
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,530
I'm a little hungry.

651
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,260
My lord, it will be ready soon.

652
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,700
- Don't boil it down.
- I know.

653
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,910
Hey, hey, Long Legs.

654
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,850
- Yes?
- You seem free. Come over here.

655
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,770
That's not true. I was...

656
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,880
- preparing to cook...
- Come over here.

657
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,710
Let's go over there.

658
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,210
(Hopping)

659
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,320
What...

660
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,020
My lord, who is going to carry you
on his back from next week?

661
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,130
- Exactly.
- None of us is as tall as he is.

662
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,220
I won't get to ride on his back
anymore.

663
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,520
(Lord Yoo is enjoying
riding on the tall servant.)

664
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,990
You'll get a lower ride.

665
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,990
- Put me down here.
- Yes, my lord.

666
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,640
He rode on his back
just to come here?

667
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,730
This is crazy.
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

668
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,640
- That looks good.
- Why would he make me...

669
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,470
You should boil it for a long time.

670
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,240
- It looks delicious.
- Kwang Soo, come with me.

671
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,710
Here. You can have this.

672
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,780
Why?

673
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,780
For no reason. Today is
your last day on the show.

674
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,210
Gosh. I told you
not to act like this.

675
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,250
- Take it.
- Why would you give me a coin?

676
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,280
- Just take it.
- Why are you doing this?

677
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,020
- Just take it. What's the point...
- Listen to me.

678
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,930
It's my coin.
I want to give it to him.

679
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,790
- Hold on.
- Why would you give me your coin?

680
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,100
Don't go easy on me.

681
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,030
Well, I'll just put it here.

682
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,610
Gosh. Just keep it.

683
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,910
(He put bait to lure Long Legs
who is crazy about coins.)

684
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,000
Keep it.

685
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,180
Keep it.

686
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,200
Then give it to me instead.

687
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,000
Are you not going to be
on the show next week?

688
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,940
- Next week...
- You'll keep being on the show.

689
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,080
- That's true.
- He won't be here next week.

690
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,740
- Is that why you want to give him?
- Yes. It'll be pointless to win.

691
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,510
- I think the food is ready.
- Yes.

692
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,660
Scoop out the rice.

693
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,250
- And set the table here.
- Yes.

694
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,390
Yes, my lord.

695
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,950
Seok Sam, hold this janggu.

696
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,430
- And play it for me.
- Me?

697
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,670
I've never played it before.

698
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,600
I have never played it before.

699
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,000
But I'll do it since you told me to.

700
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,970
(With a nervous look on his face,)

701
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,180
(he started playing it carefully.)

702
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,770
It feels good, let's have some fun

703
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,040
- We cooked
- Wait...

704
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,120
- Wait until the food is served.
- It feels good, let's have some fun

705
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,940
- Start playing when the food is...
- Today, we'll have a party

706
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,950
It feels good, let's have some fun

707
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,120
We have galbijjim
and green onion jeon

708
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,060
It feels good, let's have some fun

709
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,160
Cabbage jeon is tasty too,
it feels good, let's have some fun

710
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,130
Lord Yoo is as stubborn as a mule,
it feels good, let's have some fun

711
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,200
I can't stand him anymore,
it feels good, let's have some fun

712
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,170
Let us all work together

713
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,110
- It feels good, let's have some fun
- It feels good, let's have some fun

714
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,930
Everyone feels pressure
for different reasons

715
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,810
It feels good, let's have some fun

716
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,150
(He overcame the pressure
and sang the entire work song.)

717
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,270
I'll bring you the other dishes.

718
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,710
This looks so delicious.

719
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,740
Ji Hyo did an amazing job.

720
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,750
We made cabbage jeon as well
since you like it.

721
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,390
So Min did a great job.

722
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,660
- Ji Hyo did an amazing job.
- We made cabbage jeon as well...

723
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,690
(He's having a big bite
of crispy jeon.)

724
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,290
- How do you like it?
- She made cabbage jeon?

725
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,600
- Do you like it?
- Is it okay?

726
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,790
- Really?
- It's good.

727
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,200
I'm finally getting a coin.

728
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,030
It's so hard to make him
spend money.

729
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,380
He's finally taking a coin out.

730
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,970
- So Min.
- Yes, my lord.

731
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,740
- I'll give you three nyang.
- Oh, my.

732
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,010
We made it together, my lord.

733
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,440
- Thank you.
- Hey, we made it together.

734
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,590
Just give me one nyang.

735
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,440
- Did you scoop it out?
- It looks delicious.

736
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,820
Shouldn't you put some more
in the bowl?

737
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,320
Scoop out some more.

738
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,930
That looks good.

739
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,430
Jae Suk is actually eating alone
over there.

740
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,490
I can't believe him.

741
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,960
He must think he's really a lord.

742
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,260
He didn't even offer us a bite.

743
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,460
- Isn't he too mean?
- Is it good?

744
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,900
My lord, here's galbijjim.

745
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,910
- Please try it.
- Please try a bite.

746
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,260
The table is too small.

747
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,730
- Let me taste it.
- Let's bring another table.

748
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,270
(I eat alone.)

749
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,180
There's not much left.
Give him a bite.

750
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,350
- He did it on another show.
- Gosh, look at him.

751
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,270
We cooked it in an iron pot,
my lord.

752
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,440
(Standing in line)

753
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,060
(Seok Sam seems dazed
because he's hungry.)

754
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,130
That kimchi smelled so good too.

755
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,520
- Watching Lord Yoo enjoying it...
- Everything looks so good.

756
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,950
- makes me feel great.
- Indeed.

757
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,990
- But he can't finish all that.
- It makes me happy.

758
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,630
Can we... Can we eat some too?

759
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,230
You can eat some
if Lord Yoo lets you.

760
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,230
We only have a few potatoes left.

761
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,530
My lord, can we eat a little too?

762
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,230
How about just one of us eats?

763
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,610
(Shaking his head)

764
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,110
- Gosh, seriously.
- Is that a no?

765
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,350
I can't believe him.

766
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,380
Why can't we eat?

767
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,120
- Let's change the lord. I'm angry.
- What's wrong with him?

768
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Let's all pitch in
to change the lord.

769
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,650
- I think we should.
- That's so mean.

770
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,150
What do you say? Are you in?

771
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,660
Lord Yoo is so kind and generous
to us.

772
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,250
We don't have to think
about doing anything.

773
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,220
Hey, you guys, do you like
living in this world?

774
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,290
- Let's turn the world upside down,
- That's why you're always a slave.

775
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,370
and make it a world that we rule.

776
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,530
That's why you can't be freed
from slavery.

777
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,030
Why won't they try to be freed?

778
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,670
- Just the two of us?
- Let's make a new world.

779
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,260
- We need 15 coins, right?
- Yes.

780
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,700
(What they have is far from enough.)

781
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,200
- If we collect 15 coins...
- Right. Let's go.

782
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
(They plan to go outside
to find more coins.)

783
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,180
There's another one.
Oh, my. I found another pouch.

784
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,120
(Kwang Soo found a pouch,
and there's a penalty stick in it!)

785
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,890
Hey. I found it too.

786
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,920
What's this?

787
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,160
We can write a name on it
and turn it in.

788
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,360
Write a name on it and turn it in?

789
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,630
Do we write a name on this
and turn it in?

790
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,220
Suk Jin, we can collect 15 of these
and turn them in.

791
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,630
Do we write a name on this
and turn it in?

792
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,690
Yes, but you're not allowed to write
the lord's name on it.

793
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,430
- We can do it by ourselves.
- Let's hold on to it for now.

794
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,370
(They can buy a penalty stick
with coins.)

795
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,200
(The penalty stick they can write
a lord's name on is marked red!)

796
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,240
(They need 3
of Lord Yu's penalty sticks...)

797
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,380
(to change the lord!)

798
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,240
(Will Seok Sam and Long Legs
succeed in changing the lord?)

799
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,850
- How many coins do you have?
- I have three.

800
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,420
I think I have 5 coins.
No, I have 4.

801
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,710
- That's not enough.
- We have only seven coins.

802
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,250
- We need 15 nyang.
- Let's find 8 more coins.

803
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,360
There's a lot of pouches
hidden in different places.

804
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,100
You have one, right?
Let's turn in our penalty sticks.

805
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,130
Let's not write each other's names.

806
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,430
I'll write Se Chan's name on it.
He's so cheeky.

807
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,260
- I choose Jong Kook.
- Here you go.

808
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,000
- It's good.
- Lord Yoo is so nice.

809
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,140
He's not a bad person.

810
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,430
- Hey, where did Seok Sam...
- Here.

811
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,530
and Long Legs go?

812
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,340
Long Legs? He must've gone out
to find more pouches.

813
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,700
I think he did too.

814
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,940
- Everyone, let's eat.
- Let's eat here.

815
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,740
- Se Chan, here you go.
- Thank you.

816
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,540
Eat as much as you want
since you worked hard to cook.

817
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,740
- Let's sit down here.
- Thank you, my lord.

818
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,250
We should go and get food.

819
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,180
- My, it's so delicious.
- It's really good.

820
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,860
I feel like a slave.
I feel like a real slave.

821
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,330
I really feel like
a slave right now.

822
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,720
It's as if war just broke out.

823
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,630
We wouldn't dare
to sit there with him.

824
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,340
What are you doing?

825
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,260
Come over here
so Lord Yoo can eat comfortably.

826
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,640
Okay.

827
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,530
You can come and eat here.

828
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,770
- Can we, really?
- Yes.

829
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,140
Thank you.

830
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,650
- When could we...
- You look like a real servant.

831
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,000
- Se Chan is...
- It's so realistic.

832
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,120
- I'm just acting.
- He looks so natural, right?

833
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,240
- You're not just acting.
- I'm acting.

834
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,280
- Se Chan, eat some jeon too.
- That looks so good.

835
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,420
- Right?
- Yes.

836
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,710
- It's so good.
- Do you like it?

837
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,060
Eat up.

838
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,130
- It's so good.
- Give some to Ji Hyo too.

839
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,020
- Ji Hyo.
- It's so tasty.

840
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,690
- So Min, this is amazing.
- It's good, right?

841
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,330
(He's into his character
even when eating.)

842
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,230
- It's good.
- I mean...

843
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,990
You seemed to make it so easy
and yet it's so good.

844
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,030
- It's really tasty.
- It's delicious.

845
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,500
(While they're impressed
by the effect of an iron pot...)

846
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,580
- Are you eating?
- What?

847
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,270
Did you all finish your food?

848
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,380
- Yes, my lord.
- We enjoyed it.

849
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,310
- Wait. We didn't...
- Then...

850
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,850
We're starving.

851
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,380
You weren't here when we had food.

852
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,580
Did you make bibimbap?

853
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,210
A store-bought sauce is the best.

854
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,390
It's hard to believe
that you made this so quickly.

855
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,860
(Seok Sam and Long Legs are
finally trying the food.)

856
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,560
Did we really make this?
It's so delicious.

857
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,950
He said "we."
What do you mean by that?

858
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,720
- You didn't...
- All you did was play the janggu.

859
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,990
You didn't cook.

860
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,840
Hey, are you on our side
or his side?

861
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,430
Don't try to divide us into teams.

862
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,870
Shouldn't we be grateful
for food and a place to sleep?

863
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,970
- Look how you guys are eating.
- You all look so happy.

864
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,840
Why would you make a fuss about it?

865
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,650
You're sitting next to Lord Yu.

866
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,850
- Sitting on this bench...
- It makes us feel...

867
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,180
as if we moved up in social class.

868
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,350
- Now stand in line.
- Yes, my lord.

869
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,710
Stand in line.

870
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,160
- Stand in line.
- Stand in line.

871
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,450
In the order of seniority.

872
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,720
- Hey, who do you think you are?
- All right.

873
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,330
- Jong Kook, lead the group.
- Get in the back of the line.

874
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,950
- Yes, my lord!
- Seok Sam, get in the back.

875
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,070
- Starting from Seok Sam, count off.
- Seok Sam.

876
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,100
- 1.
- 2.

877
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,340
- 3. 4.
- 5.

878
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,900
- 6.
- 7. End of the number.

879
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,170
- Okay. Let's go.
- Yes.

880
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,370
- Jong Kook probably won't change.
- Jong Kook is unbelievable.

881
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,500
Why is Jong Kook...

882
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,530
- so obedient?
- Let's go.

883
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,240
Also, do you know this?

884
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,620
That I will choose one of you...

885
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,120
to receive a prize along with me.

886
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,510
- Oh, right.
- Okay!

887
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,820
Yes, my lord.

888
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,120
Stand in your position!

889
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,160
(Stand in your position!)

890
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660
You just sound like a gangster.

891
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,060
Have you decided
to stick to that image?

892
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,930
- He looks like...
- Stand in line!

893
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,430
- Is he a gangster or what?
- What was that?

894
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,330
- He acts like a gangster.
- I mean...

895
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,790
If you don't obey me,
I'll put a brand on your body.

896
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,260
Why is he acting like that?

897
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,730
(As if I burnt my heart)

898
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,640
Why is he so loyal to Jae Suk?

899
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,340
Was he always that obedient to him?

900
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,180
Jong Kook, step forward.

901
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,610
Here.

902
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,240
- I'll give you one nyang.
- Thank you, my lord.

903
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
- You look like a pet dog.
- Good.

904
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,820
- I can always trust you.
- Of course.

905
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,010
Why is he so loyal to Jae Suk?

906
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,420
You should never forget
that you're a slave.

907
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,560
What's with his tone?

908
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,330
- I don't understand.
- Calm down.

909
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,520
Calm down. You are right.

910
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,260
- My gosh.
- He's such a loyal servant.

911
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,430
He's just a bully.

912
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,370
- We were born slaves.
- Why are you...

913
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,370
- You're right.
- so loyal to him?

914
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,640
- We were born slaves.
- He changed his attitude...

915
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,180
just for coins.

916
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,940
- If we put our coins together...
- I'll put a brand on your body.

917
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,850
- It's possible.
- We have enough money.

918
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,040
We need to go...

919
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,710
to the bank to turn in our coins.

920
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,280
We have eight coins. Give me yours.

921
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,710
Who is whispering?

922
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,750
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it.

923
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,450
- Hey.
- Who is still whispering?

924
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,160
I heard Haha saying that we should
collect 15 coins...

925
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,360
and do voting over there.

926
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,450
I didn't say that.

927
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,930
- It's true!
- I didn't say that.

928
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,720
- I'm innocent.
- Take a step forward.

929
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,370
- That's a false accusation.
- Se Chan asked us to vote for him.

930
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,870
- There's no way I said that.
- I'm innocent.

931
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,430
- You know I wouldn't do that.
- Come forward.

932
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,030
- These two planned it.
- I would never do that.

933
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,610
- We would never do that.
- Why don't I break their wrists...

934
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,880
- so they can't cast a vote?
- That's okay.

935
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,610
- Gosh, seriously.
- What's wrong with him?

936
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,910
What's his problem?

937
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,740
- Why is he so loyal to Lord Yu?
- He's Lord Yu's bodyguard.

938
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,180
- It's a false accusation.
- Be careful.

939
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,150
- Yes, my lord.
- Be careful.

940
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,650
Quite a lot of penalty sticks
have been added...

941
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,090
- in the servant room.
- Really?

942
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:23,220
Someone will very likely receive
a penalty.

943
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:29,600
(The servants gave one another
a penalty stick.)

944
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,410
You don't have to turn in 15 nyang
all at once to drag Lord Yoo down.

945
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,370
You can turn in a little at a time,
and it will be saved.

946
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,230
Like an installment savings plan?

947
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,810
- The coins can be accumulated?
- That's right.

948
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,110
I'll turn in all five coins I have.

949
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,110
The first mission...

950
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,380
requires a good strategy and wit.

951
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,820
- It's Galbijjim of Fear.
- What is it?

952
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,980
- Galbijjim?
- What is it?

953
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,980
It's a different version
of tonkatsu game.

954
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,560
- Oh, I see.
- Oh, tonkatsu game?

955
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,830
Start outside the circle.

956
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,130
Shout "Gal" and step
inside the circle with one foot.

957
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,830
Then shout "Bijjim,"
jump out of the circle,

958
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,290
and land on both feet.

959
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,730
The next players will continue
in the same way.

960
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,070
If you step on the foot
of someone who jumped before you,

961
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,500
you can draw on his or her face.

962
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,880
- I see.
- Got it.

963
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,650
And those who already jumped
can avoid it,

964
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,850
but they can move only one foot.

965
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,940
You have to go back
inside the circle on your turn.

966
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,180
If you fail to do so,
you get eliminated.

967
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,360
Each of the final 5 members
will get 5 nyang.

968
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,620
- Got it.
- Okay.

969
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,430
We can get a lot of coins
in this game.

970
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,180
Can you all step back?
I'll show you how to play the game.

971
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,290
Yes, please demonstrate
for us, my lord.

972
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,430
- Watch me.
- What's wrong with him?

973
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,330
- He drives me crazy.
- What's wrong with you?

974
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,830
I haven't seen anyone
who butters up others like he does.

975
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,870
- What if we change the lord?
- He's determined...

976
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,460
to be Lord Yu's servant.

977
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,080
If you're far away from the circle,

978
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,540
and failed to go back
inside the circle, you're out.

979
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,740
- That's right.
- If you fail to come back.

980
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,080
- If you fail to come back.
- You have to consider coming back.

981
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,120
If you fail to come back,
you're out.

982
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,040
- We shouldn't go too far.
- You should jump at once.

983
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,540
- Here are makeup tools.
- Okay.

984
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,560
- Going first is a disadvantage.
- Thank you.

985
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,890
Lord Yu, please decide the order.

986
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,480
- Going first is a disadvantage.
- Okay.

987
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,750
- No.
- Is it a disadvantage?

988
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,020
You should attack and defend.

989
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,130
How about we play
rock-paper-scissors?

990
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,900
I think it will be fair.

991
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,260
Seok Sam goes first.

992
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,640
(Seok Sam has been chosen
to be the 1st to go.)

993
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
Okay.

994
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,610
- He goes first.
- We shouldn't jump too far.

995
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,640
- We shouldn't.
- Going first is not good.

996
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,880
- Okay.
- It's not good.

997
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,930
I'm at a disadvantage,

998
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,270
but life is all about
overcoming difficulties.

999
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,010
- I don't think...
- We should overcome it.

1000
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,650
- Don't you agree? We can do this!
- Right.

1001
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,650
Don't look at me.
Chant "Feeling! Intuition! Cross!"

1002
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,240
You just want to chant it.
Don't try too hard...

1003
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,920
- to make it look natural.
- Why would we do that again?

1004
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,980
- Feel!
- Why would we...

1005
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,450
Why should we do that
all of a sudden?

1006
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,750
- Feel!
- Intuition!

1007
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,750
- Cross!
- Cross!

1008
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,830
Suk Jin seems happy.

1009
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,070
He's crying. Don't cry, Suk Jin.

1010
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,220
Lee Ji Brothers

1011
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,370
- Go ahead. Go.
- Let's go.

1012
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,690
Here I go. I won't go too far.

1013
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,730
Galbijjim.

1014
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,270
- You're out if you fall down.
- I won't fall.

1015
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,880
We shouted the chant together.

1016
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,940
Galbijjim.

1017
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,620
- He stepped on Suk Jin's foot.
- Galbijjim.

1018
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,620
(He stepped on Suk Jin's foot.)

1019
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,710
- He stepped on Suk Jin's foot.
- Draw on his face.

1020
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,120
Keep your foot on his foot.

1021
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,520
(Servant Ji got stepped on his foot
on his 1st turn.)

1022
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,480
(Kwang Soo drew snot on his face.)

1023
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,790
(Se Chan is up next.)

1024
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,130
Galbijjim.

1025
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,160
(He dodged it.)

1026
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
You dodged it?

1027
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,330
Ready, go.

1028
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,690
(Haha is up next.)

1029
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,230
Galbijjim.

1030
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,540
That's a smart move.

1031
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,040
He has a different strategy.

1032
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,710
Is it my turn?

1033
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,180
- Yes.
- Galbijjim.

1034
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,640
- She stepped on his foot.
- Galbijjim.

1035
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,910
(Kwang Soo got stepped on his foot!)

1036
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:35,980
Ji Hyo, draw something on his face.

1037
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,120
(She will draw on his face
as he couldn't dodge it.)

1038
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,710
- Close your eyes.
- Rather than...

1039
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,080
(Rubbing)

1040
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,850
(What's that?)

1041
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:44,890
(He looks as if he got
flour bombed.)

1042
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:45,930
That's good.

1043
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,330
- Who's up next?
- Next.

1044
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,270
- I'm up next, right?
- Yes.

1045
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,940
- I can dodge it, right?
- Yes.

1046
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,060
(Here comes Bodyguard Kook.)

1047
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,000
It must hurt
if he steps on the foot.

1048
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,140
He has the scary look
on his face again.

1049
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,770
Jong Kook is about to start.

1050
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,830
Take it easy, will you?

1051
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,140
Why are you being this loyal to him?

1052
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
I'll get rid of at least three.

1053
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Sounds good. Go ahead.

1054
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,680
Don't think about cheating.

1055
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,690
Galbijjim.

1056
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,250
I don't think Jong Kook
can make it back.

1057
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,690
How can we head back?

1058
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,910
You won't be able to.

1059
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,080
I can make it though.

1060
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,690
So Min, you're up next.

1061
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,730
All right.

1062
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,060
Which way?

1063
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,190
Galbijjim.

1064
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,060
It's peaceful over there.

1065
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,060
This is how it is usually done.

1066
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,310
Will Lord Yoo take a gamble?
Go ahead.

1067
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,330
Here he comes.

1068
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,440
Galbijjim!

1069
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,710
Galbijjim!

1070
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,770
(He just jumps to them
without any planning.)

1071
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,910
(It hurts...)

1072
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,440
How did you see the opening?

1073
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,140
How did you manage that?

1074
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,640
Did he step on Suk Jin's foot?

1075
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,310
That must've really hurt.

1076
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,520
Why didn't you move out of the way?

1077
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,290
How did he manage
to stomp on Suk Jin's feet?

1078
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,560
Why didn't you move out of the way?

1079
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,190
You flew like a butterfly just now.

1080
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,620
Okay.

1081
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,790
Suk Jin must go back now.

1082
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,460
- Can we push one another?
- I didn't touch you.

1083
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,730
We must stay still.

1084
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,370
- I'm standing still.
- This is cruel.

1085
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,540
My hands are in one place.

1086
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,440
All I have to do
is step inside that circle.

1087
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,540
I feel bad for him.

1088
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,180
Suk Jin, are you feeling pressured?

1089
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,540
- No.
- Can you manage to get back?

1090
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,710
- Of course.
- Is there any pressure?

1091
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,850
- There's no pressure.
- Show some tears first.

1092
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,080
You're cruel, you know that?

1093
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,270
What if Suk Jin...

1094
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,810
is targeted all day?

1095
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,210
Why did I have to go first?

1096
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,890
He didn't get to jump
on anyone else.

1097
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,290
- Here I go.
- I'm standing still.

1098
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,480
- You should stand still.
- Of course.

1099
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,690
We won't do anything.

1100
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,830
- Don't grab me.
- We won't.

1101
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,690
Say "Gal."

1102
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,520
- Gal...
- He's out.

1103
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,600
bijjim.

1104
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,040
(He managed to make it out
despite the pressure.)

1105
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,060
Kwang Soo's next.

1106
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,270
- It's Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo's next.

1107
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,910
He won't be able to make it.

1108
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,060
There's no chance.

1109
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,680
(Jong Kook's legs
make it harder for him.)

1110
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,810
Gal...

1111
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,870
(Gal...)

1112
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,310
You're out.

1113
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,710
- You're out.
- Isn't he out?

1114
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,080
- You're out.
- Am I out?

1115
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,250
- Okay.
- Does that mean I'm out?

1116
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,410
- Yes.
- Of course.

1117
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,290
- Next!
- Who's next?

1118
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,750
- Se Chan.
- Is it Se Chan?

1119
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,480
Who should I attack?

1120
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,890
Galbijjim! I stepped on your foot.

1121
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,770
(He targets So Min.)

1122
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,690
All right. Draw on So Min's face.

1123
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,730
- Is it me?
- What's going on over there?

1124
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,770
- Is it me?
- What's going on over there?

1125
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,480
We're too close, aren't we?
Sorry about that.

1126
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,730
- What on earth?
- I'm sorry.

1127
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,350
- What's going on?
- What is this?

1128
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,040
- I...
- What's the meaning of this?

1129
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,520
- I'm really sorry.
- Hey!

1130
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,870
What do you think you're doing?

1131
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,910
Are you kidding me?

1132
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,440
- I was just playing the game.
- What do you think you're doing?

1133
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,810
This with a flower in your hair?

1134
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,580
Why are you two enjoying this?

1135
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,980
I said I didn't want
to see things like this.

1136
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,020
What do you think you're doing?

1137
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,430
We're too close, aren't we?

1138
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,850
Se Chan...

1139
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,560
You two.

1140
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,330
- Stop it.
- This is public indecency.

1141
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,460
This is your workplace.

1142
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,390
No relationships
are allowed at work.

1143
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,460
Turn toward me.

1144
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,710
Unbelievable.

1145
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,060
You two seem close.

1146
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,480
Seriously?

1147
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,230
Hi, Yondu.

1148
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,270
- Keep Yondu locked down.
- Yondu's back.

1149
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,640
- Why did it have to be Se Chan?
- I knew it.

1150
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,180
Look at you, Yondu.

1151
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,040
Did you think
we wouldn't recognize you?

1152
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,890
There you go.

1153
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:57,910
Who's next?

1154
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,120
- Isn't it me?
- Okay.

1155
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,460
(Glancing)

1156
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,120
- Look at his gaze.
- I'm putting my trust in you.

1157
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,600
What do you think you're doing?

1158
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,660
Look at his gaze.

1159
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,690
His eyes were sparkling just now.

1160
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,330
- Unbelievable.
- He's saying it's his turn.

1161
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,310
He swears to give it his all.

1162
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,710
He looks like a loyal servant.

1163
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,410
Why is he being this loyal?

1164
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,980
Gal...

1165
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,750
- Jong Kook will crush him down.
- bijjim!

1166
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,680
It hurts me to just look at him.

1167
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,140
He stepped on Suk Jin's foot.

1168
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,520
- Nicely done.
- I stepped on your foot.

1169
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,750
His foot will be bruised.

1170
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,160
(Seok Sam has sore feet and
a face that's been scribbled on.)

1171
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,620
Is So Min next?

1172
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,350
- Yes, it's me.
- She can't make it.

1173
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,460
That means you're out of the game.

1174
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,830
Gal...

1175
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,960
She stepped on the line.

1176
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,890
She stepped on the line.

1177
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,270
- But...
- She's out.

1178
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,000
- Out.
- You're out.

1179
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,440
Round one will end
if another is eliminated.

1180
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,000
- Will it be over then?
- Who's next?

1181
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,040
Go ahead.

1182
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,680
- It's Lord Yu.
- Jae Suk, you're up.

1183
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,350
- Is it my turn?
- It's Lord Yu's turn.

1184
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,500
It's too far away.

1185
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,480
Let me see.

1186
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,310
(Which group will he target?)

1187
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,390
- Lord Yu, he won't be able to...
- Gal...

1188
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,710
bijjim.

1189
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,410
- Lord Yu, he won't be able to...
- Gal...

1190
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,890
bijjim.

1191
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,850
- He can't move.
- Did you step on his foot?

1192
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,120
- No.
- Suk Jin, you're next.

1193
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,250
- Me?
- Yes.

1194
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,600
His leg...

1195
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,850
How can he move
when Jong Kook's foot is on his?

1196
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,960
- You can do it.
- I feel bad for him.

1197
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,500
- Go ahead.
- Go.

1198
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,560
I'll move out of the way.

1199
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,160
- He...
- He did it.

1200
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,460
You have to free your other foot.

1201
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,540
I'll move out of the way.

1202
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,910
(One foot made it to the circle!)

1203
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,980
You have to free your other foot.

1204
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,080
I can't believe he made it.

1205
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,140
He has to free his other foot.

1206
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,080
You're out if you can't make it.

1207
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,180
I'm getting a cramp.

1208
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,480
Wait, Bi...

1209
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,040
(He struggles to free his foot,)

1210
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,710
(but he falls to the side
with a scream.)

1211
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,890
How could you press down that hard?

1212
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,060
- You all won.
- Nice!

1213
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,790
Okay, let's do this.

1214
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,440
Five nyang will be given to those...

1215
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,890
- who survived the game.
- Nice.

1216
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,160
- Really?
- Five nyang?

1217
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,660
That's generous of you.

1218
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,870
You get five nyang each?

1219
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,980
Thank you.

1220
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,540
- Let's play just one more round.
- Sounds good.

1221
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,980
- Okay.
- The order seems to be important.

1222
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,540
- All right. Then...
- He's right.

1223
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,540
Let's play a game
to decide the order.

1224
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,790
- Sure.
- Sounds good!

1225
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,020
Then,

1226
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,080
since we're all here,

1227
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,250
let's play the Game of Wits.

1228
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,250
- 1.
- 2.

1229
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,460
- 3.
- Who sat down first?

1230
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,480
I did.

1231
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,750
You'll be first to jump.

1232
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,850
Hold on a second.

1233
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,100
- Okay.
- Are you kidding me, Lord Yu?

1234
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,160
There's nothing I can do about it.

1235
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,660
You said it was the Game of Wits.

1236
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,870
Just jump!

1237
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,230
- Do as you are told.
- You ungrateful brat.

1238
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,230
Seriously?

1239
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,040
- Look here, shorty.
- Mind your manners.

1240
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,830
- How dare you.
- What did I do?

1241
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,180
Are you glaring at your master?

1242
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,230
- Just do as you are told.
- Wait...

1243
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,480
Jong Kook.

1244
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,140
You shouldn't be this way.

1245
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,520
You're one of us, aren't you?

1246
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,040
- Are you defying him?
- Wait.

1247
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,190
Insolent brat.

1248
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,980
(After disciplining Haha,
he returns with a smile.)

1249
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,310
Here you go.

1250
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,690
Did you give him money?

1251
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,290
Let's not be this way.

1252
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,080
- Seriously?
- Are you kidding me?

1253
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,250
I like your constantly
positive attitude.

1254
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,560
- Learn from him.
- Exactly.

1255
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,520
Having a positive attitude...

1256
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,460
- I'll go first then.
- No, I will.

1257
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,640
Se Chan will go first.

1258
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,310
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1259
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,600
- We should spread out.
- Right.

1260
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,870
What's the best move?

1261
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,600
- Should we go further out?
- Coming back should be the goal.

1262
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,910
Galbijjim.

1263
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,350
- Just don't be stepped on.
- Galbijjim.

1264
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,940
- That's it.
- Go further out.

1265
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,270
Galbijjim.

1266
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,390
- Good.
- Things have taken a fun turn.

1267
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,020
Good job, guys.
This is how it's done.

1268
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,020
(Jong Kook's next.)

1269
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,910
How about you go that way?

1270
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,710
- From here to there?
- Yes.

1271
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,080
The one up next
gets the first choice then.

1272
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
(Jong Kook could
split them into four groups.)

1273
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,730
Galbijjim.

1274
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,290
(He ambushes Kwang Soo.)

1275
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,430
He made his choice.

1276
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,000
(It hurts!)

1277
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,460
(His heavy weight
lands on Kwang Soo's foot.)

1278
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,500
It serves you right for spacing out.

1279
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,000
He said he was going that way!

1280
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,830
- You should've been focused.
- Okay.

1281
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,040
You already have a beard anyway.

1282
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,100
(He gets a mustache
on top of white eye-shadow.)

1283
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,120
Ji Hyo.

1284
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,250
- Galbijjim!
- She stepped on his foot.

1285
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,120
- Galbijjim!
- She stepped on his foot.

1286
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,310
(Is she hugging him from behind?)

1287
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,210
- What on earth?
- What is this?

1288
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,350
Why are you hugging him from behind?

1289
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,890
- I...
- Hold on a second.

1290
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,160
Ji Hyo, why did you
hug him from behind?

1291
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,520
You didn't step on my feet.

1292
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,020
Jae Suk, I'm just playing a game.

1293
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,100
- Did you step on his foot?
- I did.

1294
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,790
- On his heel.
- She did.

1295
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,100
- Did she?
- Wait.

1296
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Then...

1297
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,500
(She draws on Jong Kook's face.)

1298
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,940
Now I'm scared. It's Rambo.

1299
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,540
It's Rambo!

1300
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,180
- It's Rambo!
- What is this?

1301
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,350
Rambo!

1302
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,410
Must it be this random?

1303
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,580
Hey there, Rambo.

1304
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,750
You could've drawn it
across my cheeks.

1305
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,120
It's Rambo.

1306
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,080
When did Rambo get here?

1307
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,310
I'm a huge fan.

1308
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,750
All he needs
is for the bandana to be red.

1309
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,430
They're all going that way now.

1310
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,830
They will easily make it back.

1311
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,250
The first one to play
gets to come back first.

1312
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,100
Gal...

1313
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,100
bijjim!

1314
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,230
Okay, good.

1315
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,500
Is Haha aiming for this opening?

1316
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,660
- Get over here.
- Galbijjim.

1317
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,410
- Okay.
- I have no choice, Lord Yu.

1318
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,830
I can't believe
you stepped on Lord Yu's foot.

1319
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,870
- What on earth is that?
- He looks cool though.

1320
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,180
- You look great.
- Rambo!

1321
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,480
It's Rambo.

1322
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,580
He truly looks like Rambo.

1323
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,750
He looks determined.

1324
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,540
The first master and special agent.

1325
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,980
(The first master and special agent)

1326
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,120
Call me Lord Rambo.

1327
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,160
- Lord Rambo.
- Lord Rambo.

1328
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,580
- Lord Rambo.
- I'm Lord Rambo.

1329
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,890
- Who's next?
- It's me.

1330
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,060
- There's no chance he can make it.
- No way.

1331
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,290
- Go ahead.
- He'll never make it.

1332
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,960
- Go on.
- He can't move.

1333
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,410
(He tries to cheat his way out.)

1334
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,270
Are you out of your mind?

1335
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,600
You must jump from your spot,
and you can't hold onto anyone.

1336
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,370
(He must get past 7 people.)

1337
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,640
Gal...

1338
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,350
- You're out.
- He's out.

1339
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,540
Is it me?

1340
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,750
Oh, it's Jong Kook.

1341
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,310
All right.

1342
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,480
- Where is it?
- Right here.

1343
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,020
He won't be able to make it.

1344
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,210
Can you?

1345
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,890
- He can't make it.
- How...

1346
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,060
Gal...

1347
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,500
Gal...

1348
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,270
(Gal...)

1349
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,890
- What?
- Bijjim.

1350
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,600
He actually made it.

1351
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,230
He made it through!

1352
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,100
- What was that?
- Are you kidding me?

1353
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,410
Can you push past people like that?

1354
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,600
Is this a joke?

1355
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,850
- That's your move?
- What's wrong?

1356
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,750
- Okay, fine.
- All right!

1357
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,980
- Nicely done.
- Gal...

1358
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,290
I like your gung-ho attitude.

1359
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,750
- Ji Hyo.
- I'm next.

1360
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,350
- Ji Hyo will be out.
- Go ahead.

1361
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,660
Gal...

1362
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,250
Out! You stepped on the line.

1363
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,690
That's too bad.

1364
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:10,980
Suk Jin will make it back.

1365
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,600
(It doesn't seem easy
with Haha blocking his way.)

1366
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,160
Gal...

1367
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:21,370
(Take that.)

1368
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,600
Suk Jin got poked in the butt.

1369
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,080
Suk Jin got poked in the butt.
That should be a world record.

1370
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,310
Getting poked in the butt...

1371
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,480
The oldest person
to get poked in the butt.

1372
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,290
The pants are too thin, so...

1373
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,850
(Humiliated)

1374
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:40,120
It's been about 45 years
since I was goosed.

1375
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,830
It's a world record!

1376
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,080
(It's his turn to attack.)

1377
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,230
Bijjim!

1378
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,020
(Just the one foot?)

1379
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,560
What on earth was that?

1380
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,560
You're out.

1381
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,600
(Suk Jin's out.)

1382
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,460
- You're out.
- Both feet should've made it out.

1383
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,410
- Both feet.
- Of course.

1384
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,180
- We've played many times already.
- They did go out later.

1385
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,940
- Stop it.
- My gosh.

1386
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,370
I was so upset
when he poked my butt.

1387
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,140
I was so upset.

1388
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,480
- I won this round.
- Me too.

1389
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,810
- This guy is...
- Thank you.

1390
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,890
Okay.

1391
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,020
I collected a few already.

1392
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,790
(They were able to collect
lots of coins through this mission.)

1393
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,580
- I'm going to get the sticks.
- Me too.

1394
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,390
I'm going to kick Lord Yoo out.

1395
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,160
(The tall servant puts his thoughts
into action first.)

1396
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,230
(He arrived at the servant room.)

1397
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,870
I'm going to use
all the coins I have.

1398
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,040
(He uses 6 nyang
to kick Lord Yoo out.)

1399
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,640
Let's go to the servant room.

1400
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,060
I think we should.

1401
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,600
Let's go to the servant room
and change our lord.

1402
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,000
So this is it.

1403
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,180
I've never been to this place.

1404
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,210
I'm going to kick Lord Yoo out.

1405
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,310
Hello.

1406
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,640
(To dethrone Lord Yu,
Se Chan uses all his coins too.)

1407
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,810
Two more penalty sticks
of Lord Yoo have been added.

1408
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:44,960
It's done, right?

1409
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,960
- You can change the lord.
- Really?

1410
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,160
I used all of my coins.

1411
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,250
- Well done.
- And read this out loud for him.

1412
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,390
Well done.

1413
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,890
How did it go?

1414
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,730
- We can change the lord.
- I used all of my coins.

1415
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,100
(The servants succeed
in their uprising...)

1416
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,120
(behind Lord Yu's back.)

1417
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:00,040
- We can change the lord.
- How do we do it?

1418
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,100
- Gosh, he startled me.
- What are you guys up to?

1419
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,770
- Nothing.
- It's nothing, Lord Yu.

1420
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,230
What are you guys up to?

1421
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,230
Let's walk faster now.

1422
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,040
Hurry up!

1423
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,580
(Come quickly, Lord Yu.)

1424
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,680
(Those arrogant servants...)

1425
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,040
I have a big announcement to make!

1426
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,210
What is it?

1427
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,810
I received a note.

1428
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,160
- Read it out loud.
- This doesn't suit you.

1429
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,000
"Hear this, Lord Yu."

1430
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,690
"The servants succeeded
in their uprising."

1431
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,430
"You are no longer a lord.
You have been degraded..."

1432
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,140
- "to a servant."
- Hey!

1433
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,290
(He falls in status.)

1434
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,460
(Getting back at him)

1435
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,370
Kneel before us!

1436
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,480
Kneel!

1437
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,440
- Stay still!
- How dare you!

1438
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,870
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

1439
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,310
- "How dare you?"
- How is this happening?

1440
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,770
- "How dare you?"
- You.

1441
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,270
(The former lord keeps treating
the servants rudely.)

1442
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,750
- Stop right there.
- Already?

1443
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:49,810
- Of course.
- Shall we torture him?

1444
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:53,160
"You will now pick a new lord..."

1445
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,330
"among the servants who contributed
to the uprising."

1446
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,230
Let's go over there.

1447
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,690
(The miserable end of Lord Yu
who made people suffer)

1448
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:05,390
The two servants who contributed
to kicking Lord Yoo out...

1449
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,710
are Kwang Soo and Se Chan.
Their names are written here.

1450
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,770
We'll pick one name randomly,
and the winner will be the new lord.

1451
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,680
Please pick one.

1452
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,910
All right. Pick a name.

1453
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,980
- Hey, you. Keep quiet.
- Watch your tone.

1454
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,190
(Watch what you say.)

1455
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,810
- Keep quiet.
- You...

1456
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,310
- Look at him.
- Don't say anything.

1457
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:29,120
- Hey, you.
- You should get changed now!

1458
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,060
- Get changed!
- You changed your stance so fast.

1459
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,390
- My goodness.
- I'm dumbfounded.

1460
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,330
- My gosh, look at his face.
- I'm really dumbfounded.

1461
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,620
- You should go ahead!
- My gosh.

1462
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,660
How about letting Lord Yoo pick it?

1463
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,960
- Lord Yu?
- Who is Lord Yu?

1464
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,330
- I mean Servant Yu.
- It's Servant Yu.

1465
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,710
Take off your robe.
Why are you still wearing it?

1466
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,560
Although I am descending...

1467
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,270
- Shut it.
- Be quiet.

1468
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,350
(Hitting his mouth)

1469
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,500
- Be quiet.
- Who are you to say that?

1470
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,580
(As soon as he steps down,
he's getting hit by everyone.)

1471
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,910
This is so upsetting.

1472
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,520
- Whose name are you picking?
- It's over already.

1473
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:56,850
I pick this.

1474
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,310
(Who will become the new lord?)

1475
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:01,930
I pick this.

1476
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,690
- It's Kwang Soo.
- Yes!

1477
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,750
(Kwang Soo got picked.)

1478
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,790
- It's Kwang Soo.
- Yes!

1479
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,460
(We have a new lord, Lord Lee.)

1480
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:09,790
- Lord Lee! Let me carry you!
- Yes!

1481
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,020
Enjoy it.

1482
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,940
Lord Yu, you'll give all your money
to Lord Lee.

1483
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,560
- I'm getting the money too?
- He's getting the money too?

1484
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,830
You can give out coins using those.

1485
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,140
We're in big trouble.

1486
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,730
He's worse than Jae Suk.

1487
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,810
- We're in trouble. It'll be harder.
- I'm worried already.

1488
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,140
Hurry up. 10, 9, 8, 7...

1489
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,750
- Take off your robe.
- Hey.

1490
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:29,540
(Lord Yoo is stripped of his power,
wealth, and silk clothes.)

1491
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,810
Gosh, this is infuriating.

1492
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,160
Get changed now.

1493
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,160
He's like a faithful dog.

1494
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,930
How dare you talk casually
to Lord Lee?

1495
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,520
Don't talk about the past!

1496
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,460
- Give me some.
- What?

1497
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,520
Don't talk about the past!

1498
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,830
(Approaching Kwang Soo)

1499
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,330
- Give me some.
- What?

1500
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,600
Move!

1501
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,540
What do you think you are doing?

1502
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,370
(Satisfied)

1503
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,440
- This is why I like you.
- How dare you?

1504
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,410
(This bodyguard is only kind
to the man with power.)

1505
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:55,580
- You're a faithful dog indeed.
- Okay!

1506
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,870
While Lord Lee gets changed,

1507
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,080
you need to send someone out
to get ingredients for hotteok.

1508
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,890
The second dish is hotteok.

1509
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:05,690
The ingredients for hotteok.

1510
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,020
- Ingredients?
- The second dish is hotteok.

1511
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,020
Gosh, there's no one to send out.

1512
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,790
Lord Lee, please trust me.

1513
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,460
- Lord Lee.
- Then I'll pick the man I trust,

1514
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,060
- Jong Kook.
- Me?

1515
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,000
All right. I'll go with him.

1516
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,160
No, I will go.

1517
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,370
You should get ready
to lift the palanquin.

1518
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,870
(Lord Lee pays back
for how he was treated.)

1519
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,540
- This is so upsetting.
- Jong Kook...

1520
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,250
- and Suk Jin should go.
- Okay!

1521
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,370
I like Suk Jin.

1522
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,410
- This is great.
- This is so upsetting.

1523
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,620
Let's go find out the prices.

1524
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,750
(The two servants set out
to get the ingredients.)

1525
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,040
Gosh, this man...

1526
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,790
You brat! Sweep the garden!

1527
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,660
I can't stand the sight of you.

1528
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,890
That punk. I knew this would happen.

1529
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:45,930
(The former lord
is treated with contempt.)

1530
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,460
I'm a man of low status.

1531
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,870
From now, I am...

1532
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,870
I'm the first special agent
among servants.

1533
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,770
- So you should...
- Don't be ridiculous.

1534
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,540
I'm the first special agent
among servants.

1535
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,230
(In your dreams!)

1536
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,640
(Servant Yoo still can't get over
his role-playing.)

1537
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,080
- He's being ridiculous.
- This is so upsetting.

1538
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,350
- Lord Lee.
- Lord Lee, I'll perform for you.

1539
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,080
- Lord Lee, I'll perform for you.
- That's...

1540
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,810
- what Servant Ji likes!
- So give me some money.

1541
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,910
Give me some money.

1542
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,750
Things are so expensive these days.

1543
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,250
- We're not even kidding.
- Really?

1544
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:16,480
How much do they cost?

1545
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,750
- They're so expensive.
- Hotteok is...

1546
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,000
The flour is 20 nyang.

1547
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,460
And the sugar you put inside...

1548
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,520
- is 10 nyang.
- So a total of 30 nyang.

1549
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,790
He became a pushover now.

1550
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,330
Lord Lee became a pushover.

1551
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:27,940
Then should I trust them
and give them the money?

1552
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,710
- We're serious.
- We're serious. We're not kidding.

1553
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:30,810
- Do you want to see for yourself?
- If you give me the money,

1554
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,180
I'll be sure to buy them
at the right price.

1555
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,180
- Lord Lee, don't you trust us?
- I'm serious.

1556
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,580
- I'll do it.
- Please let me go.

1557
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,770
- Give me 15 nyang.
- 10...

1558
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,580
- I'll go get them at 15 nyang.
- 15 nyang?

1559
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,620
- Yes.
- I'll use mine if it's not enough.

1560
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,040
- They said they'll take 15 only.
- I'll use my own money too.

1561
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,750
- No one's going lower than that?
- Yes, 15 nyang.

1562
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,540
If you fail,
I'll take all your money.

1563
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,660
- Okay.
- Okay, got it.

1564
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,750
Make sure to get all the ingredients
with 15 nyang.

1565
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,750
Okay, okay.

1566
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,020
- Let's follow them.
- Let's do that.

1567
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,350
(Haha and Suk Jin also set off.)

1568
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,890
- Sweep the garden!
- Hey, make a fire.

1569
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,330
- Hey.
- Make a fire.

1570
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,830
Come here. Get down.

1571
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:59,290
(While Lord Lee becomes
more ruthless...)

1572
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,160
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

1573
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,500
(Somebody moans in pain.)

1574
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:08,140
- What happened?
- Lord Lee!

1575
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:09,710
- Something bad happened!
- What is it? What happened?

1576
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:12,080
- We met...
- We met bandits on our way!

1577
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,410
(Bandits in the middle of a city?)

1578
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,350
- We lost all of our money!
- Lord Lee!

1579
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,160
- Lord Lee!
- We barely...

1580
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,250
- My goodness.
- We barely made it out alive.

1581
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,330
- We almost died!
- Please forgive us!

1582
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:28,620
We almost died!

1583
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,790
- We're serious!
- They hit us and threatened us!

1584
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,890
- I'm so sorry!
- It's all my fault!

1585
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,230
I was so scared!
They threatened us with a knife!

1586
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,640
We almost died!

1587
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,980
- What happened?
- I barely saved them!

1588
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,810
- Lord Lee.
- If you give us 15 nyang,

1589
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,270
- we'll get the ingredients.
- Seriously. Lord Lee!

1590
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,140
- You should punish them.
- Can I check your bag?

1591
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,710
No, you can't!

1592
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,690
- I really don't have it.
- No need to go through their bags.

1593
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,290
- I really don't have it.
- I think they hid it somewhere.

1594
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,350
What's that?

1595
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,560
"Hear this, offender Lord Lee."

1596
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,160
"Hear this, offender Lord Lee."

1597
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,600
"The servants succeeded
in their uprising."

1598
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:02,790
"You are no longer a lord."

1599
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,000
"You have been degraded
to a servant."

1600
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,730
You punk!

1601
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,330
- They used that money.
- "You will now pick a new lord..."

1602
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,660
"among the servants who contributed
to the uprising."

1603
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,080
- Hey, hey. Move!
- We have a new lord!

1604
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,480
Let's go right now.

1605
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,810
We can change the lord right away.

1606
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,910
We can change the lord right now.

1607
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,680
Let's change the lord right away.

1608
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,750
(They headed straight
to the servant room instead.)

1609
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,580
- That brat...
- That rude brat!

1610
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,190
- That rude brat.
- I got 15 nyang.

1611
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,690
- 15 nyang?
- I got 15 too. Put them together.

1612
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,690
(They used the money from Lord Lee
to bring him down.)

1613
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,120
- They used that money?
- Did they really?

1614
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,060
- You thoughtless brat!
- How dare you!

1615
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,250
- Take off your robe.
- Take off your robe now!

1616
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:36,270
- Take off your robe.
- Put the palanquin away.

1617
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,290
There are
Jae Suk, Haha, and So Min.

1618
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,290
You should pick one.

1619
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,560
Pick one.

1620
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,910
- Pick one.
- So Min would be funny.

1621
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,710
- I want to try it too.
- I want So Min to become one.

1622
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:44,710
You want to do it, right?

1623
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,140
- All right.
- I picked it.

1624
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,710
Help So Min become one.

1625
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:48,850
But I think
she'd be really annoying.

1626
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,140
It'd be best
if I become the lord again.

1627
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,440
If Jae Suk
becomes the lord again...

1628
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,520
- Let us see.
- It's Jae Suk.

1629
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,620
Give that to me!

1630
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,620
(The 3 servants rose up in revolt
and brought down Lord Lee.)

1631
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,750
(Who will become the new lord
among them?)

1632
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,250
- It's Jae Suk.
- Give that to me!

1633
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,350
Is it really Jae Suk?

1634
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,710
"Yoo Jae Suk."

1635
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,480
(Jae Suk has become
the lord again!)

1636
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:04,980
(Lord Rambo is back.)

1637
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,600
I knew it.

1638
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,750
Take it off right now.

1639
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,660
Lord Yu!

1640
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,120
(He was degraded to a servant
and had miserable days.)

1641
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:12,600
- Shut it.
- Be quiet.

1642
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,230
(He was slapped and humiliated.)

1643
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,600
(They made fun of him
playing Lord Rambo.)

1644
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,040
(A glorious return of Lord Yu)

1645
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:23,770
- Look at Jong Kook.
- I knew it.

1646
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,140
Jong Kook is at it again.

1647
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,680
I knew it.

1648
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:28,350
I knew it!

1649
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,250
- Take it off right now.
- I knew it.

1650
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,310
He'll get up there again.

1651
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,810
We used the money you gave us
in the servant room.

1652
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,080
That darn boy.

1653
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,250
We were short of exactly 15 nyang.

1654
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,020
- Thank you for that.
- We used your money.

1655
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,660
(Donation angel)

1656
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,060
What did he do as a lord?

1657
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,160
I just had the robe on briefly.

1658
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,160
It's like a fashion show.

1659
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,730
- I knew it!
- Take it off right now!

1660
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,660
Jae Suk needs to be the lord.

1661
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,140
- Is he getting it again?
- Lord Yu.

1662
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:54,680
(Singing celebratory song)

1663
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,870
(A parade to celebrate
the return of Lord Yu)

1664
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,940
(Lord Rambo leads the parade.)

1665
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,350
(And the servants
follow behind him.)

1666
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,350
(Even the dancer
from the cultural center joins in.)

1667
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:08,560
(The celebration
reaches its climax.)

1668
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,980
(Gosh, I don't want to do it.)

1669
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,390
(Servant Lee,
who used to be a clown,)

1670
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:16,270
(twirls a baton to celebrate.)

1671
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,500
(The parade ends.)

1672
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,640
- Well, Jong Kook.
- Yes.

1673
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,810
- Start the count off.
- Okay, My Lord.

1674
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:25,040
- There he goes again.
- He's at it again.

1675
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,180
- This is driving me crazy.
- I'm so sick of it.

1676
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,440
- Please.
- Come on.

1677
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,910
- We're doing it again?
- Count off!

1678
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,350
- Do it properly!
- This is driving me crazy.

1679
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,140
Let's start with Kwang Soo. Start!

1680
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,140
- 1.
- 2.

1681
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,190
- 3.
- 4.

1682
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,210
- 5.
- 6.

1683
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,410
Seven. End of count.

1684
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,560
- I'm going to the village,
- This is exhausting.

1685
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,890
- so bring the palanquin.
- Palanquin!

1686
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,250
- Palanquin...
- Who is carrying it?

1687
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,980
- Tell us.
- Carry it!

1688
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,500
- Carry it.
- You...

1689
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,600
- You should carry it too.
- and you.

1690
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,620
Lord Yu, when will we get
the ingredients for hotteok?

1691
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,870
- What?
- Lord Yu, while traveling,

1692
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,870
pick the servant you want,

1693
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:57,270
and you can relax
in a luxurious SUV.

1694
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,080
I wanted to ride it.

1695
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,500
Then can't I join in
on the product placement?

1696
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,770
- Okay, now...
- Pick me.

1697
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:07,440
You all saw how it was
when Lord Lee was in charge.

1698
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,640
- Right.
- Now.

1699
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,710
- I will...
- I'm finally in the right place.

1700
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,080
Be quiet. Be quiet!

1701
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,080
(Be quiet!)

1702
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:14,850
How dare you open your mouth?

1703
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,020
- He's having so much fun.
- Who said you could talk?

1704
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,890
Who said you could talk?

1705
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,160
Earlier, he said...

1706
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,120
- Did I?
- No, My Lord.

1707
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,600
He called himself
a special agent earlier.

1708
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,830
Se Chan, you should come with me.

1709
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,500
- Him?
- Thank you.

1710
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,270
- I'll take him.
- Because he's comfortable.

1711
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,440
I think
he's going to scheme against me.

1712
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,540
- Oh, right.
- Come here.

1713
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,040
- You should go.
- Sure.

1714
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,350
I'll go and take a break.

1715
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,350
Lord Yu, you made the right choice.

1716
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,020
Right you are.

1717
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:47,310
(Lord Yoo and Servant Yang arrive
at a place where they get to rest.)

1718
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,560
- Please get in.
- Shall I?

1719
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,060
(Let me...)

1720
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,790
Only Lord Yoo can get in the car.

1721
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,040
Darn it! This is...

1722
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,140
Then what am I supposed to do?

1723
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,600
You can wait outside
and open the door for him.

1724
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,230
- Hey, hey.
- What is this?

1725
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,500
Then where can I stay?

1726
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,180
Just stand right there.

1727
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,710
You want me to just wait here?

1728
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:10,480
The inside is really spacious.

1729
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:12,870
Gosh, this is nice.

1730
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,640
(The VJ goes inside
to shoot Lord Yu.)

1731
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,690
He can get in but I can't?

1732
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,350
Director, I'll shoot him myself.

1733
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,460
Actually,

1734
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,080
you don't need me here.

1735
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:26,850
You're only shooting the inside.

1736
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,930
Was this one of their conditions?

1737
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,870
One of us standing outside?

1738
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,870
(Even the product placement
discriminates based on his status.)

1739
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:35,960
How many coins do you have?

1740
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,230
- Gosh, he's so annoying today.
- I should choose him this time.

1741
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,940
- He's just...
- He crossed the line.

1742
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,370
- He's so annoying.
- I know. It's killing me.

1743
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:44,370
- I used all of my coins already.
- Me too.

1744
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,710
Let's choose Jong Kook then.

1745
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,810
- Gosh, he's so annoying today.
- I should choose him this time.

1746
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,380
- He's just...
- He crossed the line.

1747
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,860
- He's so annoying.
- I know. It's killing me.

1748
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,190
Welcome.

1749
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,880
How much are the ingredients
of hotteok?

1750
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,360
Flour costs 12 nyang,
and sugar costs 8 nyang.

1751
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,630
Then just give us the flour.

1752
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:01,750
(Then just give us the flour.)

1753
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,130
- You only need this?
- Yes.

1754
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:04,170
(What about sugar?)

1755
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,960
- You're not adding sugar?
- It's okay.

1756
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,040
We're only going to make it
with flour.

1757
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,060
- Here you go.
- Okay, then...

1758
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,270
(They used 12 nyang
to get flour only.)

1759
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,400
I got 12 nyang.

1760
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,040
- Hello.
- Hi.

1761
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,610
- I'm putting in 5 nyang.
- Who will you pick?

1762
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,270
- No, I'm paying to change the lord.
- Lord Yu?

1763
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,110
How come you took Se Chan?

1764
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,190
Haha and I...

1765
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,290
bought the sticks to make you
the new lord.

1766
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:29,020
Keep quiet and bring yakgwa.
You're upsetting me.

1767
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,750
(Lord Yu
has anger management issues.)

1768
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,460
We won't be able to
see them together anymore.

1769
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,520
- Is he being hysterical or what?
- My gosh.

1770
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,330
All the lords are sensitive.

1771
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,730
I preferred having Lord Lee...

1772
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,690
because he gave us more money.
Don't you think?

1773
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,340
It was way better
when we had Lord Lee.

1774
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,440
- Right. He even paid us more.
- I'm so angry.

1775
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,170
Hurry up and make hotteok. Hey!

1776
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:49,900
You. Come here.

1777
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,310
"You. Come here?"

1778
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:53,270
- Come here.
- Why?

1779
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,420
Come here.

1780
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,250
(Look at his face.)

1781
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,020
Look at his makeup.

1782
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,360
You know you have snot
on your face, right?

1783
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,360
(He looks even more pitiful
with the snot makeup.)

1784
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,090
Hey, only these guys are working.

1785
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,460
- Why aren't you working?
- I'm hungry.

1786
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,020
Who cares if you're hungry?
Everyone here is hungry.

1787
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,170
Where did you hit?
I heard a loud snap.

1788
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:14,540
I mean,
he's slacking off for so long.

1789
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,130
Why aren't you working?

1790
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,230
- I mean...
- Tell me.

1791
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,730
I had to go to the store
so I couldn't eat.

1792
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:21,900
My goodness.

1793
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,540
(Lord Yoo can't stand his servants
being idle.)

1794
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,540
I got so upset earlier.

1795
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,210
I think it's a good idea
to press with this.

1796
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,480
- I think it'll be really spicy.
- Who adds chilis in hotteok?

1797
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,360
It's a fusion dish.

1798
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,210
Who adds chilis in hotteok?

1799
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,250
It's a fusion dish.

1800
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,480
Just let her be.

1801
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,590
- Wait and see.
- You're complaining...

1802
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,590
when you're not even helping her.
Gosh, seriously.

1803
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:40,650
Hold on.

1804
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:43,130
- Jong Kook.
- Yes, My Lord!

1805
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,040
- Leave Ji Hyo, Se Chan,
- Okay.

1806
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,840
- and So Min here,
- Okay.

1807
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,040
and let the rest
run laps around here.

1808
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,210
You should take them and...

1809
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,170
- What are you talking about?
- It's not like we're dogs!

1810
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,340
- Until where?
- To the stairs, and come back.

1811
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,270
- Why would we run?
- Okay.

1812
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,270
Why would he let us run...

1813
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,270
- out of nowhere?
- Line up!

1814
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,310
- Line up now!
- Haha, you can stay.

1815
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:02,940
Just us two?

1816
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,840
Line up and start the count off.

1817
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,960
- 1.
- 2.

1818
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,460
- Three. End of count.
- All right. Good.

1819
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,460
I'll be behind you.
We're taking a big lap around here.

1820
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,020
- Ready. Start with your left foot.
- What is this?

1821
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,400
Left, left, left.

1822
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,420
Why are we doing this?

1823
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,940
Left, left, left.

1824
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,790
- What is this?
- Start counting!

1825
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:25,480
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

1826
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,980
- 1, 2, 3...
- 1, 2, 3.

1827
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,840
- They're back.
- 1, 2,

1828
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,480
- 3, 4.
- This is nice.

1829
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,150
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- That's good.

1830
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,210
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

1831
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:36,150
- This is nice.
- They all look so tired.

1832
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:37,650
- 3, 4.
- 3, 4.

1833
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,210
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

1834
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:41,060
- Halt.
- 1, 2.

1835
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,360
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes, My Lord.

1836
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,830
- Did they run well?
- They really worked out.

1837
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,230
- Yes, they listened to me well.
- Look at them sweating.

1838
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,560
You should report to me now.

1839
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,330
- We had no renegades.
- That's good. Well done.

1840
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,330
- Mr. Kim, you're so...
- He's all smiles.

1841
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,730
- You're really good with this.
- Jong Kook is all smiles.

1842
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,710
- Here. Good work.
- Thank you, My Lord.

1843
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,840
I don't want to live like him.

1844
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,630
At ease. You're dismissed.

1845
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,730
You're dismissed!

1846
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:01,980
- You're dismissed.
- What is this?

1847
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,540
He made you run.

1848
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,210
- We're not getting any?
- You're not giving us any?

1849
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,650
He made you run so that
you don't scheme against him.

1850
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,920
If they stay together,
they keep plotting things.

1851
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
Lord Yu, please sit down.

1852
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,860
My, look at this.

1853
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,190
This looks amazing.

1854
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:19,830
(He greedily eats it alone.)

1855
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,830
(I hope it's to his liking.)

1856
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,230
Oh, really?

1857
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,360
Spicy, salty,
and sweet ingredients go well.

1858
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,210
- Right. It's sweet and salty.
- Also,

1859
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,670
because of Cheongyang chili,

1860
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,630
- it's not greasy.
- You see?

1861
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:35,230
You see? I told you we should add
Cheongyang chili.

1862
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,750
My gosh, it's so good.

1863
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,170
He really finished the whole thing.
Lord Yoo finished it.

1864
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,940
- I'm happy that he finished it.
- I'm happy too.

1865
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,210
All right, everyone!
Put your arms around each other.

1866
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:48,380
Come! Put your arms
around each other.

1867
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,380
- Come.
- My gosh.

1868
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,650
- Why...
- Why are we doing this?

1869
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:51,750
Why does he make us do
so many things?

1870
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,920
- What are we doing next?
- Let's...

1871
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,860
thank each other for making
the delicious hotteok...

1872
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,940
that we all enjoyed.

1873
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,230
(The cheering
that only Jae Suk wants)

1874
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,230
(I really don't want to do this.)

1875
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,480
(Lord Yoo loves having
a family-like relationship...)

1876
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,480
(with his servants.)

1877
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,270
- To the front.
- Let's go.

1878
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,940
- Put your hands together.
- Put them together!

1879
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,420
All right now.

1880
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,750
- Let's...
- Yes!

1881
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,040
wish everyone good health.

1882
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,750
- Doesn't this house...
- Let's cheer for each other.

1883
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,480
- let the servants take a break?
- No.

1884
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,920
Why is he so full of energy all day?

1885
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,360
Say "let's go"
on the count of 3. 1, 2, 3.

1886
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,500
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1887
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,330
That was nice! Let's go!

1888
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:32,090
I can't even go against him
because I have no money.

1889
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,840
- This is driving me crazy.
- You're all dismissed!

1890
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,130
- Dismissed!
- Dismissed!

1891
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,110
- Let's take a break.
- You're all dismissed!

1892
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,440
- You can take a break.
- Come to the servant room.

1893
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,440
Come to the servant room.

1894
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,000
- Is there something?
- There are two.

1895
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,340
- Let's gather all our coins.
- Okay.

1896
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,610
(They take a short break
after working hard.)

1897
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:45,810
I should lie down.

1898
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,540
I'm so tired.

1899
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,020
(Seok Sam found the perfect spot
to rest while the staff have lunch.)

1900
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,440
This is nice.

1901
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,460
(He lies down as he groans.)

1902
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:56,060
This is nice.
It's so nice to lie down.

1903
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,150
(Servant Ji uses a book
as his pillow and lies down.)

1904
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:00,730
(He then fell asleep
in the same position.)

1905
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:05,730
(Right then, the staff spotted
Servant Ji who's deeply asleep.)

1906
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:09,730
(He's deep in sleep
without knowing what's going on.)

1907
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,440
- He's sleeping.
- Quiet.

1908
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,170
- He's really sleeping.
- Let's begin.

1909
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,480
Suk Jin is sleeping.

1910
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,840
(Let's begin. Suk Jin is sleeping.)

1911
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:22,540
(Even the staff get ready to shoot
to play a joke on Seok Sam.)

1912
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,190
- Did you all sleep well?
- Yes, My Lord.

1913
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:26,380
- Did you have a good rest?
- Yes, My Lord.

1914
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,420
What do you want us to do now?

1915
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,150
- We'll do anything for you.
- Now...

1916
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,480
- Hold on. Jong Kook.
- Yes, My Lord.

1917
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,730
Shall we start the count off?

1918
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:34,750
- Let's begin with you.
- One.

1919
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:35,770
- 2.
- 3.

1920
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:36,770
- 4.
- 5.

1921
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:37,830
Six. End of count.

1922
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,440
- What?
- There's only six of us?

1923
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,170
- This is...
- There's only six of you?

1924
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,730
Where did the other one go?

1925
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:45,040
- I'll get ready to chase him down!
- Where did he go?

1926
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,670
- I'll chase him down!
- Where did he go?

1927
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,230
Where did one go?

1928
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,270
- I'll chase him down!
- Where did one go?

1929
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:51,750
- The slave hunter will find him.
- Where did one go?

1930
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,920
The slave hunter will find him.

1931
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,440
For goodness' sake.

1932
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,710
(Seok Sam is startled awake
upon the news of slave hunters.)

1933
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,020
For goodness' sake.

1934
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,310
(Peeking)

1935
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,690
- Look at his face.
- What are you doing?

1936
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:03,480
- What?
- What is up with his face?

1937
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,920
- For a second...
- You punk.

1938
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,960
I was told I could rest
while the staff members were eating.

1939
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,130
Come back to your senses.

1940
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,920
- Why are you staggering?
- Hey.

1941
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:11,690
- Suddenly...
- For goodness' sake.

1942
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:14,090
How did his face become so puffy
in such a short amount of time?

1943
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,170
You punk.

1944
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,500
- Why didn't you wake me up?
- Hey.

1945
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,040
How could you use books as a pillow?

1946
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,540
(How could you use books
as a pillow?)

1947
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:20,980
Hey.

1948
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,250
- I mean...
- How could you do that?

1949
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:23,770
I guess he was cold.

1950
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,310
- He must feel chilly.
- It's cold.

1951
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,210
- He must feel chilly.
- I had a good nap.

1952
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,980
Gosh, it's very refreshing.

1953
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,210
Are you healthy?

1954
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,250
I am healthy.

1955
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:34,020
Are you okay?

1956
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,750
Are you okay?

1957
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,630
- I am healthy.
- He is healthy!

1958
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:40,020
- I am jealous of Suk Jin.
- He came alive.

1959
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:43,730
(Cold water helped Seok Sam
find his vigor.)

1960
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,290
- I am healthy.
- He is healthy.

1961
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:47,090
Suk Jin is back.

1962
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,270
I am healthy.

1963
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,310
- I am healthy.
- Seok Sam, are you okay?

1964
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,900
- I am okay.
- Did you recover?

1965
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,630
- It's time for a meal.
- We need to eat.

1966
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,650
- Let's prepare the third meal.
- "We need to eat."

1967
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,400
- Seok Sam, go.
- You are the healthy one.

1968
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,810
See how much the ingredients are.

1969
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,110
For goodness' sake.

1970
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,150
Why are they making me work so much?

1971
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,020
Patbingsu.

1972
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:06,020
I am here
for the patbingsu ingredients.

1973
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:07,750
They are here.

1974
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,020
- Do we need to crush the ice?
- Yes.

1975
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,380
All the ingredients cost two nyang.

1976
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,020
1, 2, 3, 4,

1977
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,190
5, 6, 7.

1978
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,860
14 nyang.

1979
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,460
(Buying all the ingredients
would cost 14 nyang.)

1980
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,730
All right.

1981
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:19,360
Shall I go for a walk?

1982
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,060
Are you going for a walk?

1983
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,560
Lord Yu...

1984
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,440
is going for a walk.

1985
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:25,900
All right.

1986
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:27,580
Shall I go for a walk?

1987
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:28,940
(Lord Yoo goes on a short walk
by himself.)

1988
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,150
Lord Yu...

1989
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,880
is going for a walk.

1990
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,080
How many coins do you have?

1991
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,250
- How many...
- We should go...

1992
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,920
- and get the number.
- Does anyone have three?

1993
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,940
We need to get the number.

1994
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,380
- I have many coins.
- I will use mine then.

1995
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,420
- I have two coins.
- I have some coins too.

1996
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:41,790
- Don't buy a penalty stick for me.
- Okay.

1997
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,880
(They leave as they check
the number of their coins.)

1998
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,650
It's over there.

1999
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:45,830
(Jong Kook calls the servants
to the servant room.)

2000
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:47,060
Let's go inside.

2001
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:48,630
Where did you guys go?

2002
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,630
Hey.

2003
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,060
Everyone is here.

2004
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,290
(Everyone gathers around.)

2005
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:53,690
We have enough!
Let's change the lord!

2006
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,270
(Let's change the lord!)

2007
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,730
(The servants
want to change the lord again.)

2008
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:59,810
- I will chip in one coin.
- Shall I do that?

2009
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:00,980
- Three coins.
- Let's gather them around.

2010
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,000
All right.

2011
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2012
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,080
Please take the scroll and read it.

2013
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,420
Everyone chipped in
except for Jae Suk.

2014
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,520
The new lord will be decided
by drawing lots.

2015
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:11,190
Let's go for the prize.

2016
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:14,150
(Every servant worked
to change the lord.)

2017
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,310
All right.

2018
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,590
All right!
I will make another announcement.

2019
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:18,460
(All right!
I will make another announcement.)

2020
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:21,150
(Again?)

2021
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,020
"Hear this, Lord Yu."

2022
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:25,000
"The servants succeeded
in their uprising."

2023
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,290
"You are no longer a lord.
You have been degraded..."

2024
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,460
"to a servant."

2025
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,500
- Take it off.
- "You will now pick a new lord..."

2026
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,960
"among the servants..."

2027
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,400
- "who contributed to the uprising."
- For goodness' sake.

2028
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,230
Good work, everyone.

2029
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:36,540
- All right.
- I don't care who becomes the lord.

2030
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,150
For goodness' sake.

2031
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:39,840
- This is too much.
- Pick the new lord.

2032
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,340
We all have equal chances.

2033
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,810
- Let me be the new lord.
- Seriously.

2034
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:44,020
- Let it be me just once.
- Let me be the new lord...

2035
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,420
- just once.
- Will it be the last change?

2036
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,790
We don't have the money...

2037
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:48,020
- to change the lord again.
- Jae Suk.

2038
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,880
- It will be the last change.
- That's right.

2039
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,190
There are a lot of coins inside.

2040
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,330
Let's help each other.

2041
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:55,520
- He picked one.
- He picked one.

2042
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,920
He picked one.

2043
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,540
If the new lord
doesn't get changed again,

2044
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,560
he or she will receive a prize
and pick another member.

2045
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,500
(The last lord will receive a prize
and pick another member.)

2046
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,810
- He picked one.
- Who will it be?

2047
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:06,210
(Who will be the lucky 4th lord?)

2048
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,340
Me.

2049
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,380
It's me, you punks!

2050
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,940
(Haha.)

2051
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:14,380
(The new lord is Haha.)

2052
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,190
For goodness' sake.
I have no luck whatsoever.

2053
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:19,750
Why can't I become the lord
just once?

2054
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,960
- Seriously.
- I turned in so many coins.

2055
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,860
For goodness' sake.
I have no luck whatsoever.

2056
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,130
- I knew you had the lord's voice.
- Lord Ha.

2057
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:30,190
Lord Ha,
you know how things work, right?

2058
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:31,290
You should help a fellow servant.

2059
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:33,040
(Lord Ha!)

2060
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,190
Who is this?

2061
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:36,110
Judging by the thickness...

2062
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,480
- Haha got picked.
- I got the position.

2063
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,580
I got the position.

2064
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,940
- He will win the prize.
- I got it.

2065
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,340
He will win the prize
no matter what.

2066
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,670
I said repeatedly
that he has a lord's voice.

2067
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,610
Help him get dressed, you punk.

2068
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:51,980
- Servant Yu.
- Help him get dressed.

2069
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,710
- Hey.
- Why are you... You, you!

2070
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,480
Why are you so insolent?

2071
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:59,130
Why is he so insolent?

2072
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:00,860
He glared at me earlier.

2073
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,730
The outfit suits him perfectly.

2074
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:06,000
He finally found the outfit
that suits him perfectly.

2075
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,190
- He looks so cute.
- "He looks so cute."

2076
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,560
- You look so cute.
- All right.

2077
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,770
- We will eat patbingsu now.
- Okay.

2078
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,040
I am getting a prize.

2079
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:14,400
You are right.

2080
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,170
And one of you will win the prize
with me.

2081
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,310
- That's right.
- Okay.

2082
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:18,900
Raise your hand
if you have beef with it.

2083
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,840
- We don't.
- "Have beef?"

2084
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,040
It looks like you have beef.

2085
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,210
No, Lord Ha.

2086
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,420
I love your choice of words.

2087
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,480
- I love your raw choice of words.
- Lord Ha,

2088
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,960
I guess you didn't read many books.

2089
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,090
Lord Ha!

2090
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:33,330
I can bring back the ingredients
if you give me ten coins.

2091
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:35,400
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am sure.

2092
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,460
I will go.

2093
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:38,560
I can bring back the ingredients
if you give me ten coins.

2094
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:39,900
(He doesn't stop chattering.)

2095
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:42,730
Don't do that.
He will run into a bandit.

2096
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:43,730
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

2097
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:45,210
- Make him run a lap.
- Okay.

2098
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:46,770
Come here.

2099
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:47,940
You don't need to go.

2100
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,650
- Get ready.
- Let's hear it.

2101
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,380
- Get ready.
- Okay!

2102
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:52,920
In place, double time.

2103
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:54,710
Left, left,

2104
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,210
- left... Left!
- He is bad at it.

2105
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:57,750
- Again.
- He is bad at it.

2106
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:58,880
- Set, go.
- He is nervous.

2107
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,980
- Left, left.
- Come on.

2108
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,420
March as you say the number.

2109
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,250
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

2110
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,900
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Make sure we hear it.

2111
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,230
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

2112
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:10,630
We can't hear you!

2113
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:12,270
Say it loud again.

2114
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:13,730
- March as you say the number.
- 1, 2,

2115
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:15,270
3, 4.

2116
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:17,040
1, 2, 3, 4.

2117
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:18,730
For goodness' sake.

2118
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:20,040
(He stops
as soon as he is out of sight.)

2119
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,430
I need to find some money.

2120
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,180
(I need to find some money.)

2121
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,380
(How many coins does he have?)

2122
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,640
Six coins.

2123
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,880
I can't hear you!

2124
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,390
Shall I go and get him?

2125
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,850
I can't hear you!

2126
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:33,260
Someone will need to go and get him.

2127
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,350
All right.

2128
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,430
- Jong Kook, go and get him.
- Okay.

2129
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:38,430
I will go.

2130
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:39,850
- I can go.
- Please let me do it.

2131
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:42,300
- Lee Ji Brothers will go.
- Don't cry.

2132
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,300
(He suddenly makes an offer.)

2133
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:45,390
- Feeling and Intuition should go.
- Yes.

2134
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:48,500
(Feeling and Intuition should go.)

2135
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,470
- Come on.
- Don't make it emotional.

2136
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:52,010
Don't send me away like that.

2137
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:53,680
Feeling!

2138
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,880
- Intuition! Cross!
- Cross!

2139
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,270
- Let's go.
- Why...

2140
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,250
The rest of you should clean up.

2141
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,270
Okay.

2142
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,920
Clean up the place.

2143
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,010
We finished cleaning up.

2144
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,890
- The three of you, follow me.
- Why?

2145
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:07,980
What is going on?

2146
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:09,550
Lord Ha, it's an emergency.

2147
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:10,790
My goodness.

2148
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:12,290
- Doctor!
- My goodness.

2149
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,300
- Lord Ha!
- Suk Jin, please.

2150
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,360
Seok Sam, please wake up.

2151
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,300
Lord Ha, it's an emergency.

2152
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:20,340
- My goodness.
- Doctor!

2153
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:21,690
- I knew it.
- Suk Jin, please.

2154
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:22,900
Seok Sam, please wake up.

2155
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,170
What happened?

2156
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:25,970
- Lord Ha!
- Suk Jin, please.

2157
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,140
Seok Sam, please wake up.

2158
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,680
He was on his way
to buy the ingredients.

2159
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,400
- Please wake up.
- Listen.

2160
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:34,010
- I mean...
- Those jerks.

2161
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:36,110
It happened when I was looking away
for a second.

2162
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,110
I am so upset.

2163
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,460
- He got robbed.
- When I was looking away,

2164
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:42,510
- he got robbed.
- It was a pickpocket.

2165
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:43,590
Seriously.

2166
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:44,890
You know,

2167
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,020
- I was too focused on the road.
- We even met a tiger.

2168
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,260
A tiger!

2169
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,430
What happened?

2170
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:51,000
- You jerk.
- I was too focused on the road.

2171
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:53,430
"Hear this, insolent Lord Ha."

2172
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:54,600
You punk!

2173
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:57,760
"The servants succeeded
in their uprising."

2174
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,760
"You are no longer a lord."

2175
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,080
"You have been degraded
to a servant."

2176
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,540
- Isn't this too much?
- "You will now pick a new lord..."

2177
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,210
"among the servants who contributed
to the uprising."

2178
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:06,470
You know, I have been a lord...

2179
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:09,250
for less than five minutes.
This is too much.

2180
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,220
Be quiet. Be quiet.

2181
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:12,980
He was a lord for five minutes.

2182
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:15,310
In the neighborhood,

2183
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:18,050
- there are so many bandits.
- Seriously.

2184
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,330
- We really ran out of money.
- We ran out of money.

2185
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:21,830
The next lord will be the last one.

2186
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:23,260
- My goodness.
- The next lord will win.

2187
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,670
- Seriously.
- Please let it be me.

2188
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,300
Please.

2189
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,000
- Pick one without looking.
- No matter who becomes a lord...

2190
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,170
- No matter who becomes a lord...
- Go ahead.

2191
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,100
It will be incredible
if I become a lord this time.

2192
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,680
Pick one.

2193
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,470
Please, please.
Let me be a lord this once.

2194
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:36,880
Let me be a lord this once.

2195
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,380
This is the last chance.
Please, please.

2196
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,310
I will make a peaceful village.

2197
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,720
I just hope it isn't him.

2198
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,140
- I won't say anything.
- I just hope it isn't him.

2199
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,750
Who is it? Jong Kook?

2200
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,290
- It has to be me.
- You never know.

2201
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:51,590
(Who is it among Jae Suk,
Suk Jin, Jong Kook, and Kwang Soo?)

2202
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,260
- Can I pick again?
- Why?

2203
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:54,460
- Is it Jae Suk again?
- Is it Jae Suk?

2204
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,020
- Is it Jae Suk again?
- No way.

2205
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,500
- Can I pick again?
- Come on.

2206
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,630
Who is it?

2207
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,000
Is it Jong Kook?

2208
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,670
Gosh!

2209
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:02,730
It's Jong Kook.

2210
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:07,300
(Jong Kook becomes a lord.)

2211
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,350
Kim Jong Kook!

2212
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,640
For goodness' sake.

2213
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,810
I can't believe it. Okay.

2214
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,440
(Here is the thing
about Servant Kim.)

2215
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,010
(The endless roll calls
didn't tire him out.)

2216
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:23,520
(He was a faithful dog
who collected coins diligently.)

2217
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:27,350
(He relieved his work stress
by splitting firewood.)

2218
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:29,150
Let go of me. Just let go of me.

2219
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:30,630
- All right. Let go of me.
- I support you.

2220
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,430
- Lord Kim.
- Give me the hat.

2221
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,560
- Give him the outfit.
- Lord Kim.

2222
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,840
He said he wants to pick again.

2223
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,260
- Who?
- He did.

2224
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,470
- Do you want to pick again?
- No, no.

2225
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:40,640
Shall I take this off?

2226
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,880
Lord Kim.

2227
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,470
Please send us home.

2228
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,180
- All right.
- Can we go home soon?

2229
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:47,970
- For goodness' sake.
- Forget it.

2230
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,590
We are getting so many patients.

2231
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,390
Who is tired?

2232
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:54,220
We would have gone home
had we just eaten patbingsu.

2233
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,090
We are getting so many patients.

2234
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:57,720
We would have been done
had we just eaten patbingsu.

2235
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:59,180
- Patbingsu.
- It's another patient.

2236
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,430
- It's another patient.
- Hey, hey.

2237
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:01,830
- Patbingsu.
- Hey.

2238
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:03,260
- What is up with him?
- Stand in a double file.

2239
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,300
Who do you think you are?

2240
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,520
- What is up with her?
- Who do you think you are?

2241
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,670
What is up with her?

2242
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,000
- Don't bother with her.
- Who do you think you are?

2243
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,800
Lord Kim gave me instructions.

2244
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,010
- You were in the special forces.
- Yes, sir.

2245
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:14,340
You were in the special forces.

2246
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,770
- Line them up.
- That's ridiculous.

2247
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:17,680
- Line them up.
- Stand in a double file.

2248
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:19,010
Stand in a double file.

2249
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:20,440
- Fall into two lines.
- I can't help...

2250
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,010
- but follow the orders.
- Fall into two lines.

2251
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,220
Count off.

2252
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,420
- 1.
- 2.

2253
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,640
- 3.
- 4.

2254
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:27,290
- 5.
- 6.

2255
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:28,460
Say, "End of count."

2256
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,790
- You are seven.
- Say your number.

2257
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,460
Who do you think you are?

2258
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:34,300
Does he think
he is in a position of power?

2259
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,600
He should be tortured.

2260
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,760
- I mean...
- Say your number.

2261
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,830
- Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Okay, sir!
- Got it?

2262
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:39,970
- Again.
- Again.

2263
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:41,060
Without saying his number, he went,

2264
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,500
"Why are there six servants?"

2265
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:44,230
All right.

2266
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,840
Who will go and buy
the ingredients for patbingsu?

2267
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,840
I will do it.

2268
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,180
- Do you have money?
- No.

2269
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,270
Steal the ingredients.

2270
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:51,800
- What?
- What kind of lord...

2271
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,220
- makes his servants steal?
- Steal?

2272
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,220
Yes.

2273
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,480
There is a lot of money
in the servant room.

2274
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,310
- Is that so?
- Shall we go over there?

2275
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:00,350
Shall we go over there
and steal money?

2276
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:03,460
I should receive money
since I became a lord, right?

2277
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,930
I will give you six nyang.

2278
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,550
- All right.
- Red bean paste and ice?

2279
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,130
Red bean paste, ice, and rice cake.

2280
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:11,860
He is good at running errands.

2281
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:14,100
It's like a regular errand.

2282
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:18,300
Ice, red bean paste, rice cake.
Ice, red bean paste, rice cake.

2283
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:20,580
Ice, red bean paste, rice cake.

2284
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:22,710
What? What?

2285
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:23,940
It's the end.

2286
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:25,900
Let's eat it quickly
and get the shoot over with.

2287
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,380
Can we change the lord?

2288
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,310
No. We don't have enough coins.

2289
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,790
- We don't have the money.
- Seriously.

2290
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,760
- All right.
- Where did Jae Suk go?

2291
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,010
- What?
- Where did he go?

2292
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,890
(Lord Kim finds out
that Servant Yoo is missing.)

2293
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:39,150
He is scheming something.
Shall we go after him?

2294
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:40,350
Where did Jae Suk go?

2295
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:45,190
(Lord Kim will surely ask
where he has been.)

2296
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:48,190
(Servant suddenly puts
an A-frame on his back.)

2297
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,390
- He is back.
- What?

2298
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:50,600
(Why is he carrying an A-frame?)

2299
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,670
- An A-frame?
- What kind of setup is this?

2300
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,080
Let's hear it.

2301
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,970
- Let's hear what he has to say.
- What happened?

2302
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,440
Let's hear it.

2303
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,510
Let's hear what he has to say.

2304
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:00,050
What happened?

2305
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:01,350
Will he be able
to convince Lord Kim?

2306
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,380
Lord Kim,

2307
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,250
I buried Seok Sam
in a nice plot of land.

2308
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,110
(Lord Kim, I buried Seok Sam
in a nice plot of land.)

2309
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:10,180
(I buried Seok Sam
in a nice plot of land.)

2310
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,330
No!

2311
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:13,830
- Seok Sam!
- No!

2312
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:15,150
Seok Sam!

2313
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,690
- Overcome it!
- My goodness.

2314
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,390
You promised to be healthy!

2315
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:20,690
He couldn't even eat patbingsu.

2316
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,060
Seok Sam.

2317
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,540
We were almost done.

2318
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,380
He became the crows' meal.

2319
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,270
It's good
that there's one less mouth to feed.

2320
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,380
It's better to have
fewer mouths to feed.

2321
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,440
- It's for the best.
- Yes, it's better this way.

2322
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,750
That's right. Good job.

2323
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,010
For goodness' sake.

2324
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,810
He and I shouted,
"Feeling! Intuition! Cross!"

2325
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:39,390
- He left before you.
- He left before you.

2326
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:41,290
He left before you.

2327
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,430
Okay. All right.

2328
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:44,760
- Can we sit down?
- What?

2329
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,350
- Can we sit down?
- Sit in a single row.

2330
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:47,500
Let's sit in a single row.

2331
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,220
(They overcome their sadness
and return to their daily lives.)

2332
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:50,220
- Is it mine?
- Yes.

2333
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,170
- Seok Sam.
- Okay. Good job.

2334
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:54,540
Servant Song, go and balance...

2335
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:56,840
- the penalty sticks.
- Okay.

2336
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,170
Sit down.

2337
01:14:58,170 --> 01:14:59,470
- Hey.
- What do you have?

2338
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:01,230
Seok Sam. It's Seok Sam.

2339
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,770
- Seok Sam came back.
- Seok Sam.

2340
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:04,680
- Seok Sam came back.
- Seok Sam came back to life.

2341
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,350
- What? It's a ghost!
- Seok Sam.

2342
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:08,270
- You aren't Seok Sam, are you?
- It's a ghost!

2343
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,890
- What? It's a ghost!
- Seok Sam.

2344
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:11,390
(How did Seok Sam come back
to life?)

2345
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:13,310
- What?
- Seok Sam is dead!

2346
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,260
- Seok Sam.
- What is going on?

2347
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,790
- I died?
- My goodness.

2348
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,430
- I can't touch him.
- Seok Sam.

2349
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,800
- Why did I... Why?
- Seok Sam.

2350
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,690
- What's going on with the story?
- Please move on to the afterlife!

2351
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:22,720
Seok Sam.

2352
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,600
(Please move on to the afterlife!)

2353
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,600
We will resolve your resentment.
Please go.

2354
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,000
What's going on with the story?

2355
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,300
(The story changed a lot
while he was on an errand.)

2356
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,600
(Move on?)

2357
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:35,210
- Seok Sam, you are dead.
- Dead?

2358
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:37,270
- What's going on with the story?
- Stop it.

2359
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,550
Stop it.

2360
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:40,110
Seok Sam, where is the rice cake?

2361
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:41,440
- What?
- Rice cake.

2362
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,610
- It's here.
- Lord Kim.

2363
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,790
- Is it underneath?
- It's too little.

2364
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:46,420
How did you get rice cake?

2365
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,390
Of course I got rice cake.

2366
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:50,180
Here is the machine.

2367
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,520
Bring it here.

2368
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:53,720
- Spin it.
- Watch your hands.

2369
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,550
The ice is getting crushed.

2370
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,600
- It's working.
- You are doing well.

2371
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:00,000
- Add the red bean paste.
- Add it.

2372
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,300
Okay. Put it here.

2373
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,390
(They put the patbingsu
in front of Lord Kim.)

2374
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:04,670
- My goodness.
- I went and got the ingredients.

2375
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,210
(The last meal of the day
is patbingsu.)

2376
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:07,540
- It looks delicious.
- Seriously.

2377
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,680
I really want to eat it.

2378
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,900
- The texture must be different.
- I am thirsty.

2379
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,420
- Is it tasty?
- The texture must be different.

2380
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,390
He used the old-fashioned machine.

2381
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:17,510
Are you okay?

2382
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:18,980
- I know that feeling.
- He has brain-freeze.

2383
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:20,350
He has brain-freeze.

2384
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:21,420
Is it tasty?

2385
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,550
(Lord Kim's review)

2386
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:24,460
I see that condensed milk is a must.

2387
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,460
(They finished serving
the last meal.)

2388
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:26,460
It's a must.

2389
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:29,760
You finished all three meals.

2390
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,500
The lord changed four times
in total.

2391
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,500
(More people will receive
the penalty.)

2392
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,840
Thus, five penalty sticks
will be picked.

2393
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:37,470
- 5?
- 5?

2394
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,060
Practically everyone will receive
the penalty.

2395
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,710
Why don't I give the prize first?

2396
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,400
Lord Kim.

2397
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,270
The prize is Korean beef.

2398
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:46,350
It looks delicious.

2399
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:49,550
Pick a servant who will receive
the same prize.

2400
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:52,590
(Lord Kim and the servant he picks
will receive the Korean beef.)

2401
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:54,460
Look at the color.

2402
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,520
(Who will Lord Kim choose?)

2403
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,190
(Handing it over)

2404
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:02,720
Why would you give it to me?

2405
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,190
Don't pretend to cry.

2406
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:05,360
- Hey.
- Don't give it to me.

2407
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,470
Take it, you punk.

2408
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:08,430
- Take it.
- Why would you give it to me?

2409
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,100
Take it. You will be gone soon.

2410
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,300
It doesn't mean
you should give it to me.

2411
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,710
- Good job.
- Why would you give it to me?

2412
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,640
- It doesn't suit you.
- Don't pretend to cry.

2413
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:16,270
(Whispering)

2414
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:18,180
- What?
- Sell it to me for a cheap price.

2415
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,440
Sell it to you for a cheap price?

2416
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,640
(A dealer tries to take the prize.)

2417
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:25,610
Now, I will reveal the penalty.

2418
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:28,180
The penalty for the lord
and the servants' will be...

2419
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:29,980
doing the dirty dishes.

2420
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,150
- That's such a hassle.
- That's such a hassle.

2421
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:33,800
The batter has hardened.

2422
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,690
I don't like doing dishes.

2423
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:37,500
It will take 15 minutes
just to soak the dishes.

2424
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,560
That's such a hassle.

2425
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,000
You also need to carry the dishes
to a different location.

2426
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:43,900
Do we need to carry them?

2427
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,430
It's a big hassle.

2428
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,210
- It's the worst penalty.
- This is driving me crazy.

2429
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:49,580
I will reveal how many
penalty sticks each member has.

2430
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:53,510
Jae Suk, Suk Jin, Jong Kook,
and Haha...

2431
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:54,550
each have five.

2432
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,810
Ji Hyo has one.

2433
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:58,550
So Min has two.

2434
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,150
Se Chan has six.

2435
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,960
- 6?
- How do I have 6?

2436
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,130
Kwang Soo has eight.

2437
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,330
Eight?

2438
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:07,350
(The final count of penalty sticks)

2439
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,960
Please pick five penalty sticks.

2440
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,000
The names on the five penalty sticks
can overlap, right?

2441
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,930
That's right. One member
might carry out the penalty alone.

2442
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,000
That would be the worst.

2443
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,800
Please don't let it be me.

2444
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,760
I have a high chance.

2445
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,210
Let's go.

2446
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,540
- Kwang Soo.
- So Min.

2447
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:22,600
Don't pick mine.

2448
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,080
I hope So Min and Ji Hyo
get included.

2449
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,250
He picked one.

2450
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,010
- The first one.
- What?

2451
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:29,050
(Kwang Soo got picked.)

2452
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:30,220
Gosh!

2453
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:33,050
(He got picked right away
to carry out the penalty.)

2454
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:35,310
Kwang Soo's penalties
will be forever!

2455
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,830
- Let's go.
- Good luck.

2456
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:38,890
One shot.

2457
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,190
Here I go.

2458
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:41,760
I mixed the sticks well.

2459
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,560
No way.

2460
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,690
What?

2461
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,060
- What?
- What?

2462
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,010
- What?
- What?

2463
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:52,230
No way.

2464
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,840
(It's Kwang Soo again!)

2465
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,350
(The spirit of variety shows
has come down on Kwang Soo again.)

2466
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:58,970
That's so funny.

2467
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,220
Nice, nice!

2468
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:03,390
Kwang Soo is the best for penalties!

2469
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,720
Three more.

2470
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,140
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2471
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,890
- I will mix the sticks well.
- Let's go.

2472
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:09,650
This one won't be Kwang Soo's.

2473
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:11,180
It's unbelievable.

2474
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,050
If all five sticks are yours,
you shouldn't quit.

2475
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:14,130
(Kwang Soo might be able
to monopolize the penalty.)

2476
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,130
- He picked one.
- What?

2477
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:19,760
What? Are you serious?

2478
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,540
- Is it Kwang Soo again?
- Are you serious?

2479
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,540
It's really Kwang Soo's!

2480
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:24,840
Are you serious?

2481
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,510
How is this possible?
It's really Kwang Soo's!

2482
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,400
- It's really Kwang Soo's!
- It's really his!

2483
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,430
(Everyone is surprised.)

2484
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,180
(Even after 11 years,
they aren't used to his bad luck.)

2485
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,710
- Come on.
- It's really his!

2486
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,050
- No way.
- It's unbelievable.

2487
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,550
How is this possible?

2488
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,010
Two spots remain.

2489
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,090
- Getting picked now is the worst.
- It's the worst.

2490
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:41,890
- It must be Seok Sam.
- Please, please.

2491
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:43,050
(He picks the fourth penalty stick.)

2492
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:44,720
- Again?
- It must be Jong Kook's!

2493
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,050
- Again?
- Is it Jong Kook's?

2494
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,260
(Gosh!)

2495
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,930
(Lord Kim got picked.)

2496
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,560
All right.

2497
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,360
(Kwang Soo got someone
to do the dishes with.)

2498
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,800
It's the last one.

2499
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,260
The last one.

2500
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:57,840
Please let me avoid it.

2501
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:00,080
(It's time to pick
the last penalty stick.)

2502
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,300
- The last one.
- Let's go.

2503
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,380
- Please.
- Let's go.

2504
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:04,880
I really don't want to do this.

2505
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,010
Let's go.

2506
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,880
I hope Suk Jin gets picked.

2507
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,610
Who is it?

2508
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:11,510
Why? Who is it?

2509
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:12,920
- Is it Kwang Soo?
- No way.

2510
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,290
Is it you?

2511
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:17,790
Me?

2512
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:19,180
- No way.
- For real?

2513
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,460
Give it to Suk Jin.

2514
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:23,970
(Seok Sam got picked.)

2515
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:26,020
- Yes!
- We did it!

2516
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,140
(Seok Sam always gets picked
for things like this.)

2517
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:28,260
It's beautiful.

2518
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:29,760
Why did I have to pick mine?

2519
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,300
- Do "Feeling and intuition."
- Do "Feeling and intuition."

2520
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:34,380
- Feeling! Cross!
- Intuition! Cross!

2521
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:37,680
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

2522
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:38,880
Thank you.

2523
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,850
There are so many dishes
with the batter.

2524
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:42,610
We can finish it quickly.

2525
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:46,650
How did I end up working
with servants?

2526
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:48,850
Jong Kook, it's over.

2527
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:50,330
I stooped to the servants' level.

2528
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,630
We ate so much.

2529
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:54,190
I don't want to do the dishes.

2530
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:57,890
(Suk Jin takes the initiative
for the first time in a long while.)

2531
01:20:58,190 --> 01:20:59,670
Then you rinse it.

2532
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:01,040
(They wash the dishes diligently.)

2533
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:04,340
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

2534
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,770
This might be your last penalty.

2535
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,270
Seriously.

2536
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:12,680
How many weeks remain?

2537
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,850
I think this is his last penalty.

2538
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:17,610
His last episode
might not have a penalty.

2539
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:19,610
Kwang Soo,
this is your last penalty.

2540
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:22,010
- Seriously.
- That might be the case.

2541
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,220
- Really?
- I think this is his last penalty.

2542
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:27,800
His last episode...
I doubt it would have a penalty.

2543
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,470
Today's penalty...

2544
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:31,860
makes me happy for some reason.

2545
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,390
Don't say stuff like that.

2546
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,930
Why are you making things awkward?

2547
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,470
- It's nice...
- Don't say stuff like that.

2548
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:41,040
to join Kwang Soo's last penalty.

2549
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,880
(Without a word,)

2550
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:52,220
(they carry on as if it's a part
of their daily lives.)

2551
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:56,550
(11 years ago,)

2552
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:58,220
- I don't know what to say.
- Hello.

2553
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:59,650
I am Lee Kwang Soo.

2554
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,960
I am 26 years old. I will work hard.

2555
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,970
(Kwang Soo was in his mid-20s.)

2556
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:07,340
(11 years have passed,)

2557
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:11,010
(and he is now in his late-30s.)

2558
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,150
Thank you so much.

2559
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,170
(The last story...)

2560
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:40,430
I am sorry.

2561
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:43,430
(Kwang Soo wants to tell)

2562
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,800
(Goodbye, Our Special Brother)
