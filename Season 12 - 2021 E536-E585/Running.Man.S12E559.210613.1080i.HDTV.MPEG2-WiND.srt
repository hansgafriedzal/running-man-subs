1
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,760
(When someone's leaving,)

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,640
(you get together at a certain place
to say goodbye.)

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,710
(It's called a send-off.)

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,780
(June 13, 2021)

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,350
(Lee Kwang Soo's last day
on Running Man)

6
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,620
(A day)

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,050
(A month)

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,350
(A year)

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,260
(10 years)

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,370
(He's been with us
for 10 years and 338 days.)

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,130
(Even without Kwang Soo,
Running Man's time,)

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,730
(Running Man's betrayal,)

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,480
(Running Man's jokes,)

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,340
(Running Man's laughter...)

15
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,550
(will continue endlessly.)

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,760
(And the joy of each episode
will keep piling up.)

17
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,190
(But we hope
it will always be pleasant...)

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:15,150
(to reminisce about the time
that we spent with Kwang Soo...)

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:23,130
(and how bright those days were.)

20
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,240
(Today, we send him off with joy,)

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,270
Let's begin.

22
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,040
All right. Thank you.

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,070
(but Kwang Soo...)

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,850
(will also have to say goodbye
to Lee Kwang Soo of Running Man.)

25
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,650
- So the last shoot is finally over.
- Right.

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,120
So this will be
your last pre-recording.

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,320
Since this is your last shoot,
we prepared this for you.

28
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,680
Thank you.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,760
(On his last day, he gets dessert
without any mission to accomplish.)

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,900
This is really good.

31
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,460
This isn't product placement.

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,160
- No?
- No, it's not.

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
(He tries hard to advertise things
until the last moment.)

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,300
We are going to do some races
where you can build...

35
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,980
good memories with the members.

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,040
We'd like you to think about...

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,070
things you want
to do with the members,

38
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,990
things you want to eat,

39
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,090
or places you want to visit...

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,150
on your last day on Running Man.

41
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,900
I want to go to the place
where we shot the first episode.

42
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,270
It's the SBS building.

43
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,140
We don't usually get to go there.

44
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,800
- You mean the roof garden?
- Yes.

45
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,770
Actually, it's not like...

46
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,080
I can go there whenever I want now.

47
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,420
And we went to the Han River
many times.

48
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,590
We crossed the river in winter.

49
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,150
And...

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,390
We shot a lot of episodes
at the Han River.

51
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,860
(They rowed across the river
on a paper boat.)

52
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,430
(And they swam across the river.)

53
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,670
I want to go to the Han River...

54
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,200
(They also greeted
two new members at the Han River.)

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,430
whatever we do there.

56
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,560
The weather is nice these days.

57
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
Things I want to eat?

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,240
There was a day...

59
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,300
(Things I want to eat?)

60
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,370
when we shot an episode at my place.

61
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,450
I had chicken soup...

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,020
with the members.

63
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:24,020
(They went to Kwang Soo's place
and ate chicken kalguksu there.)

64
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,800
(They shared the hot soup...)

65
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,520
(and laughed together
on a winter day.)

66
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,030
I think that's my happy memory
about food.

67
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,400
And we recently went
to a pork belly restaurant.

68
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,900
That day,

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,580
I saw the members
enjoy the food a lot.

70
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,970
We've been to many good restaurants,
but that day...

71
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,020
I really enjoyed it too.

72
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,210
(He felt happy to see
the members enjoy the food.)

73
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,490
If it's possible,

74
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,590
(He has warm memories about
chicken kalguksu and pork belly.)

75
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,360
I want to eat pork belly too.

76
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,830
In the same episode,

77
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,090
we also went to the LP bar.

78
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,900
If we go there one more time,

79
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,460
they will like it.

80
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,740
(Kwang Soo only chooses the foods
and places that the members like.)

81
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,030
Personally, I just want...

82
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,930
things to be normal as always.

83
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,110
Just like an ordinary day.

84
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,270
Honestly, that's how...

85
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,090
I'm feeling now.

86
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,610
What?
Since this is Kwang Soo's last day,

87
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,780
we're at the place
where we shot the first episode.

88
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,920
(So today's race is prepared
according to Kwang Soo's wishes.)

89
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,650
- Am I right?
- It looks just the same.

90
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,720
- Hello.
- This is where we shot the opening.

91
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,460
We're doing this
for Kwang Soo's last day.

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

93
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,960
(July 11, 2010,
Running Man's first episode)

94
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,640
(The members look somewhat young.)

95
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,380
(They introduced themselves
in the pouring rain.)

96
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,110
(I'm...)

97
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,610
(a sprout.)

98
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,190
- It rained a lot that day.
- Right.

99
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,480
- It suddenly poured down.
- It rained when Kwang Soo talked.

100
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,650
I think so.

101
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,390
- That's when it started.
- As I said, "I'm a sprout."

102
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,520
(He still remembers
the moment vividly.)

103
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,690
Hey!

104
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,500
- Why are you...
- This is your last day,

105
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,720
but why did you not shave your face?

106
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,920
I didn't see that earlier
because of his mask.

107
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,020
- Hey!
- You can't do this.

108
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,360
- I looked like this last week.
- You should look neat.

109
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,940
I guess it's connected.
He had a beard in the first episode.

110
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,570
- It's not like that.
- You're right.

111
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,400
- You're so meticulous.
- No, it's just for my movie.

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,670
- Today...
- He's not usually like this.

113
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,040
I guess even the crew is sad
that this is his last day.

114
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,340
Let's talk about Kwang Soo.
This is his last day.

115
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
No.

116
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,780
He didn't say a word
when the cameras were off.

117
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
Once the camera was turned on,

118
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,590
he said,
"This is Kwang Soo's last day,"

119
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,520
"so we're at the place
where we shot the first episode."

120
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,690
Say "Feeling! Intuition! Cross!"

121
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,020
- He didn't even look into my eyes.
- Suk Jin.

122
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,090
- Why would he do that?
- Suk Jin, come over here.

123
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,720
- Why?
- Don't stand next to him.

124
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,830
- Why do you suddenly care for him?
- It's not like that.

125
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,030
It's not sudden.

126
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,960
- Kwang Soo, you know how I feel.
- Of course I do.

127
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,270
All right.

128
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,470
Kwang Soo is about to end
his 11 years on Running Man now.

129
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,580
So we should send him out
into the world.

130
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,170
Send him out to where?

131
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,670
- It's not like...
- Into the world?

132
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,170
- I'm getting out of prison.
- The thing is,

133
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,210
For the past 11 years
on Running Man,

134
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,150
Kwang Soo has committed
lots of sins and mischievous acts.

135
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,830
And we should reform him
before he goes out into the world.

136
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,900
So we prepared the Goodbye,
My Special Brother Race.

137
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,350
"My Special Brother?"
They referenced your movie title.

138
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,570
You played Dong Gu, right?

139
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,000
So we analyzed...

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,230
what Kwang Soo has done
over the past 11 years...

141
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,010
- to give him a verdict.
- I see.

142
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,510
And we had a former judge...

143
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,750
who is now a deputy director general
of legal counsel review it.

144
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,040
- He will never be released.
- Wouldn't he get a life sentence?

145
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,520
- Do we have to go that far?
- He will never be released.

146
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,410
Kwang Soo can't get out of prison.

147
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,280
- Please play the video.
- He will be there for life.

148
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,980
First, please introduce yourself.

149
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,520
Hello. I worked as a judge
for about ten years.

150
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,650
My name is Jung Jae Min.

151
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,500
- He's a real judge.
- He's a judge.

152
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,220
Why are you being so serious?

153
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,570
- Is he a real judge?
- He's Judge Jung Jae Min.

154
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,440
- Is this serious?
- Is he seriously...

155
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,070
He's a deputy director general
of legal counsel and a writer now.

156
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,880
We've collected
all the mischievous acts...

157
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,940
that Kwang Soo has committed
over the 559 episodes...

158
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,840
- and classified it.
- Okay.

159
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,400
- Property damage.
- Right.

160
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,770
He committed it 58 times.

161
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,020
58 times?

162
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,950
- That's a lot.
- He destroyed stuff.

163
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,780
(Kwang Soo got carried away
and destroyed a lot of props.)

164
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,520
58 times?

165
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,520
(He even kicked away
the members' belongings.)

166
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,330
Look at what he's doing.

167
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,000
Who do you think I learned it from?

168
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,090
That's really...

169
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,400
And he committed assault 353 times.

170
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,400
I got hit as well.

171
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,010
(He beat the members, crew members,)

172
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,040
(and even citizens.)

173
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,750
He beat everyone.

174
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,270
(He kicked, bit, and hit.)

175
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,540
- He hit Jong Kook a lot.
- I got beaten a lot.

176
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,390
(He used every conceivable means
to get his own way.)

177
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,890
And there's public indecency.

178
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,480
- He committed it 37 times.
- Public indecency?

179
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,690
Oh, right.

180
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,330
- That's right.
- That's what he did.

181
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,400
(He didn't take good care
of his pants during the shoots.)

182
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,700
- That was the best.
- And there's fraud.

183
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,310
- He committed it 1,812 times.
- I see.

184
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,670
Actually, we just stopped counting
because there were too many cases.

185
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,880
Aren't you Lee Kwang Soo?

186
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,310
No. I saw him up there.

187
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,080
(He kept lying and bluffing
with no shame.)

188
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,170
He committed 1,812 frauds
in about 500 episodes?

189
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,610
Kwang Soo is the one
who started forgery.

190
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,960
(He even went through
the crew's bags to forge hints.)

191
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,690
Obstruction of justice,
verbal abuse,

192
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,820
blackmail,

193
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,420
- public disturbance...
- Is this how we send him away?

194
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,150
He's just a criminal.

195
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,720
There are 3,353 cases.

196
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,830
(There have been 3,353 cases
of his mischief.)

197
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,070
Gosh, this is terrifying.

198
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,020
- He looks serious now.
- I know.

199
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,590
So...

200
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,000
he used force...

201
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,010
to take someone down.

202
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,130
When he loses something,

203
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,230
he'd grab something.

204
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,130
If he runs away... That's assault.

205
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,910
It makes him a robber.
It's a serious robbery.

206
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,240
The nature of the crime is
quite serious.

207
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,050
"The nature of the crime is
quite serious."

208
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,780
We were doing a TV show
with a criminal.

209
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,790
If that's the case,
we are all criminals.

210
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,880
In the view of variety shows,

211
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,590
what would be the sentence...

212
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,980
for the crimes he's committed?

213
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,250
Kwang Soo,
you can't leave our show like this.

214
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,390
(He decides the sentence
for Kwang Soo's crimes.)

215
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,430
Considering the nature of crimes
and the degree of illegality...

216
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,390
- And he's done it so many times.
- I see.

217
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,570
Considering all that,

218
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,700
the defendant, Lee Kwang Soo,

219
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,340
is sentenced
to 1,050 years in prison.

220
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,570
(The defendant is sentenced
to 1,050 years in prison.)

221
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,910
- What?
- What? 1,050 years?

222
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,500
- Seriously?
- Take him.

223
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,450
Arrest him.

224
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,640
We can't let him go. Catch him.

225
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,840
- In about 500 episodes...
- In the 559 episodes...

226
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,920
Hey, Kwang Soo.

227
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,950
You're done for. You're doomed.

228
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,110
- 1,000 years?
- Catch him.

229
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,320
How would he serve 1,000 years?

230
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,930
According to the consultation
with the former judge,

231
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,460
Kwang Soo is sentenced
to 1,050 years in prison.

232
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,840
In order to get
Kwang Soo out of prison,

233
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,260
the members will perform missions
to reform and train Kwang Soo.

234
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,680
Before the three reform sessions
come to an end at 6:30 p.m.,

235
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
the members have to reduce
his sentence.

236
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,240
- Over 1,000...
- You have to get rid of...

237
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
all 1,050 years.

238
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,870
- It will be tough.
- If you fail to do so,

239
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,420
you all will get a penalty.

240
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,050
Since this is Kwang Soo's last day,

241
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,250
we prepared various gifts
for Kwang Soo as well.

242
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,380
Really?

243
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,790
Every time you get rid of 150 years,

244
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,590
Kwang Soo will get a chance
to draw lots to pick his gift.

245
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,330
And there will be three venues
for his reformation.

246
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,860
We had a pre-interview
with Kwang Soo...

247
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,230
and decided three places
that he wants to visit...

248
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,630
with the members before his release.

249
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,410
And in order to commemorate
your happy memories today,

250
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,970
a professional photographer
will take photos of you.

251
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,410
There he is.

252
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,740
You will get the photos
at the end of the show.

253
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,180
- We all get the photos?
- Yes.

254
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,560
(The members start posing
for the photos immediately.)

255
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,250
(Actually, the members are keeping
a secret today.)

256
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

257
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,160
Hello.

258
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,330
Is Kwang Soo coming late
since he's the main character today?

259
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,260
Today is our last day
with Kwang Soo.

260
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,890
- Right.
- Kwang Soo doesn't know about this.

261
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,130
He thinks we will start at noon.

262
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,440
- Really?
- So he's getting ready now.

263
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,810
And the crew members...

264
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,810
prepared special gifts...

265
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,100
for Kwang Soo
with the members' sincere hearts.

266
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,780
During the missions,

267
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,050
Kwang Soo will get the gifts...

268
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,820
by drawing lots with your help.

269
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,690
- Really?
- Here are the gifts.

270
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,060
The premium champagne, Dom Perignon.

271
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,220
- My gosh.
- We know that.

272
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,590
And a brand-name hoodie.

273
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,490
- Bal-something?
- Yes. Bal-something.

274
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,330
- That's amazing.
- It starts with Bal.

275
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,730
And a brand-name bag,

276
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,170
pants, a decorative picture frame,

277
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,260
a sound bar, and a bedding set.
This is what we prepared.

278
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,130
But he can only receive them
if he succeeds.

279
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,910
You will help Kwang Soo get...

280
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,840
as many gifts as possible
through the missions.

281
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,950
- We'll help him?
- I see.

282
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,320
You will also have a chance to get
the same gifts as Kwang Soo...

283
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,610
- through hidden missions.
- Really?

284
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,030
- I can get gifts too?
- Then we have a reason to help him.

285
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,460
- I can get a hoodie from B brand?
- Yes.

286
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,030
- Okay.
- I always wanted a designer hoodie.

287
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,090
Throughout today's shoot,

288
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,200
a professional photographer
that we hired...

289
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,490
will take photos of you
using a film camera.

290
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,130
Kwang Soo likes photos
taken with a film camera.

291
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,410
You will be ranked in the order
of the number of photos...

292
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,280
taken with Kwang Soo.

293
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,950
The person in the first place...

294
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,600
will get the same gifts
as Kwang Soo.

295
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,050
That's awesome.

296
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,510
But the person in the bottom place
will get a terrible penalty.

297
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,710
Why would any of us get a penalty
on a day like this?

298
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,480
The penalty can be a hassle
and scary at the same time.

299
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,830
It's crossing the sky bridge
that is 541m high,

300
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,830
the highest in the world,

301
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,720
where you can enjoy
the whole view of Seoul.

302
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,170
Hey, Suk Jin will cry.

303
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,390
- He'll cry again?
- Yes, he will.

304
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,130
Suk Jin, come over here.

305
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,210
(So they started fighting
to stand next to Kwang Soo.)

306
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,100
Why do you suddenly act all friendly
standing next to Kwang Soo?

307
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,940
- You know how I feel, right?
- Of course, Suk Jin.

308
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,540
Hey, So Min, you stand here.

309
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,600
Right, Ji Hyo. Come stand here.

310
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,820
(They all tried to have more photos
taken with Kwang Soo.)

311
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,250
(Likewise, the 7 members' rankings
kept changing.)

312
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,690
A professional photographer will
take photos of you today.

313
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,190
- There. He's taking photos of us.
- I see him.

314
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,190
We'll give you the photos as a gift.

315
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,030
- Will all of us get photos? Nice.
- Yes.

316
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,090
We'll do the first mission
to reduce the sentence right here.

317
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,200
From the beginning?

318
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,670
I'm worried.

319
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,730
- All right.
- Go on.

320
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,130
You've done a lot.

321
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,710
The first mission is...

322
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,940
(While the rankings are changing,
the 1st mission begins.)

323
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,870
Kwang Soo Knows.

324
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,080
(The 1st mission, Kwang Soo Knows)

325
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,140
In 1 of the 2 boxes in front of you,

326
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,950
there are keywords
that indicate a certain time...

327
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,970
such as "this morning."

328
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:15,980
In the other box,

329
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,980
- there are numbers from 1 to 7.
- I see.

330
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,210
Kwang Soo,
pick one out of each box...

331
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,510
and ask a question
to which the same number...

332
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,190
of the member as the number
you picked can say yes.

333
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,620
You must include the keyword
in your question.

334
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,960
That is, you succeed if the number
of the members...

335
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,890
who say yes to the question equals
the number that you picked.

336
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,590
- Gosh, you punk.
- He's taking a photo of us.

337
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,260
- He's taking a photo of us.
- Gosh.

338
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,040
1, 2.

339
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,910
Goodbye, Kwang Soo.

340
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,780
(In the end, they got 1 photo
where all 8 of them appear.)

341
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,280
- Please listen to me.
- Okay.

342
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,320
- Kwang Soo will ask a question.
- Yes.

343
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,010
And those of you
that the question applies to...

344
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,450
will stand up.

345
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,880
You succeed if the same number
of you as he picked stand up.

346
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,380
- I see.
- Okay. I get it.

347
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,980
50 years will be deducted
for each question you succeed.

348
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,090
- 50 years?
- Okay, okay.

349
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,160
- Kwang Soo, you know us well.
- We can just succeed three times.

350
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,830
Since you know us well,
just go for it.

351
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,300
- Be confident.
- Right.

352
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,670
Kwang Soo, please choose
the keyword first.

353
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,170
(Kwang Soo will choose
the keyword for the question.)

354
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,570
Please show us the keyword
you picked.

355
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,940
Thank you. Now choose the number.

356
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,680
(Keyword, Last Night)

357
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,080
(Number, 1)

358
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,920
Now make a question that starts
with the keyword...

359
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
and would apply to that number
of members.

360
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,110
This is difficult.

361
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,250
(The question has to begin
with "last night...")

362
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,710
(and apply to only 1 member.)

363
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,380
Come on! Hurry up!

364
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,960
- Last night,
- Last night...

365
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,300
which of you went to the gym?

366
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,700
Which of you went to
the gym last night?

367
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,040
1, 2, 3.

368
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,090
(He aimed to make Jong Kook get up
as he goes to the gym every day.)

369
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,910
(If no one but Jong Kook stands up,
50 years will be deducted.)

370
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,080
- You failed.
- Jong Kook, wasn't it you?

371
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,600
- Didn't you go last night?
- I went to the gym early yesterday.

372
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm not lying, Kwang Soo.
Believe me.

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,210
- I went to the gym early.
- He didn't go there at night.

374
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,870
- You should've said "yesterday."
- Right.

375
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,290
- But the keyword is "last night."
- He went to the gym in the morning.

376
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,090
- Kwang Soo.
- Why don't you know that about him?

377
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,010
- Why don't you know that?
- He goes there on Sunday evening.

378
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,560
- Drop it and turn around.
- He often goes to the gym at night.

379
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,120
- Hey, you made him a little upset.
- That was disappointing.

380
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,750
It was disappointing.

381
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,490
Is it something
that could make you upset?

382
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,090
Kwang Soo failed this time.

383
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,490
Please move on.

384
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,760
- Try to focus, okay?
- Right. Focus.

385
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,390
- Okay.
- Try to be more cheerful.

386
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,910
Make it look funny when you pick
balls out of the boxes.

387
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,000
Smile a little while doing that.

388
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,210
- Do something like this.
- Exactly.

389
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,230
Make it funny. That's good.

390
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,410
- Yes. That's good.
- Good job. That's better.

391
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,100
- This is your last time here.
- Get as much air time as you can.

392
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,510
Pour out all you have!

393
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,280
(They told him off harshly
for making it boring.)

394
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,420
- Okay.
- Let's go. What's the keyword?

395
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,590
(Keyword, Last Night, Number, 2)

396
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,320
- Last night...
- Last night!

397
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,480
(Last night...)

398
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,960
- They might switch the channels!
- Wait. Give me a second.

399
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,530
They'll switch the channels!

400
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,390
- Just a moment.
- This is a weekend variety show.

401
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,830
What's with this silence?

402
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,200
- They'll see "Boss in the Mirror."
- No, no, no.

403
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,630
- No! Stay tuned!
- They'll watch another show.

404
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,070
- Don't watch that show!
- Right.

405
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,710
- Last night,
- Last night.

406
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,470
(He started saying the question
hastily not to lose viewers.)

407
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,810
which of you skipped dinner?

408
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,010
Which of you skipped dinner
last night?

409
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,450
1, 2, 3.

410
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,050
- You know we would never do that.
- Dinner?

411
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,340
Turn around.

412
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,340
- What's wrong with you?
- All of you had dinner?

413
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,110
- Isn't it obvious?
- Why would any of us skip dinner?

414
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,380
- Hey.
- I didn't get to eat dinner.

415
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,460
- Why?
- How could you skip dinner?

416
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,030
- What's the number?
- Two.

417
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,720
Did you think we were too sad
because of you to eat dinner?

418
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,850
No, I didn't think that.

419
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,200
- I can't believe...
- Let's just drop it.

420
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,490
- It was an easy one.
- I'm sorry. I'll do better.

421
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,720
Okay. Move on to the third question.

422
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,340
Next, choose the number.

423
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:27,410
(Keyword, Last Year)

424
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,870
(Number, 1)

425
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,910
Let's do this.

426
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,340
Let's reduce the sentence.

427
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,210
(He's thinking hard and carefully.)

428
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,320
Hey, Kwang Soo, it's getting boring.
Hurry up.

429
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,420
Got it.

430
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,820
- This is difficult.
- Hurry up!

431
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,660
- This is a weekend show!
- I'm sorry.

432
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,090
Just give up if it's so difficult,
you punk.

433
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,220
- Pardon?
- I said, just give up.

434
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,090
"It's getting boring."
That was funny.

435
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,460
- Last year,
- Last year?

436
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,890
- Okay.
- which of you bought a new car?

437
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,200
Which of you bought a new car
last year?

438
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,670
1, 2, 3.

439
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,260
- What? Last year?
- I bought a new car.

440
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,310
(Expected number of members, 1)

441
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,000
- Success.
- Okay!

442
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,210
(Finally, he got 50 years deducted
from his sentence.)

443
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,810
- How did he pull it off?
- Did you think of me?

444
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,840
Yes, I did.

445
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,580
- The SUV?
- Give him a hug!

446
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,710
I'm impressed.

447
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,970
Give him a hug.

448
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,370
I'm so touched.

449
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,220
He knew it. He picked number one.

450
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,290
And he knew Haha was the only one
who bought a new car.

451
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,020
I had another child. That's why.

452
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,680
- He knew it.
- Hey, come back.

453
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,790
- Stop it.
- Go back to your seat, Haha!

454
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,030
- Hey, hey.
- Why are you trying to make...

455
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,620
- people cry already?
- Don't make us cry already.

456
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,920
- Don't look up at the sky.
- Don't do that.

457
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,190
Don't make us cry.

458
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,190
I pulled it off.

459
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,970
- Don't make it unnatural.
- I pulled it off.

460
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,600
By the way,
Kwang Soo did a great job.

461
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,860
You could be released
from prison alive.

462
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,540
You can eat tofu to celebrate it.

463
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,780
Get more years deducted, Kwang Soo.
Please.

464
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,310
(Keyword, This Year, Number, 2)

465
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,670
(Sighing)

466
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,380
I'm sorry to say this, but I can't
watch Running Man this week.

467
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,910
Gosh, it's not that bad.

468
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,350
Are you trying to ruin the show
because you're leaving?

469
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,610
I'm not trying to ruin the show.

470
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,920
(We might get the lowest ratings
on his last day on the show.)

471
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,230
- Why is it taking so long?
- I can...

472
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,690
- I can do this...
- He looks like a donkey.

473
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,000
Could he plan to join
"Boss in the Mirror?"

474
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,120
- Oh, right.
- Could he join the show?

475
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,070
- Why would they accuse me of that?
- Are you leaving our show...

476
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,630
- to join another show?
- I bet it's "Boss in the Mirror..."

477
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,070
seeing that you look like a donkey.

478
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,660
- What's this?
- I'm upset.

479
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
- I'll do better this time.
- Try to pick a large number.

480
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,900
- I'll do it faster from now on.
- Use your sense of humor.

481
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,340
- This year,
- This year.

482
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,050
which of you haven't won
any awards yet?

483
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,110
- Not like a toy?
- A real award given at a ceremony.

484
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,220
- A real award?
- Like a prize?

485
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,720
No awards ceremonies have been held
as it's the beginning of the year.

486
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,590
Now turn around.

487
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,380
- Okay!
- Five of us stood up.

488
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,020
- A real award?
- Yes, a real award.

489
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,850
This year, has anyone driven?

490
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,880
- Okay!
- Six of us got up.

491
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
(He continued the momentum
and succeeded again.)

492
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,560
- I do but I don't have a car.
- Kwang Soo.

493
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,890
- That one was heart-warming.
- Because you don't have a car?

494
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,360
It was heart-warming. Good job.

495
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,770
I admit it was a good one.

496
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,160
- It was heart-warming.
- Indeed.

497
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
Kwang Soo, it was heart-warming.

498
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,340
- As a result,
- Yes.

499
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,400
he got exactly 150 years deducted,

500
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,430
he's going to choose gifts
at random.

501
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,480
(He gets a chance every time he gets
150 years deducted.)

502
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,550
- Right now?
- Yes, we'll begin now.

503
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,480
The first gift is a designer bag.

504
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,640
1 of the 2 eggs is raw,
and the other is boiled.

505
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,220
You'll receive the gift
if you pick the hard-boiled egg.

506
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,950
You will get nothing
if you pick the raw egg.

507
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,790
- It's hard to figure out.
- Kwang Soo, go for it.

508
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,850
- Kwang Soo.
- Go ahead.

509
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,000
Kwang Soo, pick one.

510
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,350
- I choose this one.
- Good. I would choose that one too.

511
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,620
- Break it on your forehead.
- I picked the same one.

512
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,270
- Me too.
- I'm worried since I picked it too.

513
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,340
Let's stay away from him.

514
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,840
- I picked it too, Kwang Soo.
- Come on.

515
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,860
- I picked the same one.
- If that's a hard-boiled egg...

516
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,040
If it's a hard-boiled egg, he'll get
the designer bag right away.

517
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
- Right away?
- Yes.

518
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,780
- I had a good feeling about it.
- Let's go.

519
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,250
(Breaking the egg)

520
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,010
- That's amazing.
- Oh, my.

521
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,550
- This can't be right.
- He's already reformed.

522
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,940
- It's hard to believe.
- Hey, you're leaving the show.

523
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,610
- You should've failed.
- People will switch the channel.

524
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,050
You got the designer bag.

525
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,560
Okay!

526
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,060
- Hey, this is not right.
- Hey.

527
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,330
- You should've chosen to be funny.
- People will switch the channel.

528
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,350
- I was just...
- What's wrong with you?

529
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,500
Kwang Soo told us about the food...

530
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,190
he wanted to eat with you guys
before going back to society.

531
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,030
We'll move to the location
to eat it.

532
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,030
- Let's go!
- Okay.

533
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,300
Kwang Soo, please change
into a prison uniform.

534
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,360
A prison uniform?

535
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,970
I didn't know that there was food
that he wanted to eat with us.

536
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,310
(A prison uniform has been prepared
for him.)

537
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,130
Jae Suk, can you drive?

538
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,340
Of course. I'll drive.

539
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,020
Jae Suk, why would you hop
on my back?

540
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,410
(He'll drive Kwang Soo
instead of a car.)

541
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,550
- Why?
- When will I get to do this again?

542
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,790
- Jae Suk.
- Right?

543
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,260
Please take me to the driver's seat.

544
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,450
Who will give me a piggyback ride
after you leave?

545
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,620
Are you giving him a piggyback ride
for the last time?

546
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,800
I got on his back.

547
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,300
I know. I was talking to him.

548
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,620
Thank you, Kwang Soo.

549
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,690
That's okay, Jae Suk.

550
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,930
(Kwang Soo feels happy
after his last ride for Jae Suk.)

551
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,570
Did everyone put on their seatbelts?

552
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,070
- Yes!
- Yes, I did.

553
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,480
I drive aggressively at times.

554
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
(They're leaving while chatting
as always.)

555
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,600
- Don't cause us trouble.
- I do that when making turns.

556
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,640
(And Jae Suk is driving as always.)

557
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,750
- By the way,
- Why me?

558
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,680
I realized that So Min...
Did you guys notice it too?

559
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,380
Have you ever seen
a secret royal emissary?

560
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,020
(For the past 11 years,
they felt natural in a crowded car.)

561
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,090
You saw her for the 1st time,
and this is your 2nd time, right?

562
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,730
- Do you have a crush on me?
- No.

563
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,290
(It felt natural
that Jae Suk drove all the time.)

564
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,690
I would even lend you money.

565
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,190
Good boy, good boy.

566
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,340
(Kwang Soo is sitting in the back
because he's a prisoner.)

567
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,360
Don't you think Kwang Soo should be
tied up like a prisoner?

568
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,970
- He should be tied up.
- I'm not an actual prisoner.

569
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,170
How many years do you have left?

570
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,200
- A little more than 900 years.
- We should tie him up.

571
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
(900 years to be released
from Running Man Prison)

572
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,940
By the way, Kwang Soo,
do you really have to...

573
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,640
Think again. You see, this is...

574
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,520
- It's not too late.
- Exactly.

575
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,050
Apologize to the viewers
at the end of the show.

576
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,320
Then he goes back on his word?

577
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,180
- You would be okay.
- That would be funny.

578
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,790
The viewers would understand you.

579
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,830
- They'd just laugh it off.
- Exactly.

580
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,300
"Gosh, that brat."

581
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,300
They'd just think he's playful.

582
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,190
- They'd get mad and just laugh.
- Say it was a camera prank.

583
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,970
Say, "I can't find any better jobs
than this."

584
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,890
"I had so much fun
shooting the special episode."

585
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,360
(It's possible to say it was all
a prank because it's Kwang Soo.)

586
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,010
That would be hilarious.

587
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,480
What are you going to do
on Mondays from now on?

588
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,310
- You'll be bored on Mondays.
- It's obvious.

589
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,780
He'll lie in his bed all day long.

590
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,480
- Come to work as a cameraman.
- Exactly.

591
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,880
- Every Monday,
- He'll be at home on Mondays.

592
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,090
you'll think of us a lot.

593
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,090
(Every Monday,
you'll think of us a lot.)

594
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,090
I know.

595
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,490
(I know.)

596
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,260
I remember our trip to New Zealand.

597
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,420
There's a lot of reruns
of the episodes...

598
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,800
- where we traveled to Hong Kong...
- Right.

599
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,270
Watching it made me miss those days.

600
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,270
Recently, I watched the one
where Ji Hyo, So Min, Suk Jin,

601
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,840
- and I went on a trip to Mongolia.
- I remember that.

602
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,080
When you went to Mongolia,
did Kwang Soo and I go to Russia?

603
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,900
- Yes, you guys went to Russia.
- That's right.

604
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,280
We ate snow crab.

605
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,580
I miss those times.

606
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,910
I miss you already.

607
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,790
I miss traveling freely.

608
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,410
I miss you already, Kwang Soo.

609
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,910
Do you remember
when we went to Russia?

610
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,560
- He was right about that.
- It was good.

611
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,760
Are we going to have
a buffet outside?

612
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,000
- I don't know.
- This is Han River Park.

613
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,160
It must be a good place.

614
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,920
- Where are we?
- We're at Han River Park.

615
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,430
Are we going to eat...

616
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,570
on a cruise ship?

617
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,810
- Could that be the case?
- Will we eat on a cruise ship?

618
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,470
- I guess that's the case.
- Really?

619
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,200
- That's it.
- Oh, really?

620
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,370
I always wanted to eat there.

621
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,170
- Thank you, Kwang Soo.
- I've never eaten there either.

622
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,640
We came here for a shoot many times.

623
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,110
We made a lot of good memories here.

624
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,370
(The Han River with good memories
they made while shooting the show)

625
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,550
Shall we walk hand in hand?

626
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,910
(Shall we walk hand in hand?)

627
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,990
(Since it's his last day, they're
trying things they never did.)

628
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,060
"Shall we walk hand in hand?"

629
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,090
- My gosh.
- Are our hands warm?

630
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,190
(Are our hands warm?)

631
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,260
Yes, they're warm.

632
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,160
(Suk Jin was walking
behind Kwang Soo.)

633
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,530
- Oh, my.
- Suk Jin wants to hold your hand.

634
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,090
This will be a lovely but sad scene.

635
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,340
He's acting like that
because the camera is rolling.

636
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,400
- He didn't see it.
- He just saw the camera.

637
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,010
- Who?
- Suk Jin. It makes me upset.

638
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,340
- What did you say?
- I mean, in the elevator,

639
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,870
he didn't even look at me.

640
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,580
- I'm going to take a photo.
- He said it all of a sudden.

641
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,840
- I'm going to take a photo.
- He's the worst.

642
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,090
- I'll take a photo of them.
- What's wrong with him?

643
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,290
Even now, look at what he's doing.

644
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,830
He's taking a photo of us.

645
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,880
(The photographer already took
a photo of them.)

646
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,950
- He's the worst.
- He always does that.

647
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,120
They look so lovely.

648
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,890
(The last feast with Kwang Soo)

649
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,070
What's this?

650
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,570
Something smells good.

651
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,590
I think we're going to eat
pork belly.

652
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,840
- We'll have a barbecue?
- Oh, we'll eat outside.

653
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,900
We'll have a barbecue.

654
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,160
- What's that?
- We'll have a barbecue.

655
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,170
(Kwang Soo chose the most convenient
and familiar menus.)

656
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,040
- Let's sit here together.
- We'll actually eat pork belly.

657
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,370
- Sit here.
- Kwang Soo, sit in the center.

658
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,200
- Kwang Soo, sit in the center.
- Come over here.

659
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,840
Kwang Soo, why did you take us here?
Why didn't you choose simple food?

660
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,340
- It's not like that.
- Kwang Soo, what is this?

661
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,180
- I didn't ask for this.
- Why must we eat out here?

662
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,590
I didn't ask for a meal outside.

663
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,180
- You see, Kwang Soo,
- Gosh, seriously.

664
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,950
- you should've kept it simple.
- What is this?

665
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,090
- Having a barbecue?
- Why would you make a fuss?

666
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,830
- A bowl of noodles would be nice.
- I mean...

667
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,890
- A bowl of gukbap would be enough.
- Exactly. This is ridiculous.

668
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,630
Why didn't you order some lunchboxes
so we could have a quick lunch?

669
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,970
They all seemed excited
before the camera was rolling.

670
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,160
- What is this?
- You told the staff, right?

671
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,280
Kwang Soo, you should go home now.

672
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,580
- We'll see you next week.
- We'll see you next week.

673
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,870
- I should finish it today.
- Just one more week.

674
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,140
The first menu
that Kwang Soo chose is...

675
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,320
- pork belly with a lot of memories.
- Okay.

676
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,490
The second menu is chicken kalguksu.

677
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,020
- Oh, chicken kalguksu?
- That's good.

678
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,990
- Right. Whenever we visited him...
- Whenever we went to his house...

679
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,290
That's why I chose it.

680
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,030
When Suk Jin and I visited
Kwang Soo's house,

681
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,690
we often ate chicken kalguksu.

682
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,420
It was the first time
Kwang Soo treated us.

683
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,860
You didn't have to point that out.

684
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,740
- My gosh.
- It's true. I won't deny it.

685
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,200
Do you know what the number
on Kwang Soo's chest means?

686
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,310
- What is it?
- 3991.

687
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,370
3,991 days?

688
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,780
- Correct.
- Oh, my.

689
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,370
- My, Se Chan is so smart.
- It's been 3,991 days.

690
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,870
Today is the 3,991st day.

691
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,720
- Since he joined Running Man?
- Then it's been 3,991 days...

692
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,020
- since we joined the show too.
- Since we all joined the show.

693
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,790
- It's the same for us.
- What about us?

694
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,150
- It's been such a long time.
- It'll be 4,000 days after 9 days.

695
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,790
The flame is too weak.

696
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,880
- It's time for you to leave.
- I hope we last long.

697
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,920
- My gosh.
- Why?

698
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,560
I guess he can't stand
any moment of warmth.

699
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,730
Why? What did he say?

700
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,840
He said, "It's been 4,000 days?
It's time for you to leave."

701
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,770
Did you want to do this that much?

702
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,770
(Did you want to do this that much?)

703
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,870
You wanted to have a barbecue
at the Han River?

704
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,810
- Are you happy?
- Why didn't you tell us?

705
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,720
- We could've done it for you.
- You don't even answer my calls.

706
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,750
(You don't even answer my calls.)

707
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,380
- It'll be better than frozen meat.
- Of course.

708
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,290
- Kwang Soo.
- The meat is quite thick.

709
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,110
Look at the fresh meat.
It looks so good.

710
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,950
- It looks delicious.
- It looks good.

711
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,450
You see, chicken kalguksu is
meaningful to us.

712
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,450
(It's time to enjoy the food
that Kwang Soo chose.)

713
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,560
It's cooked now. Let's eat.

714
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,070
Is the meat there cooked?

715
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
Is it good?

716
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,620
(Eating a thick piece of pork belly)

717
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,590
Try the soup first
and see if it's good.

718
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,200
It's good.

719
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,810
It was cooked
before it was delivered.

720
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,280
- Is it good?
- It's so tasty.

721
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
(He's starting
to get emotional again.)

722
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,810
It's good to eat outside.

723
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,170
Kwang Soo, be quiet.
We're eating here.

724
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,170
But Jae Suk...

725
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,720
(Jae Suk cut him off successfully
to the end.)

726
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,840
He's too chatty.

727
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,590
We don't have time
to laugh and chat.

728
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,560
Then why did you...

729
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,680
We don't have time...

730
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,850
(He laughed and chatted
most loudly.)

731
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,680
Think before you talk.

732
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,560
- Gosh.
- It's good.

733
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,090
This is so nice.

734
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,860
We'll start the second mission now.
It's a simple game.

735
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,970
You have to pull the cloth out
without the bucket falling.

736
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,160
Since you got 150 years deducted,

737
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,070
- you'll choose a gift again.
- Right now?

738
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,080
- The second gift is...
- That again?

739
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,430
a designer hoodie.

740
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
This is the best.

741
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
- From B brand.
- Go, Kwang Soo!

742
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,110
- Ready.
- I have a good feeling about this.

743
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,110
- This one?
- Yes.

744
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,610
- Me too.
- I'd choose the other one.

745
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,650
Everyone else chose this one.

746
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,560
- Suk Jin, you've been...
- Why?

747
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,490
encouraging Kwang Soo
by his side unlike you.

748
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,560
I've never seen you like this.

749
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,090
Honestly, I'm most disappointed
by him.

750
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,470
When there was no camera around us,
he walked far behind me.

751
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,270
But he ran to me
when he saw the helicam.

752
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,540
(He's upset.)

753
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,860
Come on. The viewers might think
that's true.

754
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,670
I hope you succeed.

755
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,130
Okay. Kwang Soo, that's the one.

756
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,780
Go.

757
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,940
- Kwang Soo seems quite lucky today.
- Indeed.

758
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,440
I'm sure it's a hard-boiled egg.
It must not be a raw egg.

759
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,580
(Could he be lucky for the 1st time
in 3,991 days?)

760
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,110
- Oh, no.
- That's Kwang Soo.

761
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,680
Finally, he's back to his true self.

762
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,090
- What was that?
- I told you to pick this one.

763
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,650
Right. You should've picked
the same number.

764
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,450
You won't get a designer hoodie
since you failed.

765
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,560
What a shame.

766
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,970
Hey, remove snot from his nose too.

767
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,300
That's so heart-warming.

768
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,090
He's washing Kwang Soo's face.
This is beautiful.

769
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,770
Are you happy
that Jae Suk is washing your face?

770
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,840
Blow your nose.

771
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,100
Oh, my.

772
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,370
(Squeezing his nose)

773
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,100
- Jae Suk, you're skillful.
- Of course. I've done this a lot.

774
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,670
We'll ride a ferry
to move to the next location.

775
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,670
- Are we leaving now?
- Yes.

776
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,820
- Okay.
- Okay.

777
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,050
- You can go up there.
- How many photos of me are there?

778
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,550
How many photos?

779
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,680
(He's checking the number of photos
of him with Kwang Soo.)

780
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,380
(1st, Haha, 2nd, Suk Jin,
3rd, So Min,)

781
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,330
(4th, Ji Hyo, 5th Jong Kook,
6th, Jae Suk and Se Chan)

782
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,350
Okay.

783
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,350
Would you like some coffee?

784
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,860
Is that coffee?

785
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
(They moved to an improvised
campsite on the ferry.)

786
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,340
This is what I like the most.

787
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,860
I'm sitting on a camping chair
under a parasol.

788
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,540
Thanks to Kwang Soo,

789
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,480
- we're enjoying a relaxing time.
- We got to ride a ferry too.

790
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,900
Exactly. We don't get to ride
a ferry many times.

791
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,640
Oh, gosh.

792
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,440
Kwang Soo... My gosh.

793
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,320
Suk Jin is starting it.

794
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,560
Suk Jin, stop gazing at him
like that.

795
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,450
- Why are you starting it?
- Don't do that.

796
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,420
- It's not like that.
- You're trying to make us cry.

797
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,850
Did you ever make good memories
with him on a private occasion?

798
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,270
- Of course, he did.
- Really? When?

799
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,160
I think he played
a card game with him.

800
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,070
(It sounds too tasteless
to call a good memory.)

801
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,100
- Did we?
- Yes.

802
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
- I spent a lot of time with him.
- I bet...

803
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,480
you never let him win
and tried to win more money.

804
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,510
You played cards with him.
I remember that now.

805
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,370
- Right.
- I remember I got double points.

806
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,640
Right. You do share memories
with him.

807
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,820
(Looking around)

808
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,440
Hey, Bo Pil, why are you crying?

809
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,790
I'm not. I had something in my eye.

810
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,020
(Bo Pil suddenly wiped his eyes
while they were talking.)

811
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,950
- Is he crying? Oh, no.
- Why are you crying already?

812
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,650
Why are you crying?

813
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,190
- Come on. Why?
- Why are you crying?

814
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,570
- What's with him?
- Why are you crying?

815
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,190
Bo Pil always cared about you,
unlike the way he talked to you.

816
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,630
Why are tears coming
from only one eye?

817
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,470
- That's an unusual skill.
- What are you doing?

818
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,430
- How do you do that?
- Why are you crying?

819
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,040
- Only one of his eyes is red.
- Everybody cries these days.

820
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,340
Gosh. What's wrong with all of you?

821
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,280
(Imitating a drama scene)

822
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,370
Stop it.

823
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,480
(He's swallowing his tears
by flexing his nostrils.)

824
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,880
Why are you crying? Why?

825
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,880
- They're leaving.
- It blew its horn.

826
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,820
- They're waving at us.
- Bye.

827
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,680
Where is Chan Hee going?
Where is he going alone?

828
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,760
Now he's shooting scenes
without the director's directions.

829
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,470
- Chan Hee is here with us.
- He's here.

830
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,160
(Surprised)

831
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,200
- Chan Hee, I'm sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

832
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,540
- I'm sorry, Chan Hee.
- How could you say such a thing?.

833
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,200
Just because you thought
Chan Hee wasn't here...

834
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,170
- You cut him off at the right time.
- Chan Hee, I'm sorry.

835
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,580
You must never leave us.

836
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,580
You complimented him so much
when he was in front of you.

837
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,870
Please stay here with us.

838
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,490
- Don't go anywhere.
- Right.

839
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,520
- Once you leave, this will happen.
- He's so funny.

840
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,220
- The ferry is leaving now.
- Oh, my.

841
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,650
- This is exciting.
- It's moving.

842
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,830
We haven't done things like this
in a while.

843
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,830
You spent a lot of money
on this episode.

844
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,120
We came outside thanks to Kwang Soo.

845
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,860
(The donkey is happy
as the other members are satisfied.)

846
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,570
Suk Jin is getting direct sunlight.

847
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,340
(Only he is under direct sunlight.)

848
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,970
Look at him.

849
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,240
It's as if he's at a tanning salon.

850
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,700
Nice. I picked the right seat.

851
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,580
- He needs to cover his eyes.
- Gosh, seriously.

852
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,840
- I didn't know he liked tanning.
- How can this be?

853
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,820
- Gosh.
- I see seagulls flying around too.

854
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,940
- Seagulls are flying toward us.
- I see them too.

855
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,180
There's a drone up there too. Look.

856
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,350
Oh, those punks. Right. Thank you.

857
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,120
- Their eyes look scary.
- Look at that.

858
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,590
It has the R logo on the side.

859
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,620
- That's nonsense.
- It has the logo on its body.

860
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,800
I think you should catch it.

861
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,570
- Why would a seagull have the logo?
- One of those seagulls...

862
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,770
I think the mission is to catch
the seagull.

863
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,740
Look. It has the logo on its side.

864
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,660
- Kwang Soo, hurry up and catch it.
- Nonsense.

865
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,930
Only then you can finish this.

866
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,700
It has the logo right here.
Hurry up and catch it.

867
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,630
- That doesn't make sense.
- You might get 1,000 years...

868
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,170
- Hurry up and jump.
- You might get 1,000 years...

869
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,580
You might get 1,000 years deducted.

870
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,280
You can finish it right away.
It has the logo on its body.

871
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,440
- Hurry up and go.
- No way.

872
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,870
We're passing the bridge.

873
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,590
I've never seen the bridge
from below.

874
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,290
There might be the monster
from "The Host" hanging there.

875
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,880
- Since we passed the second bridge,
- Yes.

876
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,090
- we'll begin the third mission.
- Kwang Soo, come back to your seat.

877
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,450
Well... As we continue missions...

878
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,450
(Well... As we continue missions...)

879
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,950
- How many are there left?
- It feels...

880
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,950
I hope there will be a lot of them.

881
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,420
It feels like we're counting down
the hours before saying goodbye.

882
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,570
(The mission will be revealed
while everyone's sad.)

883
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,160
All of you will work together
on this mission.

884
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,360
You will take turns to look at...

885
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,670
an elementary-level
Chinese character...

886
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,170
which you must guess
in three seconds.

887
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,250
If all eight of you guess correctly,

888
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,080
Kwang Soo will get to shed
300 years off his sentence.

889
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,370
- 300 years?
- 300 years?

890
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,640
If all eight of you guess correctly.

891
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,520
- 300 years?
- That's a lot of years.

892
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,320
This is bad. I don't know
many Chinese characters.

893
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,680
- Meanwhile, he knows a lot.
- Him...

894
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,120
Haha, you don't know
what "left" even is.

895
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,560
- I don't know many.
- I don't know any.

896
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,230
- Left.
- The Chinese character for "left."

897
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,590
Doesn't "woo" mean "right?"

898
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,860
- Do you know what "woo" is?
- Left and right.

899
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,160
"Woo" is the character for "right."

900
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,270
Not "woo" and "jwa."
Woo means right.

901
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,040
Woo means right and jwa means left.

902
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,400
- I know that.
- We use it when driving.

903
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,540
(Croaking)

904
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,810
Are you laughing at us?

905
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,340
- Are you laughing at us?
- Seriously?

906
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,370
(Even the seagulls
laugh at the empty heads.)

907
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,640
That one's definitely
laughing at you.

908
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,050
That one's definitely
laughing at you.

909
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,180
It's so annoying!

910
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,250
I've never heard seagulls
make that sound before.

911
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,410
It was laughing at you like crazy.

912
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,560
That one standing over there.

913
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,150
Why are the seagulls
gathering over here?

914
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,950
Isn't that the one with the R mark?

915
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,330
- There are too many.
- What?

916
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,660
- Hold on.
- We don't need an audience!

917
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,840
- That's super annoying.
- We have an audience.

918
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,000
Let's start over on this side then.

919
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,310
Here we go.

920
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,510
- Starting with Kwang Soo.
- Right.

921
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,630
And go.

922
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,400
- 1, 2, 3.
- "Month."

923
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,580
That's right. Good.

924
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,100
- That one I knew.
- I didn't know.

925
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,670
- Don't you belittle us!
- I knew that.

926
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,520
- I didn't know.
- Don't you belittle us!

927
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,250
I knew it'd be on this level.

928
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,680
- 1, 2, 3.
- "Mouth."

929
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,840
Nicely done!

930
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,880
That one I knew.

931
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,260
Those are the only two I know.

932
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,290
Guys,

933
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,650
I got it right!

934
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,150
Did you know that?

935
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,590
What do I do? That's all I know.

936
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,300
Did you see that though?
He didn't seem sure.

937
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,360
- That one I knew.
- Here's the third one.

938
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,730
- "Mouth."
- Haha, you're up.

939
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,740
1, 2, 3.

940
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,840
"Wol."

941
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,970
- "Eye."
- That's "eye."

942
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,270
(Unbelievable)

943
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,240
- What?
- "Wol?"

944
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,430
What on earth is "wol?"

945
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,010
It means "Thursday."

946
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,510
- It looks like an eye.
- That is incorrect.

947
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,220
- Isn't it "wind?"
- He didn't know.

948
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,020
It's too hard.

949
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,680
Did I look cool
when I got "mouth" right?

950
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,990
I knew "mouth" as well.

951
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,180
He changed seats and got caught
with a character he didn't know.

952
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,350
Mr. Empty Head!

953
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,830
- Let's start over there.
- On that side.

954
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,420
- Oh, no.
- The first one must be the easiest.

955
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,970
- Of course.
- We can do this, guys.

956
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,300
Again, it's elementary level.

957
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,090
- And...
- Don't say things like that.

958
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,240
And go.

959
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,770
- 1, 2, 3.
- "Wol."

960
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,040
- Wrong.
- What?

961
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,310
- "Wol."
- Wrong.

962
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,480
(Wol?)

963
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,700
I meant that it's "eight."

964
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,940
- The syllable is "pal."
- It's "pal," not "wol."

965
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,080
Where did "wol" come from?

966
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,440
It catches you off guard.

967
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,170
It catches you off guard!

968
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,590
- So Min, this is bad.
- Shouldn't we protect her?

969
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,090
- Sit over here.
- It catches you off guard.

970
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,060
- Sit over there.
- Then I'd get a harder one.

971
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,350
Let's go with those
who haven't played yet.

972
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,920
- We three have.
- I'll get a harder one.

973
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,120
I got mine right.

974
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,530
All this after getting
"mouth" right?

975
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,530
- Sit over here if you get it right.
- We got it right.

976
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,830
- You should sit over there.
- Right.

977
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,860
Leader of the Empty Head Clan,
sit over there.

978
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,590
We'll start with Haha then.

979
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,570
Haha will go first.

980
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,810
1, 2, 3.

981
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,160
I know this one.

982
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,340
- "Da."
- It's "da."

983
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,740
"Da!"

984
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,030
- "Da!"
- What does it mean?

985
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,700
Why must I say it?

986
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,680
It's just "da."

987
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,970
- It's not correct.
- "Wol" is just "wol."

988
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,640
He at least got "da" right.

989
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,010
- He got "da" right.
- Haha's clueless.

990
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,950
The character means "many."

991
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,280
- Isn't it better to give up?
- Is it "garlic?"

992
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,160
But So Min knew that one.

993
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,120
- Se Chan...
- Hey, come back here.

994
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,620
- No, don't.
- Take this seat again.

995
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,950
- Unbelievable.
- Please don't.

996
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,720
- I've had it with him.
- Don't.

997
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,240
He asked if the character
meant "garlic."

998
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,990
- Wait...
- "Many."

999
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,660
- He's the worst!
- Don't do this on your last day.

1000
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,140
"Does that mean garlic?"

1001
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,740
Stop it, okay?

1002
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,470
- It's not garlic.
- It means "many."

1003
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,850
- Many.
- You thought it was "garlic?"

1004
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,350
- No, Se Chan did.
- Se Chan?

1005
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,910
I thought it was "garlic."

1006
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,470
Like in "many" people.

1007
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,890
I get it now. It means "many."

1008
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,050
Can you give us the one
for "sun" again?

1009
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,220
And go.

1010
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,350
- 1, 2, 3.
- "Baek."

1011
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,660
1, 2, 3.

1012
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,950
It's "Baek."

1013
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,220
"Baek."

1014
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,450
(He heard Se Chan.)

1015
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,720
What does it mean?

1016
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,620
It's 1 versus 100.

1017
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,840
Seriously? It means "100."

1018
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,870
Is it "100?"

1019
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,340
(You can't help but drop your head.)

1020
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,300
- Did he say "1 versus 100?"
- Does it not mean "white?"

1021
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,600
It means "100."

1022
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,740
(He was confident enough
to fight 100 men though.)

1023
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,350
- Does it not mean "white?"
- It means "100."

1024
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,390
"100?"

1025
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,620
- Seriously, 1 versus 100?
- Gosh, 1 versus 100.

1026
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,410
- That was hilarious.
- It wasn't a bad answer though.

1027
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,680
You know,

1028
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,050
you need to protect our dignity...

1029
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,950
so that we can stay on this show.

1030
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,660
Viewers will get sick of us.

1031
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,600
- Let them be adequately hard.
- This will backfire on us.

1032
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,430
What if the viewers
don't want to see us?

1033
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,340
Even those who love us...

1034
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,640
will be appalled
by how stupid we seem.

1035
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,740
They will be like,

1036
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,030
- "How can they not know that?"
- Like this.

1037
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,470
- "Seriously?"
- I don't know any of them though.

1038
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,680
Ready, set, go.

1039
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,470
1, 2, 3.

1040
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,140
- You know this, right?
- 4, 5.

1041
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,280
- Seriously?
- It means "four!"

1042
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,910
- Did you not know that?
- Even I knew that.

1043
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,390
I thought about saying "Saturday."

1044
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,550
- Seriously...
- How is that "Saturday?"

1045
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,550
"Saturday" is this.

1046
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,280
Because there are two sticks
inside the mouth?

1047
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,550
Don't say things like that.

1048
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,600
Kwang Soo, don't show
that you're alarmed.

1049
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,220
You should know this one!

1050
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,300
Seriously?

1051
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,970
Yes, that's "four."

1052
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,740
- He gave you an easy one.
- This is bad.

1053
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,140
How about 5 correct answers
for 200 years?

1054
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,870
- Okay.
- I'll sit this out then.

1055
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,640
- Let's do this.
- Just five?

1056
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,510
(They replay the game
with an easier objective.)

1057
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,350
"North!"

1058
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,550
Nicely done.

1059
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,780
- "Blood."
- That is correct.

1060
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,850
- Of course.
- Seriously?

1061
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,280
"Door."

1062
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,410
(Kwang Soo answers correctly
followed by Jong Kook and Suk Jin.)

1063
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,490
And go. 1, 2, 3...

1064
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,450
- "Fire."
- Nice!

1065
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,890
- That's right.
- Good job.

1066
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,350
- Good job, Ji Hyo.
- Let's end this.

1067
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,050
- I can't believe it.
- She got it right.

1068
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,430
There's no need to even doubt it.

1069
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,890
Jae Suk will get it right for sure.

1070
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,570
- Still...
- Let's shed 200 years.

1071
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,660
"Flavor."

1072
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,820
- That is correct.
- All right!

1073
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,030
- "Flavor?"
- That's 200 years.

1074
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,100
- "Flavor."
- Yes, "flavor."

1075
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,640
- It's used in the word "tasty."
- Nicely done.

1076
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240
That's 200 years off his sentence.

1077
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,340
Good job.

1078
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,530
So 200 years
have been cut from your sentence,

1079
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,970
and now you have 550 years left.

1080
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,740
- Good.
- It's not bad.

1081
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,320
It's currently 4:30 p.m...

1082
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,780
and you have two hours left.

1083
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,910
You'll be playing
for a high-end soundbar.

1084
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,760
- Okay, I've chosen one.
- All right!

1085
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,820
(He chooses egg number one.)

1086
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,660
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

1087
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,030
1, 2...

1088
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,120
- I bet it's a boiled egg.
- Three!

1089
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,120
- All right.
- Nice!

1090
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,890
Good one.

1091
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,030
- You get a soundbar.
- A soundbar?

1092
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,600
A soundbar?

1093
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,240
- Do I really get one?
- Yes.

1094
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,660
(The cruise resulted in
years off his sentence and a gift.)

1095
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,370
Good job.

1096
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,070
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Have a nice day.

1097
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,300
Thank you.

1098
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,070
Gosh, check out this beautiful path.

1099
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,970
- It's stunning.
- It really is.

1100
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,120
- This is amazing.
- It is.

1101
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,180
- It's so pretty.
- Right, Ji Hyo?

1102
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,780
- This is stunning.
- I feel like I'm on a picnic.

1103
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,660
Let's take a photo, guys.

1104
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,590
(They take a photo
between the flowers.)

1105
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,620
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1106
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,160
(Kwang Soo,
let your path always be colorful.)

1107
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,600
- I feel less queasy now.
- I was a little queasy too.

1108
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,200
It's hot today.

1109
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,030
- It's hot for me too.
- Please close the door.

1110
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,600
- The cruise made me queasy.
- Same here.

1111
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,200
I don't feel that good either.

1112
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,970
Just because
Kwang Soo's dropping out...

1113
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,680
If it weren't for him,

1114
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,640
- we'd be doing something else.
- Exactly.

1115
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,740
- You just had to quit the show.
- Tell me about it.

1116
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,140
Take it back and say
you'll stick around a little longer.

1117
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,120
Say this near the end of the show.

1118
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,590
"I'll choose one..."

1119
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,220
"to drop out instead of me."

1120
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,620
That'd be fun.

1121
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,280
- It's very Running Man.
- It'll be like a challenge.

1122
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,350
Wouldn't it be fun?

1123
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,390
"Ji Suk Jin out."

1124
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,890
(Ji Suk Jin out)

1125
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,240
"I'll be dropping out of the show
against my will."

1126
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,870
"We'll be back
after a refreshment period..."

1127
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,100
A refreshment period?

1128
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,600
The time is 5:18 p.m.,

1129
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,280
which means you have
an hour and 12 minutes left.

1130
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,740
In this next round,

1131
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,140
more years will be shed off...

1132
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,470
if you're able
to mimic Kwang Soo better.

1133
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,950
This is Hello, It's Me.

1134
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,450
The one with the phone call, right?

1135
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,590
You will call
Kwang Soo's acquaintance...

1136
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,390
pretending to be him.

1137
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,590
The more you...

1138
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,820
(Call Kwang Soo's acquaintance
pretending to be him.)

1139
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,600
(To win the round,
they must fool the receiver.)

1140
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:11,200
(They'll lose the round
if the receiver figures it out.)

1141
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,070
This won't be easy at all.

1142
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,700
Can you say "Hello?"

1143
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,970
Hello.

1144
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

1145
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,950
- Hello, I'm Kwang Soo.
- Hello, I'm Kwang Soo.

1146
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,180
Hello.

1147
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,070
Hello.

1148
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,510
- Who will go first?
- Se Chan.

1149
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,740
Hello.

1150
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,910
- Right.
- Hello.

1151
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,950
- Hello.
- Sure.

1152
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,160
Suk Jin, are you willing to play?

1153
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,550
I should.

1154
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,320
No, there's no need for that.

1155
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,990
- I should give it a try.
- Pick someone...

1156
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,530
who isn't home.

1157
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,200
- Someone who's outside.
- That's right.

1158
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,720
Someone who's out and about.

1159
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,030
To mask the sound?

1160
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,300
It'll seem less obvious
if other sounds get mixed in.

1161
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,640
Wait. How about...

1162
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,970
I've never talked to Ahn Bo Hyun
on the phone,

1163
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,340
- but he texted me.
- Really?

1164
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,510
- Ahn Bo Hyun?
- Yes, he texted me.

1165
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,930
That's perfect.

1166
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,200
He won't know my voice
since we haven't talked before.

1167
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,350
If you call him...
Yes, he might not realize it.

1168
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,680
What did the text say?

1169
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,010
- He said I did a good job.
- We should know.

1170
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,490
- Perfect.
- He told me...

1171
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,720
to have a good last day.

1172
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,160
- This will work for sure.
- I bet it'll work.

1173
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,780
Even Suk Jin could make it work.

1174
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,890
- Do you want to give it a go?
- Would it work?

1175
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,820
Your voice has been
exposed a lot lately.

1176
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,700
- Who is he though?
- He's an actor.

1177
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,570
(He gives it a go without
even knowing who the receiver is.)

1178
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,800
- Wait.
- Hello?

1179
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,100
(Will Suk Jin be able
to fool Bo Hyun?)

1180
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,840
- Hello?
- I see that you texted.

1181
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,370
Yes?

1182
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,640
(Who is he trying to sound like?)

1183
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,280
Yes?

1184
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,470
You did a good job on the show.
Has filming ended?

1185
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,740
Yes, just a minute ago.

1186
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,740
I congratulate you on a good job.

1187
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,660
Thank you for texting me.

1188
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,550
Please don't mention it.
It was nothing.

1189
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,930
- It was an emotional day today.
- Right.

1190
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,600
- So I'm grateful.
- He's emotionless.

1191
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,700
Please don't mention it.

1192
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,640
Then...

1193
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,970
We should work out together
sometime.

1194
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,140
Sounds good. Anytime, Kwang Soo.

1195
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,240
Where exactly do you live again?

1196
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,410
Seongsu-dong.
I live close to your place.

1197
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,050
That's right next to where I live.

1198
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,700
Isn't this him just
talking to Suk Jin?

1199
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,950
We're only five minutes away.

1200
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,970
Five minutes?
We should meet up then.

1201
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,050
I haven't been
in the best mood these days.

1202
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,720
- His mood?
- Call me when you want to work out.

1203
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,680
Sure thing. Anyway,

1204
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,390
thank you for the text.
I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

1205
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,720
Sure thing. Please give me a call.
Once again, good job.

1206
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,990
Sure.

1207
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,720
Bo Hyun!

1208
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,490
- Hello?
- Anyway, Suk Jin succeeded?

1209
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,800
Right.

1210
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,200
That was Suk Jin
on the phone just now.

1211
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,530
How could he not know?
It sounded completely different.

1212
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,100
- Gosh, well...
- It sounded completely different.

1213
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,100
Just hang up.

1214
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,680
Bo Hyun, that was Suk Jin.
How could you not know?

1215
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,140
- Anyone could tell.
- I thought he cried.

1216
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,140
What?

1217
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,370
I knew it didn't sound like him.

1218
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,720
I thought he sounded different,
so I thought he cried.

1219
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,820
No.

1220
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,820
Even if he cried,

1221
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,320
- his voice was very different.
- Right.

1222
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,910
I know. That's why...

1223
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,120
I was going to ask,

1224
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,780
- Right.
- but I thought he sounded upset.

1225
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,430
You thought he sounded sad,
so you couldn't ask?

1226
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,760
(Bo Hyun let it go
in case Kwang Soo was upset.)

1227
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,430
- Okay.
- Thank you, Bo Hyun.

1228
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1229
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,160
- Thank you.
- He fell for this?

1230
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,300
I started to feel guilty
while I was doing it.

1231
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,070
You fulfilled the maximum time,
so you reduced 300 years.

1232
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,800
300 years.

1233
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,070
That's incredible.
That's really incredible.

1234
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,350
(Thanks to Big Nose,
Kwang Soo's release gets closer.)

1235
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,910
This is so funny. How did it work?
How interesting.

1236
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,680
The quiet that comes after laughing.

1237
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,120
Right. We're really going
to Kwang Soo's place.

1238
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,820
- There's a lingering feeling.
- Right.

1239
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,430
- Right.
- Right.

1240
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,990
(They started at SBS in Mok-dong,)

1241
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,820
(and they are getting closer
to Kwang Soo's home.)

1242
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,100
Suk Jin's sleeping.

1243
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,700
He's sleeping.

1244
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,740
(He was talking about
lingering feelings,)

1245
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,470
(but he fell asleep
as soon as they stopped filming.)

1246
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,970
- Kwang Soo! Congratulations!
- Thank you!

1247
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,100
Kwang Soo! Congratulations!

1248
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,370
(Really surprised)

1249
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,180
(Why are you congratulating him?)

1250
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,470
But seriously...

1251
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,820
I think it's right to do that.

1252
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,490
- Right. It's right to do that.
- Right.

1253
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,120
- It's the right thing to do.
- It was too cruel.

1254
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,550
But still...

1255
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,030
That's the right thing to do.

1256
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,220
- Even if you consider the time...
- Right.

1257
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,030
- So you all agree, right?
- Right.

1258
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,430
- We do.
- Suk Jin...

1259
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,870
How could you decide
like this though?

1260
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,720
- About this, I...
- You have to do it like that.

1261
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,300
I didn't expect such a twist.

1262
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,340
Do you agree?

1263
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,930
Suk Jin, what should we do?
Should we do it like that?

1264
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,340
- Right.
- Then Suk Jin will leave the show.

1265
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,200
(He agreed to leave the show
without realizing.)

1266
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,680
Gosh, Bo Pil, you're really...

1267
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,070
(The members and the staff
are sincere about teasing Suk Jin.)

1268
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,740
- He's so mean.
- For the past 11 years...

1269
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,910
This will be another moment of
Ji Suk Jin's light sleep.

1270
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,280
A moment of
Ji Suk Jin's light sleep.

1271
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,760
- Suk Jin was really surprised.
- Gosh, I was so surprised.

1272
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,320
We're arriving at
the final reformation venue.

1273
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,590
For the next mission,

1274
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,430
Kwang Soo will decide the order
everyone will get off in.

1275
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,890
Send Suk Jin first.

1276
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,200
It's not a bad idea to go
in that order.

1277
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,760
- Shall we start from the front?
- 1, 2, 3, 4,

1278
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,160
- 5, 6, 7.
- Right.

1279
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,870
What is it? I'm so curious.

1280
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,240
I'll put down the foundations.

1281
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,100
Yes?

1282
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,350
- In this mission,
- Yes?

1283
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,350
you can reduce Kwang Soo's sentence
according to how well you know him.

1284
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,240
It's the Lee Kwang Soo
Aptitude Test.

1285
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,280
Right.

1286
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,050
All seven members will answer
a question about Lee Kwang Soo,

1287
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,850
and for each member
who gets it right,

1288
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,720
Kwang Soo's sentence
will be reduced by 40 years.

1289
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,030
They're questions about Kwang Soo?

1290
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,260
As of this moment,
the remaining sentence is 250 years.

1291
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,530
If all seven members
answer correctly,

1292
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:08,470
the mission will end right away.

1293
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,600
Okay.

1294
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,470
(Meanwhile, the other members
wait for their turns.)

1295
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,410
(Looking)

1296
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:18,700
Do I have to divide everything
I did with Kwang Soo?

1297
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,950
(Now that they arrive
at the final destination...)

1298
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,370
I don't know anymore.

1299
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,140
"I don't know."
You just have to do it.

1300
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,850
The next person can go out now.

1301
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,120
- Haha.
- It's Haha.

1302
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,220
I can do it!

1303
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,820
You can do it!

1304
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,890
Haha is on his way.

1305
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,720
- Ji Hyo. You can do it!
- I'll see you in a bit!

1306
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,990
You can do it!

1307
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,030
- Song Ji Hyo. You can do it!
- You can do it!

1308
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,990
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

1309
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,370
(As each member leaves,)

1310
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,490
Okay.

1311
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,910
(the inside of the bus
is filled with silence.)

1312
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,970
This is the final destination!

1313
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,970
(It's the final destination!)

1314
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,510
Gosh, Jong Kook.
Don't look at him like that!

1315
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,090
Let's go. Okay.

1316
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,590
(They spent the day laughing,
but as the end draws near...)

1317
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,990
They say
it's better to get it over with...

1318
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,180
(The word "last"
feels more real to them.)

1319
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:11,320
(They take a photo while they wait
for their turn.)

1320
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:15,240
(They spent the past
11 years together,)

1321
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,760
(and in the future,
today will become a distant memory.)

1322
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:25,470
(We will now start the final trip
down memory lane with Kwang Soo.)

1323
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,100
- Was it hard?
- Mine was hard.

1324
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,550
What was your question?

1325
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,780
What?

1326
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,490
- Were all the questions different?
- I think they're all different.

1327
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,720
There he is.

1328
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,280
Hold on.

1329
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,820
Why do you keep playing this song?

1330
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,950
We can't hear this song anymore.

1331
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,530
We can't hear this song anymore.

1332
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,590
(Kwang Soo's theme song
is played for this special day.)

1333
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,260
- Come in.
- Come in.

1334
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,660
This song is very sad.

1335
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,490
Gosh, it's Kwang Soo's last day.

1336
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,100
My gosh, it's so sad.

1337
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,070
- As you all know,
- Yes?

1338
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,600
you all received a question about
Kwang Soo as you got off the bus.

1339
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,680
- Right.
- Right.

1340
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,550
The first person to get off the bus
was Suk Jin.

1341
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,600
(The 1st runner is Suk Jin.)

1342
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,010
His question asked
what Kwang Soo's debut project was.

1343
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,050
(What was
Kwang Soo's debut project?)

1344
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,410
I don't think I got it right.

1345
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,820
Kwang Soo,
what project did you debut with?

1346
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,220
"Here He Comes."

1347
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:10,990
- "Here He Comes?"
- "Here He Comes."

1348
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,780
- That one was hard.
- That's hard.

1349
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,320
The first question was hard.

1350
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,620
I don't think he got it right.

1351
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,030
He didn't get it right.

1352
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,120
He couldn't have gotten it right.

1353
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,600
- Right.
- I was in...

1354
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,890
"High Kick Through The Roof."

1355
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,160
Was it "High Kick Through The Roof?"

1356
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,140
- The first...
- How do you really feel?

1357
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,340
- 191cm.
- Right.

1358
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,930
- 300mm.
- 290mm.

1359
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,140
- 290mm.
- 290mm.

1360
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,640
(What's Lee Kwang Soo's height
and shoe size?)

1361
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,680
(Height 191cm, Shoe size 290mm,
Height 192cm, Shoe size 300mm)

1362
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,100
- He got it wrong.
- He was off by 1cm.

1363
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,910
1cm and 10mm.

1364
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,240
- You wear 300mm.
- He was wrong.

1365
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,780
There's a toe that's more rotten.

1366
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,090
The main one.

1367
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:41,390
- Right. That's why...
- The right toe.

1368
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,010
- What is the answer?
- My right toe.

1369
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,660
- That's right.
- It's his right toe.

1370
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,260
- He used to paint it.
- Back in the day.

1371
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,760
- I changed it.
- It's his right toe.

1372
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,820
We used to color it
with a permanent marker.

1373
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,760
Nobody got a single question right.

1374
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,320
Next up is Yoo Jae Suk.

1375
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,340
What's Kwang Soo's father's name?

1376
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,260
I had a hard time remembering.

1377
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,470
Did you remember?

1378
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:00,800
If you get this right,
it would be unbelievable.

1379
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,870
It was a long time ago.

1380
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,470
- Can you tell us his name first?
- I believe that this is his name.

1381
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,950
(What is
Lee Kwang Soo's father's name?)

1382
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,490
- "Lee Jong Ho?"
- What is his name?

1383
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,090
His name is Lee Jong Ho.

1384
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,220
- Did I get it right?
- You got it right!

1385
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,490
(He's surprised too.)

1386
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:28,430
How do you remember the names
of celebrities' fathers?

1387
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,260
- It's like "TV Brings Love."
- Am I right?

1388
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,890
Doesn't it seem like
"TV Brings Love?"

1389
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,300
- That's incredible.
- That's right.

1390
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,490
That's his name!

1391
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:36,700
- Right.
- Am I right? Is this his name?

1392
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,140
- I think you're right.
- It's like "TV Brings Love."

1393
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,800
How did you know?

1394
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,880
- Are you crying?
- Are you crying?

1395
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,010
Kwang Soo...

1396
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,510
- Are you crying?
- All of a sudden?

1397
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,700
Why are you crying?

1398
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,380
- Why are you crying so suddenly?
- This isn't the right timing.

1399
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,180
- Why are you crying?
- Why are you crying?

1400
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,110
- He said your father's name.
- Why are you crying?

1401
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,450
- His father was mentioned.
- His father.

1402
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:54,610
He thought of his father.

1403
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:57,160
- He was a part of Running Man too.
- That's right.

1404
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,930
- His father was on the show too.
- Right.

1405
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:01,700
Hello, sir.

1406
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,390
He hits me
even when there aren't any cameras.

1407
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,590
(He is a special guest who joined us
a few times with his kind smile.)

1408
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,200
I saw that you got hit
3 or 4 times yesterday too.

1409
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,660
- Really?
- He was improvising.

1410
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,090
- How did you...
- But this...

1411
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,840
(Jae Suk remembered his name.)

1412
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,740
If this is the case,
I know Suk Jin's father's name...

1413
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,180
as well as Kwang Soo's father.

1414
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,950
- Right.
- I must memorize everyone's names.

1415
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,840
- Next was Jong Kook.
- Right.

1416
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,780
He wrote the answer down
the fastest.

1417
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,780
Really?

1418
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,240
- I wrote it as soon as I heard it.
- He really did.

1419
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,510
What's the design
of Kwang Soo's bike?

1420
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,990
Zebra.

1421
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,280
- That's correct.
- Right.

1422
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,780
- The answer is?
- Zebra.

1423
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,890
- Of course.
- He's seen it.

1424
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,760
I know what it looks like.
It's hard for me not to know.

1425
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,890
I've seen it before.

1426
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,160
We went cycling together...

1427
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,640
and rode around the Han River
for four hours.

1428
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,530
His sofa has a zebra print too.

1429
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:46,910
- Right. It's zebra.
- Right.

1430
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:48,510
- His underwear is zebra print too.
- His underwear too.

1431
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:53,180
What's the title of the movie
that Kwang Soo is filming right now?

1432
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:55,510
- "Happy New Year."
- "Happy New Year."

1433
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,510
Please show us what you wrote.

1434
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,890
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

1435
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,910
- It's because she's an actress.
- She got it right.

1436
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:03,760
- That's right.
- Thank you. I'm touched.

1437
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:05,590
This is the last question.

1438
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:09,220
It was "What is
Lee Kwang Soo's phone number?"

1439
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,320
- What?
- This is hard.

1440
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,630
- This is hard.
- This is really hard.

1441
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,320
- Nobody memorizes numbers anymore.
- Right.

1442
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,200
If he gets
four consecutive numbers right,

1443
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,660
we will count that as correct.

1444
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,140
- Let's look at your answer.
- Okay.

1445
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,240
Out of the eight numbers?

1446
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,300
010-2753-8...

1447
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,140
I've never even heard
of this number before.

1448
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,300
(I've never heard of this number.)

1449
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,410
Seriously.

1450
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,780
(The touching moment is ruined.)

1451
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,820
I seriously... Gosh, this is...

1452
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,320
My tears just dried up.

1453
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,160
He didn't get
a single number correct.

1454
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,360
- I thought it was right.
- Me too.

1455
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,490
He sounded so confident.

1456
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,720
Why were you so confident?

1457
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,050
It's not even close.

1458
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,390
I'm sorry.
I always look up your name.

1459
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,590
- My tears dried up too.
- Isn't this too hard?

1460
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,570
As a result,
you got three questions right.

1461
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:53,470
For each question, you got 40 years,
so it will be reduced by 120 years.

1462
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,470
- How many years do we have left?
- How much is left?

1463
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:58,180
You guys have 130 years left,
and the current time is...

1464
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:01,280
It just turned 5:59 p.m.

1465
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,880
- That means Kwang Soo...
- Then Kwang Soo...

1466
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,050
will be imprisoned.

1467
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,240
- He can just go in right now.
- Right.

1468
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,390
If you combine what you got
on the bus,

1469
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:12,930
you get a total of three chances
to choose gifts at random.

1470
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,130
What is it this time?

1471
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,490
This time, it is a pair
of trendy and expensive pants.

1472
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,320
- What's trendy and expensive?
- What is trendy?

1473
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,070
I think these pants
might be from a popular brand.

1474
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,240
I hope you win today.

1475
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,360
- I hope you win.
- Seriously. We're being serious.

1476
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,010
- The right one?
- Yes. Go ahead.

1477
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,780
This might be a splash.

1478
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,840
(If it's a hard-boiled egg,
he gets a pair of expensive pants.)

1479
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,070
You have to hit it on your forehead.

1480
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,410
(Hard-boiled egg)

1481
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:37,740
(Kwang Soo is doing well today.
He gets a pair of nice pants.)

1482
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,110
- An expensive bedding set.
- Go ahead.

1483
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,390
(Another hard-boiled egg?)

1484
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,820
Did you see that?
Why is he doing so good today?

1485
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,160
(He exceeds everyone's expectations
and gets the bedding too.)

1486
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:51,700
Hey. It's your favorite, champagne.

1487
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,590
- You'll get a lot of gifts today.
- You can do it.

1488
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,360
(He gets another hard-boiled egg.)

1489
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,570
- What's with him today?
- I can't believe it.

1490
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:03,280
- Gosh, this is...
- I can't believe it.

1491
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,110
Aren't they both hard-boiled eggs?
I can't believe this.

1492
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,880
- You can tell when you spin it.
- What's with you both?

1493
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,470
- See?
- You're right.

1494
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:10,240
Raw eggs don't spin.

1495
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,220
Right. These are raw eggs.

1496
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,180
- You're right.
- Hard-boiled eggs spin.

1497
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,050
- Raw eggs don't.
- This one doesn't.

1498
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,360
Now that it's time
for Kwang Soo to leave,

1499
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,550
his luck is going back to normal.

1500
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,930
Hey, Bo Pil,
why are you putting your head down?

1501
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,720
As a result you were successful
all three times.

1502
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,200
- See?
- No way.

1503
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,070
- He got it all.
- You're incredibly lucky today.

1504
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,240
As a result,
you have about 20 minutes left.

1505
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,200
The time you have left is 130 years.

1506
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,410
I'll give you the mission
to take care of the 130 years.

1507
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:40,240
In this mission,
Unlucky Kwang Soo's soulmate,

1508
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,910
the pirate, must come out
to get rid of the remaining years.

1509
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,390
My Last Pirate Roulette.

1510
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,050
- It has to come out?
- My Last Pirate Roulette.

1511
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,890
When you stab the pirate
with the knife,

1512
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,950
you will get 150 years reduced
if you get it on the 1st try,

1513
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,130
140 years reduced if you get it
on the 2nd try,

1514
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:55,200
130 years on the 3rd try,
and 120 years on the 4th try.

1515
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,360
We will continue
until the 8th player like this.

1516
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:59,890
Once the 8th player has gone,

1517
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,840
the pirate gets reset,
and you can try again.

1518
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,570
- However, that much time will pass,
- Right.

1519
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,300
and if that's the case,

1520
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,610
you may not get rid of it all
within 20 minutes.

1521
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,410
It will be best for you to hurry.

1522
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:13,410
Let's hurry.

1523
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:14,640
I'll give it to you.

1524
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,570
It's 150 years
if I get it on my 1st try?

1525
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,890
It's impossible to do that.

1526
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,950
- You've done it before.
- You have.

1527
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,760
It would be cool if you do it
at the last moment and leave.

1528
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,450
- Right.
- Did the spirit of variety shows...

1529
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,530
come at the end?

1530
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,630
- Don't be burdened.
- I don't know.

1531
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:32,630
- I'll just...
- Right. It's impossible.

1532
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,090
(It popped out!)

1533
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,740
It popped out!

1534
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,160
(He succeeded on the first try.)

1535
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,470
- Kwang Soo... You...
- Hey.

1536
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,610
- Does this make sense?
- You're insane.

1537
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,910
This isn't a lie.

1538
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:45,970
Really?

1539
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,280
- Did you mark it?
- You can't mark it.

1540
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,380
You don't know where it would be.
Every time...

1541
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,180
I don't think they'll believe this.

1542
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,640
Because it's random...

1543
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,390
No, there's nothing here.

1544
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,780
Don't go!

1545
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,990
Does this make sense?

1546
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,390
Just don't go!

1547
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,260
Why are you leaving
when you're like this?

1548
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,160
There really is
a spirit of variety shows!

1549
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,300
Seriously.

1550
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,200
The person behind us
must be surprised too.

1551
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,360
- Weren't you surprised?
- He looks really surprised.

1552
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,660
- You saw everything, right?
- We didn't plan this, right?

1553
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,800
- Does this make sense?
- How does this make sense?

1554
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,410
It doesn't make sense,
but with 12 minutes left, at 6:18 p.m.,

1555
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,680
Lee Kwang Soo is released
after serving his full sentence.

1556
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,220
- Does this make sense?
- The expression sounds a bit...

1557
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,570
- Does this make sense?
- He's being released.

1558
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,820
There must be ghosts.

1559
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,280
- Seriously.
- I'm at a loss for words.

1560
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,320
It's so scary.

1561
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,780
Are we just letting him go?
Or are we clinging onto him?

1562
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,590
- We're being cool.
- We're being cool, right?

1563
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,950
- This is your last gift.
- I have chills.

1564
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,860
When will you get to do this again?

1565
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,260
- At this timing,
- You should go.

1566
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,990
it's time to let things explode.

1567
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:41,300
You got everything but the hoodie.

1568
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,840
Okay.

1569
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,070
- It's the trendy decorative frame.
- A frame.

1570
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,510
- Okay.
- A frame.

1571
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:49,010
it will look really pretty
in your home.

1572
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,840
- Look at that.
- In the end, this happened.

1573
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,840
(Raw egg)

1574
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,490
(The spirit of variety shows made
the perfect timing for this song.)

1575
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:02,410
So this is how
the spirit of variety shows...

1576
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,110
sends Kwang Soo off in the end.

1577
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,180
He did this for you.

1578
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,130
(Cracking)

1579
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,260
(The last hard-boiled egg
doesn't get chosen by Kwang Soo.)

1580
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,090
- That's right.
- As a result,

1581
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,990
the gifts
that Kwang Soo received are...

1582
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:18,410
a bag, sound bar, pants, bedding,
and champagne.

1583
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,640
(A bag, sound bar, pants, bedding,
and champagne)

1584
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,430
You weren't unlucky today.

1585
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,070
- This...
- You were blessed.

1586
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,640
In any case, you got rid of
all 1,050 years of the sentence.

1587
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,740
- Right.
- Right.

1588
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,950
The photos we took today
have been printed...

1589
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,090
- and are on their way. Yes.
- Are they?

1590
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:34,220
In the meanwhile,
since we're at an LP bar,

1591
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,680
each of you can write a message,

1592
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,860
and we can listen to some songs.

1593
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,680
Since one song per person
is too many,

1594
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,450
the four older guys
will request one song,

1595
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,200
and Ji Hyo
and the two youngest members...

1596
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,760
will request a song.

1597
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,640
- Let's make it light.
- Of course.

1598
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,660
We need to make it light.

1599
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,640
- We'll make it light, okay?
- Right.

1600
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,110
(The older guys hate things
that make them cringe.)

1601
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,240
(While they all start
to write carefully,)

1602
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,140
- It's already...
- 30?

1603
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:06,890
(the LP bar owner
begins choosing the song.)

1604
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:21,160
(It's a rare sight
to see the members...)

1605
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,110
(be so serious and sentimental
on Running Man.)

1606
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:31,470
(Every word that they write down,)

1607
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:38,240
(they remember
bits of their memories.)

1608
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,680
I feel sad
as I'm thinking about what to write.

1609
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,860
It's starting to hit me
now that I'm writing this.

1610
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,490
Me too. This is...

1611
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,030
A little bit.

1612
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,140
(What does Kwang Soo want to say
to the members as he leaves?)

1613
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,760
When we read our messages,
the music...

1614
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,380
Okay.

1615
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,740
Do you want to start
with the older members first?

1616
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,740
I should draw a nice picture
of Kwang Soo.

1617
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,320
- We'll start with Suk Jin.
- Me?

1618
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,840
- Suk Jin is starting.
- Seok Sam...

1619
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,090
- I wrote it calmly. I just...
- Okay.

1620
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,360
- You can start.
- Should I start?

1621
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,220
Don't cry.

1622
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,090
- Don't cry.
- I don't even know.

1623
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,510
(He tries to hold back his tears,
but his eyes well up.)

1624
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,140
I don't even know.

1625
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,180
(He tries to hold back his tears,
but his eyes well up.)

1626
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,380
Whose is it?

1627
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,070
- I'll read it.
- It's Suk Jin's.

1628
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,740
Don't cry.

1629
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:43,950
This one is from Suk Jin.

1630
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:47,450
"It has already been 11 years
since I first met you."

1631
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:51,360
"You were just Long Legs
Lee Kwang Soo whom I met at work,"

1632
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,590
"but now you're my little brother
whom I'll be with forever."

1633
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,090
"Kwang Soo."

1634
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,820
"I was happy when I shouted..."

1635
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,320
"'Feeling! Intuition! Cross!'
with you."

1636
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,070
"I was happy when I shouted..."

1637
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:05,410
(He skipped the development and went
straight to saying he's happy.)

1638
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,200
(The touching moment was broken
into pieces.)

1639
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,740
- He ruined the moment so suddenly.
- So suddenly.

1640
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:13,140
- My gosh.
- Gosh, Suk Jin is...

1641
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:17,950
"'Feeling! Intuition! Cross!'
might've been nothing to others,"

1642
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:22,050
"but I was sincerely grateful
for each moment of it."

1643
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:24,760
"Kwang Soo, you are kind and cool.
One day..."

1644
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:28,390
Easy, or Lee Ji,
like Lee Kwang Soo and Ji Suk Jin.

1645
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:30,630
You guys are incredible.

1646
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:35,240
(The Lee Ji Brothers were famous
for being weaklings,)

1647
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:40,260
(but whenever they were together,
they were quite reliable.)

1648
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,740
(They have good feelings
and good intuition.)

1649
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,840
"Kwang Soo,
let's see each other forever."

1650
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,380
"Let's be friends forever.
Even if you're not on Running Man,"

1651
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,780
we're family.
I love you, Kwang Soo."

1652
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,680
That's what he wrote.

1653
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,490
Why did your handwriting
get so big as it progressed?

1654
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:56,990
- Right.
- Well...

1655
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,360
I experienced my tears
drying up again.

1656
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:02,090
(As it went beyond five lines,
he began to scribble it down.)

1657
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:04,470
- This time it's my turn.
- Okay.

1658
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,300
(They continue
with Jae Suk's message.)

1659
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,760
"To my beloved brother Kwang Soo."

1660
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:12,470
"It has already been 11 years
since we started Running Man."

1661
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,410
"It's hard to put into words
how much effort you put in."

1662
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,030
"You did so well."

1663
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,950
"I don't know who to interrupt..."

1664
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,910
"and who to ask
for piggyback rides anymore,"

1665
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:26,990
"but I think it will end up
being Se Chan or Suk Jin."

1666
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:32,260
(Me?)

1667
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,680
He's telling him not to be worried.

1668
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,860
My tears are drying up.

1669
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,760
I'm going to suffer more
because of you.

1670
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,260
My tears don't go beyond this point.

1671
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,760
(He only thinks
about joking around.)

1672
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,510
- Don't worry.
- He's saying he has alternatives.

1673
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:47,880
Right. I have alternatives.
It could be Se Chan or Suk Jin.

1674
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,700
"It will feel empty and be hard
without you around,"

1675
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,640
"but don't worry about us."

1676
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,410
"Do everything
that you've wanted to do."

1677
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:58,840
"Let's see each other often."

1678
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,990
"Call me if you ever need anything.
Thank you, Kwang Soo."

1679
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,860
"It wasn't boring because of you."

1680
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,930
Gosh, I...

1681
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,490
"It wasn't boring because of you."

1682
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,800
Whenever we had a shoot,

1683
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,110
Kwang Soo kept me
from feeling bored.

1684
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,740
Se Chan and Suk Jin
should play that role from now on.

1685
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,320
- We will work hard.
- You aren't transferring duties.

1686
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:29,950
- Kwang Soo.
- Look at him.

1687
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:31,550
You are giving him no chance to cry.

1688
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,390
Since Suk Jin has a bad back,
I will give you piggyback rides.

1689
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,160
- Give me piggyback rides.
- I will strengthen my legs.

1690
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,910
Jong Kook can do it too.

1691
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,050
Kwang Soo really kept us
from getting bored.

1692
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:41,360
Let's read Jong Kook's letter.

1693
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,390
(Jong Kook's letter)

1694
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,300
- Is it mine?
- Read Jong Kook's letter.

1695
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,840
"I don't know why it was so fun."

1696
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:05,450
"We used to laugh
every time our eyes met."

1697
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,490
"I thought
we would stay this way..."

1698
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,360
"Stay this way forever."

1699
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:23,860
"And I thought..."

1700
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:28,700
"you would be there until the end,"

1701
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,510
"which is why I think
I feel even sadder."

1702
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:36,680
"We won't be together
on Running Man anymore,"

1703
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,950
"but let's be together
for the rest of our lives."

1704
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,930
"Be healthy always, you punk."

1705
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,570
- This is a song for you.
- Here you go.

1706
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:02,840
- Seriously.
- Take the drawing too.

1707
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,610
- My goodness.
- He drew Kwang Soo nicely.

1708
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,880
Thank you.

1709
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,780
(Jong Kook shyly hands over
a sketch of Kwang Soo that he drew.)

1710
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,280
- Seriously.
- Take the drawing too.

1711
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,740
(I love you!)

1712
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,280
- He drew Kwang Soo so nicely.
- Thank you.

1713
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:17,550
How many talents does he have?

1714
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:18,890
About three.

1715
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:21,950
Singing, variety shows, and drawing.

1716
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,130
- I see.
- Yes.

1717
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,490
If we include exercising,
that makes four.

1718
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,260
"To my younger brother, Kwang Soo.
To my lovely Kwang Soo."

1719
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,930
"Hello, Kwang Soo. It's me, Haha."

1720
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:37,010
"Since I saw you every week
for the past 11 years,"

1721
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,280
"I feel like I will see you
next week..."

1722
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,640
"as well."

1723
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,320
"It's because you did your best..."

1724
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:54,220
"and showed
an incredible amount of effort..."

1725
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,720
"that so many viewers are upset..."

1726
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:03,840
"and as sad as we are."

1727
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,800
"You worked hard."

1728
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,070
"Kwang Soo, who will I tease now?"

1729
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:10,930
"Who will I con now?"

1730
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,740
"With whom
will I stay up all night talking?"

1731
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,280
"I love you."

1732
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:21,050
"I will pray
that you stay dazzling and cool..."

1733
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,590
"and realize your dreams
no matter where you are."

1734
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,280
"I love you, Kwang Soo!"

1735
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,260
"Stay healthy and happy."

1736
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,390
"This is a passionate goodbye.
From Haha."

1737
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:42,410
- Toy's song.
- "Passionate Goodbye."

1738
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,800
- "Passionate Goodbye."
- "Passionate Goodbye" is nice.

1739
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,880
- All right.
- "Passionate Goodbye" is nice.

1740
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,410
"Passionate Goodbye."

1741
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,840
"Passionate Goodbye."

1742
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,450
- "Passionate Goodbye" is nice.
- All right.

1743
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:51,820
"Passionate Goodbye" is nice.

1744
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,680
(This is a passionate goodbye.
From Haha.)

1745
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,260
- It's a very nice song.
- It's really nice.

1746
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,260
- I think it's perfect.
- It's really nice.

1747
01:02:58,530 --> 01:02:59,680
It's a cheerful goodbye.

1748
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:02,660
Yoo Hui Yeol has only one talent.

1749
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,300
(Kwang Soo, it's a happy, cheerful,
and passionate goodbye!)

1750
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,130
Only one talent.

1751
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:13,530
(As friends and colleagues,
they stayed by Kwang Soo's side.)

1752
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:16,140
(Suk Jin, Jae Suk,)

1753
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,680
(Jong Kook, and Haha)

1754
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,720
(In his mid-20s, Kwang Soo was
the immature youngest member.)

1755
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,490
(He truly liked and cherished
Kwang Soo.)

1756
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,360
- What? What is it?
- It's like a party.

1757
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,490
(The man who's the best
at teasing Kwang Soo, Jae Suk)

1758
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:41,660
(Despite being scared of him,)

1759
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:44,930
(Kwang Soo turned to him first
in times of need.)

1760
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:50,410
(Kwang Soo's moral support,
Jong Kook)

1761
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:56,950
(Kwang Soo's forever ally, Suk Jin)

1762
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:01,760
(Kwang Soo's forever older brother,
Haha)

1763
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:07,130
(They are precious men
who filled Kwang Soo's 11 years...)

1764
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:10,030
(with happiness.)

1765
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:18,070
(And as Kwang Soo once was
to the older members,)

1766
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:25,180
(younger brother Se Chan
became Kwang Soo's happiness.)

1767
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:26,470
Se Chan.

1768
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,470
Se Chan, come on.

1769
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,890
(The youngest members
burst out in tears.)

1770
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:39,860
(Kwang Soo was Se Chan
and So Min's biggest support.)

1771
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,090
Don't cry.

1772
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:42,660
Why are you crying?

1773
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:46,590
(Their hearts are full of sadness,)

1774
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:51,430
(but they will say
a passionate goodbye.)

1775
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,050
All right.

1776
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,610
- My goodness.
- That was nice.

1777
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:01,880
The next ones are...

1778
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:03,970
Se Chan, So Min, and Ji Hyo.

1779
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:06,450
(It's Ji Hyo
and the youngest members' turn.)

1780
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,450
"During the mean,
happy, exhausting,"

1781
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:12,390
"stressful, touching moments..."

1782
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:16,430
"and when we went
to unfamiliar places, and saw..."

1783
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:19,720
What is this letter?

1784
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,640
(What is this letter?)

1785
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,610
"And saw fascinating things."

1786
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,070
"And saw fascinating things."

1787
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:30,010
"And saw fascinating things,"

1788
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,740
"thank you..."

1789
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,740
- "Thank you..."
- Seriously.

1790
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,010
"Thank you for staying with me
through thick and thin..."

1791
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,220
(Ji Hyo's hand-written letter
is harder to crack than a code.)

1792
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:43,010
"for the past 11 years."

1793
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,890
"Thank you. You worked hard."

1794
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,630
"Kwang Soo,
you are my younger brother."

1795
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:49,160
"I love you, Kwang Soo."

1796
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,260
That's simple.

1797
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,390
- That suits Ji Hyo.
- Is that all?

1798
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,760
- That's simple.
- That's all.

1799
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,070
- Is that all?
- That's healthy.

1800
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,660
"Kwang Soo,
you are my younger brother."

1801
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,700
(Ji Hyo stayed the most composed.)

1802
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:02,530
(Two hours later,)

1803
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:06,880
(she stayed behind
after the shoot...)

1804
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,970
(to write the words...)

1805
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:09,820
"Kwang Soo, it's me."

1806
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:12,510
(that she was too shy to deliver
in another letter.)

1807
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,640
"Like I said earlier,"

1808
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,910
"it still doesn't feel real to me."

1809
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:20,360
"I think deep sadness will hit me
and make me crumble..."

1810
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:24,550
"when it hits me
that you are no longer here."

1811
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,990
"Visit whenever you miss us."

1812
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,970
"I love you, Kwang Soo."

1813
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,740
- So Min's letter.
- So Min's letter.

1814
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,410
(So Min's letter)

1815
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,570
"Kwang Soo."

1816
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:41,070
"I am really thankful
that I got to know you..."

1817
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,680
"during the time
that is either short or long."

1818
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:47,990
"I am really thankful
for the unforgettable memories."

1819
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,930
"I will pray for you
each step of the way,"

1820
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:55,860
"and I will keep the show going."

1821
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,390
"Visit Running Man anytime.
We will be waiting."

1822
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:05,200
All right.

1823
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:07,140
Okay.

1824
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,800
Yangsebari.

1825
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,180
(Se Chan's letter comes next.)

1826
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,840
"Kwang Soo, you worked hard
for the past 11 years."

1827
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:22,590
"I was happy to spend four years
with you."

1828
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:29,490
"We used to call each other
after every shoot..."

1829
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:56,510
"and have long conversations.
I guess that won't happen now."

1830
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,820
"I will miss you a lot."

1831
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,950
"I will always miss you,
think of you, and feel empty."

1832
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:08,160
"Now, do everything you want to do
in the world without penalties."

1833
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,740
- That's right.
- The world without penalties.

1834
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,610
- He is right.
- He is good.

1835
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:19,280
- It is the world without penalties.
- He is good.

1836
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,050
Se Chan doesn't disappoint.

1837
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,410
Which song did they request?

1838
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:26,510
(The song Ji Hyo, So Min,
and Se Chan requested is...)

1839
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,640
It's "Goodbye."

1840
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:29,860
- "Goodbye?"
- It's a song by Jung Jae Wook.

1841
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:34,280
- Goodbye, my precious one
- Goodbye, my precious one

1842
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:37,020
- Thank you
- Thank you

1843
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,100
Jung Jae Wook.

1844
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,230
- I love this song.
- It's a good song.

1845
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,840
(Kwang Soo, goodbye.)

1846
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:53,310
(Don't be sorry)

1847
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:54,480
Spit it out.

1848
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,310
- You told me to eat it!
- You punk!

1849
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,090
I told you to unwrap it, not eat it.

1850
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:06,150
(They fought without feeling sorry
for the past 11 years.)

1851
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:10,730
(Since she was
so close and precious to him,)

1852
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:17,400
(Kwang Soo wanted
to fall into her arms first.)

1853
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:21,980
You have a long torso.

1854
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:25,880
(From the moment
they visited the show as guests,)

1855
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:30,310
(So Min and Se Chan bonded
with Kwang Soo.)

1856
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,650
- Really?
- Young blood!

1857
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:36,610
(They formed
the young members' clique.)

1858
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:44,150
(They were happy
when they were together.)

1859
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,730
We did it!

1860
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:50,440
(I was happy)

1861
01:09:54,730 --> 01:10:00,270
(The younger members are special
to Kwang Soo...)

1862
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:04,680
(and he will never forget them.)

1863
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:20,270
(Goodbye, my precious one.)

1864
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,600
Now...

1865
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,970
- Kwang Soo's letter remains.
- Kwang Soo's letter.

1866
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,270
All right.

1867
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:32,550
(Kwang Soo will deliver...)

1868
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:36,650
(his last story.)

1869
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:48,630
"Members,"

1870
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:52,630
"you helped me become
the person I am today..."

1871
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,600
"and gave me another family."

1872
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:06,650
"Thank you so much."

1873
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:14,740
"I am sorry."

1874
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,350
"Again, I am sorry."

1875
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,400
"Again, I am sorry."

1876
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:46,810
"I didn't do well
over the past 11 years,"

1877
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,650
"but I think I did my best."

1878
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:00,430
"Every week, the Running Man members
do their absolute best."

1879
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:10,600
"Please continue to give the show
a lot of love and attention."

1880
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,440
"Thank you."

1881
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:15,910
(I didn't do well
over the past 11 years,)

1882
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,480
(but I think I did my best.)

1883
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,720
(Every week, the Running Man members
do their absolute best.)

1884
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,060
(Please continue to give the show
a lot of love and attention.)

1885
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:25,890
(Kwang Soo left an empty spot
in Running Man...)

1886
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:27,930
He always sits there.

1887
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:29,560
(and Running Man left an empty spot
in Kwang Soo.)

1888
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,600
- That means he is confident.
- Yes.

1889
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,020
(We hope
pretty flowers will grow...)

1890
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,660
- Come on.
- How pretty!

1891
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,230
(in those empty spots.)

1892
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,400
Seriously.

1893
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,140
Will we listen to a song
Kwang Soo requested?

1894
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,100
Which song
would you like to listen to?

1895
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,570
I was going to pick "Goodbye Now."

1896
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:44,640
- Which song?
- I was going to pick "Goodbye Now."

1897
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,550
- "Goodbye Now."
- Yes.

1898
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:48,600
We listened to the song many times.

1899
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,440
(The song Kwang Soo requested
will be played soon.)

1900
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:53,940
It's played the most often.

1901
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:56,850
The album that contains
the day with Kwang Soo is here.

1902
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:57,910
- Did it arrive?
- Really?

1903
01:12:57,910 --> 01:13:00,480
- Already?
- Before I hand over the album,

1904
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,560
I will announce a few results.

1905
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:04,130
- That's right.
- That's right.

1906
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,300
That's right.

1907
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:08,600
Today, the seven members
except for Kwang Soo...

1908
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,400
had the hidden mission
of getting photos taken with him.

1909
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,970
(Get as many photos taken
with Kwang Soo as possible.)

1910
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:16,600
The first place with the most number
of photos with Kwang Soo...

1911
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,440
will acquire the same presents
as Kwang Soo.

1912
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:21,010
The last place will receive
the penalty.

1913
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,070
I don't think I am in last place.

1914
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:23,650
- I will announce the results.
- Okay.

1915
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:28,910
(They had a fierce competition
to stand next to Kwang Soo.)

1916
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:33,430
(They made memories
as they got the photos taken.)

1917
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:36,490
(Who will place 1st
and receive the present?)

1918
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,560
Jae Suk,

1919
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,730
27 photos.

1920
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:41,320
27 photos?

1921
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,840
Suk Jin,

1922
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,800
27 photos.

1923
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,860
What?

1924
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,810
(Suk Jin and Jae Suk, 27 photos)

1925
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:51,070
Jong Kook, 27 photos.
Haha, 27 photos.

1926
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:53,510
Ji Hyo, 27 photos.
So Min, 27 photos.

1927
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:55,570
- No way.
- Se Chan, 27 photos.

1928
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:58,070
Everyone was
in the same number of photos.

1929
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:59,650
- What?
- What is going on?

1930
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,590
(The hidden mission
was competitive.)

1931
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:04,190
(How did they get the same result?)

1932
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,760
Since everyone won,

1933
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,990
Kwang Soo succeeded
in his last hidden mission.

1934
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:11,650
(Kwang Soo's last hidden mission
is a success.)

1935
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:13,970
- Did you have a hidden mission?
- I see.

1936
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:15,900
- Kwang Soo succeeded?
- Did you have a hidden mission?

1937
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,990
(Did Kwang Soo have
a hidden mission?)

1938
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:18,690
Kwang Soo had a hidden mission.

1939
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:20,840
Today, Kwang Soo carried out...

1940
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,100
a hidden mission
behind the members' backs.

1941
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,180
What was it?

1942
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,770
The seven presents that were shown,

1943
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,650
a premium champagne,
a brand-name hoodie,

1944
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:31,410
a decorative picture frame,
a sound bar,

1945
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:33,240
a bedding set,
and the others are ready.

1946
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:36,410
Last week and the week before that,

1947
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:38,850
Kwang Soo actually bought these
for the members.

1948
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:39,950
- What?
- Really?

1949
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:44,100
(Kwang Soo bought the presents
over the past 2 weeks.)

1950
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,490
Why did you buy such nice items?

1951
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:48,970
I didn't know he would reveal it.

1952
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:50,860
(They were his presents
for the members.)

1953
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,440
Kwang Soo had to complete
his hidden mission...

1954
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,340
to deliver the presents on the show.

1955
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:56,400
(It's the last surprise
Kwang Soo prepared.)

1956
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,200
Are they really for us?

1957
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:00,100
In any case...

1958
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,310
(10 days before the shoot)

1959
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,940
I want to give presents
to the members.

1960
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:08,810
I won't do that on the show, but...

1961
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:12,150
Are you preparing presents?

1962
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:14,760
I don't know
if I will be able to deliver them.

1963
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,760
- They get a bit...
- They think it's cringe-worthy.

1964
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,630
They don't even like receiving
birthday presents.

1965
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,300
They get embarrassed.

1966
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:27,700
The presents are for the members...

1967
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:31,340
as well as myself.

1968
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,810
- My heart will be lighter.
- If you give the presents?

1969
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:36,020
That's right.

1970
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,270
(For Kwang Soo,
who feels sorry to the members)

1971
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,050
- You prepared presents.
- Yes.

1972
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:44,690
We received the presents
from your manager.

1973
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:47,090
We plan to use them
for the race today.

1974
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:49,950
The members think
those presents are for you,

1975
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,560
but it's actually your chance...

1976
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,690
to deliver them to the members.

1977
01:15:55,970 --> 01:16:00,060
You must pick a boiled egg
to give each member a present.

1978
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:05,310
(Kwang Soo picked the eggs carefully
for the members.)

1979
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:09,150
It will be hard to pick a boiled egg
seven times in a row,

1980
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:12,310
so you will have
a special hidden rule.

1981
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:14,020
The members think
that the person who has...

1982
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,780
the most number of photos
with you...

1983
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,280
receives the same presents,

1984
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:21,150
while the person in last place
gets a penalty.

1985
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:25,450
If you help all of them
tie for first place,

1986
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,800
they will receive the presents...

1987
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,190
and be exempt from the penalty.

1988
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:36,770
So they need to be
in the same number of photos.

1989
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:37,840
That's right.

1990
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,100
(Make sure everyone is
in the same number of photos.)

1991
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,610
The real-time rankings
will be shown to you secretly...

1992
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:45,310
through the dice
in front of the production crew.

1993
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:48,740
It will be in the order of age
starting from the left.

1994
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:53,350
Each die's number shows
the member's ranking.

1995
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,130
The moment you enter
the last venue, the LP bar,

1996
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:57,630
the hidden mission will end.

1997
01:16:58,260 --> 01:16:59,490
What?

1998
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:04,470
(Thus started
Kwang Soo's game of wits.)

1999
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:06,160
Let me see the rankings.

2000
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,700
(He checked with the producer
from time to time.)

2001
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,010
Is Se Chan in last place?

2002
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:13,150
(Kwang Soo learned
that Se Chan is in last place...)

2003
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:16,770
(and stayed close to Se Chan.)

2004
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:21,480
(He followed Se Chan around.)

2005
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:23,280
That's a lot.

2006
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,760
(When he pulled Se Chan up
in the rankings,)

2007
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:29,730
(he saw that Jae Suk was
in last place.)

2008
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:31,630
Come on.

2009
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:36,440
(Kwang Soo was busy all day long.)

2010
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,640
The last place.

2011
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,510
Ji Hyo is in last place.

2012
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:41,860
(Then he targeted Se Chan,
Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo.)

2013
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,650
(While everyone looked
at the scenery,)

2014
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:51,810
(Kwang Soo looked at the members.)

2015
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:55,760
(Even the moments
that seemed like coincidence...)

2016
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,450
(contained Kwang Soo's love.)

2017
01:17:58,450 --> 01:17:59,930
Hyung Gu, what are the rankings?

2018
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:01,820
Really?

2019
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,770
(Kwang Soo's busy day...)

2020
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:08,020
(had a happy ending.)

2021
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:10,490
He completed the mission.

2022
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:11,800
That's how we got the same number.

2023
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,560
Since all of you are first place,
you can take your present.

2024
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,700
I can't believe
they are from Kwang Soo.

2025
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,980
Why did you buy
such expensive presents?

2026
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,650
Did you control the numbers?

2027
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:21,810
(The last presents from Kwang Soo,)

2028
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:22,910
You knew about it.

2029
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:24,110
(the man who wanted to give,
not receive)

2030
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:28,240
Thanks to Kwang Soo,
everyone is exempt from the penalty.

2031
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:31,520
I will reveal the presents
Kwang Soo prepared.

2032
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,450
- We didn't prepare any presents.
- I know.

2033
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:37,260
We didn't prepare any presents.

2034
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,490
What?

2035
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,100
- What is that?
- It's a present.

2036
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:46,060
- There is a present for everyone.
- There is a present for everyone.

2037
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,440
There are names.

2038
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,380
Kwang Soo bought a present
that suits each member.

2039
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:51,530
Really?

2040
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:53,270
This is for Haha.

2041
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,570
Suk Jin.

2042
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:57,480
- What?
- It's yours.

2043
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,720
Is that Suk Jin's?

2044
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,480
- I didn't prepare anything.
- It's Suk Jin's.

2045
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:03,780
What is this?

2046
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:05,730
Why did you get
such an expensive present?

2047
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:07,450
(Jae Suk often wears hoodies.)

2048
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,150
Why is mine small?

2049
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,490
You will like it.

2050
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,470
What's So Min's present?
Oh, the champagne.

2051
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,030
- I love it.
- Right. That's what she likes.

2052
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:18,440
- Gosh, this is...
- What's this, So Min?

2053
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:19,840
The bedding set is for Ji Hyo.

2054
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,140
That's because she sleeps a lot.

2055
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:23,730
What's for me?

2056
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:25,740
Why does it always
have to be so big for me?

2057
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:26,740
It's a sound bar.

2058
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:30,150
- It's a sound bar.
- I don't even know what it is.

2059
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:33,050
- It's like a TV speaker.
- Really?

2060
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:35,190
- So you can watch Netflix.
- I've never had this before.

2061
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:36,910
This is really nice.

2062
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:39,060
Why are you giving this to me?

2063
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,320
Se Chan, this is a picture frame.

2064
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,020
Gosh, what do I do?

2065
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,260
We once went to buy
a painting together.

2066
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,160
- He didn't buy it that day.
- I can't believe this.

2067
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:50,730
I guess Jong Kook will have to move.

2068
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:53,100
- This is really nice.
- It's so good.

2069
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,360
In the living room...

2070
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,340
I felt a little shy
about giving this to you,

2071
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:00,200
so I met Bo Pil
and talked about this.

2072
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,910
Gosh, this is really...

2073
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:05,480
- It's a commemorative plaque.
- It says Lee Kwang Soo.

2074
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:07,020
- What's that?
- It's pure gold.

2075
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,020
(It's a golden name tag,
the symbol of Running Man.)

2076
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,560
It's a name tag.

2077
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,760
I really want one.

2078
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,280
"You can stop running and walk now."

2079
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,020
"Our special brother, Lee Kwang Soo.
From the Running Man crew."

2080
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,130
- That's really cool.
- It's gold.

2081
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:19,230
- It's pure gold.
- Thank you.

2082
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,100
- That's very rare.
- Sure.

2083
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,320
And here's our second gift.

2084
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:26,700
All the 112 crew members
wrote messages to him.

2085
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,030
- Really?
- It's like a Rolling Paper.

2086
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:30,810
- My gosh.
- This will make you cry.

2087
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:31,900
(The 112 crew members
left him messages.)

2088
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,850
There's one from Kang Chan Hee.

2089
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:36,180
- Thank you.
- It looks very sincere.

2090
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,270
- He wrote with his sincere heart.
- I can see that.

2091
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:42,110
- Gosh, Kwang Soo.
- There's even a drawing.

2092
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:44,610
- This is a great gift.
- It's really nice.

2093
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:46,650
- This is the best gift.
- Thank you so much.

2094
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:47,780
There are so many things.

2095
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:50,450
This is our third gift, a speaker.

2096
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:52,020
(They got Kwang Soo a speaker
as he was thinking of getting one.)

2097
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,900
- He loves music.
- Thank you.

2098
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,990
- Is this product placement?
- I bet it is.

2099
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:57,970
- He will use it every day.
- This is really...

2100
01:20:57,970 --> 01:20:59,440
- He'll use it with his girlfriend.
- Enjoy it with your girlfriend.

2101
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,030
It's perfect for a date.

2102
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:02,030
There's a photo album.

2103
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:03,730
- The next gift is...
- There's a photo album.

2104
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:06,180
It's amazing that
we got it done so soon.

2105
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,270
These are the photos we took today.

2106
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:09,610
- They are from today.
- This is really good.

2107
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:12,350
Gosh, when did you take this photo?

2108
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:14,220
- Did they take photos?
- When did you take this?

2109
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:16,980
I saw him make a V with his fingers.

2110
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:18,720
- Kwang Soo did?
- We did.

2111
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,950
- We did.
- What a great world.

2112
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:23,260
- We get it right away.
- Can we get the files as well?

2113
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,760
- I bet we can get the files.
- Yes. We will give you the files.

2114
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:26,730
I want the files as well.

2115
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:29,440
He always talks about coffee trucks,
so we got him a coupon.

2116
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,440
- A free pass to Running Man?
- Good.

2117
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,900
You can come anytime
without making a call.

2118
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,640
- Thank you.
- All right.

2119
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,380
This is really precious.

2120
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,740
Lastly, tell us how you feel.

2121
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:44,240
All right, Kwang Soo.
Say something to our viewers.

2122
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,550
(Kwang Soo's last song request,
"Goodbye Now")

2123
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:48,190
- Say goodbye.
- Okay.

2124
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,590
All right.

2125
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,150
Thank you...

2126
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:59,800
for everything.

2127
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,850
I was happy.

2128
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:31,190
(Kwang Soo joined Running Man as
the youngest member 11 years ago.)

2129
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:38,190
(He loved laughter
more than anyone.)

2130
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:45,730
(He was more serious
about Running Man than anyone.)

2131
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:47,240
- Film this.
- This isn't about me.

2132
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:51,380
(Behind the glittering glamour
of Running Man...)

2133
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,950
(he always shouted his head off
to cheer for his members...)

2134
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:01,590
(and shared joy with them.)

2135
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:08,600
(He was always
very considerate and thoughtful.)

2136
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:13,470
(To some people, Kwang Soo
is their childhood memory...)

2137
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:17,840
(and the pillar of hope
that got them through hard times.)

2138
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:22,200
(Now he says goodbye to you.)

2139
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:25,020
Thank you for everything. Thank you.

2140
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:26,110
All right.

2141
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,940
Well done, Kwang Soo.

2142
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,950
- You've worked so hard, Kwang Soo.
- Good job.

2143
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:31,760
You've done a great job
for 11 years.

2144
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,390
We will see you again.

2145
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:34,780
Like we said before,

2146
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,230
this is...

2147
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,990
our last episode with Kwang Soo.

2148
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:42,630
I don't know
how to express our feelings.

2149
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:46,530
I believe our viewers
would feel the same way.

2150
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:49,030
But the thing is,

2151
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:53,100
life doesn't always go
as we planned.

2152
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,550
Even after Kwang Soo leaves,

2153
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:57,850
like we said before,

2154
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:00,850
- we will keep working hard...
- Sure. We'll try our best.

2155
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:03,150
to make our viewers happy.

2156
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:05,650
I'd like to thank Kwang Soo again...

2157
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:08,150
for the time he's spent with us.

2158
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:10,930
Thanks to him,
we were really merry and happy.

2159
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:14,320
Kwang Soo won't be there,
but please keep watching our show.

2160
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,800
I'll buy this there.

2161
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:17,530
All right.

2162
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,810
- Do you have the receipt for this?
- Yes.

2163
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,470
- I want one.
- Can you give me one?

2164
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:22,730
No?

2165
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,240
1, 2, 3.

2166
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,700
This is the last photo.

2167
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,240
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2168
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:31,810
Well done.

2169
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:33,940
- Thank you, Kwang Soo.
- You punk.

2170
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:35,550
Look at you.

2171
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:37,810
- Kwang Soo.
- Thank you so much.

2172
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,390
- Oh, gosh.
- Good work today.

2173
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:41,020
Thank you.

2174
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:44,730
You were very lucky
on your last day here.

2175
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:45,990
It was amazing.

2176
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:47,600
Kwang Soo, clap your hands once.

2177
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,100
- Okay.
- It's the last time.

2178
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,160
All right. That's your last slate
on Running Man.

2179
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,640
- Stop saying that.
- Here I go.

2180
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,640
- 1, 2...
- Are you coming back next week?

2181
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:56,700
I hope so.

2182
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:59,180
- He can do one more week.
- Like a prank.

2183
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,180
1, 2, 3. Thank you.

2184
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2185
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:06,440
(Just like that, Kwang Soo
stops running after 3,991 days.)

2186
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2187
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,910
Our oldest member, Suk Jin.

2188
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:15,150
Jae Suk, who helped me...

2189
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:16,950
come this far.

2190
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:20,490
My moral support, Jong Kook.

2191
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:23,690
Haha, who is always like
my family and friend.

2192
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:27,200
Ji Hyo who's like my real sister.

2193
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,510
So Min and Se Chan...

2194
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:33,010
who are like my sister and brother.

2195
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:37,570
With my gratitude to all of them,
I'll try my best...

2196
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:40,850
for the rest of my life.

2197
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,520
I love you.

2198
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:49,630
(Our special brother, Lee Kwang Soo,
thank you for the past 11 years.)

2199
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:51,430
(The 1st get-together
of the Board Game Club)

2200
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,060
- Let's meet in person.
- Who is Pink Princess?

2201
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,430
They want to beat me.

2202
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,470
(All the weird members
are getting together.)

2203
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,340
Strong guys use nicknames like this.

2204
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,640
(They try to look strong...)

2205
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,060
(with their nicknames.)

2206
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:04,070
(The 7 members
enjoy the get-together...)

2207
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,350
(with every fiber of their bodies.)

2208
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,380
(Then they find a box.)

2209
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:08,770
Do we teleport by jumping?

2210
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,180
(The members get into a board game.)

2211
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,280
(I'm the protagonist of the game.)

2212
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:16,450
(They ally with each other...)

2213
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:18,090
(and betray each other to win.)

2214
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,280
(Who will be the strongest player?)

2215
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,430
(The 1st Game Lover Get-together)
